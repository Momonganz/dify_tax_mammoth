FATCA INTERGOVERNMENTAL AGREEMENT UPDATE - ADDITIONAL TERMS EFFECTIVE FROM 3 JULY 2014 This document was added to http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz on 23 March 2015. It will appear in the April 2015 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin (Volume 27, Number 3). Notice pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of New Zealand to Improve International Tax Compliance and Implement FATCA (the Agreement) New Zealand has, pursuant to Article 7 of the Agreement, received notification from the United States Government that it has granted more favourable terms to a Partner Jurisdiction. Article 7 provides that more favourable terms apply automatically to the Agreement unless a decision is made to decline them. New Zealand has not declined the application of the terms. The following paragraphs are therefore to be treated as being included in Section VI of Annex I of the Agreement beginning on 3 July 2014. With reference to paragraph G, no written notice was provided to the United States before 3 July 2014. G. Alternative Procedures for New Accounts Opened Prior to Entry Into Force of this Agreement. 1. Applicability. If New Zealand has provided a written notice to the United States prior to entry into force of this Agreement that, as of July 1, 2014, New Zealand lacked the legal authority to require Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions either: (i) to require Account Holders of New Individual Accounts to provide the self-certification specified in section III of this Annex I, or (ii) to perform all the due diligence procedures related to New Entity Accounts specified in section V of this Annex I, then Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions may apply the alternative procedures described in subparagraph G(2) of this section, as applicable, to such New Accounts, in lieu of the procedures otherwise required under this Annex I. The alternative procedures described in subparagraph G(2) of this section shall be available only for those New Individual Accounts or New Entity Accounts, as applicable, opened prior to the earlier of: (i) the date New Zealand has the ability to compel Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to comply with the due diligence procedures described in section III or section V of this Annex I, as applicable, which date New Zealand shall inform the United States of in writing by the date of entry into force of this Agreement, or (ii) the date of entry into force of this Agreement. If the alternative procedures for New Entity Accounts opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, described in paragraph H of this section are applied with respect to all New Entity Accounts or a clearly identified group of such accounts, the alternative procedures described in this paragraph G may not be applied with respect to such New Entity Accounts. For all other New Accounts, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must apply the due diligence procedures described in section III or section V of this Annex I, as applicable, to determine if the account is a U.S. Reportable Account or an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution. 2. Alternative Procedures. a) Within one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must: (i) with respect to a New Individual Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section, request the self-certification specified in 1 section III of this Annex I and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification consistent with the procedures described in section III of this Annex I, and (ii) with respect to a New Entity Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section, perform the due diligence procedures specified in section V of this Annex I and request information as necessary to document the account, including any self-certification, required by section V of this Annex I. b) New Zealand must report on any New Account that is identified pursuant to subparagraph G(2)(a) of this section as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, by the date that is the later of: (i) September 30 next following the date that the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, or (ii) 90 days after the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable. The information required to be reported with respect to such a New Account is any information that would have been reportable under this Agreement if the New Account had been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, as of the date the account was opened. c) By the date that is one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must close any New Account described in subparagraph G(1) of this section for which it was unable to collect the required self- certification or other documentation pursuant to the procedures described in subparagraph G(2)(a) of this section. In addition, by the date that is one year after the date of entry into force of this Agreement, Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions must: (i) with respect to such closed accounts that prior to such closure were New Individual Accounts (without regard to whether such accounts were High Value Accounts), perform the due diligence procedures specified in paragraph D of section II of this Annex I, or (ii) with respect to such closed accounts that prior to such closure were New Entity Accounts, perform the due diligence procedures specified in section IV of this Annex I. d) New Zealand must report on any closed account that is identified pursuant to subparagraph G(2)(c) of this section as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, by the date that is the later of: (i) September 30 next following the date that the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, or (ii) 90 days after the account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable. The information required to be reported for such a closed account is any information that would have been reportable under this Agreement if the account had been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account or as an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, as applicable, as of the date the account was opened. H. Alternative Procedures for New Entity Accounts Opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015. For New Entity Accounts opened on or after July 1, 2014, and before January 1, 2015, either with respect to all New Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, New Zealand may permit Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to treat such accounts as Preexisting Entity Accounts and apply the due diligence procedures related to Preexisting Entity Accounts specified in section IV of this Annex I in lieu of the due diligence procedures specified in section V of this Annex I. In this case, the due diligence procedures of section IV of this Annex I must be applied without regard to the account balance or value threshold specified in paragraph A of section IV of this Annex I. 2
COMPETENT AUTHORITY ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPETENT AUTHORITIES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND NEW ZEALAND On June 12, 2014, the Government of the United States of America and the Government of New Zealand signed an intergovernmental agreement (“IGA”) entitled, “Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of New Zealand to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA.” The IGA requires, in particular, the, exchange of certain information with respect to U.S. and New Zealand Reportable Accounts on an automatic basis, pursuant to the provisions of Article 25 of the Convention between the United States of America and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, done at Wellington on July 23, 1982, as amended by a Protocol, done at Washington on December 1, 2008 (the “Convention”). Article 3(6) of the IGA provides that the Competent Authorities of the United States and New Zealand (the “Competent Authorities”) shall enter into an agreement or arrangement under the mutual agreement procedure provided for in Article 24 of the Convention, in order to establish and prescribe the rules and procedures necessary to implement certain provisions in the IGA. Article 24 of the Convention permits the Competent Authorities to also address other matters regarding implementation of the Convention. These matters may also be addressed herein as the IGA is entered into pursuant to the Convention. Consistent with the IGA and after consultations between the Competent Authorities, the Competent Authorities have reached the following arrangement (this "Arrangement”). Terms used both in this Arrangement and in the IGA have the same meaning as in the IGA, unless otherwise specified in this Arrangement. References to Paragraphs and Attachments pertain to Paragraphs of, and Attachments to, this Arrangement, unless otherwise specified. Except as otherwise provided in the IGA, any references to U.S. Treasury Regulations are to the relevant regulations in effect at the time of application. References to Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Publications include updated versions. All references to days comprising time periods for completion of actions refer to calendar days and not business days. However, if such period ends on a Saturday, Sunday or national statutory holiday, it would be treated as ending on the next calendar day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or national statutory holiday. Paragraph 1 OBJECT AND SCOPE 1.1 As provided in Article 3(6) of the IGA, this Arrangement establishes the procedures for the automatic exchange obligations described in Article 2 of the 1 IGA and for the exchange of information reported under Article 4(1)(b) of the IGA. Information to be exchanged pursuant to Articles 2 and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA includes information provided: 1.1.1 by a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, 1.1.2 by or on behalf of each of the following Non-Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions that would be treated as a deemed-compliant FFI under Annex II of the IGA for purposes of section 1471 oftheU.S. Internal Revenue Code (a "Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution”): - a Financial Institution with a Local Client Base, as described in Section lll(A) of Annex II of the IGA; - a Trustee-Documented Trust, as described in Section IV(A) of Annex II of the IGA; - a Sponsored Investment Entity, as described in Section IV(B)(1) of Annex II of the IGA; - a Sponsored Controlled Foreign Corporation, as described in Section IV(B)(2) of Annex II of the IGA; - a Sponsored, Closely Held Investment Vehicle, as described in Section IV(C) of Annex II of the IGA; or 1.1.3 by a Reporting U.S. Financial Institution. 1.2 A New Zealand Financial Institution that would otherwise qualify as a Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution, and thus as a Non-Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution under Article 1(1 )(q) of the IGA, but does not satisfy one or more applicable requirements in Annex II or the relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations is a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution under Article 1(1 )(o) of the IGA. 1.3 As provided in Article 3(6) of the IGA, this Arrangement prescribes rules and procedures as may be necessary to implement Article 5 of the IGA. 1.4 As permitted by Article 24 of the Convention, this Arrangement addresses other matters concerning implementation of the IGA, including: registration, confidentiality and data safeguards, costs, consultation and modification, and publication of this Arrangement. 2 Paragraph 2 REGISTRATION OF NEW ZEALAND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS 2.1 In General: The Competent Authorities note that, under Article 4(1)(c) and Annex II of the IGA, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution or Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution would be treated as compliant with, and not subject to withholding under, section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code if the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution or Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution (or, as applicable, its sponsor or trustee), among other requirements, complies with the applicable registration requirements on the FATCA registration website. The Competent Authorities also note the IRS intends to issue a unique Global Intermediary Identification Number (“GIIN”) to each Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution and Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution that successfully completes the FATCA registration requirements. 2.2 Inclusion of New Zealand Financial Institutions on IRS FFI List: The IRS intends to include on the “IRS FFI list” (as defined in section 1.1471-1 (b)(73) of the U.S. Treasury Regulations) the name and GIIN of each New Zealand Financial Institution issued a GIIN by the FATCA Registration System. Pursuant to Article 5(2)(b) of the IGA and Paragraph 4.3.2.2, however, a registered New Zealand Financial Institution would be removed from the IRS FFI list if an issue of significant non-compliance is not resolved within a period of eighteen (18) months. 2.3 Exchange of Registration Information: The U.S. Competent Authority intends to provide the New Zealand Competent Authority annually with the information necessary to identify each registered New Zealand Financial Institution included on the IRS FFI list. Paragraph 3 TIME AND MANNER OF EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 3.1 Automatic Exchange within Nine (9) Months: Consistent with Articles 3(5) and 3(6) of the IGA, the Competent Authorities intend to exchange automatically the information described in Articles 2 and 4(1)(b) of the IGA within nine (9) months after the end of the calendar year to which the information relates. 3.2 Format: 3.2.1 Information Described in Articles 2(2) and 4(1)(b) of the IGA: The FATCA XML Schema, as reflected in the FATCA XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5124), and the FATCA Metadata XML Schema, as reflected in 3 the FATCA Metadata XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5188), posted on IRS.gov are intended to be used as the format for the exchange of information described in Articles 2(2) and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA. The FATCA XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5124) and the FATCA Metadata XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5188) describe the structure of the schemata and include data dictionaries with summaries of the relevant data elements. 3.2.2 Notices: The U S. Competent Authority intends to use the schemata described in the FATCA XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5124), FATCA Metadata XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5188), and FATCA Reports ICMM Notification XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5216) posted on IRS.gov as the format for providing notices pursuant to this Arrangement. 3.2.3 Schema Changes: The IRS intends to post any changes to schemata applicable to a particular calendar year on http://www.irs.gov/FATCA as soon as possible. When feasible, IRS intends to provide notice of such changes prior to posting. The Competent Authorities anticipate a collaborative process concerning schemata changes. 3.3 Information Transmission: 3.3.1 Method: The Competent Authorities intend to use the International Data Exchange Service (“IDES”), as reflected in the FATCA IDES User Guide (IRS Publication 5190) and the FATCA Metadata XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5188) posted on IRS.gov, for all exchange of information, including notices described in Paragraph 4.3, pursuant to the IGA. 3.3.1.1 Use of Regional Router for Transmission: The New Zealand Competent Authority may elect to use a regional router (e.g. the European Union’s "Speed 2”) to transmit information to, and download information from, IDES where the U.S. Competent Authority has approved that regional router in writing for compliance with specified standards, including encryption and internet transmission protocols. This election should be made in writing and delivered to the U.S. Competent Authority prior to transmitting information via the regional router to IDES or downloading information from IDES via the regional router. 3.3.1.2 Use of IDES as a Data Collection Tool: The New Zealand Competent Authority may elect to use IDES as a Model 1 Option 2 ("Ml 02”) data collection tool for its information exchange pursuant to the IGA. The procedures and methodology for using IDES in this manner are described in greater detail in the FATCA IDES User Guide (IRS Publication 5190). The M102 election should be made 4 in writing and delivered to the U.S. Competent Authority prior to the uploading or downloading of information to or from IDES by a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution or by or on behalf of a Paragraph 1,1.2 Financial Institution. 3.3.1.3 Consistency: The Competent Authorities intend that an election described in Paragraph 3.3.1.1 or 3.3.1.2 would be applied consistently to all information uploaded or downloaded from the time of the election, unless such election is properly revoked consistent with Paragraph 3.3.1.4. 3.3.1.4 Revocation of Election: The New Zealand Competent Authority may revoke an election described in Paragraph 3.3.1.1 or 3.3.1.2 following consultation with, and written notice to, the U.S. Competent Authority. 3.3.2 When Information is Exchanged: Information described in Articles 2(2) and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA would be considered exchanged at the time of receipt specified in Paragraph 3.3.4. See Paragraph 5.2 concerning each Competent Authority’s responsibility for maintaining confidentiality and other protections with respect to exchanged information. 3.3.3 Feedback and Consultation: The Competent Authorities understand that feedback with regard to data quality and usability is an important element of the exchange process and they may consult with each other as provided in Paragraph 7.2 about data error or transmission problems inadequately addressed through standard notification processes over IDES. 3.3.4 Time of Receipt: Except as described below, information transmitted via IDES by the New Zealand Competent Authority would be considered provided to, and received by, the U.S. Competent Authority on the date the information is successfully uploaded onto IDES. Except as described below, information transmitted by the U.S. Competent Authority via IDES would be considered provided to, and received by, the New Zealand Competent Authority on the date the information is available for downloading from IDES. 3.3.4.1 Regional Router: If the New Zealand Competent Authority elects the use of a regional router for information transmission via IDES, information the regional router transmits would be considered provided to, and received by, the U.S. Competent Authority on the date it is successfully uploaded from the router to IDES, and information transmitted by the U.S. Competent Authority would be considered provided to, and received by, the New Zealand Competent Authority on the date it is available for downloading to the router from IDES. 5 3.3.4.2 M102 Data Collection Tool: If the New Zealand Competent Authority elects to use IDES as an M102 data collection tool, information would be considered provided to, and received by, the U.S. Competent Authority on the date the New Zealand Competent Authority approves and therefore releases the information on IDES to the U.S. Competent Authority, and information transmitted by the U.S. Competent Authority would be considered provided to, and received by, the New Zealand Competent Authority on the date it is available for downloading from IDES. See FATCA IDES User Guide (IRS Publication 5190). 3.4 Notification of File Processing Success or Failure: 3.4.1. Notification of File Processing Success: Within fifteen (15) days of successfully receiving a file containing the information described in Articles 2(2) and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA in the time and manner described in Article 3(5) of the IGA and in Paragraph 3, the Competent Authority receiving the file (the “receiving Competent Authority”) should provide notice of such successful receipt to the Competent Authority providing the file (the “providing Competent Authority"). The U.S. Competent Authority expects to generate such notification automatically through the International Compliance Management Model (“ICMM”) and transmit it via IDES. The notice need not express the receiving Competent Authority’s view about the adequacy of the information received or whether the receiving Competent Authority believes that the providing Competent Authority should take measures pursuant to Article 5 of the IGA to obtain corrected or complete information. 3.4.2. Notification of File Processing Failure: Within fifteen (15) days of receiving a file containing information that cannot be processed, the receiving Competent Authority should provide notice of such processing failure to the providing Competent Authority. The U.S. Competent Authority expects to generate such notification automatically through the ICMM and transmit it via IDES. 3.4.3 ICMM: A description of, and additional information regarding, ICMM, including the (i) FATCA Reports ICMM Notifications User Guide (IRS Publication 5189), and (ii) FATCA Reports ICMM Notification XML Schema User Guide (IRS Publication 5216), can be found on IRS.gov. 3.5 Transliteration: Any information the New Zealand Competent Authority exchanges that is reported in a non-Latin domestic alphabet or literation is expected be transliterated pursuant to New Zealand domestic procedures or rules aligned with international standards for transliteration (for example as specified in ISO 8859) into the Latin alphabet. The New Zealand Competent Authority may send designatory data (e.g., name or address) both in its domestic alphabet or literation and separately in the Latin alphabet within each account 6 record if it so chooses. The New Zealand Competent Authority should also be prepared to transliterate the information it receives from the U.S. Competent Authority from the Latin alphabet to any non-Latin domestic alphabet or literation it uses or accepts. Paragraph 4 REMEDIATION AND ENFORCEMENT 4.1 In General: The U.S. Competent Authority and the New Zealand Competent Authority should each seek to ensure that all of the information specified in Articles 2(2) and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA has been identified and reported to the U.S. Competent Authority and the New Zealand Competent Authority, as applicable, so that such information is available to be exchanged in the time and manner described in Article 3(5) of the IGA and in Paragraph 3. 4.2 Categories of Non-Compliance: Non-compliance with the IGA may be administrative or minor in nature, or may constitute significant non-compliance. 4.2.1 Significant Non-Compliance: Under Article 5(2) of the IGA, the receiving Competent Authority has the discretion to determine whether there is significant non-compliance with the obligations to obtain and exchange information described in Articles 2(2) and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA with respect to a Reporting Financial Institution in the other jurisdiction. The U.S. Competent Authority also has the discretion to determine significant non-compliance based on failure to satisfy due diligence, reporting, withholding and other obligations with respect to a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution. The receiving Competent Authority may determine that certain failures constitute significant non-compliance with respect to a Reporting Financial Institution regardless of whether the failure is attributable to the providing Competent Authority or the Reporting Financial Institution. Examples of significant non-compliance are set forth in Paragraphs 4.2.1.1 through 4.2.1.3. 4.2.1.1 Reporting Failures: The U.S. Competent Authority may find significant non-compliance based on a failure by a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution to report information on U.S. Reportable Accounts, as specified in Article 4(1 )(a) of the IGA, or on 2015 and 2016 payments to Nonparticipating Financial Institutions, as specified in Article 4(1)(b) of the IGA. 4.2.1.2 Failure to Timely Correct: Failure by a Reporting Financial Institution to correct administrative or other minor errors may, in the discretion of the receiving Competent Authority, 7 lead to a determination of significant non-compliance. The Competent Authorities expect, however, that in the ordinary course a determination of such significant non-compliance would not occur until at least 120 days after the notice specified in Paragraph 4.3.1 is provided to, and received by, the providing Competent Authority (per Paragraph 3,3.4). 4.2.1.3 Other Non-compliance Under the IGA: The U.S. Competent Authority may make a determination of significant non- compliance with respect to a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution to the extent it does not meet the conditions set forth in Article 4 of the IGA, including by failing to (i) withhold on any U.S. Source Withholdable Payment made to any Nonparticipating Financial Institution to the extent required under Article 4(1)(d) of the IGA; (ii) provide to any immediate payor of a U.S. Source Withholdable Payment the information required for withholding and reporting on any such payment to a Nonparticipating Financial institution to the extent required under Article 4(1 )(e) of the IGA; and (iii) comply with Article 4(5) of the IGA with respect to Related Entities and branches that are Nonparticipating Financial Institutions. Lack of compliance with other conditions set forth in Article 4, such as compliance with applicable registration requirements, may also lead to a determination of significant non-compliance with regard to a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution. 4.2.1.4 Consultation: In the ordinary course, the Competent Authorities anticipate consultation prior to a determination of significant non-compliance. 4.2.2 Administrative or Other Minor Errors: Under Article 5(1) of the IGA, administrative and other minor errors include incorrect or incomplete reporting of information described under Articles 2(2) and 4(1 )(b) of the IGA or other errors that result in infringements of the IGA. 4.2.2.1 Self-initiated Reporting Changes: In the event a providing Competent Authority receives a notice from a Reporting Financial Institution or by or on behalf of a Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution regarding an omission or other error in an exchanged report, the report should be amended. The providing Competent Authority should forward any amended reports to the receiving Competent Authority as soon as practicable. 4.3 Notification Procedures: To address non-compliance, the receiving Competent Authority would notify the providing Competent Authority pursuant to Article 5 of the IGA. The notification procedures would differ depending upon whether the 8 receiving Competent Authority seeks to address administrative or other minor errors or significant non-compliance. 4.3.1 Procedures for Administrative or Other Minor Errors: As provided in Article 5(1) of the IGA, the receiving Competent Authority would notify the providing Competent Authority when the receiving Competent Authority has reason to believe that administrative errors or other minor errors may have led to incorrect or incomplete information reporting or result in other infringements of the IGA. The providing Competent Authority would then apply its domestic law (including applicable penalties) to obtain complete and correct information or to resolve other minor or administrative infringements of the IGA and exchange such information with the receiving Competent Authority. 4.3.2 Procedures for Significant Non-Compliance: 4.3.2.1 In General: Under Article 5(2) of the IGA, the receiving Competent Authority would notify the providing Competent Authority when the receiving Competent Authority has determined there is significant non-compliance with the obligations under the IGA with respect to a Reporting Financial Institution. After such notification of significant non-compliance from the receiving Competent Authority, the providing Competent Authority would apply its domestic laws (including applicable penalties) to address the significant non- compliance described in the notice. The Competent Authorities may consult on the steps needed to address such non-compliance. If the U.S. Competent Authority were to notify the New Zealand Competent Authority of a determination of significant non-compliance, the date on which notification was provided to, and received by, the New Zealand Competent Authority (per Paragraph 3.3.4) would constitute the beginning of the eighteen (18) month period set forth in Article 5(2)(b) of the IGA. 4.3.2.2 Notice to Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution: The New Zealand Competent Authority should notify the relevant Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution of the significant non-compliance determination, including the date the U.S. Competent Authority provided notice of such non-compliance to the New Zealand Competent Authority (per Paragraph 3.3.4). The notice should also indicate that if the significant non-compliance is not cured within eighteen (18) months after the date the U.S Competent Authority provided notice to the New Zealand Competent Authority, the relevant Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may be treated as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, its name may be removed from the IRS FFI list, and it may therefore be subject to 30-percent withholding under section 1471(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. 9 4.4.1 The Competent Authorities intend calendar years 2014 and 2015 to be a transition period for purposes of the enforcement and administration of any data collection, due diligence, information reporting, automatic information exchange, and withholding requirements described in the IGA. The Competent Authorities intend to take into account the good faith efforts of each other, Reporting Financial Institutions, and Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institutions toward compliance with any such requirements during this transition period when pursuing enforcement. 4.4.2 The transition period described in Paragraph 4.4.1 may be extended by mutual written decision of the Competent Authorities. 4.4 Transition Period for Remediation and Enforcement: Paragraph 5 CONFIDENTIALITY AND DATA SAFEGUARDS 5.1 Confidentiality and Use: in accordance with Article 3(7) of the IGA, all information exchanged pursuant to the IGA is subject to the confidentiality and other protections provided for in the Convention (hereinafter “Confidentiality Protections”), including the provisions limiting the use of the information exchanged. The Competent Authorities intend to maintain appropriate safeguards and infrastructure (“Data Safeguards”). 5.2 Transmission Risk and Responsibility: The New Zealand Competent Authority intends to maintain Confidentiality Protections regarding information transmitted by the U.S. Competent Authority via IDES from the time it successfully downloads such information from IDES. The U.S. Competent Authority intends to maintain Confidentiality Protections regarding information transmitted via IDES from the time information is successfully uploaded to IDES. Where the New Zealand Competent Authority elects to use IDES as an M102 data collection tool, the New Zealand Competent Authority intends to maintain Confidentiality Protections from the time information is successfully uploaded by a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution or by or on behalf of a Paragraph 1.1.2 Financial Institution to IDES. See FATCA IDES User Guide (IRS Publication 5190). 5.3 Notification of Actual or Potential Breach of the Confidentiality and Safeguard Protections: A Competent Authority should notify the other Competent Authority promptly regarding any actual or potential breach of the Confidentiality Protections, or in the event that the Competent Authority no longer intends to maintain the Data Safeguards. 10 Paragraph 6 COSTS 6.1 Unless the Competent Authorities specify otherwise in writing, each Competent Authority intends to bear its own ordinary costs incurred in administering its domestic iaws and providing assistance under this Arrangement. The Competent Authorities may consult with each other in advance of the incidence of extraordinary costs to consider whether, and if so how, to allocate such costs between the Competent Authorities. Paragraph 7 EFFECT, CONSULTATION AND MODIFICATION 7.1 Operative Date: This Arrangement becomes operative on the later of (i) the date the IGA enters into force, or (ii) the date the Arrangement is signed by the U.S. and the New Zealand Competent Authorities. Once the Arrangement is operative, its provisions apply to all information that is exchanged pursuant to the IGA, including information for calendar years that precede the operative date. 7.2 Consultation: Each Competent Authority may at any time request consultations on the implementation, interpretation, application, or modification of this Arrangement. Such consultation (through discussion or correspondence) should take place within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of receipt of such request, unless otherwise mutually decided. If the Competent Authority of a Contracting State believes the other Contracting State has failed to fulfill its obligations under the IGA, it may request immediate consultation to ensure fulfillment of the IGA. 7.3 Modification: This Arrangement may be modified at any time by mutual consent of the Competent Authorities, in writing. 7.4 Discontinuation: This Arrangement is intended to be discontinued automatically upon termination of the IGA. In the event of discontinuation, all information previously received under this Arrangement would remain subject to the Confidentiality Protections. 11 Paragraph 8 PUBLICATION 8.1 The Competent Authorities intend to make this Arrangement publicly available through official publication by each Contracting State within thirty (30) days from the last date of signature of this Arrangement. The Competent Authorities expect to set the precise date and time through consultation.

COMPETENT AUTHORITY ARRANGEMENT The Competent Authorities of the United States and New Zealand have reached the following arrangement (“Arrangement”) concerning the meaning of the term “resident in New Zealand” as that term applies to a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a “unit trust” which is deemed to be a company for purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007) under paragraph 1(1) of Article 1 (Definitions) of the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of New Zealand to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA, signed on 12 June 2014 (“IGA”). This Arrangement is entered into pursuant to paragraph 2 of Article 1 of the IGA and paragraph 3 of Article 24 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of the Convention between the United States of America and New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, together with a related Protocol, done at Washington on December 1,2008. It is understood that for purposes of this Arrangement, “Article” refers to an Article of the IGA. New Zealand Financial Institution under Article 1(1)0) of the IGA Article 1(1 )(l) provides that the definition of the term “New Zealand Financial Institution” means “any Financial Institution resident in New Zealand, but excluding any branch of such Financial Institution that is located outside New Zealand” and “any branch of a Financial Institution not resident in New Zealand, if such branch is located in New Zealand.” Under Article 1(2), “\[a\]ny term not otherwise defined in this Agreement \[the IGA\] shall, unless the context otherwise requires or the Competent Authorities agree to a common meaning (as permitted by domestic law), have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of the Party applying this Agreement \[the IGA\], any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that Party prevailing over the meaning given to the term under the laws of that Party.” A Financial Institution that is a trust is a New Zealand Financial Institution if it is resident in New Zealand. The laws of New Zealand provide residency rules for income tax purposes for individuals and certain entities that have a separate legal personality. Trusts (with the exception of unit trusts) are not separate legal entities in New Zealand, and thus New Zealand does not have residency rules for income tax purposes for trusts (other than unit trusts). Common Meaning of the Term “Resident in New Zealand” with Respect to a Financial Institution that is a Trust (other than a Unit Trust) Pursuant to Article 1(2), New Zealand has requested, and the Competent Authorities of the United States and New Zealand have reached, the following common understanding 1 of the meaning of the term “resident in New Zealand” with respect to a trust (other than a unit trust): Beginning on or before April 1,2017, the term “resident in New Zealand” means, in the context of a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust), a trust that has one or more trustees resident in New Zealand for New Zealand income tax purposes at any time during the reporting period, or is managed by a branch of a trustee located in New Zealand provided that the branch of the trustee is subject to regulatory supervision in New Zealand. However, a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust) would not be considered “resident in New Zealand” if the trust is resident in a Partner Jurisdiction or in another jurisdiction that permits the trust to comply with the requirements of a participating FFI under the U.S. Treasury Regulations, and the trust reports all the information required to be reported pursuant to the Partner Jurisdiction’s IGA or the U.S. Treasury Regulations, as applicable, with respect to Financial Accounts maintained by the trust. Prior to April 1,2017, a trust (other than a unit trust) may rely on any reasonable definition for the term “resident in New Zealand” including, for instance, in the context of a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust), a trust that is established under the laws of New Zealand, whereby the trust is settled, executed, and governed by New Zealand law. Upon signature of both Competent Authorities, this Arrangement is operative. 2

A large number of responses were received on the online forum, with more than 900 comments across both areas of consultation and more than 2,300 tick-box responses to the proposals. Ninety written submissions were also received. This document summarises the main themes from both the online consultation and written submissions, supported by representative quotes from the actual submissions and comments received. It also sets out the results from the 2,300 tick-box responses to the proposals. Some of the representative quotes in response to a particular question may also relate to other questions or proposals. The comments quoted in the summaries, and in the appendices, are representative examples of comments received in the online submissions and written submissions. They are quoted as supplied, apart from the correction of typographical errors. The submissions received were generally supportive of the overall direction and there was no groundswell of opinion which On 31 March 2015, the Government released the first two in a series of discussion documents for public consultation planned for the next few years to support consultation on the Government’s proposals for modernising and simplifying tax administration in New Zealand. The first consultation, Making Tax Simpler – A Government Green Paper on tax administration (the Green Paper), aimed to introduce New Zealand to the overall direction of the tax administration modernisation programme and sought feedback on that direction. The second consultation document, Making Tax Simpler – Better digital services (Better digital services), outlined proposals for moving Inland Revenue and its customers toward much greater use of sophisticated digital technology. An online forum makingtaxsimpler. ird.govt.nz provided the opportunity for the public to submit comments online and answer opinion polls for both the Green Paper and Better digital services under a series of questions linked to those in the discussion documents. Written submissions were also received through the cHapter 1 introduction 4 suggested that the Government should revisit this direction. A number of submissions indicated a level of comfort with current processes and practices. Some also noted concerns about the potential for costs to be shifted from Government/Inland Revenue to businesses and employers by requiring them to use accounting or payroll software or update existing software. Respondents noted that some of the proposals would increase compliance costs for people interacting with the tax system. Also, the lack of detailed proposals meant that submitters could not fully determine the impact of the potential changes. The proposals identified in the Green Paper and Better digital services are being developed further, and the submissions and comments received are being used to shape the detailed public consultations proposed to be released as part of future Making Tax Simpler consultations. The subsequent consultations will set out in more detail the proposed changes to tax administration, allowing people to provide more informed views. Some responses to the consultation raised broad suggestions for change along the lines of abolishing income tax and increasing GST, as well as suggestions that the responsibility for administering KiwiSaver or Working for Families should rest with other government agencies. These responses were outside the scope of the consultation due to the key assumptions made during the early IndIcatIve conSultatIon tImelIne 2016 Investment income information 2016 Business taxation 2016 Individuals’ interactions with IR 2015 Towards a new Tax Administration Act Better administration of PAYE/GST 2015 Social policy 2 017 M arch 2015 Green Paper on tax administration Green Paper on tax administration M arch 2015 Better digital services M arch 2015 5 development of the policy issues discussed in the Green Paper. These were: • Key tax bases will remain substantially in place and New Zealand will continue with its broad-base, low-rate approach. There are no fundamental changes currently planned to either income tax (individuals and corporates) or GST. Previous comprehensive tax reviews, most recently by the 2010 Tax Working Group, provide a high degree of support for this assumption. • Social policy and other non-tax functions currently administered by Inland Revenue (for example, in relation to Working for Families, child support, student loan repayments and KiwiSaver) will continue to be a key part of Inland Revenue’s portfolio of work. 1 Comments and suggestions out of scope have not been included in this document. Responses that related more generally to Inland Revenue operations, for example interactions with Inland Revenue via call centres, or specific policy issues in the Government’s tax policy work programme, are being passed on to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for her consideration and progression, if appropriate. Chapters 2 and 3 reflect the layout of the consultative documents and the associated online forums, and the questions posed in the documents and the online forums. They include diagrams which set out the results of the online polls. Not all numbers add to 100% due to rounding. 1 Paragraph 1.48 page 44 of the Green Paper. 6 Sixty-six people responded to the online opinion poll question: “are these suggestions the right ones to deliver change?” The Green Paper introduced New Zealand to the overall direction of the tax administration modernisation programme, set out the proposed areas for review and possible policy and legislative changes that could be needed, and sought feedback on that direction. Why focuS on tax admInIS tratIon? This section of the Green Paper outlined the background and motivation for modernising tax administration, set out current issues and discussed the desired characteristics of the future tax administration. Feedback was sought on the overall direction of the project and order of the proposed changes. Number of submissions and results of online consultation Ten written submissions and 82 online comments were received on this section.2 61% Yes, these suggestions are the right ones to deliver change 18% Unsure 21% No cHapter 2 7 Forty-four people responded to the online opinion poll question: “have we missed anything?” Thirty-seven people responded to the online opinion poll question: “are the potential changes heading in the right direction, and have we focused on the right things?” 45% Yes, things have been missed 16% Unsure 68% Yes, the changes are heading in the right direction and the focus is right 16% No 45% Unsure whether anything has been missed 9% No 8 Thirty-five people responded to the online opinion poll question: “Is this the right order?” Thirty-two people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you think this order will work for you?” 49% Yes, the proposed sequencing and order of work is sensible 53% Yes, this order will work 37% No 28% No 14% Unsure 19 % Unsure 9 Summary of comments on why focus on tax administration Written submissions expressed general support for the overall project and the proposals to simplify the tax system: A ground-up review of the tax administration system is long overdue. Just wanted to say that I love the proposed changes... However, some submitters expressed reservations: We are concerned that there is a lack of a problem definition for some of the proposals listed in the paper. Change ... should only be delivered where there is a clear problem/issue identified and fixing that problem would deliver benefits for tax system as a whole, with providing benefits to business being a key part of this equation. Not all businesses stand to benefit from the proposals. Care needs to be taken in the policy/design that the tax system caters for all, including rural businesses and very small businesses. Two submissions proposed additional key underlying principles they felt should serve as a framework for the overall project: A broad framework for the fundamental principles for the wider project should be put together. These fundamental principles should include: • Changes will result in a net benefit to the New Zealand economy and community i.e., costs are not merely shifted from Government/Inland Revenue to business/employers and individuals. • New Zealand’s broad-base, low- rate approach to the tax base will continue. • Confidentiality of taxpayer information is assured. • The key role to be played by intermediaries, including agents, is acknowledged and recognised to ensure the changes are in line with current commercial practice. • Certainty and predictability will be enhanced. • There will continue to be a need for people to engage with people and not only for systems to engage with each other. • There is no “one size fits all”. Some written submitters considered that the Green Paper did not sufficiently incorporate the role of tax agents and intermediaries in its discussion, and stressed that the value of the role played by tax agents should not be overlooked in the transformation project: In order for the transformation programme to be successful, engagement with the tax agent community is essential... Several written submissions emphasised that the changes should reduce compliance costs and the 10 complexity of the tax system for business and individual taxpayers, with provisional tax being a focus of many comments: Please help us minimise our admin costs and time for micro to small business. Provisional tax – hate it, horrible. More importantly, STRESSFUL. Improving provisional tax would greatly help small companies stay afloat. Current provisional tax payments in advance punish small businesses’ cashfl o w... Submitters also stressed that the project should not have the effect of shifting costs from Inland Revenue/ the Government to businesses: It is of fundamental importance that business transformation does not shift the boundary between the role of Inland Revenue as tax collector and the business’s role, thereby driving up costs for business. Some written submissions also noted that transition costs should be kept to a minimum: Any changes will need to be implemented as seamlessly as possible to ensure transition costs are kept to a minimum. This is particularly important for small businesses who may feel the compliance costs in coping with the changes are disproportionately higher in the shorter term. Some written submissions observed that the Green Paper discusses potential changes only in very broad terms and emphasised that future discussion documents should discuss proposals in greater detail so stakeholders can consider and provide comment on any potential changes and their impacts: The discussion on any potential changes to GST in the Green Paper is limited, especially compared with the more detailed discussion on potential changes to PAYE . Online commentators expressed support for “faster turnarounds” from Inland Revenue on refunds and receiving information from Inland Revenue: The time taken to process refunds is far too long... if we don't pay immediately penalties are applied but the same in reverse doesn't happen. Online commentators supported simplification of the tax system and reductions in compliance costs (both monetary and in terms of time). Online commentators also expressed support for increased use of technology. However, this came with a rider: We have a concern that digitisation is being seen as something of a “magic bullet” and the human element which remains is being overlooked. Ultimately, business processes involve human input and therefore the possibility for error remains. Rectifying human error will remain a necessary element of any tax administration system ... regardless of change, the ability to liaise directly and quickly with Inland Revenue staff 11 remains available. With respect to the proposed order of work, several online submitters considered that “the rationalisation of tax types” should be brought forward in the review: It makes sense to review the PAYE and withholding taxes on labour and investment income before implementing changes to how individuals interact with Inland Revenue. We consider simplifying tax for businesses, especially small businesses, should also be a priority. The review of business tax obligations should proceed alongside the various withholding tax system considerations as this would allow the impact of the tax system on business obligations, both as taxpayers in their own right and as tax collectors for Government, to be considered holistically. In response to the question about whether there are any key errors or omissions in the discussion in the Green Paper, one online submitter noted that the taxation of capital gains on property investment should be considered as part of the review. Another commented: Expand the focus of tax collection past targeting income earners, to include wealth gatherers. the future for BuSIneSS ProceSSeS – Paye The Green Paper sought views on reducing the compliance costs associated with PAYE and GST by way of greater use of technology and, in relation to PAYE, some simplification of the rules and rationalisation of how employment remuneration is taxed. It also sought views on whether the scope of the current withholding tax rules (schedular payments) should be expanded to cover other “employment-like” income such as that earned by independent contractors. Number of submissions and results of online consultation Nineteen written submission and 38 online comments were received on this section. Forty-nine people responded to the online opinion poll question: “Would you benefit from the incorporation of Paye into your business systems?” 55% Yes, I would benefit from the incorporation of PAYE into my business systems 8% Unsure 37% No 12 Twenty-three people responded to the online opinion poll question: “have we identified the right areas for the Paye review to focus on?” Twenty-three people responded to the online opinion poll question: “Is there anything else about streamlining the collection of Paye, GSt, and other information that needs to be considered?” 70% Yes, the right areas for the PAYE review to focus on have been identified 22% Unsure 9% No 35% Yes, there are other things that need to be considered 43% Unsure 22% No 13 Summary of comments on the future for business processes – PAYE Issue: Streamline the collection of PAYE, GST and related information by integrating tax obligations into existing business systems There was general support for the idea of streamlining various tax types: We agree that making greater use of a business’s own systems to provide PAYE information should provide benefits to employers by reducing duplication and allowing easier amendment and corrections of tax codes. In theory, integrating PAYE into existing business payroll systems has the potential to simplify compliance for both business and Inland Revenue. However... reforms in this area will have to be carefully thought out and there are practical considerations that Inland Revenue will need to consider in depth. However, not all submitters were convinced of the benefits of the proposed changes: So far, nothing you've talked about in terms of streamlining processes and integrating PAYE into normal business processes is different to what people should be doing now. Where are the improvements and benefits for employers actually coming from? While at a general level there was support for the move towards a digital employer monthly schedule (EMS) or PAYE system, some submissions emphasised that technology will not be a complete solution to the problems and issues in the current PAY E s y s te m .3 In addition, submissions raised several issues relating to the practical implications of a move towards a digital EMS system. Several submitters expressed concern that the shift will generate increased compliance costs for businesses in that it will result in the need to update or acquire payroll software, with some submissions noting that some smaller businesses do not have sophisticated software or any software at all: You have mentioned MYOB. Many of us use other small business accounting systems... I would appreciate that mine (Quikbooks) is recognised by IRD. To encourage small businesses to move to more efficient payroll systems Inland Revenue should consider increasing the current payroll subsidy. This would also acknowledge the role of employers as de facto tax collectors through the PAYE system. With respect to the proposal that a business’s own systems be used to provide PAYE and related information to Inland Revenue, several submissions emphasised the need to ensure that the information provided to Inland Revenue is accurate. It was noted that even with real- time exchange of information, accuracy will not be possible 100% of the time. The variable nature of self-employed income caused concern for one submitter: I am NOT in favour of any real-time interaction between my accounting 14 software and the IRD allowing tax to be calculated on “as you earn” basis. Small businesses’ income is ... very low some months, very high others. If a sole trader had an income for one month that projects to an annual income of twice what it will actually be, how could the tax for that isolated month be calculated fairly? Any such system would be overburdened with refunds, adjustments, corrections, complaints, unfair penalties, etc. I do not see any potential efficiencies at all. Some submissions suggested that employers should be required to pay the amounts deducted to Inland Revenue at the same time as the payment of the salary or wages, while others noted that employers should continue to pay amounts deducted to Inland Revenue later in light of the fact that the delayed payment compensates employers for some of the compliance costs incurred. Issue: Reviewing and streamlining the PAYE rules more generally There was general support for the PAYE rules to be reviewed and updated. One submission noted that such a review was well overdue: We support a review and update of the PAYE and schedular payment rules as the original framework was established in a different era and changes have been made in an ad hoc manner. Submissions noted the need for flexibility and the ability to correct mistakes in relation to PAYE, suggesting that the penalty and use of money interest (UOMI) rules be reviewed to provide a framework for this to occur: Some flexibility around timeliness and ability to correct errors without penalty or interest costs should be considered. Some submissions expressed concerns about the complexity of taxing fringe benefits using the PAYE rules: We do not support inclusion of fringe benefits into the PAYE system. The collection of FBT data comes from many sources which cannot be easily adapted (if at all) into our PAYE system on a real time basis. Inclusion of fringe benefits to an employee's earnings may create lumpy earnings outcomes with the possibility for unexpected consequences such as increases to KiwiSaver contributions, child support or student loan repayments. We also note that incorporating fringe benefits into the PAYE rules is likely to significantly increase compliance costs for employers, especially for those that currently elect to pay FBT at the flat rate of 49.25%. Incorporating fringe benefits into the PAYE rules will require the PAYE to be calculated separately for each employee receiving fringe benefits. Issue: Enhancing withholding taxes to cover “employment-like” income While some submissions saw merit in extending withholding taxes to cover “employment-like” income, all submissions expressed concern that such an extension would result in increased compliance costs for employers/businesses: 15 the future for BuSIneSS tax A particular focus of Making Tax Simpler is to ensure it becomes easier for businesses to comply with their tax obligations, reducing their compliance costs and improving overall levels of compliance. The Green Paper sought views from a business tax perspective on: • the key tax administration issues businesses currently face • any concrete ways of increasing speed and certainty for businesses in relation to their tax affairs • ways the provisional tax system could be improved • any areas of tax administration that could be simplified for small business, without creating tax breaks • the key issues to be considered in making it easier to provide income information. Number of submissions and results of online consultation Forty-one written submissions and 278 online comments were received on this section. It is difficult to see how additional compliance will not be imposed on business taxpayers by requiring them to withhold tax in more circumstances. It's too hard to put the withholding burden on businesses. There are going to be too many exceptions, too many grey areas. If you really want to keep it simple for businesses, abolish all withholding tax on business transactions. Put the IRD resource in to chasing those that don't declare the income. Requiring people who don't currently have to deduct withholding tax (or PAYE) to have to do it, adds to their workload but provides no benefit to the person doing the work and potentially exposes them to penalties. Some submissions pointed out that there could be implications for self- employed people who would start to be taxed at source: Self-employed or independent contractors whose income is taxed at source could experience cashflow difficulties, especially if they are making losses; an exemption certificate needs to be available ... Also, these deductions ... are based on gross income so do not take account of expenses (and getting a refund at the end of tax year does not make up for the cash flow challenges or interest costs of not being able to use your own money). One submission noted the difficulty in developing a workable definition of what activities would be covered. 16 132 people responded to the online opinion poll question: “Should we focus on the provisional tax rules?” Fifty-one people responded to the online opinion poll question: “are we heading in the right direction for small business?” 27% Unsure 5% Unsure 29% No 17 % No 43% Yes, this is the right direction for small businesses 79% Yes, Government should focus on the provisional tax rules 17 Summary of comments on the future for business tax Issue: Reforming the provisional tax regime is a key aspect of reducing compliance cost for businesses There was strong support for a review of the provisional tax rules and the UOMI rules, with only a minority of submitters suggesting the current regime should be retained as it currently is: 4 We fully support the need to review the provisional tax system, particularly the current use-of-money interest (UOMI) rules and their application. This is a good initiative and it will bring some good results if implemented with an attitude of giving the end users a high priority... A number of submitters felt that the current provisional tax system was acceptable if there were changes to reduce the impact of UOMI, while the options of provisional tax based on GST and provisional tax on a PAYE basis both gained significant support: The issue with the provisional tax system, particularly for large corporates is not necessarily the complexity of the calculation but rather the consequence of under or overpaying provisional tax being the resulting use of money interest cost imposed. We broadly agree that using accounting profits with a few adjustments or a bespoke percentage of a business’s turnover could simplify the calculation of provisional tax and create more certainty for businesses. Other submitters argued for the complete removal of the provisional tax rules due to the difficulty of estimating income, and some of these submitters argued that it was tax on income that hadn’t been earned yet. Issue: Provisional tax could be calculated and paid more on account – i.e., PAYE for business There was strong support for more regular payments of provisional tax as income is earned, in preference to the current estimation and three even payments across the income year: As a contractor, my earnings vary month to month and year to year, so the standard provisional tax system doesn't work for me. A PAYE system would work and is something I have communicated to IR in the past. Fully endorsed as an idea. However, 14% of submitters on this topic specifically disagreed with the proposal. Some submitters were concerned about potential cashflow implications, particularly for SMEs, start-up businesses and seasonal businesses, and several suggested that a PAYE-type regime should be on an “opt in” basis rather than being compulsory: What about giving us a choice ...to either pay as you go, or as the current system. That way the different businesses can tailor their tax payments to suit their business character. ...having to pay by 20th following would mean having to pay before a portion of our customers had paid us. 18 Submitters who supported the idea offered a range of views on how often payment should be made, including weekly, fortnightly, monthly or aligned with GST payment dates: An idea would be to allow provisional tax to be paid based on the previous quarter's actual/estimated results. That way business would not worry about penalties on underestimated annual income, as they had four opportunities to get it close. The simplest way seems to add the option to a current monthly system such as GST which at the moment at least, can be paid manually or electronically.... Issue: Other matters raised in relation to provisional tax A number of matters were raised in the submissions on provisional tax. A large number of submitters commented on the UOMI and penalties rules and the effect these had in conjunction with the current provisional tax rules: ...the key provisional tax concerns for small and medium sized businesses are certainty of cashflows (working capital management), UOMI risk and compliance burdens. Increasing the existing $50,000 threshold for UOMI, extending this threshold to businesses and addressing the current UOMI rates wedge will go some way to addressing these concerns. Estimating profitability for the coming year and then being penalised when you get it wrong is totally unfair and unreasonable. There were also several positive comments about paying provisional tax using the GST ratio method, and suggestions that the criteria for using this method should be changed to allow greater use: The GST ratio method has many advantages over the standard provisional tax payment method. However, the threshold of $150,000 RIT is too low; it needs to be increased. Issue: Simplification for small businesses Responses in relation to making tax simpler for micro and small businesses were mixed. Some suggested that supplying software would be a great idea while others cautioned against expecting too much from this: I have a concern that the “approval” of specific online accounting packages will effectively force small businesses to take up certain packages. ... Any changes to the proposal for businesses to use electronic systems must not be mandatory to the point they leave small business (particularly start-ups) with no choice but to pay whatever charges a software provider imposes on them. Accounts can, for many, be perfectly well kept with a good spreadsheet based on the IR samples in the Business Toolkit. I would like to urge caution in “mandating” proposals for a move to mandatory technology systems. Perhaps offer an incentive if this is easier, but don't make businesses a prisoner of software providers by creating a de facto monopoly or cartel. 19 Some submissions suggested allowing small businesses to operate on a cash basis rather than an accruals basis. Other submissions suggested relaxing some of the rules around fixed assets to allow a deduction up front and remove the need to calculate depreciation. The one general area of agreement was that simplification would be a good thing, although several small business owners are happy with things as they are: I run a small business – do not have employees, only contractors, and the majority of my business happens in three months of the year. I do not need any more simplification than I have. The proposed system would only increase my workload and would only increase compliance costs and errors. Submitters also noted that the principle “no one size fits all” is very important in dealing with small businesses, and the importance of getting good feedback from people within this sector of the economy: Smaller/micro businesses need to be a focus as this group bears a disproportionate share of the compliance costs – consult/work closely with them to find out what they want and what would work for them. Issue: How can we make it easier for businesses to supply information? While there was general agreement that digital communication is the way forward, a number of submitters felt that there needs to be a paper-based system alongside the digital offerings, as not all small businesses will be able to provide electronic information and even some larger rural businesses may have difficulty accessing the internet due to their location. Large businesses with bespoke systems also expressed concerns about interacting with Inland Revenue, as it may take some time and cost to configure their systems to communicate effectively with Inland Revenue’s systems: Large corporates have bespoke accounting systems ... updates to large corporates’ payroll systems will be more complex, time-consuming and expensive. In addition, businesses will need to be given long lead-times to implement changes to their payroll systems, as unplanned upgrades need to be planned, budgeted for and approved among competing business priorities. Some submitters also noted the need to ensure that they have the ability to review their information before it is transmitted to Inland Revenue. An application programming interface has been requested by some submitters to enable efficient communication with IRD systems: ...the administrator for that company needs to authorise the transfer. Otherwise if there was unfinished workings or an error in the data which was not fixed prior to the software automatically sending the data, this would create nightmares for both IR and the company. 20 Summary of comments on withholding taxes from capital income Responses to the proposals to streamline the collection of withholding tax information were varied. Individual online submitters raised specific issues causing difficulty in this area: I have just spent a solid two days collating all the payments I've received and imputation credits and RWT for my investments. Yet the IRD already has this information as payers send the IRD a copy. RWT exemptions generated some comments: The need to provide the basis of the exemption, to make a declaration, and to furnish books of account and any other relevant accounting information, is convoluted and unnecessary...a review should also consider: • extending the period for which an RWT exemption certificate is issued • removing the need for a new application each time an RWT exemption certificate is required. Some submissions noted that when considering changes to the RWT rules (and specifically the provision of RWT information), Inland Revenue should be mindful of additional compliance/ transitional costs on businesses and should particularly consider the impact on smaller interest payers as not all taxpayers will have sophisticated systems: WIthholdInG taxeS from caPItal Income Feedback was sought on improving the collection of resident withholding tax information from customers who pay interest and dividends. Number of submissions and results of online consultation Ten written submissions and eight online comments were received on this section. Twenty-four people responded to the online opinion poll question: “Is there anything else a review of the rWt rules should consider?” 54% Yes, there are other things a review of the RWT rules should consider 33% Unsure 13% No 21 IndIvIdualS The Green Paper proposed changes for individuals’ interactions with the tax system, including providing online income tax statements prepopulated with income details, and more effective use of technology to better manage both overpayments and underpayments of tax. Feedback was sought on this idea. Number of submissions and results of online consultation Fourteen written submissions and 55 online comments were received on this section. Ninety-six people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you agree with the idea of requiring individuals to interact with the tax system by online statements?” If information provision can be incorporated into the business’s own systems, we do not think it should be too onerous for financial institutions to provide information to Inland Revenue each month on RWT deducted on interest for their customers. Further consideration should be given to the compliance costs for SMEs which would arise from increased reporting requirements in relation to dividends paid where RWT was withheld. We believe as part of the review of New Zealand’s tax administration system, consideration must always be given to reducing duplication where possible. Therefore, we support the proposal that, if RWT information is provided directly to Inland Revenue when it was withheld, financial institutions and other businesses withholding RWT on interest should no longer have to issue annual withholding certificates to customers. Some submitters suggested that the costs to businesses and Inland Revenue might outweigh the benefits of the proposed changes: Inland Revenue needs to be able to demonstrate that any gains from changes to the way withholding tax is collected outweigh the costs to both businesses and Inland Revenue from those changes... officials need to consider whether a drive towards greater accuracy in the amount paid throughout the year on capital income is actually an achievable or desirable outcome. 44% Yes, I agree with the idea of requiring individuals to interact with the tax system by online statements 13% Unsure 44% No, I don't agree with the idea of requiring individuals to interact with the tax system by online statements 22 treatment across individual taxpayers. In addition, we consider there may be some social good in that individuals would necessarily become more aware of the detail of their income and financial affairs, their rights and obligations as taxpayers. Some submitters agreed in principle but expressed some concerns about how the process would work: We do not consider it would be sufficient to present a taxpayer with a statement of prepopulated data then a simple request to the taxpayer to confirm or add to it. Rather, we suggest IR should pose a series of questions designed to elicit and capture all sources of income which taxpayers may have and only to allow completion and filing of the return once those questions have been answered. I think the idea of more people interacting with the tax system is good in principle but I don't think the majority of people are financially literate enough to do so in a meaningful way. An automated form that was prepopulated and included very clear instructions on completing it with online help options, would be useful (similar to passport application forms). Issue: Other matters raised in relation to individuals Some submitters expressed concerns at the suggestions of automatic recovery of underpayments by adjusted withholding tax rates, with fears that this might cause cashflow issues. They felt there would need to be communication with the taxpayer Summary of comments on individuals Issue: Individuals should interact with the tax system through a prepopulated secure online tax statement There was strong support to move towards online interaction, but also a significant level of concern that a large number of taxpayers will not be able to manage online interaction. There was support for retaining paper returns alongside the online interaction to cater for these taxpayers: Any changes need to accommodate those unable to interact electronically, such as farmers who have no access to broadband or only a patchy service which makes electronic interaction very difficult. You will be surprised to know how many individuals in low socio-economic areas and many elderly people (who pay tax on their pension/investments) still do not have a computer or access to a PC ... forcing them to interact with the IRD via the internet will be rather problematic. No doubt the IRD will penalise them in some way for failing to interact with the IRD using the required method? A few submitters also noted that getting taxpayers to interact with the tax system would improve their knowledge of the tax system and that this was a good thing: Requiring all taxpayers who derive income to file annual returns may increase perceptions of equality of 23 a more real-time basis, resulting in certainty for individuals and families. Number of submissions and results of online consultation Six written submissions and five online comments were received on this section. Thirty-seven people responded to the online opinion poll question: “are we on the right track for reviewing social policy administration?” so that they knew that it was going to happen: Taxpayers on benefits, those receiving Working for Families or making student loan repayments will have different abilities to cope with additional deductions from their net wage. However, if different withholding thresholds are imposed, these must be overlaid with the principle of fairness and this should be evident in the structure proposed. One submitter commented that such a proposal would also need to be looked at from the perspective of the party that would have to apply the higher level of withholding tax. Respondents expressed concerns over people avoiding tax by doing cash jobs and companies paying less than their fair share of tax. They felt that the proposals failed to target these people and would more likely affect ordinary taxpayers. SocIal PolIcy Along with its tax collection responsibilities, Inland Revenue is also responsible for Child Support, Student Loans, Working for Families and KiwiSaver. As a group, these non-tax responsibilities are referred to as social policy initiatives. The Green Paper sought feedback on the intention to design a social policy system that works for the customer and is fit for purpose, using prepopulated information that is already held and providing for timely payments on 57% Yes, you're on the right track for reviewing social policy administration 35% Unsure 8% No 24 Summary of comments on social policy There was support for greater administration of social policy programmes through online channels, with several submissions noting that this could save time and money: We suggest IRD’s improved collection and collation of data for individuals and increasing use of electronic payment systems should allow IRD to deliver social assistance on a current basis without using employer payrolls to do so. Three submissions noted that the current Working for Families tax credits system results in many customers falling into debt, and recommended changes to the process so that customers are paid the correct amount at the right time: The system should ensure the correct entitlements are paid and avoid creating debt. More broadly, several written submissions queried whether Inland Revenue should continue to have a role in administering social policy: We would also encourage review of the apparent underlying assumption that IRD and its systems should always be looked to and used to provide other services and perform roles beyond that of revenue collection. the PolIcy and leGISlatIve frameWork for tax admInIS tratIon To support the Government’s ideas for the modernisation and simplification of the tax system, a policy review of key tax administration and legal issues that frame and underpin much of New Zealand’s tax system is needed. The review would consider: • the roles of Parliament and the Commissioner in tax administration; • the role of customers and third parties in the transformed administration and implications for current obligations and sanctions; • principles underpinning information and secrecy; and • the legislative structure of the Inland Revenue Acts. The Green Paper sought feedback on the review of the policy and legislative framework for tax administration. 25 Number of submissions and results of online consultation Twenty-one written submissions and eight online comments were received on this section. Thirty-six people responded to the online opinion poll question: “are we looking at the right areas of the policy and legislative framework?” Summary of comments on the policy and legislative framework for tax administration Issue: Reviewing the Commissioner’s role There was general support for a review of the Commissioner’s role where this will improve effective tax administration: We agree the Commissioner could be given greater flexibility and discretion to enable swifter resolution of situations arising from impractical or inconsistent legislation. Issue: Reviewing the role of taxpayers and third parties Several submissions emphasised that the role of tax agents/intermediaries in supporting the integrity of the tax system should not be overlooked, with some submissions expressing concern about the small number of references in the Green Paper to tax agents and their role: Tax agents and other intermediaries play a critical role in supporting the integrity of the tax system and will continue to do so as the tax administration system is reformed. For valid commercial reasons, many taxpayers will continue to want to have their tax affairs managed by agents and to limit their own direct engagement with Inland Revenue. The role of agents needs to be acknowledged more explicitly in the proposals. 68% Yes, you're looking at the right areas of the policy and legislative framework 16% Unsure 16% No 26 Submissions emphasised the need for close collaboration between Inland Revenue and tax agents in the review and reform of the tax system: In order for the transformation programme to be successful, engagement with the tax agent community is essential, especially those bodies that operate in the digital environment. Issue: Information and secrecy A number of submissions emphasised the need for safeguards to maintain privacy and data integrity in the context of increased sharing of information with other government agencies and the use of business systems to provide information to Inland Revenue: We appreciate the desire for increased efficiencies, from a government perspective, and the general desire of individuals and businesses not to have to supply the same information more than once for similar, or related, purposes... we urge caution in relation to any further sharing of information under cross-agency initiatives. Voluntary compliance and the effective working of the tax system may be undermined if taxpayers consider their information is being shared too readily with other government agencies or other parties. We are cautious about giving the Commissioner greater information gathering powers without evidence that the existing powers are insufficient. Several submissions emphasised that confidentiality of taxpayer information is key to the integrity of the tax system: Integrity of data must be assured. Confidentiality/privacy of information must be protected – requests for, and access to, information must be both necessary and relevant. Issue: Review of the legislative structure of the Tax Administration A c t 19 9 4 Submissions received in this area related to the areas that should be covered in a potential review, the “near enough is good enough” approach, the need for businesses to have certainty in respect of tax positions, and whether the administration of social policy should be within Inland Revenue’s role: The review also needs to address businesses’ ability to gain certainty that their tax position is acceptable and final. 100% accuracy is not always desirable or essential – “near enough is good enough” in many cases. Allowing for some degree of materiality in the tax system without compromising the tax base unduly will help ensure the system is effective and efficient. 2 The total number of comments and submissions are derived from how officials interpreted and allocated the responses to the questions. Specific comments and submissions that were out of scope have not been included in the count. 3 The employer monthly schedule is the form that employers complete which sets out their employees’ salary or wages, PAYE and other deductions from those, and KiwiSaver contri- butions for the month. 4 The use of money interest rules aim to compensate for the loss of the use of money for taxpayers when they have over- paid their tax and Inland Revenue when tax is underpaid. 27 The Better Digital Services discussion paper (Better digital services) set out proposals around how the tax system and its customers might benefit from greater use of digital technology. It proposed a set of principles to ensure that new digital services will meet customers’ needs, and proposed options that might help ease customers’ uptake of digital services. These principles were: • over-arching principle: Services must be designed for the customer; • Principle 1: No one size fits all; • Principle 2: Tax compliance and access to entitlements are critical; and • Principle 3: Change will not be imposed without careful consideration of the cost and benefits. BenefItS As long as digital services are secure and easy to use, greater use of digital services provides the following benefits to customers: • more convenience; • increased speed and confidence; • less effort needed to comply with tax laws; • improved, more rapid and responsive customer services; • reduced costs in running the tax administration system; and • improved delivery of services across government. The consultation asked whether the benefits presented above are likely to result from the greater use of digital technology in the tax system. It also asked whether there are any benefits, other than those put forward in the discussion document, which may arise from the greater use of digital services. Number of submissions and results of online consultation Eight written submissions and 47 online comments were received on this section. cHapter 3 28 189 people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you agree that these benefits could result from the greater use of digital technology in tax administration?” 115 people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you think there are any benefits to be gained from greater use of digital services other than those listed?” 7% Unsure 30% Unsure 9% No 15% No 84% Yes,these benefits could result from the greater use of digital technology in tax administration 55% Yes, there are other benefits to be gained from greater use of digital services 29 is entered and subsequently corrected. Done well then yes ... but a poorly designed and implemented system change could cost billions and deliver nothing! ...the IRD needs to look at the amount of online services it is currently offering and to improve the computer platform this is all sitting on before offering more services via online filing etc. Would be a good step forward, but there are still many thousands of small business that use “basic” accounting applications (which suit their needs and costs very well). Therefore an open source type interface needs to be developed so that these firms are not forced in to new and expensive software applications. Of those who disagreed that the listed benefits would arise, issues about the distribution of those benefits were largely mentioned. One submission noted that some groups such as the Government and large corporations will benefit disproportionately or even at the expense of others. Another point made was that compliance costs will, at least initially, increase as new accounting software will need to be paid for and more regular reporting increases the time spent on tax compliance. In terms of additional benefits that could result from the greater use of digital technology, the following were suggested: • environmental benefits arising Summary of comments on benefits The majority of respondents categorically agreed that the benefits proposed in the discussion document would accrue from the greater use of digital services: Absolutely! This kind of approach is well overdue - bravo for focusing on this now! ...get it right this time and everyone will be happy. Among those in agreement, the following themes emerged: • there are many benefits to moving to digital services; • a digital tax system is well overdue; • digital services will need to be world class; and • the main benefit will be reduced compliance costs. Some agreed that benefits would arise, but suggested that they are dependent on digital services being: • well-designed; • sufficiently funded; • supported by software that functions as it is expected to; • accurate, so that digital services will provide greater speed and greater confidence; and • flexible, so that penalties are not incurred if the wrong information 30 Principle 3: Change will not be imposed without careful consideration of the costs and benefits. Compliance costs imposed on customers and the administrative costs imposed on the system need to be carefully considered and balanced before changes are made. The consultation asked whether these proposed principles should guide the development of digital services. Number of submissions and results of online consultation Twelve written submissions and 63 online comments were received on this section. 112 people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you agree with these principles to guide the development of digital services?” from less paper use; • digital services will improve Pasifika peoples’ engagement with the tax system, thereby slightly increasing their financial literacy; and • it is much easier to translate to a different language through digital format and this will improve customer engagement and confidence. PrIncIPleS This chapter noted the importance of having foundation principles to guide the development of digital services. The overarching principle is that the services must be designed for the customer. Each of the following three principles addresses a different aspect of this overriding principle. Principle 1: No one size fits all. This recognises that customers and the ways they wish to interact with Inland Revenue vary, and technology will change over time. As a result, digital services will need to be flexible enough to accommodate customer preferences and technology changes. Principle 2: Tax compliance and access to entitlements are critical. As people’s access and ability to use technology differs, it is important that digital services do not make tax compliance harder for individuals who have reduced access, or result in them missing out on their social policy entitlements. 87% Yes I agree with these principles to guide the development of digital services 7% No 6% Unsure 31 Summary of comments on principles Overall, there was broad agreement with the principles listed: We agree with the over-arching principle that “services must be designed for the customer” and the three principles supporting this. The “no one size fits all” principle is particularly important in the design of the future state. The principles are a good overview to a system that could indeed progress IRD services and are a necessity to supporting individuals and business, and the current system is prehistoric and needs a good overhaul!!! We agree that customers’ needs vary ... Areas that are not covered by internet services will be disadvantaged. A corollary of the “no one size fits all” principle is that future digital services must be thoroughly tested on real end-users – understanding that no one size fits all and asking people what size they fit are two different ideas. Any changes must therefore be transparent, incremental and subject to full consultation: Principle 3 needs to have added “and without stringent testing on a diverse range of real end users”. The “no one size fits all” principle recognises that digital must be flexible enough to accommodate customer preferences and technology changes: One size doesn’t fit all as there are always going to be people who need access to paper based filing. Ninety-two people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you think that there are any other principles that should guide the development of digital services?” 65% Yes there are other principles that should guide the development of digital services 9% No 26% Unsure 32 Individuals also commented that flexibility should go further than this – the system must be able to change when there are amendments to the tax system, and be able to link with a variety of different accounting software programs, not just a select few: Flexibility – the platform must be one that can take many trains. Many submitters felt that additional principles were required. The principles of security and privacy were most often mentioned. Respondents were concerned not just about hacking from outsiders, but also about misuse of information by Inland Revenue staff. There must be adequate controls within Inland Revenue; for example, information should be segregated on a “need to know” basis, and the latest data security protocols should be used. Individuals must authorise access to their information and have control over what is submitted to Inland Revenue and when. There must also be a transparent accountability process in the event of a security or privacy breach: There is a principle not often referenced in these discussions – autonomy. This is much more than privacy. It is the principle of respect for legitimate boundaries around the right to decide one's own choices. Any integration of a government system with another entity's system must always respect autonomy. The increased use of digital services must not put taxpayer information at a greater risk of loss, unauthorised sharing or improper use. Further principles suggested were: • simplicity; • accuracy; • user-friendliness; • time- and cost-effectiveness; • reliability; • intuitiveness; • adequate support; • equity; • access across different interfaces; • third party and internal government system integration; and • the ability to correct errors easily and without penalty. In some cases, the introduction of digital services will shift the cost of compliance to taxpayers. This could be where a taxpayer does not have a computer, software and internet access. Any software that is specifically for the purpose of interacting with Inland Revenue should be free to download or access. A refinement of the proposed principles is that the information must be provided in a format that is understandable by the average taxpayer. 33 What are the priority principles that will drive the solution? Smooth migration and the ability to access old information? Security? Flexibility? Ease of use? Compliance? Access across different interfaces? Third party integration? Internal government system integration? uSInG dIGItal ServIceS The consultation outlined how digital services could deliver a better customer experience. For example, Inland Revenue systems could interact with an individual’s accounting software to provide information in near real time, resulting in tax compliance occurring automatically as information is entered for accounting purposes. It was also noted that smaller businesses and individuals may prefer to meet their tax obligations via a basic online portal rather than through integrated software. To facilitate the move to digital, the consultation proposes that Inland Revenue could adopt a “digital by default” strategy whereby new customers would be encouraged to adopt digital services first, but not compelled to do so. The discussion document noted that there will always be some individuals who will be unable to move to digital services. It proposed that they either be supported to move to digital services, or non-digital services should continue to be provided. Number of submissions and results of online consultation Seventy-eight written submissions and 276 online comments were received on this section. 180 people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you think you would move to digital services for your tax interactions if high quality digital services which met your needs were offered?” 87% Yes, I think I would move to digital services for my tax interactions if high quality digital services which met my needs were offered 3% Unsure 9% No 34 110 people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you agree that Inland revenue should support existing customers to use digital services?” Ninety-five people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you think Inland revenue should create an environment that supports new customers to adopt digital services?” 5% Unsure 11% No 13% No 84% Yes Inland Revenue should create an environment that supports new customers to adopt digital services 87% Yes Inland Revenue should support existing customers to use digital services 35 Eighty-nine people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you agree that Inland revenue should provide assistance to some customers who can’t use digital services?” Ninety-four people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you think that some customers will be unable to move to digital services?” 13% No 9% No 3% Unsure 87% Yes some customers will be unable to move to digital services 88% Yes Inland Revenue should provide assistance to some customers who can't use digital services 36 122 people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you agree that people who impose a cost on everyone by choosing not to use digital services should be encouraged, supported, and if necessary required to use digital services?” 107 people responded to the online opinion poll question: “Should some customers be required to use digital services if their choice of not doing so would deny others the benefit of the new tax administration system?” 49% No, I don't agree that people who impose a cost on everyone by choosing not to use digital services should be encouraged, supported, and if necessary required to use digital services 46% No 13% Unsure 38% Ye s 54% Yes some customers should be required to use digital services 37 Summary of comments on using digital services The majority of submissions broadly welcomed the move to digital services: We are very supportive of a shift to greater use of digital services within the tax administration system. Businesses, both small and large, are increasingly integrating digital processes into their operations and it is vital that Inland Revenue keep pace with this. We are generally supportive of this outcome and see the move as a positive step that should result in more efficient government services. However, one submitter provided a cautionary note: I think you need to treat the “yes” vote with care. By and large, the only people likely to be completing this questionnaire are people who are happy working at a computer in the first place. Even though many people have email, a large number of them will simply delete the “Scrap provisional tax estimations?” email from their inbox, a few more will read it, but only a minority will even click on the link. Moreover, the majority of people who are clicking on the link and joining in are probably pro-digital, too. A minority were against the suggested shift to digital, mainly because they were either happy with the current system and therefore did not want to change, or were concerned about the cost, privacy and/or security of moving to digital services: Ninety-five people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you agree that the commissioner should use her existing powers to facilitate the move to digital services” 49% Yes the Commissioner should use her existing powers to facilitate the move to digital services 15% No 36% Unsure 38 I can't work out how to log-on with the current service. Hate cellphones, they don't have buttons now. Still mail in my GST returns and would like to keep it that way. No I don't support having to use digital services as I don't want my personal details of name, bank account number etc communicated via the internet... I am a very small business owner. I file all my returns online BUT I do not want to have to purchase expensive accounting software or employ an accountant. I just use simple Excel spreadsheets. Many submitters stressed that the software should be tested on “real world” users, rather than internal staff, and that: • accounting software with the ability to interact with Inland Revenue systems should be developed by private sector firms; • the system should provide status updates so users can see where they are in the process, and should also integrate with tax agents’ systems in order to reduce the time spent reconciling records; and • digital services may need to require the taxpayer to take an additional step, such as a text confirmation, when completing digital interaction. This is because people are far more likely to double check the accuracy of their information when submitting it in writing, as opposed to the real-time transmission in a digital system. If the benefits of digital are compelling, many will adopt it without requiring support from Inland Revenue. A submission noted that kiosks should offer a screen with pen input as this would enable individuals who struggle with technology to be able to fill out their returns as they would manually, but have the added benefit of being in digital format. Another thought that kiosks should not just offer Inland Revenue services, but aim to consolidate all Government services in one place (such as ACC and the Companies Office): A self-service portal for all services, including an easy access app and personal website: • Quicker response time for digitally transmitted information. • Help/online customer assistance as needed. • Create an Android app. Other types of support suggested were explanatory videos, step-by- step instructions, a forum where individuals could ask questions and receive support, personal assistance from Inland Revenue staff, provision of free software and subsidies: Would love to do this digitally but couldn't justify the expense of a product like Xero – for my business, as I do no more than five invoices a month (some are as small as $25), to use Xero would cost me $600 a year, which is not feasible for a small sole trader business like mine 39 with poor English language skills. Suggestions of the types of people who can but will not move to digital included those who find technology challenging, have an inherent distrust for technology or government, are prevented from using technology due to a religious or ethical belief, or are so ingrained in current processes that they are simply unwilling to move. Some people do not have a computer and wouldn't know how to use one even if it was freely available as a kiosk or otherwise. My Aunt is 75 years old and has never owned a computer – she would need support until she is no longer expected to pay tax – that could be 20 years plus!! In addition to those who don't have access to the internet you also have to consider those who may have access but have no idea as to how to use it – like my very elderly (80 years plus) clients, or those who are younger, dyslexic, intelligence impaired, or even those to whom English is a second language. Many small businesses do not use any accounting packages at present so who is going to train all of these people to complete their tax affairs? Or do you intend everyone to HAVE to use a (probably very expensive) accountant or tax agent? Just because an internet service may be “available” physically doesn't mean it can actually be afforded nor accessed on a timely basis – paying hundreds of dollars a month for a part-time service is often not an economic choice, and to penalise these people for using a more efficient and quick method – no! ... There would have to be some sort of subsidy from IRD to make this work for me.... We recommend that IRD’s call centre hours are significantly extended beyond normal working hours to assist micro/ small businesses in particular with questions/queries. Have live chat available. We recommend that IRD should proceed with the development of digital services subject to: ... Specific targeted assistance to enable people without the knowledge or skills or the access to digital technology to interact digitally. If it is cheaper to collect information and payments digitally then give a discount for filing in this way – either % reduction in tax rate or fixed $ amount. This is how the private sector drives customer behaviour, so, why not here too? A number of people were against subsidies, expressing the concern that they may not effectively target the intended group, and may just subsidise software providers rather than end users: I see no need for subsidies. Subsidies would end up being subsidies for the software providers, who may be foreign- owned entities. Examples submitters gave of individuals unable to move to digital services included people who do not have access to digital technology (such as those in rural areas or in prison), the elderly, the physically or mentally impaired and those 40 The majority of people were against requiring people to move to digital services, although there was some support for making it compulsory when not using digital affected someone else – such as for employers and tax agents. I prefer the approach of providing encouragement via fees for those who impose costs on others. They could have very good reasons for not wanting to use digital services. And sometimes those reasons could be unavoidable. But if they are imposing costs on others then they should face a fee that reflects those costs. Yes, but only where it is feasible for them to use digital services. The strategy for moving reluctant taxpayers to digital should be transparent and widely communicated. Let them have their choice but discount the channel you want people to use reflecting the lower administration costs. If it is a worthwhile saving people will move if they can. The prevailing view was that forcing people to move to digital does not incentivise Inland Revenue to ensure a high quality digital service is provided – rather it forces people to use what may be a substandard service. Further, this type of behaviour may encourage some taxpayers to become non-compliant. Digital should be optional, but the benefits should be so compelling that people will adopt it by choice. No is the simple answer. You can't force people to do something just because you want to! Sounds like an abuse of power to me. Give credible alternatives and encourage their use NOT force! Yes make it an opt out system rather than opt in. Also make the registration easier please. Ensure the platform is reliable, accurate and secure – businesses and individuals will not move to digital until they have trust in the technology system. This approach does not encourage IRD management to develop and continuously improve an excellent digital service. It encourages mediocrity and forces people to use what may be a substandard service. If digital services are available but taxpayers choose not to use them, either they have been poorly designed or their benefits to the user have not been adequately communicated. Either way, the onus is on IRD to provide the incentive, not a stick, to encourage people to transition. IRD has an incentive for taxpayers to use digital (lower costs, better collection). To provide IRD with a stick to force taxpayers to transition to digital removes the incentive for IRD management to ensure the digital service is as good as it could be (effectiveness, efficiency, ease of use, lowest cost to the economy). So I advocate digital be promoted through utilisation of its potential benefits. There is already too much emphasis on penalties within the tax regime, rather than on system improvement to reduce barriers to compliance. To facilitate the move to digital, it was suggested that the holders of new IRD numbers should default automatically 41 non-digital services should be removed, and if there are any other legislative barriers that need to be addressed. Number of submissions and results of online consultation Eight written submissions and 28 online comments were received on this section. to digital services. To boost uptake even further, we support the move to a “digital by default” strategy, in particular for new customers who are starting to use a new form of interaction. A point stressed over and over by submitters is that paper filing and some form of personal interaction with Inland Revenue must remain: There should always be the option of a fully manual relationship with IRD for those that do not wish to choose to go digital. Complex interactions may be better solved over the phone rather than by email. There was a view that Inland Revenue would need to be able to provide support to customers where the digital service did not provide the answer. leGISlatIve BarrIerS The Inland Revenue Acts set out the obligations that customers and Inland Revenue must meet. Current legislation inhibits the development of digital services in some areas as it specifies the methods of communication to be used in meeting those obligations. For example, numerous sections refer to “in writing”, which naturally prevents information being transmitted by other means, including digitally. The consultation sought responses on whether the requirements for transactions to be carried out through 42 Eighty-seven people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you agree that the timing rules for digital and non-digital services should be aligned?” Ninety-five people responded to the online opinion poll question: “do you agree that legislative requirements that some transactions be carried out through non-digital services should be removed?” 18% No 13% No 14% Unsure 68% Yes, I agree that legislative requirements that some transactions be carried out through non-digital services should be removed 87% Yes the timing rules for digital and non-digital services should be aligned 43 to customers in case digital technology fails. Some mentioned that leniency should be offered to those filing by paper to account for delays in the post. Others were against this as they believed it undermines the purpose of digital, which is to be quicker and more efficient: Keep it simple – due by a date is just as it says! But if a paper version arrives a day or two late who cares? Make the due dates the same for simplicity and get on with it. Summary of comments on legislative barriers There was general agreement with removing the legislative barriers to moving to digital services, although some responses also mentioned digital should be an option rather than a requirement: We support this view, provided the customer still has the choice of interacting directly with Inland Revenue or via their tax agent. Yes, so long as the non-electronic options are not specifically banned. They should be left as options. Some submitters also suggested other potential legislative barriers to the use of digital services: The required legislative changes are likely to be more extensive than simply removing provisions requiring non- digital communication in the Inland Revenue Acts. We suggest the general record-keeping requirements in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 should also be reviewed for the continued suitability of their provisions (including their mode, location, approvals required and length of time they need to be retained) in a primarily digital services environment. The majority were in favour of the timing rules for digital and non-digital services being aligned: When digital and non-digital are aligned then it gives choices/flexibility 44 45
Technical analysis of certain related parties debt remission Prepared by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue September 2015 Introduction In February 2015, public consultation was held seeking feedback on policy proposals to address the tax consequences of related parties debt remission issues when the debtor and the creditor are either in the same wholly owned group of companies, or, in certain circumstances, when the owner, or owners, of a company or a partnership remit debt. Cabinet has now agreed to the proposals. The Minister of Revenue intends to introduce amending legislation into Parliament early next year. To provide certainty, this note provides early detail of the proposals to be included in that draft legislation. The proposals outlined here still remain subject to parliamentary process. The current asymmetric debt remission result Debt remission is the extinguishing of a liability of a debtor by operation of law or forgiveness by the creditor. The reduction of the liability is currently treated as taxable income because, like other forms of income, it increases the wealth of the debtor. This is the right tax outcome for the remissio n of most loans. This issue concerns remission (or cancellation) of a loan (a debt remission) in situations when there is no change in ownership of the debtor or net wealth of the “owner”. A debt remission within a wholly-owned group of companies is a good example of this. One company (who advanced the loan – the creditor) suffers a loss, and the other company (who borrowed the money – the debtor) has a corresponding gain but overall there is no change in the ownership of the companies or in the wealth of the owner (that is, the owner of the wholly owned group of companies, or indeed, the parent company). See example 1 in the appendix. Under present tax law, this type of remission produces taxable income to the debtor, but no tax deduction for the creditor. This asymmetric tax result overtaxes the corporate group. This outcome was commonly “managed” by issuing equity to pay the debt – the debt is capitalised instead of it being remitted or forgiven. However, a recent interpretation by Inland Revenue has indicated that debt capitalisation may sometimes be considered tax avoidance and so taxed like debt remission. This interpretation has created uncertainty among taxpayers and their advisors and has prompted officials to review the appropriate taxation of debt remission. As well as the group company scenario, other common scenarios which raise the same scenarios include: • debt remission between an overseas parent and its New Zealand subsidiary; and • shareholder or partner debt advanced to a company or partnership (including look- through companies (LTCs) and limited partnerships), is remitted or capitalised pro-rata to ownership. See example 2 in the appendix. 1 Collectively the “related parties” or “economic group” referred to in this analysis are the parties discussed immediately above. If a capitalisation of a debt advanced by a related party would not change the overall wealth of the “economic group” or the ownership of the debtor, the core policy recommendation is that, if instead the debt is remitted, the tax result should be symmetric and this should be achieved by not imposing debt remission income on the debtor. Therefore Cabinet has agreed that there should be no debt remission income for the debtor when the debtor and creditor are in the New Zealand tax base, which includes controlled foreign companies, and: • they are members of the same wholly owned group of companies; or • the debtor is a company or partnership and: - all of the relevant debt is owed to shareholders or partners in the debtor; and - if we presume that the debt remitted was instead capitalised, there would be no dilution of ownership of the debtor following the remission and all owners’ proportionate ownership of the debtor is unchanged. Inbound investment The taxation treatment when the owner/creditor is a non-resident and the debtor is New Zealand-resident was discussed but not concluded in the February 2015 issues paper. The core proposal extends to inbound debt as any alternative produces arbitrary results. Fiscal There should be no fiscal implications to agreeing to the “core proposal”. Until recently taxpayers have commonly “managed” recognising debt remission taxable income on related- party debt by using debt capitalisation instead. The proposal will allow such treatment to continue. Supporting technical issues That the “core proposals” extend to relatives of the owner The “core proposal” as above applies where the owner is the person who has advanced the debt (group companies scenarios excepted). However, in a number of situations the debt could be advanced by a relative of the owner. For example a person could advance a loan to their spouse’s company or LTC. There is no certainty of taxation outcome if that debt is later capitalised – the capitalisation could, depending on the circumstances, be tax avoidance, and be reconstructed as a debt remission. This will be explicitly clarified and the “core proposals” will apply in situations when the loan is advanced by a relative of the owner. That nominal shareholdings be ignored in applying the “core proposals” Frequently nominal holdings in a family company are held by individuals whereas the company is effectively owned by the family trust, which is also the entity that has advanced the debt that is being remitted or capitalised. The nominal holding might be to give the 2 individuals access to the shareholder/employee salary tax rules (salary not taxed at company level, but at shareholder level). Given the legal uncertainty that would arise if the debt is capitalised, to provide certainty these nominal shareholdings will be ignored when measuring ownership for the purpose of applying the “core proposals”. The Income Tax Act 2007 financial arrangement debt remission mechanism To date there has been little discussion on the detailed mechanics of how to give effect to the “core proposals” in the taxation legislation. There is a need to provide complete certainty of outcome, and, of course, protect the tax base, by specifying the amount of the loan that is deemed to be paid on remission or capitalisation. On a very similar point, the Income Tax Act provides a useful precedent for addressing satisfactorily the mechanics to satisfy the financial arrangement rules. Where debt is forgiven (remitted) for natural love and affection the debt is deemed to have been repaid in full (including any unpaid interest). This deeming for the debt remittances and capitalisations would ensure that the correct amount of tax is charged over the life of the loan (including upon a base price adjustment). The natural love and affection debt remission mechanism will be used. Other Tax Act mechanisms Debt remission will be deemed to cause “available subscribed capital” for a corporate debtor (so that it can later be returned tax free to the shareholders if appropriate). Debt capitalisation already explicitly causes this outcome, and the economics are the same. Debt remission will be deemed to increase the cost of the creditor’s investment in the debtor (with adjustments to make it work where the creditor is not also the owner (e.g. group companies)). Again debt capitalisation already explicitly causes this outcome, and again the economics are the same. Application dates There are two ways by which the “core proposals” retrospective application date (the commencement of the 2006–07 year) can be effected: • backdate the detailed proposals; or • grandparent past returns (to the end of the 2013–14 year) and apply the detailed proposals going forwards. There are arguments both ways. However, certainty and simplicity would suggest the grandparenting approach. This will also drive the application date of the technical issues.

Regulatory Impact Statement Review of child support scheme reform AGENCY DISCLOSURE STATEMENT This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The statement provides an analysis of options to change the child support scheme reforms, enacted in 2013 but not yet in force, in order to recognise the increased priority of reducing child support debt and to reduce the administrative cost of implementing the reforms. The statement reviews the child support reforms as enacted and considers whether alternative options could continue to provide the benefits the reforms seek but at a lower implementation cost. Another key consideration in the analysis is whether the reforms, and components of the reforms, reduce child support debt. The decision to introduce the child support reforms was accompanied by a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) Child support scheme reform of 26 July 2011. The earlier RIS contains background information and analysis that is useful to the options considered in this RIS, particularly the status quo. There was consultation with a range of Government agencies and significant public consultation on child support issues over a long period of time culminating in the Child Support Amendment Act 2013. However, there has been limited consultation on the subsequent options in this statement given the timing constraints on decision-making and the sensitivity of the decisions being considered. Some assumptions have been made on the number of people who may be affected by aspects of the reforms yet to come into force and the likely impact on compliance behaviour, based on existing administrative data. These assumptions impact on the analysis on the likely benefits from various options and the impact of different options on the debt book. There are no other significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. None of the policy options would restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, unduly impair private property rights or override fundamental common law principles. Some options would reduce costs on some businesses that employ parents who pay child support, although these costs were not thought to be significant and already form part of the existing P AYE processes. Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 4 June 2014 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Background 1. As at 31 March 2014, the New Zealand child support scheme was providing fmancial support for around 203,500 children. There were 134,800 receiving carers and 136,000 liable parents with current liabilities. However, there are another 43,800 liable parents who have no current liability but owe arrears. Of the liable parents, 125,000 are in debt. In the 2013/14 tax year there were around 41,000 new child support applications and around 24,000 receiving carers left the child support scheme. 2. The scheme was established by the Child Support Act 1991, which revised the rules relating to child maintenance when agreement between parents proved difficult or when the receiving parent was a beneficiary. The Child Support Act 1991 sets out the requirements for applying for child support, the means of determining liability, and processes for payments and objections. 3. The child support scheme is administered by Inland Revenue, which is responsible for both assessing contributions and collecting payments. The child support scheme is voluntary for parents unless the caregiver is receiving a sole-parent benefit or Unsupported Child Benefit. The majority of people in the child support scheme are beneficiaries. Reasons for the review of the 1991 scheme 4. Although the current child support scheme provides a relatively straightforward way of calculating child support liability for the majority of parents, there are some major concerns that seem to be affecting an increasing number of parents (and therefore children). 5. The primary assumption under the current scheme is that the paying parent is the sole income earner and that the receiving carer is the main care provider. The formula assessment is therefore focused on the paying parent and their ability to pay. However, today when parents live apart, there is an increased emphasis on shared parental responsibility and both parents remaining actively involved in their children's lives. Work participation rates of both parents, particularly in part-time work, has also increased since the scheme was introduced, resulting in the principal carer of the children now being more likely to be in paid work or seeking paid work. 6. Escalating levels of accumulated child support debt, relating in particular to child support penalties, is increasingly becoming an issue. Child support debt now exceeds $3 billion, with 75% of the amount being penalties. 7. The scheme is now, in many cases, out of date and out of line with social expectations. This undermines some parents' incentives to meet their child support obligations and therefore detrimental to the wellbeing of their children. 2 Original policy problems 8. The child support scheme was reformed in 2013 to address the main policy problems identified at the time. These included: • whether the current child support system accurately reflects the expenditure for raising children in varying family circumstances in New Zealand; • whether greater levels of shared care and other regular care should be taken into account when calculating child support; • whether both parents' income should be taken into account when calculating the child support to be paid; • whether incentives to make payments can be improved by changing the child support penalty rules and write-off provisions. 9. The main change of the 2013 reforms has been to shift the focus ofthe child support formula assessment from assessing the liability of the paying parent, to focusing on the level of support that is required from each parent for each qualifYing child. In doing so, it considers a greater range of shared care, the income of all parents of the child (including legal step-parents), and the average cost of raising the child (taking into account other children of the parents). At the same time, changes were made to the general administrative processes and rules around payments and debts to improve incentives to make timely payments. 10. More information on the background and the reasons for reviewing the 1991 scheme can be found in the earlier Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) Child support scheme reform prepared by Inland Revenue for the original reforms, dated 26 July 2011 and released November 2011 (see http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/type/ris). The RIS also considered the problems with the 1991 scheme, the consultation undertaken and analysis of the options for addressing the problems. Child Support Amendment Act 2013 11. Following consultation on a range of options, the child support scheme was amended by the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (Amendment Act). However, the reforms are yet to come into effect. 12. The Amendment Act comes into effect from different dates. The application, formula assessment and notification process is due to come into effect from 1 April 2015 (first phase of changes). These changes specifically address the first three bullet points of the original policy problems. The changes to the payment process, penalties and debt come into effect from 1 April 2016, along with other policy changes (second phase of changes) 1 . These changes specifically address the last bullet point of the original policy problems. 1 Changes to liabilities for prisoner and long-term hospital patients came into effect on I April 2014. These were small changes that required no system changes to implement. There are also transitional provisions that came into effect from date of Royal assent. 3 13. The specific reform changes are to be implemented in two phases and are set out in the box below. First Phase The first phase includes the new formula, the new assessment, the reassessment process and the issuing of notices. It concerns changes that come into effect from 1 April2015. The new formula includes: • the estimated average cost of raising children in New Zealand, which will be annually updated; • a lower level of minimum shared care, being 28% of nights (down from 40%); • the child support income of both parents, not just the liable parent; • recognising where there may be more than two parents (such as legally recognised step-parents); • recogmsmg where a parent has qualifying children in multiple relationships. The formula will continue to determine a child support income amount. The child support income includes: • a living allowance based on equivalent levels of welfare benefits, but will no longer provide an allowance for a new spouse; • a dependent child allowance. Children from a new relationship, who are not legally dependent on the parent, will no longer be included in dependent child allowances; • a multiple relationship allowance to recognise the cost of child support paid for children in other relationships; • a new simplified process for measuring taxable income if the person only has calendar year income that is withheld at source, for example, wages. There is an updated process for parents who wish to estimate their taxable income for the year, which will also apply to receiving carers who are parents. A new assessment and reassessment process is established to collect the new information required for the formula. It also sets out that receiving carers will require care levels of35% of nights to qualify to receive payments. There will be greater Commissioner discretion to recognise significant daytime care for shared care purposes, and to rely on parenting orders when establishing care levels. Notices that are issued will contain additional information reflecting the changes to the formula. 4 Second Phase The second phase of the reforms includes the changes to the payment, penalties and debt write-off rules. It also includes other policy changes. The changes in the second phase come into effect from 1 April2016, or are not required until after the end of the child support year beginning April2015. The second phase includes: 2.1 a new defmition of "adjusted net income", which includes income adjustments to taxable income, such as income in trusts and companies; 2.2 a penalty for receiving carers who are parents and who underestimate their income for the year; 2.3 reducing the maximum age of a qualifying child from under 19 to under 18, unless they are 18 and still in full-time secondary education - aligning with Working for Families age limit; 2.4 compulsory deduction of child support from employment income, unless there are grounds for an exception such as privacy or cultural reasons; 2.5 a two stage late payment penalty with an immediate 2% late penalty, with the remainder of the current 10% penalty only being charged if the debt remains unpaid after seven days; 2.6 a reduction in the ongoing monthly penalty rate from 2% to 1% after a year; 2. 7 the ability to offset current payments against past debts where the liable parent and receiving carer swap roles (that is, where the child moves to live with the other parent); 2.8 relaxing the circumstances in which penalties can be written-off, including when a liable parent enters into an instalment arrangement or is in serious hardship, when debt recovery is an inefficient use oflnland Revenue's resources or when only low levels of penalty debt are outstanding, and allowing Inland Revenue to write off assessed debt owed to the Crown on serious hardship grounds; 2.9 recognising re-establishment costs as a grounds for an administrative review; 2.10 the discretion to recognise other payments, such as payment of school fees, as qualifying as child support payments where they directly benefit the child. 14. Further detail on the 1991 scheme and the 2013 scheme and the consultation undertaken can be found on Inland Revenue's websites, including the Tax Policy website (see http://www.ird.govt.nz/childsupportD 5 Impact of the reform 15. Analysis from 2011 determined the reforms to the child support formula would have fmancial implications for some parents. Parents Unaffected Receive more I pay Receive less I pay less more Receiving parents 82,230 (60%) 24,505 (18%) 29,776 (22%) Paying parents 57,823 (42%) 45,997 (34%) 32,691 (24%) 16. Overall, it was estimated that 70,502 parents would be better off under the changes (that is, they will receive more or pay less child support) and 62,467 worse off (that is, they will receive less or pay more). 17. For the majority of parents whose child support will be affected, the change in child support received and paid was estimated as likely to be between plus or minus $66 per month (plus or minus $800 per year). That was based on rates and data held at the time and assumptions were made where data was lacking such as the number of dependent children paying parents would have. 18. For a large percentage of receiving and paying parents (60 percent and 42 percent respectively), the changes to the formula would not result in any change in the amounts received or paid. A total of 140,053 parents would be unaffected. This is because many parents would continue to either receive a sole-parent benefit (and therefore not receive child support payments directly) or continue to pay the minimum contribution because their income level is below the minimum level for child support purposes. For those who would be affected, however, the reforms would represent a more transparent and equitable result in a greater number of different circumstances. 19. Parents who qualify for the wider recognition of share care would be most affected, with paying parents likely to pay less in such cases. Problem Defmition Impact on child support debt 20. The Minister of Revenue has indicated that reducing child support debt is a priority for child support policy. Child support debt is over $3 billion and growing. 75% of the debt is related to the penalties and the vast majority is over a year old. The penalty rate is approximately 37% a year (in addition to a late penalty payment of 10%), meaning the size of the penalty debt can soon eclipse the size of the child support assessment debt. Liable parents faced with large debt amounts may be discouraged from making further payments, especially if they are on a low income. Of the penalty debt, 97% is impaired (not expected to be collected). A disproportionate amount of debt is owed by parents living overseas. 21. The Amendment Act goes some way to addressing the issue of child support debt by improving the fairness of the scheme (and therefore acceptance by paying parents). In particular, the changes to reduce the penalty rate and allow for debt write-offs will reduce debt from 2016 but are unlikely to be a full solution. Child support debt remains a problem. 6 Cost of implementation 22. The original 2011 cost estimate for the programme to implement the reforms was $30 million. As the legislation was developed and greater details on the specific changes were determined and finalised, a business case was prepared in 2012. The business case revised the estimated cost up to $120 million over the ten year period from 2011-12 to 2021-22 (costs in the latter half of the period cover ongoing depreciation, capital charges and ongoing additional staff costs to administer the modernised scheme). The increase reflected a greater appreciation of the complexity of the changes proposed by the new formula. One of the main assumptions in the business case was that the vast majority of the expenditure would be operating cost. 23. The legislation was amended during the Parliamentary process in response to both changes recommended by officials and matters raised by submitters. For example, the level of shared care at which a receiving carer would qualify for payment was increased to 35%, but 28% of care was kept as the lower threshold for the formula assessment of child support liability. This meant some work already underway had to be significantly altered, increasing the costs and time for delivery. 24. During 2013 Inland Revenue re-assessed the time and costs associated with the programme and the assumptions underlying the business case. It became clear that the work could not be implemented, to the level of quality and certainty required, by the original legislative deadline. More time was required. Also, the assumption that the majority of development costs would be operating and not capital expenditure was proving to be incorrect as the reform was implemented. Capital expenditure comes with associated depreciation costs and capital charges leading to a higher overall cost for the reforms. If the correct assumption had been made in the business case, the cost of the reforms would have been much higher than $120 million. In early 2014, the legislative deadlines were delayed a year to allow time to complete the first phase to the standards required. The revised estimate of the project, including costs from the delay and the higher ratio of capital expenditure, is now $210 million for the ten year period from 2011112 to 2020/21. The majority of the higher cost is the depreciation and capital charge associated with the capital expenditure. 25. The higher estimated cost mean the implied benefit:cost ratio for implementing the reform has changed from when the Government originally made its decision. As a result, the Minister of Revenue requested a review of the reforms in light of the revised cost estimate. The Minister also requested a greater focus on reducing the child support debt book. Assessment of Status Quo 26. The status quo option is to implement the reforms as set out in the Amendment Act. The status quo meets the original objectives and policy problems and is expected to deliver the original non-quantified benefits considered in the earlier RIS of improved fairness, a modern scheme, and greater incentives to make timely payments. Implementing the status quo will require a higher cost than anticipated - meaning a lower value for money return to the Government. 7 27. The estimated cost of implementing the whole reform is estimated at $210 million over the ten year period. While the benefits of the reform are generally intangible, it is questionable whether the Government would have agreed to implement all of the reform components at the revised total cost. 28. The overarching fiscal objective ofthe Government has been to restrain the growth in government spending, reduce deficits and return to surplus. The additional cost of implementing the status quo will impact on the Government's operating balance meaning less spending elsewhere (where the value for money proposition may be higher), greater debt or lower surplus. 29. As the reform is made up of a number of components, the value for money of individual components will vary. Most of the reform elements are expected to have a positive impact on timely payments and reducing the growth of new debt, especially the changes to penalty and debt write-off provisions. Other elements of the reform will have a small or no impact on debt. In terms of reducing debt further, other non-legislative options may have a greater impact than elements of the child support reforms, especially as non- legislative options generally on only require operating costs and no capital expenditure. 30. While the status quo addresses the original policy problem and will mostly meet the priority of reducing child support debt, it does so at a higher than expected cost, and therefore represents less value for money than originally anticipated. Consequently, the status quo is no longer supported. OBJECTIVES 31. The objectives are to: a) reduce child support debt (or at least slow the growth); b) reduce the implementation cost ofthe reforms; c) improve the fairness of the child support scheme so that it reflects social and legal changes which have occurred since its introduction in 1992; d) promote the welfare of the children, in particular by recognising that children are disadvantaged when child support is not paid, or not paid on time. 32. High levels of debt can discourage paying parents from meeting their obligations leading to non-compliance and child support not being paid on time. A more responsive system with a better targeted payment and penalties system would encourage, or at least not discourage, parents to pay their child support, reduce debt and would help improve the well- being of their children. The cost of implementing changes to make the system more responsive should be commensurate with the likely and intended benefit. 33. Reducing the implementation cost would mean not delivering some of the changes that meet the other objectives. For example, not proceeding with the changes to the penalty rates would reduce the implementation costs but would not reduce child support debt, may be considered unfair and have a negative impact on compliance, ultimately resulting in disadvantage to the child of the parent. 8 Constraints 34. The Government has previously approved funding for $120 million and authorised the department to use a further $10 million of its capital reserves. There are significant constraints on additional funding over the next few years, particularly in the 2014115 fiscal year. The Government is unlikely to authorise new funding to meet the $210 million cost of the status quo. 35. As legislation is already in place, any further changes to legislation should be enacted before the existing provisions come into force, to avoid the prospect of retrospective application. Legislative changes that impact on child support assessments are required to be in place by February for a 1 April year as notices are sent out to parents in advance. Changes to the Inland Revenue's FIRST system take time to be implemented and checked, with the minimum time dependent on the complexity and type of change. 36. Parliament is dissolved for the election period from Thursday 14 August 2014 until after the election on Saturday 20 September 2014. Parliament also tends to rise over January. The first phase of changes applies from 1 April 2015. Therefore, to avoid retrospective application, any legislation affecting the formula assessment on the first phase ofthe reforms would require urgency through at least some stages of Parliament. A higher threshold is required to be met for urgent legislation. This constrains the options that affect the first phase of the reforms. 3 7. These time constraints also impact on the ability to consult and gather information. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 38. Four major options have been considered to reduce the cost of implementing the child support reforms and slowing the growth of child support debt while continuing to address the objectives of the reform. These range from repealing the reforms and returning to the 1991 child support scheme to scaling back the scope of the child support reform package. These options are described below: Option 1 - Defer the child support reforms until Inland Revenue's Transformation programme has been completed 39. Under this option the reforms would be further amended to either delay the commencement dates by several years or to repeal the legislation and re-introduce the reforms at a later date once the Inland Revenue Business Transformation programme is completed. The Business Transformation programme is looking to improve the processes supporting the administration of the tax system, including the technology and computer systems. Part of the implementation of the child support reform underway now will be in the department's legacy FIRST system, which is expected to be replaced as part of the Transformation pro gramme. Option 2 -Repeal the child support reforms and return to the 1991 scheme on child support 40. Under this option, the reforms would be repealed entirely, with no expectation of re- introducing the reforms at a later date. Some small improvements may continue to be made to the scheme through the usual remedial programme or through the Budget process, as funds and resources allow. 9 Option 3 -Implement the first phase of the reforms and repeal the second phase of the reforms 41. Under this option, the second phase of the reforms in the Amendment Act would be repealed, but the first phase will remain and be implemented. This would mean most of the change to the formula assessment and associated processes would continue but the penalty, debt write-off and payment changes would no longer proceed. Option 4 -Implement the first phase and part of the second phase of the reforms 42. This option is the closest to the status quo. Under this option, parts of the reforms would be repealed. All of the first phase will remain and be implemented and some parts of the second phase that meet the objective of debt reduction would also be implemented. This would mean most of the change to the formula assessment and associated processes would continue as well as the penalty, and debt write-off provisions but the changes to payment options, the wider definition of income and the underestimation penalty would no longer proceed. Impact analysis of the options 43. The impacts of options one to four and the status quo option, and whether they meet the objectives in paragraph 31, are summarised in Table 1. 44. In 2011 it was determined that 60% of receiving carers and 42% of paying parents would be unaffected by the reforms in the amount of child support they are liable to pay or expect to receive. It is expected that a similar proportion of the current and future child support parents would be unaffected by the options on whether to delay, stop or proceed with the first phase of the reforms. For liable parents this is because they are on a low income and therefore are required to only pay the minimum amount of child support, whether under the old or new formula. For receiving carers who are on a welfare benefit, any child support paid is retained by the Crown to offset the cost of the benefit payments and is not passed on. The options considered in the RIS around the first phase would impact only on the remaining 40% of receiving carers and 58% of paying parents. 45. Option 1, to defer the reforms, would likewise defer the expected impact of the reforms mentioned earlier. Option 2, to repeal the reforms, would undo the expected impact on families discussed above. That is, those expecting to be better off would no longer be, and those expected to be worse off would presumably continue to receive their current levels of support. This would depend on whether the repeal alters the compliance behaviour of paying parents. It is possible that the repeal could result in some paying parents ceasing to be compliant due to perceptions of unfairness, leading to receiving carers being worse of£ 46. The status quo, options 3 and 4 would continue to implement the first phase of the reforms including the change to shared care and the formula calculation. The expected impact on families from the 2011 RIS would continue to apply. 10 4 7. Option 4 and the status quo are the options that propose to proceed with changes to debt and penalties in the second phase. Options 1, 2 and 3 would defer or repeal the second phase, and therefore the debt and penalty provisions. Around 125,000 paying parents are in debt, about 70% of paying parents. The total debt just exceeds $3 billion, an average of $24,250 per person. Around 75% of the debt is the penalty component. Of the penalty debt, about 4% relates to the late payment penalty, with the rest relates to the 2% monthly penalty rate. However, the average debt is not a good indicator of the spread of the impact of the changes. Nearly half of the 125,000 paying parents have a debt where the penalties are greater than the value ofthe assessment debt; 44% or 55,000 people. The older the debt, the higher the proportion of penalties. This smaller group will receive the greatest impact from the penalty write-off and penalty rate reductions proposed under the status quo and option 4. For example, a $1,000 missed payment after 2 years grows to $1,768 under the current rules. Under the proposed changes in the second phase, the same debt after 2 years would be $1,571, a reduction of$197 or nearly 20% ofthe original missed payment. 48. For some debtors the issue is the inability to make payments over and above current liabilities. Around 67% of domestic debtors have low incomes, around 63,500 people. Penalty debt write-offs will have a particularly positive impact on this group. 49. To the extent that the debt and penalty changes improve the timeliness ofpayments, and the payment of assessment debt by paying parents, there would be a corresponding impact on the receiving carers and their children. However, receiving carers do not receive penalty payments (75% of all debt), and receiving carers who are beneficiaries do not receive assessment debt as this is retained by the Crown. Around 25% of domestic assessed debt and around 50% of the international assessed debt is owed to receiving carers, the rest is owned to the Crown. The number of receiving carers expected to be impacted by the penalty and debt write-off changes is therefore expected to be much less than 70% of the total carers. 11 Table 1: Summary of the impacts of the options and the status quo.

The status quo of implementing the whole reforms have a higher level of ongoing administrative costs than the 1991 scheme, mostly as a result of the new, more detailed, formula assessment in the first phase of the reform. It is expected that the new formula will result in additional contacts from parents to discuss the assessment and update details. Likewise, customer calls are expected to be longer. Other aspects, such as the change in qualifying age and compulsory wage deductions, will also increase administrative costs. At the same time, some of the changes in the first and second phase are expected to reduce the level of administration through the automation of manual processes or ability to rely on existing information and call recording. The overall result for the status quo is an increase in administrative costs. This is mainly through costs associated with an increase in staff numbers. 51. Options 1 and 2 reduce the administrative costs compared to status quo as a repeal or significant delay in the new formula assessment would be expected to reduce the need for the additional staff in the near future. The positions have been filled so there would be some additional costs associated with a redundancy process. There would be some relatively small costs associated with rolling the systems back to the 1991 scheme and communicating the changes to parents. Overall Options 1 and 2 are expected to have administrative savings. 52. Option 1 seeks to defer the changes until a new business process and computer system is in place. It is intended that the new system will mean that implementation costs of changes are reduced, and the ongoing administrative costs are reduced. As a new technological solution has not yet been chosen it is not possible to determine the extent of any future administrative savings for delaying the child support reforms. 53. Options 3 and 4 retain the new formula assessment, and therefore the additional staff and associated administrative costs. Compliance impacts 54. The status quo of implementing the whole reforms have a higher level of compliance costs than the 1991 scheme, mostly as a result ofthe new, more detailed, formula assessment in the first phase of the reform. The formula assessment will now require additional information from the receiving carers, so most of the compliance costs fall on this group. Other aspects of the reforms may reduce compliance costs through providing a wider range of options for liable parents to make payments, such as qualifying payments or debt offsetting. However, the reforms will also introduce compulsory wage deductions for liable parents who have employment income. This will increase the compliance costs for employers who will be required to administer deduction notices. 55. Options 1 and 2 would reduce the compliance costs for receiving carers by removing or significantly delaying the requirement for them to provide additional information or set up compulsory wage deductions. 56. Options 3 and 4 retain the new formula assessment and therefore the additional compliance on receiving carers. They also will repeal some of the payment options proposed for liable parents. This could result in a small increase in compliance costs to make payments. 14 Option 3 will reduce the compliance costs for employers by removing the requirement for compulsory wage deductions and not replacing it with an alternative. Option 4 includes a voluntary wage deduction process, which will have compliance costs on employers if their staff request to have child support deducted from their wages. This option has lower compliance costs than the status quo, as the status quo includes a compulsory wage deduction process. A voluntary process is expected to impact on a smaller number of employers. Social, environmental or cultural impacts 57. There are no environmental or cultural impacts associated with any of the options considered above. There are social impacts from the options as they will potentially impact on the levels of fmancial support available to families with children, the timeliness of payments, and the level of debt. Some families have made financial decisions or shared care decisions on the basis of the reforms being implemented. Other risks 58. There is a risk around the timing of options 1 and 2. These will seek to repeal or change the parts of the Child Support Amendment Act that come into effect from 1 April 2015. Inland Revenue will need to amend various systems to roll back to the 1991 scheme in time for notices of assessment in February 2014. Ideally legislative change would need to be enacted 8 months to a year before the change is required to allow time to amend and test systems. However, Parliament will be dissolved between August and October 2014 and usually rises over January. Implementing these options would likely require urgent legislation and for Inland Revenue to begin system changes before the legislation has been enacted. There is a risk that either the legislation will not be enacted in time, making it retrospective, or that Inland Revenue would be unable to change systems in time, leading to incorrect assessments. 59. The current penalty rules impose a 2% a month compounding rate on defaults. This means that overall debt quickly escalates. Nearly half of all liable parents in debt have penalties higher than the assessment debt. The reforms will reduce the penalty rate to 1% after a year in default. Options 1, 2 and 3 will delay or repeal this change, meaning debt will continue to climb. Experience indicates that compliance levels fall as debt accumulates and ages, especially when penalty debt begins to exceed the core assessment. This is a risk that debt becomes unmanageable, impacting on perceptions of the scheme and ultimately the welfare ofthe children. Further analysis relating to Option 4 -completing the first phase and part of the second phase 60. In option 4 some, but not all, ofthe second phase would be implemented. This option would incorporate those aspects that have the greatest impact on debt, or which can be delivered at low cost in comparison to the other benefits expected to arise. Components that have limited benefits and significant costs or have a small impact on debt would not proceed. 61. A similar impact analysis is required on the different components ofthe second phase of the reforms to determine if they should form part of Option 4. The analysis is contained in the following table. 15 Impacts Option Meets Recommendation and net impact objectives Advantages Disadvantages Risks/Size 2.1 Keep wid er Not recommended. income definition A&C A fairer income measure.

A significant level of public consultation was undertaken on the original options for potential child support reform. There had also been consultation with a range of Government agencies on child support issues over several years. Feedback from these agencies had, wherever possible, been incorporated into the formulation of the original policy options and subsequent legislation. There was a general recognition from these agencies that the various issues with the child support scheme need to be addressed. 63. There was less opportunity to consult on the options in this RIS given the timing constraints on decision-making and the sensitivity of the changes. Treasury, the State Services Commission and the Department of Internal Affairs (in regards to the Government Chief Information Officer) were consulted. Their feedback is incorporated in the options considered. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 64. Inland Revenue supports option 4 (implement phase and part of phase 2 of the reforms). Proceeding with the first phase would provide more equitable financial support for children in a variety of circumstances. It would also better reflect many of the social and legal changes that have occurred since the introduction of the current scheme in 1991, in particular the greater emphasis on separated parents sharing the care of and fmancial responsibility for their children. 65. Inland Revenue supports some aspects of the second phase continue as enacted but that other aspects not proceed; aspects that were designed to provide general improvements to the operation of the child support scheme, particularly in regards to payments. 66. The aspects we support proceeding include the changes to the imposition of penalties, and the writing-off of penalties and debt, and a new voluntary wage deduction process to replace the proposed compulsory wage deduction process. These will encourage and facilitate parents to make timely child support payments for the benefit of their children, and to reduce debt. While these components have an implementation cost, the impact on debt across a significant number of child support parents justify the cost. 67. The associated cost of implementation is considered to exceed the expected benefits for the components we do not support proceeding. In most cases the benefits from these changes are now expected to impact on a much smaller group of parents than anticipated, and alternative existing process may exist to achieve the desired outcome, although at a higher compliance cost to those involved. 68. Overall, option 4 is recommended as it is close to the status quo in terms of the expected benefits to be delivered by the reforms, especially in relation to debt reduction, but at a significantly reduced implementation cost. 18 Summary of changes that are proceeding or not proceeding First Phase All aspects to proceed as enacted. Second Phase It is recommended that the following aspects continue: 2.3 reducing the maximum age of a qualifying child from under 19 to under 18, unless they are 18 and still in full-time secondary education-aligning with Working for Families age limit; 2.5 a two stage late payment penalty with an immediate 2% late penalty, with the remainder of the current 10% penalty only being charged if the debt remains unpaid after seven days; 2.6 a reduction in the ongoing monthly penalty rate from 2% to 1% after a year; 2.8 relaxing the circumstances in which penalties can be written-off, including when a liable parent enters into an instalment arrangement or is in serious hardship, when debt recovery is an inefficient use oflnland Revenue's resources or when only low levels of penalty debt are outstanding, and allowing Inland Revenue to write off assessed debt owed to the Crown on serious hardship grounds; 2.9 recognising re-establishment costs as a grounds for an administrative review; It is recommended that a new voluntary wage deduction be introduced. It is recommended that the following aspects no longer proceed: 2.1 a new definition of "adjusted net income", which includes income adjustments to taxable income, such as income in trusts and companies; 2.2 a penalty for receiving carers who are parents and who underestimate their income for the year; 2.4 compulsory deduction of child support from employment income, unless there are grounds for an exception such as privacy or cultural reasons; 2. 7 the ability to offset current payments against past debts where the liable parent and receiving carer swap roles (that is, where the child moves to live with the other parent); 2.10 the discretion to recognise other payments, such as payment of school fees, as qualifying as child support payments where they directly benefit the child. 69. The total implementation cost ofthe recommended option is estimated at $163 million over the ten year period. 70. The components that do not proceed could be reconsidered in the future if the implementation costs can be reduced as part of, or following, the Business Transformation programme. 19 IMPLEMENTATION 71. Changes to the child support reform programme would require amendments to the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 and to any consequential provisions in other legislation. These amendments would be required before 1 April 2016, when the second phase comes into effect, and ideally before January 2016 as notices of assessments and communication with child support parents are usually issued in February each year. 72. The legislative amendments could be introduced as a stand-alone bill or may form part of a taxation omnibus bill. The next taxation bill is expected to be introduced after the 2014 election is concluded. 73. The scope of the child support reform implementation pro gramme will be amended in accordance with Cabinet decisions and legislation. The programme will re-plan delivery of the remaining aspects of the reform accordingly, including any new performance indicators required. The child support reform implementation programme was subject to an independent review to determine why it was unable to deliver to the original timeframes. The recommendations of the review have been accepted and are being incorporated into the programme management to ensure the implementation of the revised reforms can be delivered on time. 74. Once implemented, Inland Revenue will enforce the new legislation as part of its usual business operations. 75. There is a risk that child support families will be confused about what the revised reforms mean for them. Communications will be prepared for child support families and key stakeholders to ensure they understand the changes. Inland Revenue websites will be updated, and an article included in a Tax Information Bulletin. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 76. A programme governance group will oversee the implementation of the changes to ensure the legislative changes are delivered correctly. The changes, once implemented, will be monitored by senior managers to ensure they achieve the objectives. Any issues will be raised through Inland Revenue's internal processes. Complaints and correspondence will also be analysed to identify any issues with the new legislation or the implementation. 77. In accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP), the legislation will be reviewed and remedial changes may be included on a future tax policy work programme, subject to resources and priority. 78. In general, Inland Revenue's monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the GTPP: a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP contemplates the implementation and review stage, which can involve post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 20
Regulatory Impact Statement Black hole tax treatment of research and development expenditure Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to address the problems with the cunent "black hole" tax treatment of certain research and development (R&D) expenditure. Generally, business taxpayers will try to reduce their income tax liability by claiming deductions for business expenditure, wherever possible, against their assessable income. "Black hole" expenditure is business expenditure that is not immediately deductible for tax purposes, and also does not fonn part of the cost of a depreciable asset for tax purposes and, therefore, cannot be deducted over time as depreciation. Black hole tax treatment of expenditure can produce economic dist01iions. A taxpayer may choose to invest in an area where they can deduct or depreciate their expenditure instead of investing in an area where they cammt. lf investing in the area that receives black hole tax treatment would have been the most efficient choice in the absence oftaxation, the taxpayer's investment decision has been distorted by tax settings. The prefened option would reduce these dist01iions, by allowing capitalised R&D expenditure to be either depreciated or deducted, depending on the pruiicular circumstances. Initial proposals to provide tax deductibility for capitalised R&D expenditure were consulted on via the release of a Govenunent discussion document on 7 November 2013. The discussion document proposed making capitalised development expenditure that creates an intangible asset with a reasonably ce1iain useful life part of the depreciable costs of the asset. Submitters generally accepted that this was the appropriate way to treat this expenditure. The discussion document also proposed allowing a deduction for capitalised R&D expenditure towards an unsuccessful intangible asset with a reasonably certain useful life when the asset is written off for accounting purposes. This proposal would have meant capitalised R&D expenditure towards intangible assets with uncertain useful lives would have remained non-deductible. A number of submitters were concerned that this would leave a significant category of capitalised R&D expenditure still never being deductible for tax purposes, and that this was not the appropriate treatment of expenditure on intangible assets with indefinite but finite useful lives. After consideration of this feedback, the proposals were altered to also make these costs deductible when the asset is written off for accounting purposes. The Treasury and the Ministry of Business, ltmovation and Employment were involved in the policy development of the options discussed in tl'lis RIS, and they agree with the conclusions and reconunendations made. There is some uncertainty around the estimated fiscal costs of the options, as significant assumptions were made in developing fiscal cost estimates, due to lack of source data and limited relevant additional information provided by submitters. There are no other significant constraints, caveats or uncetiainties concerning the analysis undertaken. The prefened option and the other alternative policy options will impose some additional compliance costs on businesses that wish to avail themselves of the proposed increased allowance of tax deductions for R&D expenditure. However, businesses would only incur these additional compliance costs in cases where they consider that the benefit to them of the increased allowance of deductions outweighs the costs. None of the policy options would impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. ;lr( ~~tVL1 Mike Nutsford Policy Manage P bey and Strategy Inland Revenue 27 March 2014 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Current tax rules 1. "Black hole" expenditure is business expenditure that is not ilmnediately deductible for tax purposes, and also does not form part of the cost of a depreciable asset for tax purposes and, therefore, cannot be deducted over time as depreciation. 2. Under current tax rules, a person is allowed an immediate deduction for expenditure they incur on research or development up until an intangible asset is recognised for accounting purposes. Further development expenditure is capitalised. 3. Capitalised development expenditure can only be depreciated (that is, deducted over the life of an asset) for tax purposes once there is "depreciable property" under the Income Tax Act 2007 (IT A). Expenditure on intangible property may only be depreciated if the intangible property is listed in schedule 14 of the IT A, which lists items of "depreciable intangible property". For an item of property to be listed in schedule 14, it must be intangible and have a fmite useful life that can be estilnated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition. 4. In the event that a research and development (R&D) project does not create a depreciable asset for tax purposes, the development expenditure that has been capitalised will be rendered non-deductible, either immediately or over a period of time. This includes capitalised development expenditure on assets that are completely unsuccessful, as well as intangible assets that are useful but are not listed in schedule 14. 5. Moreover, even if the project does create an asset that is listed in schedule 14, capitalised development expenditure incurred in creating the asset may still be rendered non- deductible, either immediately or over a period of tilne. As explained in paragraphs 6 and 7 below, this may occur because, although the expenditure has given rise to an asset that is depreciable for tax purposes, the depreciable costs of the asset have been interpreted to exclude development expenditure. 6. An i11terpretation statement issued by Inland Revenue takes the view that the depreciable patent costs (for a taxpayer who has lodged a patent application with a complete specification or had a patent for an invention granted) are limited to the administrative and legal fees incurred in the patent process.' According to Inland Revenue's view of the law, capitalised development expenditure relating to the invention that is the subject of the patent (or patent application) is potentially neither deductible nor depreciable for tax purposes. 7. Although the interpretation statement is confined to patents, it is likely that the depreciable costs of plant variety rights would be interpreted in the same way, given that they are both types of intellectual property rights obtained by registration following an R&D process. 1 Interpretation statement "Income tax treatment of New Zealand patents", Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 7 (August 2006), p 51. 3 The problem 8. Black hole tax treatment of expenditure can produce economic distortions. A taxpayer may choose to invest in an area where they can deduct or depreciate their expenditure instead of investing in an area where they cannot. If investing in the area that receives black hole tax treatment would have been the most efficient choice in the absence oftaxation, the taxpayer's investment decision has been distorted by tax settings. 9. The scale of the problem cannot be quantified with any degree of precision, as we do not have direct information on what projects would have been undertaken in the absence of taxation. The vast majority of R&D expenditure is already immediately tax deductible. However, there is still room for improvement. OBJECTIVES 10. The objectives against which the options are to be assessed are to: (a) ensure economic efficiency by ensuring that, as far as possible, investment decisions are not distorted by tax considerations; (b) provide certainty about the tax treatment of particular expenditures; (c) minimise compliance costs for taxpayers; and (d) ensure the coherency, consistency and integrity of the overall tax system. 11. Objective (a) is the key objective in this analysis because the aim of the review is to reduce the cases where tax rules may be discouraging R&D investments that would be undertaken in the absence of taxation. We recognise that there are likely to be trade-offs between these tax policy objectives. For example, the preferred option minimises economic distortions but will involve some compliance costs to ensure the integrity of the tax system. 12. It is also necessary to consider the Government's Business Growth Agenda (BGA), which emphasises the importance of building innovation to help grow New Zealand's economy. "Encouraging business innovation" is one of the seven key initiatives of the Building Innovation work stream, which recognises that enabling R&D is a key element in the innovation process. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 13. Several options have been considered for addressing the problem and achieving the stated objectives. These options are set out below. Option one 14. Option one is to retain the status quo. Under the status quo, capitalised development expenditure will continue to be neither deductible nor depreciable for tax purposes. 4 Option two 15. Option two is to allow failed capitalised de velopment expenditure, which the taxpayer intended would lead to an item of "depreciable intangible property'', to be depreciated over the estimated useful life ofthe asset the development expenditure was intended to create. Option three 16. Option three is to allow an immediate deduction for failed capitalised development expenditure, which the taxpayer intended would lead to an item of "depreciable intangible property", upon the intangible asset being written off for accounting purposes. Option four (preferred option) 17. Option four is to allow a one-offtax deduction for capitalised development expenditure upon the intangible asset to which it relates being written off for accounting purposes, for taxpayers who have developed intangible assets that are not depreciable for tax purposes. This would apply irrespective of whether the asset was useful for a period or a completely unsuccessful investment. Option five 18. Option five is to allow capitalised development expenditure that creates an intangible asset with an uncertain useful life to be depreciated over a given period of time. This would apply irrespective of whether the asset was useful for a period or a completely unsuccessful investment. Option six 19. Option six is to: • allow capitalised development expenditure that creates a useful intangible asset with an uncertain useful life to be depreciated over a given period of time; and • allow an immediate deduction for capitalised development expenditure that gives rise to a completely unsuccessful intangible asset upon the asset being written off for accounting purposes. Further proposals 20. Additionally, each of options two to six, would allow capitalised development expenditure that creates an intangible asset with a useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty at the time of its creation to be depreciated over that life. 21. As an integrity measure, each of options two to six would also involve the introduction of appropriate claw-back rules (outlined below). 22. In the event that an intangible asset that has been written off for accounting purposes becomes useful, it is proposed that any capitalised development expenditure previously allowed as a tax deduction would be clawed back as income. The clawed-back amount would then be able to be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset, if the asset is depreciable. 5 23. In the event that an intangible asset that has been written off for accounting purposes is sold, it is proposed that any capitalised development expenditure previously allowed as a tax deduction (or the sale proceeds, if this amount is lower) would be clawed back as income. Impacts of options 24. The table below summarises the impacts of each of the options. 6 Table 1: Impacts of the options Meets Impacts Option objectives?

The fiscal cost estimates should be treated with some caution. Due to lack of source data and limited relevant additional information provided by submitters, significant assumptions were made in developing them, for example: • the stock of capitalised R&D expenditure; • the percentage of capitalised R&D expenditure that will be depreciated; and • the R&D failure rate. 26. Inland Revenue has carried out sensitivity analysis around some ofthe assumptions and the fiscal costs do not vary materially. Compliance costs 27. The proposed changes are taxpayer-friendly, but will impose some additional compliance costs on businesses that wish to avail themselves of the proposed increased allowance of tax deductions for R&D expenditure. These additional compliance costs are associated with: • complying with a higher accounting standard than the new minimum requirements; 2 • claiming a deduction for expenditure that previously would have been non-deductible; and • application of the proposed claw-back rules for written off assets that become useful or are sold. 28. However, these additional compliance costs would only be imposed on those businesses that wish to avail themselves of the proposed increased allowance oftax deductions for R&D expenditure. Therefore, businesses would only incur these additional compliance costs in cases where they consider that the benefit to them of the increased allowance of deductions outweighs the costs. Furthermore, we consider that the proposed claw-back rules are important integrity measures which would not be expected to often require application. Social, environmental or cultural impacts 29. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with any of the options considered above. Net impact of all options 30. The preferred option (option four) addresses the problem by reducing the cases where tax rules could discourage R&D investments that would be undertaken in the absence of taxation. It also achieves all of the stated objectives. 2 We note that, when the Financial Reporting Act 2013 comes into effect on 1 April 2014, minimum financial reporting requirements will be reduced for many businesses. The cuiTent tax provisions that allow a tax deduction for R&D expenditure, and the proposal to allow a tax deduction for taxpayers who have developed intangible assets that are not depreciable for tax purposes, are linked to particular accounting standards. 10 31. Inland Revenue does not support options one, two, five and six because they do not fully address the problem and fail to achieve some or all of the stated objectives. We originally preferred option three (the discussion document's proposal) but after consideration ofthe feedback received, and further analysis ofthat option, it is no longer preferred. CONSULTATION 32. Public consultation was carried out via the release of a consultation document, Black hole R&D exp enditure : a government discussion document, on 7 November 2013. 33. The proposals in the discussion document were essentially option three in the above regulatory impact analysis. 34. Twelve submissions were received in relation to the discussion document. The submissions were generally supportive of the intent of the proposals to relieve black hole R&D expenditure. However, many submitters were concerned that the initial proposals would still leave a significant category of capitalised development expenditure never being deductible for tax purposes. These submitters argued that this was not the appropriate treatment of expenditure on intangible assets with indefinite but fmite useful lives. These submitters wanted the scope of the proposals widened to provide tax deductibility for - both successful and unsuccessful - capitalised development expenditure towards intangible assets that are not listed in schedule 14 of the IT A. 35. While it would be inappropriate, from an economic perspective, to allow tax deductibility for expenditure towards creating an asset that would not have been likely to have a finite life if successful, we recognise that technology tends to move at a relatively fast pace and that it is likely that R&D-generated assets will have limited lives, even if those lives are not capable of being estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty at the time of the asset's creation. We were therefore sympathetic towards the submitters' concern. 36. In order to respond to this concern, we considered alternative options that would eliminate black hole R&D expenditure on a prospective basis. This led us to alter the proposals, arriving at option four as our preferred option. 37. The Treasury and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment have been consulted and agree with our conclusions and recommendations. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 38. We recommend: • allowing capitalised development expenditure that creates an intangible asset with a useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty at the time of its creation to be depreciated over that life; and • allowing a one-off tax deduction for capitalised development expenditure upon the intangible asset to which it relates being written off for accounting purposes, for taxpayers who have developed intangible assets that are not depreciable for tax 11 purposes. This would apply irrespective of whether the asset was useful for a period or a completely unsuccessful investment; and • introducing appropriate claw-back rules that would apply when an intangible asset that has been written off for accounting purposes becomes useful or is sold. 39. The proposals would enable all capitalised R&D expenditure to be deducted (thereby providing certainty of tax treatment) and would reduce the cases where tax rules discourage R&D investments that would be undertaken in the absence of taxation, but without potentially providing a tax-subsidy to investment in R&D-generated intangible assets with uncertain useful lives. 40. The proposed tax treatment of successful capitalised development expenditure on intangible assets with reasonably certain useful lives is consistent with the usual tax treatment of capitalised expenditure that has created a depreciable asset. 41. The proposed tax treatment of failed capitalised development expenditure is consistent with the usual tax treatment of failed capitalised expenditure. While the proposed tax treatment of capitalised development expenditure that creates useful assets with uncertain useful lives is unusual, it has the effect of restricting deductions to cases where it is clear that the expenditure is of no on-going value. For this reason, we prefer it to depreciating the expenditure over a given period of time, which will inevitably be too short in some cases (implying a tax-subsidy) and too long in others. As technology tends to move at a relatively fast pace, it is likely that R&D-generated assets will have limited useful lives, even if those lives are not capable of being estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty at the time of the asset's creation. Therefore, the proposed treatment improves upon the status quo, as not allowing any deduction for expenditure that has created an asset with a fmite useful life is inappropriate. 42. While there may be some additional compliance costs (as compared to the status quo) in order to get a deduction, taxpayers will only incur these additional costs where they consider that the benefit to them of the increased allowance of deductions outweighs the costs. The preferred option minimises these compliance costs by allowing a one-off tax deduction for capitalised development expenditure rather than requiring taxpayers to depreciate failed expenditure or successful expenditure on assets with uncertain useful lives over time. IMPLEMENTATION Transitional approach 43. We considered three options (set out in the table below) for transitloning to the proposed new rules. We note that most of these options are linked in some way to the date of release of the discussion document (that is, 7 November 2013). The reason why this date was chosen, as opposed to a prospective date, is that this latter alternative may have created an undesirable incentive for taxpayers to defer their R&D spending in anticipation of the proposed new rules. 12 Table 2: Transitional options Option 1 Option 2 Option 3 (preferred option) All capitalised R&D In addition to allowing all expenditure (whenever capitalised R&D Only capitalised R&D incurred) relating to expenditure (whenever R&D that creates a expenditure incurred from assets created (that is , incurred) on new assets to depreciable intangible 7 November 2013 would recognised for tax be depreciated, pro-rated asset be eligible for purposes) from 7 depreciation deductions would be allowed for depreciation deductions.

Analysis of options 44. Option 1 only gives deductions for new R&D expenditure, whereas options 2 and 3 would give windfall gains to those who have incurred sunk costs in developing assets. Therefore, option 1 is the most targeted of the three options, with options 2 and 3 providing increasing recognition that the status quo is a poor outcome under tax policy frameworks through providing relief from black hole expenditure on an increasingly wider ambit of historical R&D expenditure. 45. Although option 3 would allow the widest ambit of depreciable expenditure, there would be higher compliance costs associated with apportionment and integrity issues in relation to old documentation of costs. Option 1 could have slightly higher compliance costs than option 2, associated with the need to go back and attribute expenditure to pre-and post-7 November 2013. 46. The annual fiscal cost of all three options would eventually converge. However, over the short to medium term, option 1 would be the least fiscally expensive, and option 3 would be the most fiscally expensive. 47. Options 2 and 3 offer an additional benefit in that they would reduce the bias that those who have incurred sunk costs developing an asset have towards selling the resulting asset over continuing to hold it. This bias exists because, currently, a purchaser of one of these assets can depreciate the entire purchase cost, which means that such assets are potentially more valuable to purchasers than to the person who has developed them. 13 Preferred transitional approach -conclusion 48. We prefer option 1, which only gives deductions for new R&D expenditure, because the fiscal cost incurred as a result of the proposed changes would be more closely aligned with the Government's objective of increasing new business R&D. 49. Options 2 and 3 would give windfall gains to those who made an economic decision to proceed with developing an asset in the expectation that development expenditure incurred from the point of asset recognition for accounting purposes would be neither immediately deductible nor depreciable. These options are estimated to be considerably more fiscally expensive over the short to medium term, but would provide limited additional benefit in reducing the bias that those who have incurred sunk costs developing an asset have towards selling the resulting asset over continuing to hold it. Further implementation details 50. If approved, the proposals will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. These changes would be included in the next available taxation bill after Budget 2014 and take effect from the 2015/ 16 income year. 51. When introduced to Parliament, commentary will be released explaining the amendments, and further explanation of their effect will be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. 52. The proposals would have no systems implications for Inland Revenue but may result in some additional administrative costs, such as costs associated with publications to communicate the changes. These costs are expected to be insignificant and would be met within existing baselines. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 53. In general, Inland Revenue's monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The fmal stage in the GTPP contemplates the implementation and review stage, which can involve post- implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 14
Regulatory Impact Statement Calculating the fringe benefit arising from employment-related loans Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options for a remedial change to widen the group of employers who are eligible to use the market interest rate method of determining the fringe benefit arising from an employment-related loan. The issue arose out of concerns that some subsidiaries within banking groups could not use the method, even though the parent could. This leads to the subsidiaries overpaying fringe benefit tax, compared to the parent bank. The proposed change is consistent with the key objective as per the original policy intention, which was to ensure that persons who are able to easily determine the market interest rate on comparable loans to third parties can use the market interest rate method. A second objective was to ensure that tax considerations did not impact on economic efficiency. While our understanding is that only a limited number of organisations will be affected by the change, limitations on the available fiscal data have constrained the analysis. Estimates of the fiscal costs ($720,000 per annum) and other costs have relied on an extrapolation of industry provided figures, combined with the use of Inland Revenue's available information. Limited targeted consultation was undertaken. The New Zealand Bankers' Association brought the issue to Inland Revenue's attention, and wider consultation was not undertaken, due to the narrow, technical nature of their issue, the fact that they represent a large number of the affected persons, and the potential to address the issue promptly through an up- coming bill. Widening the group of entities eligible to use the market interest rate is unlikely to impose additional costs on businesses, particularly given that the use of the method is voluntary. Businesses that choose not to use the method may continue to use the prescribed rate, as set by regulation. None of the policy options impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. Marie Pallot Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 10 October 2014 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Fringe benefits 1. Remuneration received by a person in exchange for providing employment services is taxable. To prevent erosion of the tax base at the margins, certain non-monetary benefits provided by employers to their employees are also taxed, as fringe benefits. Fringe benefit tax (FBT) helps to ensure neutrality between paying employees in cash and in kind. One kind of fringe benefit that may be provided by an employer is a discounted loan. 2. Where an employer provides an employee with a loan with terms that are more favourable than the terms that the employee would be able to obtain from a third party, a fringe benefit arises. The amount ofthe fringe benefit is the additional amount of interest that would have been payable for a loan with similar terms, compared to the amount actually paid under the terms of the loan. Tax treatment of employment-related loans 3. There are two methods that may be used to calculate the fringe benefit arising from an employment related loan. Most employers use the prescribed rate method to determine the amount of the fringe benefit that arises. The prescribed interest rate is set by regulation, with reference to the prevailing variable first-mortgage housing rate determined by Reserve Bank survey. This ensures that the prescribed rate is in line with market rates. 4. In some cases, the prescribed rate will exceed the rate that a third party lender would offer an individual. This is because the prescribed rate is determined based on publicly advertised interest rates for first mortgages. However, many individuals can negotiate a lower rate than the advertised rate for this type ofborrowing. 5. Since 2006, persons in the business of lending money to the public (generally, financial institutions such as banks) have been able to elect to use the market interest rates to determine the fringe benefit that arises in relation to an employment-related loan, as an alternative to the prescribed rate method. The relevant market rate is the interest rate that would apply to a loan of the same kind, provided to a borrower belonging to a group of persons with comparable credit risk to the employee, dealing on an arm's length basis. 6. Employers who are not in the business of lending money to the public are not able to use the market interest rate method to value the fringe benefit from a loan, as they are not expected to have systems in place to monitor market rates without incurring undue compliance costs. In contrast, lenders will have these systems. 7. Where an employer who is in the business of lending money to the public elects to use the market interest rate method in relation to a loan, they are required to notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at least one year before the income year in which they will frrst apply the method, and must apply the method for at least two income years. This requirement is to prevent persons from switching between methods, to gain an advantage. 2 Problem defmition 8. The banking sector has found that the focus solely on the business of the employer has created issues in practice. A company may provide fringe benefits to the employees of other companies within the same group. In the case of a financial institution, the benefit may be a loan. However, the FBT rules treat the employees' employer as providing this benefit, so they may only use the market interest rate method to value the benefit if they are a lender themselves. 9. In practice groups of companies will share information among the members, and a financial institution within a group of companies can provide the information necessary to determine the market interest rate to other companies within the group. These companies form a readily identifiable class of employers who may be able to easily apply the market interest rate method, and may be treated as an extension of the policy that persons in the business of lending money to the public can apply the method. 10. The consequence ofthe status quo may be a higher FBT liability for the employer, and more FBT revenue for the Government. The status quo also creates some concerns regarding economic efficiency, as it encourages employing personnel through the lender(s) within the group, over other companies in the group that do not lend money to the public. 11. This may lead to tax considerations affecting decisions around which entity to employ persons through. This is particularly so for wholly owned groups, which function as a single economic unit, and who may otherwise be indifferent between separating certain (non- lending) functions into other companies or retaining them within the company which is lending. OBJECTIVES 12. The objectives of the proposed change are to: (a) ensure that persons who are able to easily determine the market interest rate of an employment-related loan can use the market interest rate method to determine their FBT liability; (b) maximise economic efficiency; and (c) minimise compliance costs. 13. One ofthe key features of the current rules for taxing employment-related loans is that persons do not incur undue compliance costs. Consistent with this policy choice, allowing a wider group of persons to apply the market interest rate method should not be pursued at the expense of increased compliance and administrative costs. Ensuring that persons who are able to easily determine the market interest rate of an employment-related loan may use the market interest rate method is consistent with limited compliance implications. 14. Maximising economic efficiency is a secondary consideration. The identified efficiency concern results from hiring decisions within groups which include a lender. Achieving this objective is likely to follow from widening the group of persons who may apply the market interest rate method, to include those associated with fmancial institutions. 3 REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 15. Two options have been identified to address the problem and meet the stated objectives, along with the status quo: • Option one: Employers who are a member of a wholly owned group of companies (which includes a person in the business of lending to the public) may use the market interest rate method. • Option two: Employers who are a member of a group of companies (which includes a person in the business of lending to the public) may use the market interest rate method. • Option three: Only employers who are in the business of lending to the public may use the market interest rate method (status quo). Groups of employers 16. The Income Tax Act 2007 provides rules for grouping companies which share common ownership. The test looks at the ownership of the companies and the extent to which the same owners have the same interest in each company. 17. For a company to be part of the same group of companies as another company, the same person or persons must generally have common voting interests of at least 66%. A person has a common voting interest where they own voting rights in both companies. 18. For a company to be part of the same wholly owned group of companies the common voting interest required is 100%. Therefore, a person who is in the same wholly owned group of companies as another person will always also be within the same group of companies as that person. 4 Meets Impacts Option objectives Fiscal/economic impact Administrative and Risks Net impact compliance impacts One a, band c Tax system Fiscal cost of approximately Minimal additional Minimal.

Option one is likely to have a fiscal cost of approximately $720,000 p.a. This represents a decrease in FBT of $1 million p.a. However, since FBT is deductible for the employer, there will be a corresponding increase in company tax by $280,000. The fiscal cost is based upon an extrapolation of information provided by the banking sector, for groups of companies. The reduced revenue will translate to a benefit for the affected employers, whose FBT liability has decreased by a corresponding amount. 20. The cost of Option two is expected to be largely similar to that of Option one (approx. $720,000 per annum) on the basis that most ofthe FBT effect is attributable to entities within the narrower wholly owned group. However, the wider coverage could be more relevant in the future, for example if a wholly owned subsidiary of a bank was to be partially sold. 21. The reduction in revenue arises because the market interest rate method and the prescribed rate method ascribe different values to the loan, with the prescribed rate method generally calculating a slightly greater benefit. 22. In both Option one and Option two there is a potential efficiency gain as the FBT outcome will no longer potentially impact on placement of employees within the group. The potential gain is greater for Option two, as it applies to a wider group; however this may be partially offset by the fact that employment through the financial institution or a company within the same wholly owned group is likely to be more substitutable than between the fmancial institution and the group companies which are not wholly owned. Social, environmental or cultural impacts 23. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with any of the options. Net impact 24. Option one achieves all three stated objectives. It expands the group of persons able to apply the market interest rate method to a slightly wider group of taxpayers who could be expected to easily apply the method, without posing significant risk. 25. Option two is similar to Option one, in that it meets all three of the stated objectives. However, Option two expands eligibility, and increases economic efficiency for to a slightly wider group of persons than Option one. 26. Option three presents no changes. CONSULTATION 27. Limited targeted consultation was undertaken. The New Zealand Bankers' Association (NZBA) advocated for members of groups of companies (common ownership of 66% or more) which include a lender to be able to apply the market interest rate method. The NZBA strongly supported this threshold, as some entities associated with its members are not wholly owned, but have minority interests. In support of their submission, they cited the fact that group companies would have the same information available as the lender, and identified 7 concerns that the status quo could lead to tax-induced biases in employing staff through lenders, where normal commercial considerations may favour other entities. 28. Wider consultation was not undertaken, in the interest of responding to this identified concern in as timely a manner as possible. This was seen as a potential opportunity for an incremental change consistent with the established policy. It was also seen as taxpayer- friendly and low-risk, and could be included in the upcoming taxation omnibus Bill, to secure prompt benefit for those affected. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 29. Option one benefits employers within the same wholly owned group of companies as a lender. Extending eligibility to apply the market interest rate method to these employers poses little risk as they are expected to be able to easily apply the method correctly. The exact cost of this option is estimated at approximately $720,000 p.a. 30. Option two benefits a slightly wider group of employers, those within the same group of companies as a lender. This necessarily includes all the persons affected by Option One and will affect a number of additional banking group companies which have minority shareholders. This option provides greater flexibility for the future. 31. Extending eligibility to these employers likewise poses little risk. This option is expected to have a fiscal cost to the government, and a corresponding benefit to the affected employers largely similar to that of Option one (approximately $720,000 p.a). 32. Either of these options would potentially result in an efficiency gain, as FBT outcomes would not affect hiring decisions within the affected group. 33. Inland Revenue's preferred approach is Option two: allowing employers in the same group of companies as a lender to apply the market interest rate method, on the basis that it better meets the first objective, by enabling a wider group ofpersons who could easily apply the market interest rate method to do so. Group companies should still have access to the necessary information, and the potentially wider approach does not seem to pose any additional risk. Several other provisions in the FBT rules are based on whether companies are within the same group. IMPLEMENTATION 34. Both Option one and Option two would require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow the groups of affected employers to use the rules. Option three (the status quo) does not require any changes to implement. 35. An amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 could be included in the tax bill scheduled for introduction in November 2014. Legislative amendments could apply from the date the Bill receives Royal assent. 36. The current legislation imposes requirements on a person who wishes to use the market interest rate method - they must notify the Commissioner at least one year before the income year in which they wish to use the method. They must then use the method for that and the following income year, to avoid flip-flopping. This would mean that, for an amendment Act 8 receiving assent in 2015, taxpayers with standard balance dates could give notice before 1 April2016, and begin applying the method from 1 April2017. 37. To facilitate adoption ofthe method, affected employers could be temporarily given the opportunity to elect to apply the method from the FBT quarter following the election. To integrate this with the requirement that the person apply the method for two income years, where this does not correspond with the start of an income year, the part of an income year where the rules are applied could be treated as a full income year. Such an exception to the ordinary rule is unlikely to lead to flip-flopping. 38. Implementation is not expected to lead to compliance costs for the affected employers. 39. Ifthe amendment is made, it would be publicised through inclusion in the commentary to the implementing bill. Inland Revenue would also include the item in a Tax Information Bulletin once the bill received Royal assent. 40. Inland Revenue would administer the changed rules through the ordinary business processes. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 41. There are no plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes after they become law. This is because the remedial change is consistent with the policy underlying the rules. If any specific concerns are raised, officials will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process. Also, the Income Tax Act 2007 is subject to regular review by officials. As per the normal process, there will be an opportunity for submissions to be made on the proposed changes during the select committee stage of the tax bill that any legislative change is contained in. 9
Regulatory Impact Statement Bodies corporate GST obligations This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to determine the appropriate GST treatment of bodies corporate. This is the second RIS that considers the GST treatment of bodies corporate; the first was prepared on 28 March 2014. This analysis follows submissions received on the discussion document GST Treatment of Bodies Corporate released on 6 June 2014, which sought public feedback on the approach preferred under the previous RIS (option 2 in this RIS). As a result of feedback received on the discussion document, the preferred option has changed to being option 4 (optional approach). There are four key constraints I caveats on the analysis: 1. Because of data limitations it is not possible to determine exactly how many bodies corporate are currently registered for GST, or would be required to register because they exceed the $60,000 registration threshold. (This threshold is made up of levies received by unit owners but could also be made up of sales of goods and services to third parties). 2. Again because of data limitations it is not usually possible for Inland Revenue to identify whether a GST return is from a body corporate. This means we have incomplete information on the number of bodies corporate which may have taken a tax position to claim input tax deductions in respect of leaky building repairs. 3. The estimate of the potential fiscal cost of refunds for leaky buildings is uncertain as it is based on a 2009 PricewaterhouseCoopers estimate of the costs associated with fixing weathertightness problems in multi-unit dwellings. 4. The estimate of the potential fiscal cost of cashing out reserves if all bodies corporate were to be deregistered is uncertain again due to data limitations. The estimate is based on an assumption about the average level of cash reserves held by registered bodies corporate. A range of options has been considered and measured against the objectives of providing certainty, consistency and fairness ofGST treatment whilst minimising compliance costs and disruption to current practices. There are no environmental or cultural impacts from these recommended changes. There are no other significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning this regulatory impact analysis other than those noted above. None of the policy options would restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, unduly impair private property rights or override fundamental common law principles. Marie Pallot Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 25 November 2014 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Background Bodies corporate 1. The GST system requires businesses and other entities to register for GST if they supply goods or services worth more than $60,000 in a 12-month period. Generally, GST -registered persons are required to file GST returns and pay GST on the majority of the goods and services they supply. In simple terms, the amount of GST that they pay is based on the value of these supplies less the GST cost of any inputs that they purchase from other GST registered persons. In this respect the GST system only taxes the "value added" by each business in a supply chain. 2. A body corporate is a legal entity created under the Unit Titles Act 2010 1 when multiple owners have unit title properties in an apartment building or similar complex. The body corporate is made up of all of the property owners and provides a way for the owners to act together with regard to their common and shared interests. Because bodies corporate always intend to spend all of their money, they are, in the ordinary course of events, largely tax neutral over time. Historic position 3. Currently, most bodies corporate (ofwhich there are approximately 13,800 in total) are not registered for GST and Inland Revenue's historic position has been to not allow bodies corporate to register. A High Court decision in Taupo Jka Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) appeared to support this position by suggesting that most residential bodies corporate would not be required to register for GST because they did not make supplies to unit owners for consideration. 4. However, despite this longstanding view, some bodies corporate have registered for GST (which is likely due to inconsistent administrative practice), including some that have been able to claim refunds in relation to leaky building repairs. Inland Revenue legal analysis 5. In an effort to resolve the inconsistency, Inland Revenue more recently undertook a legal analysis of the existing law and came to a view that bodies corporate could be considered to be providing services to their owners for consideration (in the form of body corporate fees). Under this interpretation, bodies corporate that receive more than $60,000 in levies (and potentially other payments) should be registered for GST. As with other taxpayers, bodies corporate below the $60,000 threshold would be able to register voluntarily. 6. This legal view was consulted on in IRRUIP7: Bodies Corporate-GST Registration which was released in May 2013. Forty-two submissions were received on the legal position and the appropriate policy outcome. Many submissions raised policy arguments as to why bodies corporate should not be required to register for GST. 1 Previously the Unit Titles Act 1972. 3 The problem 7. The main problem is that Inland Revenue's new interpretation of the law does not align with the longstanding practices of a large number of bodies corporate, who are not GST- registered. 8. Absent any policy or law change, these bodies corporate would need to change their behaviour to comply with Inland Revenue's new interpretation of the law. This could create compliance costs. 9. In addition, the fact that property owners in bodies corporate would be able claim GST refunds, whilst others such as stand-alone property owners could not, could lead to perceptions ofunfair tax outcomes. Policy process 10. In response to these submissions and concerns about the potential tax outcomes which could arise under this interpretation, the Minister of Revenue instructed officials to consider policy options for the GST treatment of bodies corporate. The Minister of Revenue indicated that a policy response was required to address three main concerns: • Uncertainty concerns-To ensure bodies corporate have certainty over how the GST rules apply to them. • Compliance cost concerns - To ensure bodies corporate that believed they were not required to register do not have to do so as a consequence ofthe recent Inland Revenue interpretation of the existing rules. • Fairness concerns -To ensure that owners of residential property affected by leaky building issues that have received compensation and who carry out repairs through a body corporate are not tax advantaged compared to residential property owners that do not have a body corporate through which to carry out the repairs. 11. Earlier this year, Cabinet agreed to the development of draft legislation to exempt supplies made by bodies corporate to their unit owners from GST. This would mean the majority of bodies corporate would not be able to register for GST. 12. This decision was publicly announced by the Minister ofRevenue on 6 June 2014 along with a proposed rule to allow GST -registered members of a body corporate to claim input deductions on their share of the expenditure incurred by the body corporate (known as the "look-through rule"). The exemption and look-through rule would apply from the date of announcement. The announcement was accompanied by a short discussion document GST treatment of bodies corporate. The document provided further detail on the exemption and sought comment on the proposed draft legislation. 13. On 18 July 2014, submissions on the discussion document GST treatment of bodies corporate closed. Fifty submissions were received. The majority of submitters did not support the proposal. Submitters argued that the compliance costs associated with the proposal would be significant (discussed further under option 2) . 4 Affected bodies corporate and impacts 14. Because of data limitations it is not possible to determine exactly how many bodies corporate are currently registered for GST, or would be required to register because they collect more than $60,000 in levies (and other payments in some cases). Despite this, it is likely that around 2,500 bodies corporate are currently registered for GST. 2 These taxpayers would be the least affected if the new interpretation of the law was followed. 15. The number of bodies corporate that would be required to register, if the current interpretation ofthe law was followed, could be as many as 3,100. 3 For most ofthese bodies corporate there would be compliance costs associated with GST registration but, in most cases, little or no net GST to pay. 16. Compliance costs would include transitional costs imposed on bodies corporate that are not currently registered, but would be required to register because they collect more than $60,000 in levies. These bodies corporate would need to be informed that their existing practice of not being registered for GST was incorrect (and the reasons why). There will also be compliance costs relating to what they need to do to comply with their ongoing GST obligations. These ongoing obligations would involve compliance costs associated with filing GST returns. These include charging GST and providing tax invoices to unit owners, paying GST to Inland Revenue, keeping tax records and possibly hiring the services of tax agents. 17. Most bodies corporate would have little or no net GST to pay over time. This is because the GST charged on body corporate fees would generally be offset by the ability for the body corporate to claim GST input credits when they spent the fees on insurance, repairs, maintenance and so on. 18. There would be GST to pay in some cases such as when the funds were used to pay for ground rent. 4 These GST costs would be passed on to underlying property owners in the form of higher body corporate fees. 19. Some bodies corporate may want to register, particularly those that would be able to receive GST refunds. For example, some bodies corporate may have built up long term maintenance funds. If these funds were raised while the body corporate was not registered, no GST would have been collected when they were levied, but input tax deductions would be available if they later registered. Given GST should be neutral for these taxpayers, the ability to claim input tax deductions with no output liability represents a windfall gain to these bodies corporate. 20. It is difficult to estimate the amount of GST refunds that bodies corporate could claim, nevertheless based on the number of bodies corporate required to register and an estimate of the average amount of cash reserves held by bodies corporate, the fiscal cost could be around 2 There are approximately 2,500 registered persons with either the words " body corporate" in the name they registered under, or who have separately identified themselves as a body corporate through their industry classification or their reported nature of business. 3 We have obtained infonnation from Land Infonnation New Zealand (LINZ) about the total number of bodies corporate (approximately 13,800) and the number of units in each body corporate. Consequently, if we make an assumption about the average body corporate fee we can work out roughly how many bodies corporate would exceed the $60,000 threshold based on the number of units. 4 Ground rent can be paid when the land underneath the building is owned by a person outside the body corporate. 5 $116 million or $23.2 million per annum over 5 years. 5 The fiscal cost could be higher if bodies corporate that were not required to register (bodies corporate that have supplies below $60,000) decided to voluntarily register. The windfall gain to this group would further lead to perceptions ofunfairness. 21. GST refunds are also likely to be available in cases where a registered body corporate has received a leaky building compensation payment 6 and has used the compensation to pay for repairs. There would be a fiscal cost associated with these refunds. The actual cost would depend on many factors, such as the cost of the repairs, how these costs are funded, and how many bodies corporate register for GST. Based on a 2009 estimate of the costs associated with fixing weathertightness problems in multi-unit dwellings, the fiscal cost could be as much as $58 million spread over the next 6 years. 7 22. It could be viewed as unfair for the GST system to allow GST refunds for a certain group of property owners but not for other property owners. Residential property owners are not generally able to register for GST so could not claim GST refunds if they paid for repairs themselves as opposed to the repairs being paid for by a registered body corporate. 8 This could lead to perceptions that the tax system is subsidising repairs for some owners but not for others. Key figures Total number ofbodies corporate 13,800 Number ofbodies corporate already registered for GST 2,500 Number ofbodies corporate that might be required to Up to 3,100 register ifthe new interpretation of the law was followed Fiscal cost of refunds ifunregistered bodies corporate $116 million decided to register for GST Fiscal cost of refunds associated with leaky building $58 million spread over the next reparrs 6 years OBJECTIVES 23. New Zealand's GST system applies broadly with very few exemptions. Accordingly, a wide range ofbusinesses, clubs and other organisations are required to register for GST. This 5 A maximum of 3, 100 bodies corporate may be required to register under the status quo option. As bodies corporate are not required to file annual accounts centrally, it is difficult to estimate the level of these reserves. However, a conservative estimate would suggest these reserves for a body corporate over the registration threshold could be over $250,000. 6 Compensation payments are not generally subject to GST as they do not relate to a supply of anything in return, or to a nonnal transaction through the supply chain. In contrast, when a GST-registered person makes an insurance claim, they are generally required to return GST in relation to the insurance payout due to a special deeming rule in the GST Act. 7 1n the 2009 PwC report Weathertightness -Estimating the Cost, it was estimated to cost $1.402 billion to fix weathertightness issues in multi-unit dwellings and that up to 31% of all weathertightness costs could be funded from compensation payments. (The remaining 69% would be funded by the building owners themselves.) This $1.402 billion cost was increased to $1.433 billion to take into account the increase in GST from 12.5% to 15%; 31% of $1.433 billion is $444 million. The GST input credits that could be claimed on $444 million would be $58 million, or $8 million per year until 2020. 8 1n the case of owner-occupiers there is no supply or consideration for GST to apply to as the owner provides accommodation to themselves. When a landlord rents a house to a tenant, the GST Act exempts this supply of residential accommodation to ensure that tenants are not disadvantaged relative to owner-occupiers. 6 broad-base, low-rate framework is a key reason why New Zealand's GST is regarded to be efficient, fair and relatively simple. 24. Other aspects of the GST system recognise that public acceptance and compliance with GST depends on minimising undue compliance costs and on taxpayers' perceptions of fair and consistent tax outcomes. These include the $60,000 registration threshold which reduces compliance costs for smaller suppliers, and the exemption for the supply of residential accommodation which ensures renters are not disadvantaged relative to owner-occupiers. 25. As described above, the new interpretation of the law regarding the GST treatment of bodies corporate has raised predominantly practical concerns related to certainty, compliance costs and fairness. Unlike most other entities, however, bodies corporate are expected to be fiscally neutral over time because they expect to spend all of the money they accumulate. 26. The objectives against which the options are to be assessed are: a) To provide certainty of GST treatment. Ideally, the policy should provide certainty for past periods as well as the future. b) To minimise compliance costs. This includes transitional costs such as requiring bodies corporate to adopt a different practice (by requiring registration or deregistration) or change a previous tax position as well as ongoing costs such as filing tax returns or paying GST. There are also potential flow-on costs to unit owners to consider. c) To provide fair and consistent tax outcomes between bodies corporate, other property owners, and other taxpayers who have similar circumstances. When assessing fairness there are three different comparisons that can be made: • Other property owners. One comparison is that a person who owns property through a unit title should face similar tax outcomes to a person who owns property under another type of property ownership (such as freehold property). • Other types of taxpayer. Consideration of the extent to which a body corporate is similar to other types of taxpayer such as a property management business or a sports club which provides organisational services for its members. • Other bodies corporate. To ensure consistency between different bodies corporate the policy should apply broadly with few exceptions. In saying this, in a GST system where most supplies are taxable, it is recognised that some entities that supply the same types of goods may be in or out of the GST system depending on whether they are over the compulsory registration threshold. 27. We recognise that there are trade-offs between these policy objectives. For example, because taxpayers have taken different tax positions, a policy which sought to reduce transitional costs by preserving a previous tax position could result in different tax outcomes for one taxpayer compared to another in a similar situation. 7 REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 28. Four policy options and the status quo were considered for addressing the policy problem and meeting the objectives. These were: Option 1: Retain the new interpretation of the law (status quo); Option 2: Change the law to remove all bodies corporate from the GST system (previously preferred option); Option 3: Exempt only supplies made by a body corporate to residential unit owners (apportionment model); Option 4; Give bodies corporate the option of whether or not to register for GST (preferred option); and Option 5: Introduce a higher GST registration threshold for bodies corporate. Option 1: Retain the new interpretation of the law (status quo) 29. Under option 1, Inland Revenue would finalise our interpretation of the existing law. Based on the work to date, this interpretation would conclude that bodies corporate that receive more than $60,000 of annual fees are required to register for GST. Other bodies corporate that receive less than $60,000 of annual fees could voluntarily register for GST. 30. As mentioned previously, this legal view was consulted on in!RRUIP7: Bodies Corporate - GST Registration which was released in May 2013. Forty-two submissions were received. Many submissions raised policy arguments as to why bodies corporate should not be required to register for GST. Much ofthe discussion below reflects submitter's comments. Certainty 31. The purpose of an interpretation statement is to provide certainty. However, it only provides certainty as to Inland Revenue's view of the law. Some bodies corporate who disagreed with Inland Revenue's interpretation of the law may choose to challenge the interpretation in the courts. This risk is increased by the fact that in the only New Zealand court case on this issue, Taupo Jka Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997), the High Court suggested that most residential bodies corporate would not be required to register for GST. 32. In addition there could be uncertainty as to whether bodies corporate would be required to revise past tax positions that were inconsistent with Inland Revenue's new interpretation, particularly for those bodies corporate who have not registered for GST. An operational practice statement could be used to provide guidance on how Inland Revenue planned to administer the new interpretation but this may not provide the affected bodies corporate with sufficient comfort on their prior tax positions. Fairness 33. Applying GST to unit title property ownership could be seen to be unfair because GST registration involves compliance costs that would not apply to other types of property ownership (i.e. individuals who own standalone houses). It could potentially discourage unit title ownership. 8 34. On the other hand, it could also be viewed as unfair that the GST system allowed GST refunds for a certain group of property owners but not for other property owners. Residential property owners are not generally able to register for GST so could not claim GST refunds if they paid for leaky building repairs themselves as opposed to the repairs being paid for by a body corporate. GST refunds could amount to $58 million. This could lead to perceptions that the tax system is subsidising repairs for some owners but not for others. Compliance costs 35. Requiring bodies corporate to register for GST could impose compliance costs on thousands of property owners and in most cases would result in little, if any, tax to pay. These costs and their impacts are described in paragraphs 15 to 18 of this RlS. The number of bodies corporate that may be required to register could be up to 3,1 00. 36. Bodies corporate could potentially be required to file or reassess GST returns for prior tax years and pay penalties and interest in respect of unpaid GST obligations. The impact on past tax positions could, however, be reduced by providing a grace period (either through legislation or operational practice) whereby the GST obligations would only be enforced prospectively, after the date that the interpretation statement was finalised. Option 2: Change the law to remove bodies corporate from the GST system 3 7. Option 2 would require a legislative amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 which would explicitly remove any body corporate that was established under the Unit Titles Act 2010 from the GST system. 38. This option would also be accompanied by a "look-through rule" that deems any third- party services provided to a body corporate (such as insurance and cleaning) to be provided directly to the underlying unit owners in proportion to their shares in the body corporate. Under this approach, if an underlying owner was running a GST -registered business on their property, they would be able to claim back their portion of the GST costs of goods and services purchased by the body corporate on their behalf. If instead, the owner was simply living in the property, they would not have to do anything and would be treated like any other final consumer. 39. This option was the preferred option in the previous RlS, and was consulted on in the 6 June 2014 discussion document. The discussion document suggested that the new rule take effect from the date that the document and draft legislation were released (6 June 2014). A savings provision was also proposed to preserve the tax positions of those bodies corporate which had registered for GST and taken tax positions prior to 6 June. 40. After receiving feedback from submitters, officials no longer prefer this option. Certainty 41. The proposed law change would provide certainty of GST treatment for future periods after the date the law was changed, while the savings provision would also preserve the tax positions of those bodies corporate which had registered for GST and taken tax positions prior to 6 June. 42. There has however been some uncertainty since the Minister made the announcement on 6 June 2014, especially because the proposal is not yet enacted. An operational statement was 9 released soon after the announcement (28 June 2014) which was intended to give bodies corporate guidance as to what they should do in the interim. The operational statement advised registered bodies corporate to continue to file GST returns until the proposal was enacted. Fairness 43. The look-through rule element of this option would ensure that a person who owns property through a unit title should face similar tax outcomes to a person who owns property under another type of property ownership. 44. The option would also prevent bodies corporate from claiming further GST refunds after 6 June 2014. Removing this ability to claim further GST refunds can be justified on the basis that it removes a tax advantage that is not available to other types of residential property owners such as standalone home owners. 45. Submitters considered this option to be unfair for those bodies corporate that would be required to deregister. Specifically, these bodies corporate would have returned GST on fees received while they were registered but would be unable to claim input tax when they spent the fees after deregistration. Given GST is meant to be neutral for these taxpayers, if this option were to be pursued there is a policy argument that registered bodies corporate should be able to claim a GST refund on cash balances held at the time of deregistration. While the fiscal cost of cashing out reserves would over time be neutral, the cost in year one could be around $77 million. 9 46. Finally, an issue with removing bodies corporate from the GST system is that other taxpayers may argue that they should also be removed from the GST system. For example, a sports or social club may argue that, like a body corporate, they face undue compliance costs from having to register for GST. Compliance costs 47. For the vast majority of bodies corporate that are not registered for GST, a retrospective law change would align the law with their existing practice and previous tax positions. This means they would not have to take any action with regard to either their past or future behaviour. 48. Submitters argued that the compliance costs associated with this option would be significant. The main compliance cost concern relates to the on-going cost of applying the look-through rule. 9 This estimated is based on the assumption that 2,500 bodies corporate would be required to deregister with average reserves of around $250,000. 10 49. The proposed look-through model has the advantages ofbeing conceptually "pure" in that it would ensure that GST -registered unit owners would be entitled to input deductions on their share of expenses incurred at the body corporate level. However, submissions highlighted that achieving any degree of accuracy in these calculations would mean imposing significant compliance costs on bodies corporate and unit owners. These concerns would largely fall into the following categories: • Measuring ownership interests in a body corporate; • Managing information flows; • Transitional issues associated with filing returns in the period between 6 June 2014 and the date of enactment of any changes. 50. It was stressed that, because the look-through calculations would need to be undertaken for every taxable period (possibly monthly), these costs would be recurring. Measuring ownership interests 51. The proposed look-through rule suggested that a registered unit owner would be able to claim input tax deductions in proportion to their "ownership interest", as defined in the Unit Titles Act 2010. Submissions noted, however, that an owner's share of the expenses incurred by the body corporate is measured in a number of different ways. For example, a ground floor tenant may not be required to contribute to elevator maintenance. As a result, allowing expenses to be claimed on an ownership interest basis could result in owners being attributed with a greater or lesser share of expenses than should be the case. 52. In practice, to ensure owners are attributed the correct share of expenses, the body corporate would be required to examine each invoice received and attribute it to the owners in the appropriate proportions. This would be a significant compliance burden-particularly for large bodies corporate. Managing information flows 53. In order for the look-through model to work, unit owners would need accurate information on expenses incurred at the body corporate level. Because input tax deductions represent the equivalent of cash refunds to unit owners, they will, like most registered persons, be motivated to access this entitlement as soon as they can. Bodies corporate would therefore be under pressure to report to suit the unit owner that has the most frequent filing obligations (potentially monthly). Currently bodies corporate are only required to report to owners on a very limited basis. 54. An additional complication could arise when registered unit owners enter or exit a body corporate (through the sale ofunits). The exiting member will want to know their entitlement up to the date of departure, which could result in further "out of cycle" calculations needing to be undertaken by the body corporate. Transitional issues 55. If the look-through model was legislated for, the estimated 2,500 bodies corporate currently registered would need to deregister as of 6 June 2014. They would also need to file final returns that unwound the position of returns filed in the period between 6 June 2014 and the date of enactment (which may be in late 2015). 11 56. As well as calculations required at the body corporate level, individual registered unit owners would also need to perform a ''wash-up" calculation, so their GST position accurately reflected the new law for the period. 57. Measures could be put in place to lower the compliance costs of the look-through but, in doing so, the rules will need to trade off simplicity for accuracy. A set of minimum requirements may be relatively easy for a body corporate to administer (although some may even struggle with this), but they are unlikely to result in unit owners' input tax deductions being truly representative of their share of costs incurred at the body corporate level. Irrespective of whether a simple or more complicated method is chosen, these costs will be recurrmg. Option 3: Exempt only supplies made by a body corporate to residential unit owners (apportionment model) 58. The apportionment model requires bodies corporate to calculate and claim the appropriate amount on input tax, as opposed to the unit owners. This approach involves deeming bodies corporate to be supplying accommodation to their unit owners. This would mean: • Supplies of accommodation in residential units would be exempt. Fees charged to residential units would not be taxable and the body corporate would not be able to claim input tax deductions in relation to those supplies. • Supplies of accommodation in units used for commercial purposes would be taxable. Fees charged to commercial units would be taxable and the body corporate would be able to claim input tax deductions in relation to those supplies. 59. Bodies corporate associated entirely with residential units would not be able to register for GST. Bodies corporate associated with commercial units or a mix of residential and commercial units would either be required to register for GST (if supplies exceed $60,000), or could voluntarily register (if supplies are below $60,000). Bodies corporate with a mix of residential and commercial units would need to apportion their input tax deductions based on the proportion of residential and commercial units. 60. This option and option two have much the same advantages and disadvantages in respect of certainty, fairness and compliance costs. Like the look-through model, the apportionment model has the potential to be conceptually pure, in that GST costs incurred at the body corporate level would be accessed by registered unit owners, but not by unregistered owners. However, the apportionment model has the advantage of not requiring details of invoices and payments to be passed through to unit owners. 61. On the other hand, this model has potential to impose significant compliance costs on bodies corporate. The body corporate will be required to identify the status of its underlying units and/or unit owners. This could be difficult given there are specific GST rules that define what is a commercial and residential dwelling, consequently, the status of the underlying unit may not always be clear. This may also give rise to privacy concerns for the unit owners concerned. If the body corporate did not make enquiries of unit owners this may result in input tax deductions being incorrectly claimed at the body corporate level or denying input deductions to unit owners that would, if they owned a stand-alone residence, be entitled to claim them. 12 Option 4: Give bodies corporate the option of whether or not to register for GST 62. Option 4 (preferred option) involves giving bodies corporate an option to register. This option would also require a legislative amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the option would only extend to supplies made to unit owners. Supplies to third parties (for example, car park rental to third parties) would be governed by the ordinary rules (i.e. a body corporate would be required to register if supplies to third-parties exceeded $60,000). Other legislative amendments would be necessary to: • clarify that services provided by bodies corporate to their members are "supplies" for GST purposes; and • address a base maintenance risk associated with bodies corporate choosing to register and deregister at times that would effectively mean that the majority of their spending was subsidised by the tax system. Certainty 63. Option 4 would provide certainty by clarifying that services provided by bodies corporate to their members are "supplies" for GST purposes. It would then allow bodies corporate the option of whether to make those supplies "taxable" by registering for GST. 64. Like option 2, this option would need to apply retrospectively in order to preserve tax positions taken by bodies corporate who had not registered for GST. 65. Unlike option 2, a savings provision would not be required to preserve tax positions taken by bodies corporate who had registered for GST as an optional approach would not prevent bodies corporate from being able to register for GST. Fairness 66. Previous fairness concerns surrounding registration of bodies corporate centred on their ability to access input tax deductions (and therefore refunds) for leaky building repairs. Because compensation payments are not subject to GST, this would result in a windfall gain for a registered body corporate when compared to an unregistered one, or a standalone homeowner. However, consultation has suggested that a practice may have emerged whereby the payers of compensation payments are reducing the amounts paid to registered bodies corporate to reflect any GST that the body corporate may be able to claim. This makes rational sense because a payer will always be motivated to make any settlement as small as possible. If this practice is now routine, the original concern regarding bodies corporate receiving windfall gains at the expense of the tax base (and gains that would not have been available to stand-alone homeowners) is mitigated. 67. Bodies corporate are only likely to register for GST if they expect to receive GST refunds. Not only would this raise revenue concerns, it could also lead to perceptions of unfairness. This concern could be addressed by imposing an output tax liability on relevant reserves (including funds from compensation payments) held by the body corporate at the time of registration. Such a liability would remove any windfall gain resulting from registration. 68. If this option were to be pursued, it will be necessary to align the application date with the introduction of the relevant legislation. This is necessary to prevent unregistered bodies corporate from registering before the enactment of any legislation in order to avoid the payment of output tax on their reserves. 13 69. Some bodies corporate may argue that since they are required to pay output tax when they register they should be entitled to an input tax refund on cash reserves held at the time of deregistration. This should not be necessary, however, as a body corporate would be able to deregister at any point in time and therefore is able to choose the most appropriate time to deregister -such as a time when their reserves are low. Cashing out reserves would also have fiscal implications as described in paragraph 45. In addition, those bodies corporate that are currently GST registered will not have entered the system in the expectation that their reserves would be cashed out on deregistration. To do so would provide those bodies corporate with a windfall gain. 70. To remove any residual incentives that bodies corporate may have to register and deregister on a regular basis, it would be desirable to also create a lock-in rule, whereby if a body corporate chooses to register after the effective date of these changes, they must stay registered for a minimum of four years. This would provide some clarity to a body corporate of the minimum compliance costs of registration and would also ensure that those looking to register only for short term gain, such as the GST advantages arising from a future compensation payment, would be discouraged from doing so. 71. Finally, adopting this option may set a precedent for other non-profit bodies to lobby for an increased threshold or a similar optional approach. Compliance costs 72. Option 4 has the lowest compliance cost of any option, as bodies corporate will be able to decide whether it is worthwhile to register for GST and bear the cost associated with registration. It is anticipated that this approach would require very few, if any, bodies corporate to take immediate action. 73. It is likely that only bodies corporate with GST registered unit owners (commercial bodies corporate) will want to register for GST. Registration may be worthwhile for these bodies corporate to avoid tax cascades - where the body corporate incurs unrecoverable GST which in turn would be passed on to unit owners. However, it is likely that many commercial bodies corporate may already be registered for GST, in which case they could remain registered. 10 74. There may be an onus on some bodies corporate to decide whether or not they should choose to register for GST. For some bodies corporate there would be costs associated with making this decision which could include paying fees to a tax agent to provide advice on their situation. Option 5: Introduce a higher GST registration threshold for bodies corporate 75. Taxpayers currently need to register for GST if they have more than $60,000 of taxable supplies. Option 5 would involve increasing the GST registration threshold for bodies corporate so that registration would be compulsory above the threshold and voluntary below the threshold. Like options 2, 3 and 4, this would require a legislative amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 10 Of the number of registered persons that identified themselves as a body corporate, 60 percent identified themselves as a "commercial" body corporate. The remaining 40 percent identified themselves as a "residential" body corporate. 14 76. This option has the same advantages and disadvantages as option 4 with one exception: even with a very high threshold there could still be cases where a body corporate exceeds the threshold but does not wish to be GST registered. Consequently, these bodies corporate would still have to deal with all the compliance costs associated with GST registration. In this regard, the threshold would create a "cliff-face", particularly for those bodies corporate that temporarily breached the threshold temporarily due to a large one-off transaction. 77. Option 4 is preferred because it does not have the "cliff-face" associated with option 5. Some may argue that large bodies corporate should be required to register, however, for the reason discussed in paragraphs 15 to 18 there would be little benefit in these taxpayers registering. Summary of impact analysis 78. The following table summarises for each option which ofthe objectives it meets or partly meets (for the reasons described above) as well as the economic, administrative, fiscal and fairness impacts. None of the options have environmental, social or cultural impacts.

As mentioned earlier, Inland Revenue undertook a legal analysis of the existing law in order to resolve the uncertainty that had arisen as a result of body corporate GST refund claims. Inland Revenue Issues Paper -new interpretation of the law 80. In May 2013, Inland Revenue released Issues Paper IRRUIP7: Bodies Corporate-GST Registration to consult on our initial view that existing law would require bodies corporate that receive more than $60,000 of annual fees to be registered for GST. The issues paper set out an initial interpretative position for consideration and also raised some alternative views. It invited submissions on both the legal position and the appropriate policy outcome. 16 81. Forty-two submissions were received. Six submissions agreed with the approach taken in the issues paper, considering it both technically correct and appropriate. Three submissions were neutral. Thirty-three submissions disagreed with the approach taken in the issues paper. 82. Many submitters raised policy arguments as to why bodies corporate should not be required to register for GST. These included arguments that a body corporate is, in substance, just a vehicle through which various property owners co-ordinate to pay costs related to accommodation, through a central account, and that requiring bodies corporate to register for GST would impose compliance costs but would collect little additional tax revenue. Discussion document-policy proposal 83. To address these concerns, on 6 June 2014, the Minister of Revenue publicly announced his intention to introduce legislation that would exempt supplies made by bodies corporate to their unit owners from GST and that the exemption would apply from the date of announcement. The announcement was accompanied by a short discussion document GST treatment of bodies corporate. The document included and sought comment on the proposed draft legislation. 84. On 18 July 2014, submissions on the discussion document GST treatment of bodies corporate closed. Fifty submissions were received, some on behalf of a large number of bodies corporate. The majority of submitters did not support the proposal. Submitters argued that the compliance costs associated with the proposal would be significant. The main compliance cost concerns related to the application of the look-through rule as discussed in paragraphs 48 to 57. In addition, submitters were concerned with the transitional costs associated with the proposal, such as the unfairness of not refunding input tax on reserves (see discussion in paragraph 45) and the compliance costs associate with the retrospective application date (see discussion in paragraph 55). 85. As a result of the feedback received the preferred option is now option 4 as compared to the previous RIS that recommended option 2. Many submitters preferred the optional approach (option 4) or a higher threshold (option 5). Next steps 86. Once the Government has made a policy decision, officials will prepare draft legislation for introduction in the next omnibus tax bill scheduled for early in 2015. 87. The Treasury were consulted on and agree with the preferred option (option 4). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 88. We recommend that the law be changed to give bodies corporate the option of whether to register for GST (option 4). For the reasons explained above, this option best achieves the objectives of providing certainty, consistency and fairness whilst minimising compliance costs and disruption to existing practices. The most effective way to meet these objectives would involve a date of introduction application date with a savings provision for tax positions taken prior to the date of introduction. 89. Retaining the existing law (option 1) is not supported as it does not address the problem, would only provide partial certainty and would not achieve the other objectives. 17 90. A GST exemption to remove all bodies corporate from the GST system (option 2) is not preferred as the compliance costs of applying the look-through rule would likely be high. Option 3 is not supported for compliance cost reasons associated with bodies corporate apportioning their input tax deductions. 91. A higher GST registration threshold (option 5) is not supported because ofthe "cliff-face" it creates for those bodies corporate that may make supplies in excess of the higher threshold. IMPLEMENTATION 92. The preferred option (option 4) would need to be implemented through a taxation bill. Draft legislation can be included in a bill scheduled for early 2015. 93. The proposed application date would be date of introduction. This is necessary to prevent unregistered bodies corporate from registering before enactment to avoid the payment of output tax on their reserves. While it is recognised retrospective application dates should generally be avoided, in this case it is necessary for the fairness and fiscal reasons discussed in paragraph 68. 94. The existing operational statement that was released on 28 June 2014 offers some certainty for the interim. It advises taxpayers to continue to follow the existing law until any legislation is enacted. This means that registered bodies corporate should continue to file GST returns in the nonnal manner. The operational statement also makes it clear that Inland Revenue will not require bodies corporate to register in the interim. 95. The new rules will be administered by Inland Revenue through ex1stmg channels. Compliance costs can be minimised by releasing clear and helpful guidance as to the operation of the new rules using existing Inland Revenue channels. Administration costs are expected to be negligible. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 96. Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 97. The fmal step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 18
Regulatory Impact Statement Cashing-out research and development tax losses Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of: • whether the current tax treatment of losses for research and development (R&D)- intensive start-up businesses is appropriate; and • the options to allow R&D-intensive start-up businesses more timely access to their tax loss deductions. Consultation on these issues took place via an officials' issues paper, R&D tax losses, released in July 2013, which sought feedback on various features of a proposed set of tax rules that would allow R&D-intensive start-up companies early access, by way of a "cash- out" (refund), to tax losses arising from qualifying R&D expenditure. Following a review of written submissions, officials from Inland Revenue and the Treasury met with a number of interested parties. Submissions were received from professional services firms, industry and other professional bodies, R&D companies and individuals, and were generally in favour of the proposal. Submitters raised issues with some of the proposed policy settings as well as overall concerns around the compliance costs of the initiative. Of particular concern were the proposed rules for the R&D wage intensity threshold, the proposed administration regime and the neutrality and integrity measures. The preferred option is to allow R&D-intensive start-ups to cash-out, or refund, their tax losses arising from qualifying R&D expenditure. This proposed initiative removes a barrier to investment in R&D start-ups which arises from the current treatment of tax losses. The estimated average fiscal cost of the proposed initiative is $15 million per annum. The accuracy of this estimate could be affected by changes in key assumptions, especially the number of companies who receive a cashed-out loss, the overall repayment rate of the cashed out loss (which depends on both the firm survival rate, and the ability to recover the value of the cashed-out loss from companies that sell intellectual property or undergo a change in ownership), and the timeframe for repayment. If the number of firms that receive a cashed-out loss or the repayment rate is higher or lower than expected, both the average fiscal cost and year-to-year variation could change. The administration regime for the proposed initiative has not yet been decided. This will be the subject of a Business Case scheduled to be determined by Cabinet in June 2014. It is therefore not possible to assess the compliance costs arising from the proposed administration regime in this RIS. However, the relative compliance costs of the various administration options will be one of the key criteria considered in the Business Case. Finalisation of the administration regime is also necessary before any changes can be legislated for. The proposed initiative will apply from income years starting on or after 1 April 2015. Legislative amendments to give effect to the measure should therefore be included in the next available omnibus tax bill which in turn means that the legislation is unlikely to be passed ahead of the 1 April 2015 start date. It is anticipated that there would be a degree of retrospectivity compared to the start date, but as this initiative is advantageous to taxpayers this should not be of concern. Even with lBgislativB introduction in early 2015, it should be passed by the time that taxpayers' losses crystallise for the first year of the proposed initiative at the end of2015/16 income year. The Treasury were involved in the development of the policy options discussed in this RIS. There are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. None of the policy options considered impair private property rights, reduce market competition, or override common law principles. Instead, the preferred option is likely to increase incentives for businesses to be innovative. Taxpayers will incur compliance costs to satisfy the eligibility and reporting requirements of the initiative, but on the whole the proposed initiative is advantageous to taxpayers. David Carrigan Policy Director, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 21 March 2014 2 STATUS QUO 1. The tax system in New Zealand is based on the principle of broad-base, low-rate taxation, as set out in the Government' s Revenue Strategy. This means that alternative forms of income and expenditure are taxed as comprehensively and as evenly as possible. These principles ensure that overall tax rates can be kept low and even (thereby minimising the influence that taxation has over economic decisions), whilst also maintaining New Zealand' s revenue base. 2. The Government's policy of broad-base, low-rate taxation means that the current tax treatment of research and development (R&D) expenditure in New Zealand is largely consistent with the tax treatment of other forms of business expenditure. There are very few provisions that we expect will distort incentives to innovate. 3. There is an asymmetric tax treatment of profits and losses under the status quo which is particularly pronounced for R&D start-ups. This asymmetry arises because profit-making businesses can deduct expenses from their, or their group companies ', assessableincome in the year that these expenses are incuned. In contrast, loss-making businesses typically have to carry expenses that contribute to tax losses forward to future years, so they can be offset against future income. 4. This treatment for losses ensures that any deductions for expenses incurred during periods of loss can be offset against profitable group companies or eventually be utilised when the business begins to earn profits. It can, however, cause a delay in the utilisation of deductions for loss-making businesses relative to profitable ones or ones with profitable group compames. 5. Although the status quo creates a t1mmg asymmetry which can disadvantage loss- making businesses, there are good reasons for requiring taxpayers to carry losses forward or allowing taxpayers to offset their losses against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. Without these provisions there would be a strong incentive for businesses to create artificial losses as a means of receiving value from the loss. Under current tax settings, however, this risk will always be capped at the level of the otherwise net income of the group. As such, allowing offsets within a group or requiring taxpayers in general to carry losses forward are essential integrity measures in the tax system. PROBLEM DEFINITION 6. Small businesses can face particular challenges when carrying out R&D, often because of restricted access to capital and uncertain cash-flows during their early development. Although there are a number of possible reasons for this (see problem scope), these challenges are likely to be compounded by status quo tax settings, which delay the ability ofloss-making businesses to use their tax deductions. 7. There are two key tax issues here. Firstly, although the status quo provides mechanisms for tax losses to be utilised, they do cause a delay for loss-making start-ups relative to profitable ones. This creates a cash-flow bias against loss-making businesses or groups which is expected to be particularly significant for small, R&D-intensive start-ups. This is expected to have a negative impact on such businesses' propensity and ability to invest in R&D, and the probability of successful innovation. 3 8. Secondly, the status quo can also penalise businesses that do not generate sufficient profits to fully utilise their deductions or offset their losses. This is because current tax provisions effectively mean that losses can only be used going forward if the original owners subsequently engage in a profitable business. In cases where this does not occur, businesses will have incurred tax-deductible expenditures that cannot be utilised. While this is less of a problem for R&D start-ups as they are able to defer R&D expenses, the status quo still makes the use of expenditure contingent upon successful innovation (or future income earned by the same group of investors). The risk of incurring this potential additional sunk cost represented by expenditure that will not create a tax benefit is likely to provide an additional disincentive to invest in R&D projects at the margin. 9. Thus, the core problem considered in this RIS is the inability of R&D start-ups to access their tax deductions in a timely fashion, or even at all. 10. As mentioned above however, there are good reasons for the status quo. Refunding tax losses, instead of requiring these to be carried forward, would give rise to significant tax base risk. Specifically, this could encourage the creation of artificial losses by taxpayers to reduce their taxable income and could have the effect of reducing government tax revenue. As such, requiring taxpayers to carry losses forward is an essential integrity measure in the tax system, and there needs to be a strong case for changing this treatment of tax losses, particularly as the proposed initiative could be seen as a precedent for wider changes to the tax treatment of losses. Scope of the problem 1 1. Although many other businesses can also be said to suffer from similar cash-flow and capital constraints, there are strong theoretical and empirical grounds for believing that R&D- start-ups face particularly challenging obstacles. This is because of: • Information asymmetries - these arise when potential lenders have less information about the value of an R&D project than the company itself, which can lead to a break- down in the provision of financing that would be worthwhile if both parties were equally well informed. This is especially prevalent for R&D start-ups given: o the novel and/or experimental nature of R&D; o the lack of proven commercial experience; and o the lack of a proven market for the final product. • High sunk costs -which mean that R&D expenditures often have a low, or zero, resale value in the event of failure. This means that R&D start-ups often have little in the way of collateral that can be used to secure debt-financing. • High up-front costs - the natural profit cycle for innovative projects tends to involve high up-front costs and consequently, longer periods in tax loss. This implies that the problem faced by R&D start-ups is not just their overall ability to access capital, but also timely access to capital. 12. These challenges interact, potentially making it very difficult for R&D start-ups to access capital in a timely manner at an important stage of their development. In contrast, other businesses do not normally face the same difficulties when seeking lending, nor do they face the same level of uncertainty over their ongoing profits/losses. As a result, we consider the 4 scope of the problem to be limited to R&D-intensive businesses, particularly those that are small and in their start-up phase. Scale of the problem 13. There is an inherent difficulty in assessing the scale of the problem as the counterfactual is highly uncertain. Specifically, it is not possible to gauge the number and value of R&D businesses that could potentially have been successful (or would not otherwise have been impeded) in the absence ofthe capital and cash-flow constraints outlined above. 14. However, empirical evidence shows that small R&D-intensive businesses have a significantly lower probability of being successful with long-term loan applications than other businesses and that the probability of success decreases as R&D intensity increases. Venture capital can address some of these problems, but evidence from different countries indicates that small and medium businesses tend to rely on internal equity financing, and prefer to seek bank loans if external financing is required. However, recent evidence indicates that banks in New Zealand are not necessarily well engaged with the financing needs of small start-up businesses, and have relatively high le vels of risk aversion compared with UK and US banking models in suppmiing early stage companies or projects. 1 15. Nearly all submitters who commented on the problem definition, as presented in the issues paper, agreed with our overall characterisation of the problem, and that the scope should be targeted to R&D-intensive start-ups and pre-revenue taxpayers. OBJECTIVES 16. The overall objective of this policy review is to reduce a bias against investment in R&D start-ups arising from the current treatment of tax losses. Any policy option should also satisfy the objectives of the Government's Revenue Strategy, which seeks to achieve a fair and efficient tax system by: • maintaining revenue flows; • minimising economic distortions; • minimising compliance and administrative costs; and • minimising scope for avoidance and evasion. 17. It is also necessary to consider the objectives of the Government' s Business Growth Agenda (BGA). The BGA identifies business innovation as one of six key areas for building national innovation and growth. Current work in the business innovation work stream involves ensuring the business environment, including regulatory settings, is set to give businesses confidence to innovate. Removing barriers to investment in R&D start-ups arising from tax settings is entirely consistent with the Government's objectives in the BGA. 1 Boven. R . . Harland. C.. and Grace. L. Plugging the Cap: An lnternationalisation S trategy. (Auckland: The New Zealand Institute. 20 I 0). 5 18. We recognise that there are likely to be trade-offs between the policy objectives. For example, the preferred option minimises economic distortions but will involve some compliance costs to ensure the integrity of the tax system. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS Options identification 19. As the core policy problem stems from the asymmetric treatment oftax losses under the status quo, the nature of the solution set is essentially binary; we can either maintain the status quo or consider ways to remove the asymmetry for the desired target group. 20. Removing the asymmetry would involve allowing certain businesses to access an amount of their tax loss deductions arising from qualifying R&D expenditure in the year that the expenditure is incurred. In practice, this means that eligible businesses would be entitled to a receipt (the cash-out) from the Government amounting to 28 per cent of their tax losses in each relevant tax year. In turn, businesses that access their tax losses early through a cashed- out loss would no longer be able to carry these losses forward to be deducted against future mcome. 21. This is the main policy option that has been developed as it directly addresses the identified policy problem. Although other options were initially considered as ways of removing the as ymmetry, these were discounted early on as they were not considered to directly address the core policy problem. Other options considered during the policy process were: • a profit-contingent loan; • a grant; • allowing taxpayers to carry their tax losses forward with interest; and • lowering the shareholder continuity threshold. 22. A profit-contingent loan was discounted because it did not address the tax distortion arising from the inability of R&D start-ups to access their tax losses in a timely fashion, or even at all. 23. A grant to R&D start-ups was also discounted as it did not remedy the policy problem, and would have had a significantly greater fiscal impact. 24. Allowing R&D start-ups to carry their tax losses forward with interest was discounted as it would not assist R&D start-ups with their cash-flow and capital constraints. While it would have addressed the distortion arising from R&D start-ups not being able to access their tax losses in a timely fashion, it would not have addressed the distortion arising from the potential wasting of the tax loss asset had the business failed to make a return. 25. Lowering the shareholder continuity threshold was raised by submitters as an alternative, and was briefly considered as a replacement for allowing R&D start-ups to cash- out R&D tax losses. Lowering the shareholder continuity threshold, with accompanying safeguards and measures to reduce risks around existing losses being used inappropriately, 6 would allow for greater changes in ownership without tax losses being forfeited. Companies that are capital~com;trained would be able to take on further equity from new shareholders without having to balance this against the forfeit of (some of) their accumulated tax losses. 26. Lowering the shareholder continuity threshold would not have addressed the same core policy problem. The R&D tax losses initiative is specifically targeted at assisting cash-flow and capital-constrained R&D start-ups who are unable to access their tax losses while the alternative proposal would be much broader, assisting any business that risked forfeiting tax losses through changing or introducing new shareholders. 27. In addition, sections EJ 22 and EJ 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007 allow taxpayers to allocate deductions for R&D expenditure taken under section DB 34 to a later income year after the shareholder continuity breach takes place. This means that R&D start-ups can already introduce new equity without forfeiting tax losses arising from R&D expenditure. Consequently, lowering the shareholder continuity threshold was not seen as a sufficiently close replacement to allowing R&D start-ups to cash-out R&D tax losses, and was not considered any further in the context of the current policy review. 28. As a result, although only one core policy option has been developed fully in this RJS, many variants of this option have been considered and consulted upon. These are discussed in the " options analysis" section below, and have been assessed with reference to the status quo. Description of the preferred option 29. Under the preferred option taxpayers that meet certain eligibility criteria will be entitled to cash-out a certain amount of their R&D tax losses. The benefit of the tax losses will be delivered by way of a cash refund equal to 28 percent of the tax loss. Only certain qualifying R&D expenditure will be permitted to contribute to the tax loss that can be cashed-out. A loss which has been cashed-out will no longer be eligible to be carried forward to be deducted against future income. 30. The key design features of the preferred option are set out below. Administration 31. In response to submissions concerned about the potential compliance costs of the proposed administration process, the administration process for the initiative is still under revision. This will be the subject of a Business Case that will determine whether the policy will be administered either by Inland Revenue only, or in partnership with Callaghan Innovation, the Crown entity that administers government funding to innovative businesses. This is scheduled to be determined by Cabinet in June 2014. Elig ibilily crileria 32. The proposed initiative will apply to R&D-intensive start-up companies who are in a tax loss position and resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. These requirements must also be met on a group basis, if the company is part of a group. 33. The initiative is restricted to certain companies only to ensure effective targeting. Companies listed on a recognised stock exchange are ineligible because they are not cash- flow and capital-constrained to the same degree as unlisted R&D stmi-ups. Also, companies 7 that have flow-through treatment of tax losses, such as look -through companies, are excluded. Any developments in this area, such as the establishment of a stock exchange that targets high-growth and innovative firms, will be followed closely. R&D wage intensity 34. Additionally, R&D -intensive start-up companies must spend at least 20 per cent of their total wage and salary expenditure on R&D to be eligible for a cashed-out loss. This measure includes shareholder salaries, contracted labour, and 66 per cent of expenditure on contracted R&D. This requirement must also be met on an overall group basis, if the company is part of a group. Definition of R&D 35. To be eligible for a cashed-out loss, a taxpayer must be carrying out eligible R&D. The proposed definitions of "research" and " development" are based on the New Zealand equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38 (NZIAS 38). This is consistent with the current definitions of "research" and "development" used in the Income Tax Act as well as by Callaghan Innovation. Guidance will be provided to support potential applicants. 36. The agency that administers the definition (Callaghan Innovation or Inland Revenue) and the way in which the definition is legislated for (as a process or as a statutory test) is dependent on the result of the Business Case. Excluded expenditure 37. Certain expenditure items will not be eligible expenditure. They are: • interest expenses on R&D; • the purchase of existing R&D assets; • R&D undertaken offshore; and • finance lease payments for R&D equipment. 38. Expenditure on "operating leases", as defined in the Income Tax Act, will be included as eligible expenditure. Operating leases are typically shorter-tetm leases that are not substitutes for financing a purchase with debt (these are "finance leases" and will remam excluded). Amount of R&D tax losses to be cashed out 39. Qualifying taxpayers will be able to cash out, for the relevant year, the lesser of: • 1.5 times their eligible R&D salary and wage expenditure; • total tax losses; • total qualifying R&D expenditure; and • the overall cap on eligible R&D tax losses. 8 40. The initial cap will be set at $500,000 of losses, which amounts to a cashed~out loss of $140,000. This will rise eventually to $2 million, equivalent to a cashed-out loss of $560,000. This cap reduces its fiscal risk, especially in the early years of the new rules when there will be uncertainty over the response of R&D start-ups to the changes. Gradually increasing the cap will help ensure that the benefits ofthe cashed-out loss will not be reduced by an increase in demand for R&D inputs that will result in an increase in the cost of carrying out R&D, rather than an increase in R&D itself. 41. The 1.5 times multiplier applied to the R&D salary and wages expenditure is intended to help R&D start-ups cash-out losses that are incurred as a result of other non-salary and wage R&D expenditure. The different ways of calculating the amount of the cashed-out loss is necessary to ensure R&D start-ups with and without a large proportion of salary and wage expenditure to total expenditure (subject to meeting the wage intensity threshold) have similar access to the policy. Loss recovery events 42. The overall policy intent is to provide a temporary cash-flow benefit for R&D start-ups that will be repaid out of their future taxable income. However, of the R&D start-ups that derive a return from the investment, not all derive a return that is taxable. Often the return is not realised until the intellectual property is sold. If the value of the cashed-out loss is not recovered from the sale proceeds, then the interest-free loan becomes a grant, and the fiscal risk of the policy is much greater. 43. As an integrity measure, we propose that loss recovery should take place for the R&D start-up when a taxpayer with a cashed-out loss or investor makes a capital return, but only to the extent of the cashed-out loss. The " loss recovery events" would be when: • the company sells intellectual property; • when 90 per cent of shares in the company are sold; • the company becomes non-resident (for tax purposes); or • the company is liquidated. 44. The liability to return the value of the cashed-out loss is the responsibility of the company rather than the shareholder for compliance reasons. A threshold of 90 per cent, rather than 100 per cent, accounts for management interests being retained in situations when private equity sells out. Although the liability is on the company, we expect that shareholders will indirectly bear this liability as any buyer knowing of the loss recovery rules should pay less for the shares than they would otherwise. 45. If the company changes its tax residence or liquidates, we propose that there be a deemed sale of intellectual property at its market value and that losses be recovered to the extent that a profit is made on that deemed sale. Mechanism to recover losses 46. R&D start-ups will be required to reinstate their tax losses through a cash payment if a loss recovery event takes place. The payment to reinstate losses will not be deemed income 9 • for tax purposes, but represents the loan repayment necessary to convert their cashed-out losses back into losses arising from R&D expenditure tO-carry forward to apply again~t future mcome. 47. To illustrate how this would work in practice, a taxpayer eligible for a cashed-out loss has in year I a $100 cashed-out loss (equivalent to $28) and $100 of losses being CatTied forward. In year 2, the taxpayer sells intellectual property receiving a capital return of $500. This is a loss recovery event and the taxpayer is required to return the value of the cashed out loss - $28 - to Inland Revenue in order to have their loss of $100 reinstated. Consequently, the loss is reinstated and the taxpayer will now have $200 of losses being carried forward to apply against future taxable income. Analysis of the preferred option Economic implications 48. The preferred option is expected to: • provide some relief for the financing constraints faced by R&D-intensive start-ups during the initial loss-making phase of the innovation cycle; and • reduce the amount of any tax losses accumulated by R&D start-up companies that will be forfeited in the event of failure. 49. This is expected at the margin to have a positive impact on incentives to invest in R&D and the likelihood of successful innovation. It is not possible to quantify these benefits as there are no comparable policies in operation elsewhere. However, in bringing forward the benefits of deductibility, the proposal essentially transfers a timing advantage from the Government to eligible businesses. It is expected that this timing advantage will be much more valuable to target businesses (cash-constrained R&D start-ups) than to the Government. Therefore, the primary economic impact of the proposal (taking into account the opportunity cost to the Governn1ent of delayed tax revenue, but before taking into account administration/implementation costs) is expected to be positive at the margin. 50. It is important to point out that this option is not the same as a conventional tax subsidy such as an R&D tax credit. This is because, prima facie, this option does not alter a compan y's overall tax liability as any tax deductions that are taken early can no longer be taken in the future. However, the option does provide a time value of money benefit to eligible businesses as it reallocates tax benefits from the future to the present. This benefit is expected to be of value for target businesses as the reallocation across time also coincides with a rebalancing of tax liabilities from periods ofloss to periods of profit. 51. Since the start of initial policy development, the OECD have also recently indicated that 'R&D tax incentives should be designed to meet the needs of young, innovative " stand alone" firms without cross-border tax planning opportunities' 2 . This is because: • Young businesses are considered to play a crucial role in employment creation, with evidence from 15 OECD countries over 2001-11 indicating that young firms (aged 5 2 M aximising the benefits of R&D tax incentives for innovation. OECD policy brief, October 2013 10 years or less) generated almost 50 per cent of all new jobs created despite accounting for only 20 per cent of total (non-financial} business employment. 3 • The global tax system is considered to create an uneven playing field for small, domestic businesses vis-a-vis large multinationals which can take advantage of cross- border tax planning opportunities. 4 52. As a result, this option is expected to be well targeted. Fiscal costs 53. Allowing early access to tax losses involves an opportunity cost to the Government from the tax loss that is cashed-out. Although this amounts to a reduction in tax revenue in the year that losses are cashed-out, this is partially recovered when businesses eventually make assessable income. This is because losses that are accessed early can no longer be carried forward to be offset against future income. As a result, the direct fiscal costs of the policy largely amount to a timing concession (relative to the status quo) for businesses at the expense of the Government. 54. However, in the case of those businesses that never become profitable (or do not generate profits sufficient to cover the value of the cashed-out loss), the cashed-out loss will effectively amount to a (pmtial) grant. Technically however, this is the " correct" (i.e. neutral) tax treatment for businesses that do not generate sufficient profits. 55. Our estimates of the fiscal costs of the policy indicate that the net effect of these various factors will result in an annual average fiscal cost to the Government of $15 million per annum. This estimate is based on evidence from the R&D business survey on the number of businesses expected to satisfy the eligibility criteria for the policy, a11d information from IR4 income tax returns about the value of their losses. Administration/implementation costs 56. The overall administration and implementation costs for a scenario where Inland Revenue partners with Callaghan Innovation are currently estimated at $2.9 million for 2014115, $4.4 million for 2015116 and $1.8 million thereafter from 2016117. These estimates are expected to be an upper limit for a rm1ge of options. 57. As noted above, the administration regime for the initiative has not yet been decided. This will be the subject of a Business Case, This is scheduled to be determined by Cabinet in June 2014. Compliance costs 58. Compliance is an important element of this initiative, as although the overall policy is business-friendly, the desired target group (R&D-intensive start-ups) is unlikely to be well equipped to deal with a high compliance burden. In addition, evaluation of the recently discontinued R&D tax credit revealed that a non-trivial p01tion of the benefits were captured by professional tax advisory services rather than R&D businesses. However, certain 3 Maximising the benefits of R&D tax incentives for innovation. OECD policy brief, October 2013 4 Maximising the benelits of R&D tax incentives for innovation. OECD policy brief, October 2013 II compliance measures are necessary to ensure that the initiative is not gamed or abused by applicants. 59. Key changes made to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers have seen the R&D wage intensity measure change and the loss recovery rules simplified, which are discussed in detail in the consultation section. 60. It is not possible to assess the compliance costs ansmg from the proposed administration regime, as this has not yet been determined. However, it is known that R&D start-ups are not equipped to handle a high compliance burden. Consequently, the relative compliance costs of the various options will be one of the key criteria considered in the Business Case. Regardless of the outcome of the Business Case, the information that taxpayers will be expected to provide as pm1 of the application process is intended to be consistent with the information an R&D start-up would be expected to have on hand as part of effective project management, and maintaining intellectual property records and accounting systems. 61. Although the initiative will inevitably place a compliance burden on applicants, and it is not possible to quantify these compliance costs, it is expected that these costs will (for most businesses) be outweighed by the benefits, especially for R&D start-ups with appropriate information management systems, as noted above. The compliance costs of applying to Callaghan Innovation for a government grant for R&D funding also provide a useful guide on reasonable compliance costs proportionate to the size of the cashed-out loss. It is also expected that compliance costs would be highest in the first year that a taxpayer applies for a cashed-out loss. With many R&D stat1-ups likely to be eligible to receive a cashed-out loss for a number of income years, compliance costs should reduce over time as taxpayers become increasingly familiar with the compliance requirements of the policy. Risks 62. The primary policy risk is that the initiative could be seen as a precedent for a more general change to the tax treatment of losses, noting that the stock of tax losses was calculated to be $44 billion in 2010. This risk should be mitigated by making it very clear that this is a very narrow proposal targeted specifically at removing a tax impediment to innovative start- up ventures. 63. We have explored the sensttivtty of the estimated fiscal cost to changes in key assumptions. In particular, this includes the number of firms who receive a cashed-out loss, the overall repayment rate of the cashed out loss (which depends on both the firm survival rate, and the ability to claw-back from firms that sell intellectual property or undergo a change in ownership), and the timeframe for repayment. This additional sensitivity analysis indicates that if the number of firms who receive a cashed-out Joss or the repayment rate is higher or lower than expected, both the average fiscal cost and year-to-year variation could change. 64. Another risk is that the initiative is poorly targeted and includes taxpayers outside the target group of R&D start-ups. This would reduce the effectiveness of the policy while increasing its fiscal cost. This occurrence is thought to be of relatively low risk as the eligibility requirements are relatively narrow and focus on excluding companies that are able to use their tax losses or are not cash- t1ow and capital-constrained. 65. There is some risk that taxpayers could attempt to recharacterise non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure to meet the eligibility requirements or inflate the size of their cashed-out 12 loss. This risk will be mitigated by using wage and salary expenditure to determine eligibility and as a basis (with a multiplier to approximate other R&D expenditun~) for calculating the amount of the cashed-out loss. Wage and salary expenditure is harder to recharacterise compared with other types of expenditure. Social, environment and cultural impacts 66. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with the preferred option. Net impact of the preferred option 67. As mentioned above, the proposal can be considered as transferring a timing advantage from the Government to eligible businesses. On balance, this timing advantage is expected to be much more valuable to target businesses (cash-constrained R&D start-ups) than to the Government, and is therefore expected to have a positive impact at the margin on incentives to invest in R&D as well as the likelihood of successful i1movation. 68. On balance, the preferred option largely meets the objectives of the project. Allowing R&D start-ups to access their tax losses from qualifying R&D expenditure reduces the distortion from the current tax treatment of losses. There is some fiscal risk but the overall estimated cost of the option is lower than that of a grant as this option only provides a timing advantage to R&D strut-ups that is repayable out of future returns. Pruticular emphasis has been placed on providing a balance around reducing compliance and administration costs with minimising avoidance and evasion following public consultation; however, the administration regime is still to be determined. The proposed initiative is consistent with the Business Growth Agenda as it removes a barrier to investment in innovative businesses. 69. As a result, it is expected that the net benefits of the policy (before taking into account administration and implementation costs) will be positive relative to the status quo. We also consider it highly unlikely that the overall administration costs will change the nature of this assessment as this analysis has considered an administration regime option with a relatively high cost-although we note that these are still subject to finalisation in the Business Case. CONSULTATION 70. An officials' issues paper, R&D tax losses was released by the Treasury and Inland Revenue for public consultation on 23 July 2013. A total of 24 submissions were received from a range of submitters including professional services firms, industry and other professional bodies, R&D companies and individuals. 71. Officials have also undertaken discussions with tax policy officials from the United Kingdom and Australia to discuss their experience with the operation of similar R&D tax initiatives. Submissions on the policy framework 72. The response from submitters was broadly positive, with the intent of the policy generally well received. Submitters were concerned with the overall complexity and compliance burden of the proposed solution, which would make it difficult and/or expensive for small R&D start-ups to comply with the policy's requirements. They felt that the overly 13 • restnct1ve nature of the eligibility criteria and a possibly time-consuming and complex application process were likely to be most problematiG in this an~a. 73. Submitters also suggested alternatives to a cashed-out loss. It was questioned whether the tax system is the appropriate vehicle to provide an R&D incentive. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has much greater expertise in assessing what is "true" R&D, and using the tax system adds complexity to what could be a much simpler loan scheme. A relaxation of the shareholder continuity rules was also proposed. The cunent requirement of 49 per cent of the original shareholding to maintain continuity is seen as a problem for many R&D start-ups, who breach the continuity threshold through the addition of new equity, and forfeit tax losses. Allowing taxpayers to cash-out losses addresses a problem, rather than the root cause of the current shareholder continuity rules. 74. As a result of consultation, we focused on updating the policy design with changes that we believed would alleviate compliance costs and complexity. These changes are noted in the policy detail section. 75. The alternatives suggested have not been considered further as they do not address the particular policy problem of the inability of R&D start-ups to access in a timely fashion, or at all, their tax losses. The loan scheme suggestion will reduce the cash-flow constraint faced by R&D start-ups, but not the wasted losses. The shareholder continuity proposal is less targeted and there are already provisions in the Income Tax Act which allow losses arising from R&D expenditure to be protected from a breach. Submissions on policy details 76. As mentioned above, submitters generally agreed with the overall objectives of the proposals as described above. However, written submissions on the issues paper and later meetings and conversations between submitters and Inland Revenue and Treasury officials also focussed on the detailed policy proposals put forward in the issues paper. 77. Although many of the features of the final policy proposal are consistent with the issues paper, the following table sets out the specific proposals that attracted the most submissions. For each issue it restates the original policy proposal and, if the final policy proposals have been altered as a result of consultation, what has changed and why. Where key submission points were not advanced as part of the final proposal, it explains the reasons why they were not considered appropriate: 14 Issues paper proposal R&D definition The issues paper proposed using the definitions of ·'research ' ' and "development" that are already used in NZIAS 38 and the Income Tax Act 2007. Submissions One group of submitters (mostly from professional services firms and industry bodies) noted that there is already a level of familiarity with this definition , which makes it more appropriate than developing new one. The alternative view (mostly from R&D companies) is that this definition will require R&D start-ups, which are understandably unfamiliar with accounting standards, to seek expensive external assistance. Officials' response It is proposed that Callaghan Innovation will determine the R&D eligibility of the applicant on behalf of Inland Rev;enue. The agencies' definitions of ' ' research " and " development'" do not materially differ as Callaghan Innovation 's definitions of " research " and " development ", like the ones currently in mse in the Income Tax Act 2007, are based on the New Zealand equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38 (NZIAS 38) . Concerns raised by submitters are valid , but some sort of definition of R&D is inevitable . Guidance to applicants should help reduce compliance costs in this area . The agency that administers the definition (Callaghan Innovation or Inland Revenue) and the way in which the definition is legislated for (as a proces s or as a statutory test) is dependent on the result of the Business Case. R&D wage intensity I Submitters raised concerns that using the R&D wage It is proposed that companies must spend at least 20 percent of intensity measure proposed in the issues paper would their total wage and salary expenditure on R&D to be eligible The issues paper proposed that companies must spend at severely curtail access to the policy because R&D start- for a cashed-out loss. This includes shareholder sa laries, least 20 percent of their total PA YE wage and salary ups often use alternatives to PA YE wages and salaries. contracted labour and contracted R&D within the measure in expenditure on R&D to be eligible for a cashed-out loss.

The contracted supplier of wage intensity measure as the equity provided cannot be valued the R&D would be unlikely to provide this information objectively or accurately to the contractor in the invoice. Submitters advised that listed R&D-intensive companies I The proposal is consistent with the issues paper. Any remain capital-constrained. It was noted that excluding developments in this area, such as the establishment of a stock 15 • The issues paper proposed that companies listed on a I listed companies provides a disincentive for growing I exchange that targets high-growth and innovative firm s, will be recognised stock exchange are ineligible because they R&D companies to list on a stock exchange. followed closely by officials . are not cash-flow and capital-constrained to the same degree as R&D start-up companies. Excluded activities The issues paper proposed a list of excluded activities based on the previous R&D tax credit, as well as excluding clinical trials and late stage software development. This was based on officials' concerns, based on experiences with the previous R&D tax credit, that despite these activities being associated with technological progress , they may not actually meet the definition of R&D. Including these activities could pose a fiscal risk as expenditure on these activities is significant. Excluded expenditure The issues paper proposed the following exclusions: Interest expenses on R&D. The purchase of existing R&D assets. R&D undertaken offshore. All lease payment s for R&D equipment. Expenditure funded by government grants or research funding. Submitters opposed the exclusions of clinical trials, and provided further information of what they entail. Clinical trials go through a number of stages. In general, stage one and two clinical trials are exploratory in nature while stage three (and four , if undertaken) confirms existing findings from earlier trial s. Submitters also opposed the exclusion of late stage software development and requested greater clarity around the exclusion. Submitters generally accepted that there were aspects of software development that were not R&D, especially in the area of 'e nd-user testing ', but detailed guidelines should be provided around what is and what isn 't R&D in this space . Submitters noted that many R&D start-ups are not able to finance the purchase of capital equipment with either debt or equity, but can only afford to lease the equipment initially. We propose using Callaghan Innovation's list of spec ific exclusions from their Growth grant, which li sts excluded activities that will not be considered R&D. This is si milar to the list of excluded activities already proposed in the issues paper and that was used for the previous R&D tax credit. The list is not exhaustive and activities not listed must still satisfy the R&D definition. If the Business Case is not approved and Callaghan Innovation is not involved in the administration ofthe policy, it is likely to be preferable to revert to the list of excluded activities propo se d in the issues paper. The two li sts are materially the same , but using the list based on the previous R&D tax credit will provide additional familiarity for Inland Revenue. The proposal is largely consistent with the issues paper. These expenses were excluded on the basis that they may distort economic decisions, endanger the integrity of the policy , or create inequity between taxpayers in a similar position . Leasing and financing with debt are not substitutes im this situation . Excluding this expenditure would reduce the qualifying R&D expenditure unnecessarily for the tm ;geted group. Officials therefore propose not excluding expenditure on operating (shorter-term) leases . Expenditure funded by government grants has also been removed from the exclusion list as this expenditure is generally not deductible , and therefore does not contribute to a loss . Loss recovery rules I Submitters were concerned that such an approach would To address these concerns, we propose that when 90% 0f the involve significant compliance and administration shares in the company are sold , loss recovery is triggered for The issues paper proposed that loss recovery should take I concerns around knowledge of the level of cashed-out the company. 16 .. place when: I loss the company held. The 5% threshold was also much - the company se ll s intellectual property; - the sa le of the company; - a 5% share holdin g was sold and that loss recovery income should arise to the shar eho lder involved. The overall polic y intent is to provide a temporary cash- flow benefit for R&D start- ups that will be repaid out of their future taxable income . However , of the R&D start - up s that derive income , not all derive income that is taxable . If the value of the cashed-out loss is not recovered from capital (non-taxable) gains , then the interest -free loan becomes a grant, and the fiscal risk of the policy is much greater. Therefore measures are proposed to recover the value of the cashed-out lo ss where investor s or the R&D start -up makes a capital return . too low. 17 Loss recovery shou ld take plac e when a taxpayer w ith a cashed-out loss or investor makes a capital return, or to pTotect the inte grity oftax base. " Loss recovery events '· are: the company se ll s int e llectual property; 90% of the sha res in the company are so ld ; the company becomes non-re side nt (for tax purposes) ; or the company is liquidated . The 90% threshold , rather than I 00% , is to account for possible private equity ownership interest s being retained. We expect that share holders will indirectl y bear this li a bility as a ny buyer knowing of the los s recovery rule s s hould pay le ss f<Dr the shares than they would otherwise. We propose requmng R&D start -up s to rein state their tax losses if a loss recovery event takes place. The payment to reinstate losse s will not be deemed income for tax purposes , but represents the loan repayment nece ssary to convert their cashed-out lo sses back into lo sses arising from R&D expenditure to carry forward to apply agai nst future income. This also reinforce s that cashed-out lo sses are in the natuve of a loan and not a grant. • r.;- ·• I' • CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 78. For the reasons set out in the "Regulatory Impact Analysis" section of this statement, we recommend that a set of tax rules be enacted that would allow R&D-intensive stm1-up companies to "cash out" (or refund) their tax losses arising from qualifying R&D expenditure, rather than carrying the loss forward to deduct against future income. 79. We also recommend that the revised rules have the key features set out from paragraph 29 of the "Regulatory Impact Analysis" section. 80. The Treasury was consulted and agrees with our conclusions and recommendations. IMPLEMENTATION 81. The proposed initiative will have some system implications for Inland Revenue which contribute to the implementation costs. Both the systems implications and implementation cost will vary depending on the administrative option chosen. 82. The proposed initiative should apply from income years starting on or after 1 April 2015. It should therefore be included in the next available omnibus tax bill scheduled for later this year, which in turn means that the legislation will not be passed ahead of the 1 April 2015 start date. It is anticipated that there would be a degree of retrospectivity compared to the start date, but as this initiative is advantageous to taxpayers this should not be of concern. Even with legislative introduction in early 2015, it would be passed by the time that taxpayers' losses crystallise for the first year of the policy on 31 March 2016. 83. The changes will be communicated to taxpayers through the usual legislative means, including a detailed commentary to the bill when introduced and a summary of the final rules in a Tax Information Bulletin once the enacting legislation has received Royal Assent. Inland Revenue will also provide guidance for potential applicants on eligible R&D. 84. The proposed initiative is a complement to other tax and non-tax R&D incentives. The R&D grant programmes administered by Callaghan Innovation target more mature innovative businesses relative to the smaller and younger R&D stm1-ups targeted by the R&D tax losses policy. 85. Taxpayers will continue to self-assess their tax liability; however, their R&D eligibility and R&D expenditure will be assessed by either Inland Revenue or Callaghan Innovation. This is necessary to reduce a fiscal risk arising from taxpayers outside the target group of R&D stm1-ups erroneously claiming a cashed-out loss or applicants recharacterising non- R&D expenditure to obtain a larger cashed-out loss. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 86. Monitoring the effect of these changes will fall under Inland Revenue's responsibilities under the generic tax policy process (GTTP). The GTTP is a multi-stage process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage of this process contemplates the implementation and review stage, which can involve Inland Revenue conducting a post-implementation review of the legislation and identifying any remedial issues. 18
Regulatory Impact Statement Review of the implementation of the simplified filing requirements for individuals' legislation Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question addressed in this statement is whether the implementation of legislation for simplified filing requirements for individuals (SFRI), which was enacted in 2012 and is not due to take effect until the 2016-17 year, is a sound investment. Inland Revenue considers that a significant proportion of the projected revenue gains of $217 million from SFRI will be eroded due to the changes expected under Inland Revenue's Business Transformation (BT) Programme, which is aimed at simplifying New Zealand's tax administration system. As a result, the SFRI legislation should not be implemented. The policy underlying the SFRI legislation was set three years ago. At that time, the Government was concerned about the inherent tension between individuals who are not required to file an income tax return and those who are. This tension gives rise to complexity in meeting obligations and creates fairness and equity concerns for some individuals. Individuals who are required to file an income tax return may have a tax debt in one year and receive a refund in another year. For individuals who are not required to file, however, there is no incentive to file an income tax return in order to square-up in years of tax debt, but they can easily claim any available refunds. The practice of filing income tax returns in those years in which an individual is due a refund is referred to as "cherry picking" and has become prevalent especially with the introduction of personal tax summary (PTS) intermediaries. This practice has also resulted in a situation where large amounts of revenue are being paid out in refunds, without a reciprocal obligation on taxpayers to pay any tax debt. SFRI legislation is aimed at addressing the fairness and equity concerns by removing the ability for people to cherry pick and by removing the requirement for others to file income tax returns. Inland Revenue's current BT thinking for individual salary and wage earners is for more streamlined processes with salary and wage earners' information being provided by third parties such as employers and banks to Inland Revenue and Inland Revenue undertaking the necessary calculations. This should lead to a more accurate P AYE structure, which means fewer people in a refund or tax debt position at the end of the year. If it were adopted, the current BT vision will represent a significant change in direction in dealing with end of year tax debts and refunds and draws into question the assumptions on which the SFRI legislation is based, and therefore whether it should now be implemented. Inland Revenue' s review of the implementation of the SFRI legislation concluded that the benefits and policy outcomes sought by SFRI can be delivered by BT but in a more coherent way that aligns with our vision of a proactive and efficient tax administration. The preferred option is to repeal the SFRI legislation. This is intended to reduce compliance costs and confusion for a large group of individuals who would need to change their interactions with Inland Revenue under SFRI and then again under BT. We acknowledge, however, that there may be a negative effect on public trust and confidence in the tax administration system due to major changes being enacted and then repealed prior to implementation. Repealing the SFRI legislation will also reduce administration costs for Inland Revenue as it will avoid creating resource contention issues across Inland Revenue's entire change portfolio and BT. In particular, highly skilled FIRST resources would have been needed to work on SFRI at a time when these resources would be required for BT. The most significant dependency of the analysis is the ability oflnland Revenue to deliver the BT programme by the indicative timeline. If Inland Revenue does not implement the BT programme and deliver the expected benefits of an improved PAYE structure by 2019-20, then this will affect Inland Revenue's assessment ofthe SFRI investment. No public consultation was undertaken on the option to repeal the SFRI legislation. We considered there would be very little benefit in consulting with the affected groups because repeal would be taxpayer-friendly, and the affected groups would not have adjusted their behaviour in line with the SFRI changes as these changes are not due to take affect for another three years. Even so, Inland Revenue hosted a conference "A Tax Administration for the 21st Century'' in June 2014. Some tax practitioners and representatives from PTS intermediaries who attended the conference questioned the relevance of the SFRI legislation given the current BT vision and supported the repeal ofthe SFRI legislation. There are no other significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. The preferred option does not impact private property rights, restrict market competition, or override fundamental common law principles. The status quo option will reduce the net amount of refunds available to individuals and this will also affect the current business model of the personal tax intermediary market. These implications were canvassed in the July 2011 Regulatory Impact Statement Simplifying filing requirements for individuals and record-keeping requirements for businesses. Ro Grindle \\ Ac ·ng Deputy Commissioner, Change ~land Revenue 22 July 2014 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Background 1. New Zealand's current tax administration is heavily reliant on paper-based processes such as the annual return-filing system. These processes are both costly and time consuming as they increase taxpayer contacts with Inland Revenue. In the last 10 years, the number of contacts with taxpayers has increased significantly and the resulting processing has created considerable pressure on the administration ofthe tax system. The increase in contacts is due in part to the expansion oflnland Revenue's responsibilities into social policy administration and the requirement for social policy recipients to file an income tax return. 2. Also driving the increase in contacts is the large number of individuals able to self- select to file an income tax return in years in which they are due a refund. This has resulted in a significantly increased workload for Inland Revenue as people re-enter the annual filing system. Some taxpayers are required to file an income tax return (and pay any tax debts) simply because they are, for example Working for Families (WfF) recipients, whereas other taxpayers who are not required to file, have the ability to "cherry pick" the years they filed on the basis of whether they are to receive a tax refund or have a tax debt. This practice has become prevalent especially with the introduction of personal tax summary (PTS) intermediaries and has also resulted in a situation where a large amount of revenue is being paid out, without a reciprocal obligation on taxpayers to pay any tax debt. 3. The simplified filing requirements for individuals (SFRI) initiatives introduced in 2012 are aimed at addressing fairness and equity concerns by stopping people cherry picking, and removing the requirement for WfF recipients to file income tax returns. Previous Cabinet decisions 4. In June 2010, Cabinet agreed to the release of the discussion document, Making tax easier, which outlined various proposals for transforming the way that Inland Revenue engages with employers, businesses and individuals \[EGI Min ( 1 0) 1111 0\]. 5. In August 2011, in response to feedback on the discussion document, several initiatives were developed and considered by Cabinet, namely: • an "e" awareness campaign and enhancements to Inland Revenue's online service for individuals (no legislation was required); • amalgamating two major tax returns, theIR 3 and personal tax summary (PTS) returns; • delinking the requirement to file a personal tax return if the person is receiving Working for Families (WfF) tax credits. ("WfF delinking"); and • requiring a person to file income tax returns for the past four years, if they are not otherwise required to file, but they choose to do so , to prevent cherry picking of refunds ("4+ 1 square-up"). 6. The three legislative initiatives were to take effect from 1 April 2015. 3 7. Cabinet agreed to the package of initiatives and their inclusion in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Bill. \[EGI Min (11) 17/14, CAB Min (11) 30/8\] 8. In early April 2012, it was identified by Inland Revenue that if the package of initiatives were to be implemented it would have placed significant pressure on Inland Revenue's ability to implement any future change initiatives, including the Student Loan Redesign Project (which was already underway) and the Child Support Reform Programme (which was in the initial stages of implementation). 9. At the time, Cabinet was advised by Inland Revenue that there was a way to deliver a less resource intensive and system-reliant solution for the package of initiatives, but it would involve not proceeding with the amalgamation of the IR 3 and the PTS returns. Cabinet agreed that in the interest of maintaining maximum organisational stability for and flexibility within Inland Revenue, the amalgamation of the two returns was removed from the Bill. Cabinet also agreed that the implementation dates for the two remaining legislative initiatives; WfF decoupling and the 4+1 square-up would be deferred for two years (the 2016-17 income year). \[EGI Min (12) 6/17, CAB Min (12) 12/6C\] 10. The Cabinet decisions were included in the officials' report that was delivered to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on 30 April 2012. There were no other significant changes made to the package of initiatives in the following Parliamentary stages. 11. The Bill containing the SFRI initiatives was enacted in November 2012. 12. The "e" awareness campaign and enhancements to Inland Revenue's online service for individuals are well underway. Key initiatives under this campaign include eUptake specific marketing to migrate more taxpayers to Inland Revenue's digital space and direct taxpayer education on Inland Revenue's online services and reduce use of cheques. High-level review of the implementation of the SFRI legislation 13. In December 2013, the Minister of Revenue directed Inland Revenue to undertake a high-level review of the benefits, costs and impacts of implementing the SFRI legislation and to consider the viability of the SFRI investment in the light of the recent progress on the Business Transformation (BT) Programme. This direction was in response to concerns raised by Inland Revenue about its ability to implement the legislation by the legislative dates and the need to seek further funding to implement the legislation. 14. Inland Revenue's review concluded that the likely outcomes from BT will mean that implementing the SFRI legislation is now no longer a sound investment. This conclusion was based on Inland Revenue's examination of the benefits and costs of implementing SFRI and how BT will affect the policy outcomes sought under SFRI. SFRI impacts 15. The estimated revenue gains expected from SFRI were $217 million over a period of seven years, starting from the 2016-17 year. These gains mainly result from the 4+ 1 square- up initiative, as individuals will no longer be able to cherry pick the years in which to file an income tax return based on whether they receive a refund. They will instead be required to file tax returns for the last four years in addition to the current year in which they have chosen to file an income tax return. 4 16. The estimated cost to implement SFRI is in the vicinity of $3 5 million to $45 million. Inland Revenue currently has $14.463 million to implement the SFRI legislation 1 . A further $20 million to $30 million will be required to implement the legislation. 17. By the end of the 2018-19 year (the year before BT is expected to start delivering benefits linked to streamlining P AYE), Inland Revenue would have spent a cumulative $3 5 million to $45 million implementing the SFRI legislation for estimated revenue of $36 million. 2 This means the return on investment for the period up to 2018-19 would be between $0.80 to $1.03 for every dollar spent. 18. The original analysis undertaken in 2011 determined that the 4+ 1 square-up would affect 310,000 individuals and the WfF decoupling change would affect 330,000 individuals. The 4+ 1 square-up group has now increased to over 500,000 due to the efforts of PTS intermediaries. The impacts of these initiatives were canvassed in the July 2011 Regulatory Impact Statement Simplifying filing requirements for individuals and record-keeping requirements for businesses. How Business Transformation affects SFRI 19. Inland Revenue is currently embarking on a Business Transformation (BT) programme, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to simplify New Zealand's tax administration system. This is more than a "computer" project - rather, it is a comprehensive transformation of Inland Revenue's operating model. This is likely to include future policy changes. 20. The outcome roadmap for BT noted by Cabinet in August 2013 displays the desired outcomes of transformation, grouped in four stages. Stage 1 focuses on securing digital services including streamlining the collection of P AYE information and is due to be delivered between years 1 to 6 of the programme. Stage 2 ofBT envisages streamlining business taxes and will include work on improving the accuracy ofPAYE deductions. Stage 3 will focus on the delivery of social policies Inland Revenue administers. Stage 4 looks at other taxes. 21. Inland Revenue's current BT thinking for salary and wage earners is for more streamlined processes with salary and wage earner information being provided to Inland Revenue by third parties and Inland Revenue undertaking the necessary tax calculations. This should lead to a more accurate P AYE structure, which means fewer people in a refund or tax debt position at the end of the year. With real-time information and analytical tools, refunds would automatically be given out removing the need for people to file an income tax return to get a refund, and debts would be automatically rolled over to new periods, so "cherry picking would be non-existent. 22. If it were adopted, the current BT VISion would represent a significant change in direction in dealing with end of year under and over payments of P AYE and draws into question the assumptions on which the SFRI legislation are based, and therefore whether it should now be implemented. 1 This amount comprises appropriated funds of $6.263 million and delegated authority for Inland Revenue to spend up to $8.2 million from its capital reserves. 2 The $36 million is based on the revised revenue gains expected from SFRI. It comprises $4 million in 2016-17, $7 million in 2017-18, and$25 million in 2018-19. 5 23. On current plan, it is envisaged BT will deliver a more improved P AYE structure by the 2019-20 year. This would make P AYE more accurate and make a significant difference to reducing, over time, the number of individuals who would need to square-up at the end ofthe year. 24. The benefits arising from BT stages 1 and 2 that are relevant to the consideration of SFRI are as follows: • BT stage 1 will deliver more accurate P AYE, therefore reducing the need for square-ups by improving the accuracy of tax codes being used by customers, providing near real-time validation of tax codes, and integrating information collection requirements and rules for PA YE into payroll software to minimise errors on a pay-period basis. Inland Revenue's recent experience with student loans has shown that getting people on the right tax code early reduces down- stream errors and increases repayment levels. • BT stage 2 will follow with further improvements in PA YE, including integrating withholding requirements and rules for PAYE into payroll software to increase the accuracy of withholding deductions on a pay-period basis and deploying upfront analytical tools to validate and verify data. 25. The BT changes for individual salary and wage earners and their expected impacts, outcomes and benefits are set out in diagram 1. Improving the accuracy of tax codes being used by individual salary and wage earners and providing near real-time validation of tax codes would mean deductions are accurate from the outset. This will mean reduced year-end square ups and more accurate assessment of social policy entitlements through improved income data. The benefits from BT would include reduced administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for individuals. Diagram 1 v • Tax codes and deductions checked up front at the start of employment • Information validated at the point of entry Change • lnfonnation received sooner y • Deductions accurate from the outset Impact • Able to detect and correct deductions sooner y • Reduced year-end square-ups Outcome • More accurate assessment of social policy entitlements through improved income data y • Reduction in administrative costs from less processing and fewer customer interactions • Reduction in compliance costs, as customers will have fewer interactions with Inland Revenue Benefits • Reduction in debt and recovery activity, as there will be fewer people needing to square-up 26. The revenue gain estimates for BT stage 1 indicate financial benefits of $500 million- $700 million and economic benefits (improved customer experience and compliance cost savings) of $1 billion-$2.2 billion over a 10-year period. Most of these benefits are expected to be realised from 2019-20 onwards. Inland Revenue is not in a position to provide a detailed yearly break-down at this time. 6 27. The estimates of the BT benefits will be validated as part of the first detailed design business case, which is expected to be completed in November 2014. This process will include consultation with customers and third parties to confirm the nature, extent and timing of these benefits. 28. Diagram 2 highlights the interplay between BT and SFRI. The bottom row of boxes indicates the cumulative net effect of the SFRI investment for the period from 2013 to 2021. The first year in which the SFRI investment becomes positive (the estimated revenue exceeds estimated costs) is the 2019-20 year, and this is when BT is also expected to start delivering its benefits of more accurate PAYE and reduced need for individuals to square-up. The positive outcomes which were expected to arise from SFRI in 2019-20 and beyond will not now be realised as the revenue gains from SFRI will cease from that point. Diagram 2 Year SFRI (Cumulative net impact- revenue minus costs ($million) WfF 4+1 square-up delivered delivered SFRI/BT crossover The first stage of BT will deliver more accurate P AYE and reduced need for square-up The next stage of BT will make further improvements in P AYE deductions II 1 19.610 1 1 63.310 1 J 29. In the 2019-20 year the SFRI benefits will cease as the SFRI policy settings are superseded by the BT policy settings. 30. The intersection of SFRI and BT would also potentially cause significant taxpayer confusion given that the two projects are operating to significantly different policy settings. This could lead to increased taxpayer contacts with Inland Revenue as taxpayers require more assistance to understand the changes and this would give rise to increased costs for both parties. 31. Inland Revenue's review concluded that the SFRI legislation should not be implemented on the basis that the revenue gains of $217 million from SFRI will be eroded by BT. On current plan, BT will deliver a more improved P AYE structure, which will make PA YE more accurate and substantially reduce the number of individuals with a material refund or tax debt at the end of the year. Consequently, as SFRI was only ever seen as a "back-end" solution (i.e., stopping people "cherry picking" thereby reducing the incentive to file) to a "front-end" problem of inaccurate PA YE deductions during the year, the policy outcomes sought under SFRI will not be realised from 2019-20 onwards. 7 OBJECTIVES 32. The objectives of this review are to ensure that: a) changes made to the current tax administration for individual salary and wage earners align with the BT vision of a proactive and efficient tax administration; b) the Government's revenue base is maintained; c) Inland Revenue can maintain its organisational stability and flexibility so that it can manage its change portfolio including BT; d) individual salary and wage earners have certainty of tax treatment and compliance costs are minimised. 33. The key objective in this analysis is objective (a). This is because the BT vision will set the future framework in which all policy changes will need to comply with. There may need to be a trade-off between the objective of maintaining the Government's revenue base and the other objectives. For example, implementing the status quo will address the cherry picking issue (and the revenue leakage) but it is also inconsistent with the BT vision and is likely to put pressure on Inland Revenue to manage its current change portfolio. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 34. Inland Revenue's high-level review considered a range of options for addressing the problem definition and achieving the objectives. These options ranged from implementing the SFRI legislation in whole, in part and not at all. 3 5. We also considered scaling back the SFRI legislation in order to mm1m1se implementation costs. However, as the underlying premise of the SFRI initiatives did not align well with the BT vision, the scale back options were not further explored. Furthermore, although it would have been possible to implement the 4+ 1 square-up change without the need to deliver WfF delinking, it would not have been sensible to deliver WfF delinking without the 4+ 1 square-up as it would still have allowed WfF customers to cherry pick. 36. The options analysed in this RIS are: • Option 1 -implement the SFRI legislation as enacted (status quo). This option would commence with the development of a better business case, which would examine both the solution and costs in more detail and establish how this initiative will be funded. • Option 2 -repeal the SFRI legislation. Under this option taxpayers will continue to have the ability to cherry pick until the BT measures are implemented in 2019-20. Analysis of options 37. The tables below set out our assessment of the two options against the objectives and summarises the impacts of each of option relative to the status quo. 8 TABLE 1: ANALYSIS OF OPTION 1 Impacts Option Meets Net impact objectives Administrative and compliance Economic and fiscal impacts impacts Equity and risks 1.

There are both social and cultural impacts associated with the options considered above. The SFRI initiatives address concerns of fairness and equity with the current tax administration system. Although some taxpayers are required to file (and pay any tax debts) simply because they are, for example WfF recipients, other taxpayers who are not required to file, have the ability to "cherry pick" the years they filed on the basis of whether they were to receive a tax refund or had a tax debt. Repealing the SFRI legislation will mean that the current tax administration will continue to be unfair for those taxpayers that are required to file and may negatively affect their trust and confidence in the current tax administration system. This could in tum impact on taxpayer compliance overall. 39. There are no environmental impacts associated with any of the options. Net impact of all options 40. The preferred option to repeal the SFRI legislation (option 2) addresses the problem by removing an inefficient means to reforming the tax administration for salary and wage earners in the light of the BT vision. It also achieves most of the objectives - that is, it ensures changes that are inconsistent with the BT vision are not made, and compliance and administrative costs are minimised overall. 41. Inland Revenue does not support the status quo (option 1) because it does not address the problem and is inconsistent with the current BT vision. CONSULTATION 42. Inland Revenue has not undertaken public consultation on the option to repeal the SFRI legislation. We considered there will be very little benefit in consulting with the affected groups on the preferred option of repealing the SFRI legislation on the basis that repeal will be see as taxpayer friendly, and these groups would not have adjusted their behaviour in line with the SFRI changes as these changes are not due to take affect for another three years. 43. In June 2014, Inland Revenue hosted the conference "A Tax Administration for the 21st Century''. Some tax practitioners and representatives ofPTS intermediaries who attended the conference questioned the relevance of the SFRI legislation in the light of BT vision and supported its repeal. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 44. Inland Revenue recommends that the SFRI legislation be repealed, as: • it is now no longer a sound investment given the BT programme of change; • on current plan, BT will deliver the benefits of SFRI (i.e., stop "cherry picking" and reduced return filing leading to fewer customer contacts) but will do so in a more proactive and efficient way. 11 • the intersection of SFRI and BT is likely to cause compliance costs and confusion for taxpayers given that the two initiatives are operating under significantly different policy settings; • it will help Inland Revenue to better manage its entire change portfolio and BT. 45. Given the above, we consider the repeal of the SFRI legislation to be preferable to implementing the legislation. Furthermore, repealing the SFRI legislation would reduce administrative and compliance costs overall. The status quo option would have the opposite effect. IMPLEMENTATION 46. Repeal legislation should be included in the next available taxation bill, which IS scheduled for introduction in November 2014. 4 7. Although the SFRI legislation is enacted it still has a further three years before it takes effect. Therefore, repealing the legislation as soon as possible will ensure that there is sufficient time to signal to the affected groups that the SFRI changes are not being implemented. The Minister of Revenue will issue a media statement on the proposed repeal when the tax bill containing the repeal legislation is introduced into the House. Once enacted, Inland Revenue will communicate the repeal as part of its business as usual communications relating to legislative changes. 48. Repealing the SFRI legislation will not negatively impact the affected groups. Individuals will continue to have the ability to cherry pick the years in which they have a refund and WfF recipients will file annual income tax returns but most of these recipients are either in a refund position and will file anyway, or are required to file under another tax law. Additionally, repealing the SFRI legislation should avoid taxpayer confusion that could have resulted from the intersection of SFRI and BT - two reforms operating under significantly different policy settings. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 49. There will be opportunities for interested parties and the general public to comment on the SFRI legislation and its repeal if the preferred option is adopted, both through submissions on the taxation bill containing the repeal, and as part the BT programme. This is because Ministers instructed officials to ensure that the policy outcomes that the SFRI legislation sought to address are included in the BT programme. 50. In general, Inland Revenue's monitoring, evaluating and reviewing of new legislation takes place takes under the GTPP. The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 12

The statement provides an analysis of options to change the child support scheme reforms, enacted in 2013 but not yet in force, in order to recognise the increased priority of reducing child support debt and to reduce the administrative cost of implementing the reforms. The statement reviews the child support reforms as enacted and considers whether alternative options could continue to provide the benefits the reforms seek but at a lower implementation cost. Another key consideration in the analysis is whether the reforms, and components of the reforms, reduce child support debt. The decision to introduce the child support reforms was accompanied by a Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) Child support scheme reform of 26 July 2011. The earlier RIS contains background information and analysis that is useful to the options considered in this RIS, particularly the status quo. There was consultation with a range of Government agencies and significant public consultation on child support issues over a long period of time culminating in the Child Support Amendment Act 2013. However, there has been limited consultation on the subsequent options in this statement given the timing constraints on decision-making and the sensitivity of the decisions being considered. Some assumptions have been made on the number of people who may be affected by aspects of the reforms yet to come into force and the likely impact on compliance behaviour, based on existing administrative data. These assumptions impact on the analysis on the likely benefits from various options and the impact of different options on the debt book. There are no other significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. None of the policy options would restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, unduly impair private property rights or override fundamental common law principles. Some options would reduce costs on some businesses that employ parents who pay child support, although these costs were not thought to be significant and already form part of the existing P AYE processes. Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 4 June 2014 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 3 of 94 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Background 1. As at 31 March 2014, the New Zealand child support scheme was providing fmancial support for around 203,500 children. There were 134,800 receiving carers and 136,000 liable parents with current liabilities. However, there are another 43,800 liable parents who have no current liability but owe arrears. Of the liable parents, 125,000 are in debt. In the 2013/14 tax year there were around 41,000 new child support applications and around 24,000 receiving carers left the child support scheme. 2. The scheme was established by the Child Support Act 1991, which revised the rules relating to child maintenance when agreement between parents proved difficult or when the receiving parent was a beneficiary. The Child Support Act 1991 sets out the requirements for applying for child support, the means of determining liability, and processes for payments and objections. 3. The child support scheme is administered by Inland Revenue, which is responsible for both assessing contributions and collecting payments. The child support scheme is voluntary for parents unless the caregiver is receiving a sole-parent benefit or Unsupported Child Benefit. The majority of people in the child support scheme are beneficiaries. Reasons for the review of the 1991 scheme 4. Although the current child support scheme provides a relatively straightforward way of calculating child support liability for the majority of parents, there are some major concerns that seem to be affecting an increasing number of parents (and therefore children). 5. The primary assumption under the current scheme is that the paying parent is the sole income earner and that the receiving carer is the main care provider. The formula assessment is therefore focused on the paying parent and their ability to pay. However, today when parents live apart, there is an increased emphasis on shared parental responsibility and both parents remaining actively involved in their children's lives. Work participation rates of both parents, particularly in part-time work, has also increased since the scheme was introduced, resulting in the principal carer of the children now being more likely to be in paid work or seeking paid work. 6. Escalating levels of accumulated child support debt, relating in particular to child support penalties, is increasingly becoming an issue. Child support debt now exceeds $3 billion, with 75% of the amount being penalties. 7. The scheme is now, in many cases, out of date and out of line with social expectations. This undermines some parents' incentives to meet their child support obligations and therefore detrimental to the wellbeing of their children. 2 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 4 of 94 Original policy problems 8. The child support scheme was reformed in 2013 to address the main policy problems identified at the time. These included: • whether the current child support system accurately reflects the expenditure for raising children in varying family circumstances in New Zealand; • whether greater levels of shared care and other regular care should be taken into account when calculating child support; • whether both parents' income should be taken into account when calculating the child support to be paid; • whether incentives to make payments can be improved by changing the child support penalty rules and write-off provisions. 9. The main change of the 2013 reforms has been to shift the focus ofthe child support formula assessment from assessing the liability of the paying parent, to focusing on the level of support that is required from each parent for each qualifYing child. In doing so, it considers a greater range of shared care, the income of all parents of the child (including legal step-parents), and the average cost of raising the child (taking into account other children of the parents). At the same time, changes were made to the general administrative processes and rules around payments and debts to improve incentives to make timely payments. 10. More information on the background and the reasons for reviewing the 1991 scheme can be found in the earlier Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) Child support scheme reform prepared by Inland Revenue for the original reforms, dated 26 July 2011 and released November 2011 (see http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/type/ris). The RIS also considered the problems with the 1991 scheme, the consultation undertaken and analysis of the options for addressing the problems. Child Support Amendment Act 2013 11. Following consultation on a range of options, the child support scheme was amended by the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 (Amendment Act). However, the reforms are yet to come into effect. 12. The Amendment Act comes into effect from different dates. The application, formula assessment and notification process is due to come into effect from 1 April 2015 (first phase of changes). These changes specifically address the first three bullet points of the original policy problems. The changes to the payment process, penalties and debt come into effect from 1 April 2016, along with other policy changes (second phase of changes) 1 . These changes specifically address the last bullet point of the original policy problems. 1 Changes to liabilities for prisoner and long-term hospital patients came into effect on I April 2014. These were small changes that required no system changes to implement. There are also transitional provisions that came into effect from date of Royal assent. 3 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 5 of 94 13. The specific reform changes are to be implemented in two phases and are set out in the box below. First Phase The first phase includes the new formula, the new assessment, the reassessment process and the issuing of notices. It concerns changes that come into effect from 1 April2015. The new formula includes: • the estimated average cost of raising children in New Zealand, which will be annually updated; • a lower level of minimum shared care, being 28% of nights (down from 40%); • the child support income of both parents, not just the liable parent; • recognising where there may be more than two parents (such as legally recognised step-parents); • recogmsmg where a parent has qualifying children in multiple relationships. The formula will continue to determine a child support income amount. The child support income includes: • a living allowance based on equivalent levels of welfare benefits, but will no longer provide an allowance for a new spouse; • a dependent child allowance. Children from a new relationship, who are not legally dependent on the parent, will no longer be included in dependent child allowances; • a multiple relationship allowance to recognise the cost of child support paid for children in other relationships; • a new simplified process for measuring taxable income if the person only has calendar year income that is withheld at source, for example, wages. There is an updated process for parents who wish to estimate their taxable income for the year, which will also apply to receiving carers who are parents. A new assessment and reassessment process is established to collect the new information required for the formula. It also sets out that receiving carers will require care levels of35% of nights to qualify to receive payments. There will be greater Commissioner discretion to recognise significant daytime care for shared care purposes, and to rely on parenting orders when establishing care levels. Notices that are issued will contain additional information reflecting the changes to the formula. 4 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 6 of 94 Second Phase The second phase of the reforms includes the changes to the payment, penalties and debt write-off rules. It also includes other policy changes. The changes in the second phase come into effect from 1 April2016, or are not required until after the end of the child support year beginning April2015. The second phase includes: 2.1 a new defmition of "adjusted net income", which includes income adjustments to taxable income, such as income in trusts and companies; 2.2 a penalty for receiving carers who are parents and who underestimate their income for the year; 2.3 reducing the maximum age of a qualifying child from under 19 to under 18, unless they are 18 and still in full-time secondary education - aligning with Working for Families age limit; 2.4 compulsory deduction of child support from employment income, unless there are grounds for an exception such as privacy or cultural reasons; 2.5 a two stage late payment penalty with an immediate 2% late penalty, with the remainder of the current 10% penalty only being charged if the debt remains unpaid after seven days; 2.6 a reduction in the ongoing monthly penalty rate from 2% to 1% after a year; 2. 7 the ability to offset current payments against past debts where the liable parent and receiving carer swap roles (that is, where the child moves to live with the other parent); 2.8 relaxing the circumstances in which penalties can be written-off, including when a liable parent enters into an instalment arrangement or is in serious hardship, when debt recovery is an inefficient use oflnland Revenue's resources or when only low levels of penalty debt are outstanding, and allowing Inland Revenue to write off assessed debt owed to the Crown on serious hardship grounds; 2.9 recognising re-establishment costs as a grounds for an administrative review; 2.10 the discretion to recognise other payments, such as payment of school fees, as qualifying as child support payments where they directly benefit the child. 14. Further detail on the 1991 scheme and the 2013 scheme and the consultation undertaken can be found on Inland Revenue's websites, including the Tax Policy website (see http://www.ird.govt.nz/childsupportD 5 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 7 of 94 Impact of the reform 15. Analysis from 2011 determined the reforms to the child support formula would have fmancial implications for some parents. Parents Unaffected Receive more I pay Receive less I pay less more Receiving parents 82,230 (60%) 24,505 (18%) 29,776 (22%) Paying parents 57,823 (42%) 45,997 (34%) 32,691 (24%) 16. Overall, it was estimated that 70,502 parents would be better off under the changes (that is, they will receive more or pay less child support) and 62,467 worse off (that is, they will receive less or pay more). 17. For the majority of parents whose child support will be affected, the change in child support received and paid was estimated as likely to be between plus or minus $66 per month (plus or minus $800 per year). That was based on rates and data held at the time and assumptions were made where data was lacking such as the number of dependent children paying parents would have. 18. For a large percentage of receiving and paying parents (60 percent and 42 percent respectively), the changes to the formula would not result in any change in the amounts received or paid. A total of 140,053 parents would be unaffected. This is because many parents would continue to either receive a sole-parent benefit (and therefore not receive child support payments directly) or continue to pay the minimum contribution because their income level is below the minimum level for child support purposes. For those who would be affected, however, the reforms would represent a more transparent and equitable result in a greater number of different circumstances. 19. Parents who qualify for the wider recognition of share care would be most affected, with paying parents likely to pay less in such cases. Problem Defmition Impact on child support debt 20. The Minister of Revenue has indicated that reducing child support debt is a priority for child support policy. Child support debt is over $3 billion and growing. 75% of the debt is related to the penalties and the vast majority is over a year old. The penalty rate is approximately 37% a year (in addition to a late penalty payment of 10%), meaning the size of the penalty debt can soon eclipse the size of the child support assessment debt. Liable parents faced with large debt amounts may be discouraged from making further payments, especially if they are on a low income. Of the penalty debt, 97% is impaired (not expected to be collected). A disproportionate amount of debt is owed by parents living overseas. 21. The Amendment Act goes some way to addressing the issue of child support debt by improving the fairness of the scheme (and therefore acceptance by paying parents). In particular, the changes to reduce the penalty rate and allow for debt write-offs will reduce debt from 2016 but are unlikely to be a full solution. Child support debt remains a problem. 6 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 8 of 94 Cost of implementation 22. The original 2011 cost estimate for the programme to implement the reforms was $30 million. As the legislation was developed and greater details on the specific changes were determined and finalised, a business case was prepared in 2012. The business case revised the estimated cost up to $120 million over the ten year period from 2011-12 to 2021-22 (costs in the latter half of the period cover ongoing depreciation, capital charges and ongoing additional staff costs to administer the modernised scheme). The increase reflected a greater appreciation of the complexity of the changes proposed by the new formula. One of the main assumptions in the business case was that the vast majority of the expenditure would be operating cost. 23. The legislation was amended during the Parliamentary process in response to both changes recommended by officials and matters raised by submitters. For example, the level of shared care at which a receiving carer would qualify for payment was increased to 35%, but 28% of care was kept as the lower threshold for the formula assessment of child support liability. This meant some work already underway had to be significantly altered, increasing the costs and time for delivery. 24. During 2013 Inland Revenue re-assessed the time and costs associated with the programme and the assumptions underlying the business case. It became clear that the work could not be implemented, to the level of quality and certainty required, by the original legislative deadline. More time was required. Also, the assumption that the majority of development costs would be operating and not capital expenditure was proving to be incorrect as the reform was implemented. Capital expenditure comes with associated depreciation costs and capital charges leading to a higher overall cost for the reforms. If the correct assumption had been made in the business case, the cost of the reforms would have been much higher than $120 million. In early 2014, the legislative deadlines were delayed a year to allow time to complete the first phase to the standards required. The revised estimate of the project, including costs from the delay and the higher ratio of capital expenditure, is now $210 million for the ten year period from 2011112 to 2020/21. The majority of the higher cost is the depreciation and capital charge associated with the capital expenditure. 25. The higher estimated cost mean the implied benefit:cost ratio for implementing the reform has changed from when the Government originally made its decision. As a result, the Minister of Revenue requested a review of the reforms in light of the revised cost estimate. The Minister also requested a greater focus on reducing the child support debt book. Assessment of Status Quo 26. The status quo option is to implement the reforms as set out in the Amendment Act. The status quo meets the original objectives and policy problems and is expected to deliver the original non-quantified benefits considered in the earlier RIS of improved fairness, a modern scheme, and greater incentives to make timely payments. Implementing the status quo will require a higher cost than anticipated - meaning a lower value for money return to the Government. 7 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 9 of 94 27. The estimated cost of implementing the whole reform is estimated at $210 million over the ten year period. While the benefits of the reform are generally intangible, it is questionable whether the Government would have agreed to implement all of the reform components at the revised total cost. 28. The overarching fiscal objective ofthe Government has been to restrain the growth in government spending, reduce deficits and return to surplus. The additional cost of implementing the status quo will impact on the Government's operating balance meaning less spending elsewhere (where the value for money proposition may be higher), greater debt or lower surplus. 29. As the reform is made up of a number of components, the value for money of individual components will vary. Most of the reform elements are expected to have a positive impact on timely payments and reducing the growth of new debt, especially the changes to penalty and debt write-off provisions. Other elements of the reform will have a small or no impact on debt. In terms of reducing debt further, other non-legislative options may have a greater impact than elements of the child support reforms, especially as non- legislative options generally on only require operating costs and no capital expenditure. 30. While the status quo addresses the original policy problem and will mostly meet the priority of reducing child support debt, it does so at a higher than expected cost, and therefore represents less value for money than originally anticipated. Consequently, the status quo is no longer supported. OBJECTIVES 31. The objectives are to: a) reduce child support debt (or at least slow the growth); b) reduce the implementation cost ofthe reforms; c) improve the fairness of the child support scheme so that it reflects social and legal changes which have occurred since its introduction in 1992; d) promote the welfare of the children, in particular by recognising that children are disadvantaged when child support is not paid, or not paid on time. 32. High levels of debt can discourage paying parents from meeting their obligations leading to non-compliance and child support not being paid on time. A more responsive system with a better targeted payment and penalties system would encourage, or at least not discourage, parents to pay their child support, reduce debt and would help improve the well- being of their children. The cost of implementing changes to make the system more responsive should be commensurate with the likely and intended benefit. 33. Reducing the implementation cost would mean not delivering some of the changes that meet the other objectives. For example, not proceeding with the changes to the penalty rates would reduce the implementation costs but would not reduce child support debt, may be considered unfair and have a negative impact on compliance, ultimately resulting in disadvantage to the child of the parent. 8 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 10 of 94 Constraints 34. The Government has previously approved funding for $120 million and authorised the department to use a further $10 million of its capital reserves. There are significant constraints on additional funding over the next few years, particularly in the 2014115 fiscal year. The Government is unlikely to authorise new funding to meet the $210 million cost of the status quo. 35. As legislation is already in place, any further changes to legislation should be enacted before the existing provisions come into force, to avoid the prospect of retrospective application. Legislative changes that impact on child support assessments are required to be in place by February for a 1 April year as notices are sent out to parents in advance. Changes to the Inland Revenue's FIRST system take time to be implemented and checked, with the minimum time dependent on the complexity and type of change. 36. Parliament is dissolved for the election period from Thursday 14 August 2014 until after the election on Saturday 20 September 2014. Parliament also tends to rise over January. The first phase of changes applies from 1 April 2015. Therefore, to avoid retrospective application, any legislation affecting the formula assessment on the first phase ofthe reforms would require urgency through at least some stages of Parliament. A higher threshold is required to be met for urgent legislation. This constrains the options that affect the first phase of the reforms. 3 7. These time constraints also impact on the ability to consult and gather information. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 38. Four major options have been considered to reduce the cost of implementing the child support reforms and slowing the growth of child support debt while continuing to address the objectives of the reform. These range from repealing the reforms and returning to the 1991 child support scheme to scaling back the scope of the child support reform package. These options are described below: Option 1 - Defer the child support reforms until Inland Revenue's Transformation programme has been completed 39. Under this option the reforms would be further amended to either delay the commencement dates by several years or to repeal the legislation and re-introduce the reforms at a later date once the Inland Revenue Business Transformation programme is completed. The Business Transformation programme is looking to improve the processes supporting the administration of the tax system, including the technology and computer systems. Part of the implementation of the child support reform underway now will be in the department's legacy FIRST system, which is expected to be replaced as part of the Transformation pro gramme. Option 2 -Repeal the child support reforms and return to the 1991 scheme on child support 40. Under this option, the reforms would be repealed entirely, with no expectation of re- introducing the reforms at a later date. Some small improvements may continue to be made to the scheme through the usual remedial programme or through the Budget process, as funds and resources allow. 9 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 11 of 94 Option 3 -Implement the first phase of the reforms and repeal the second phase of the reforms 41. Under this option, the second phase of the reforms in the Amendment Act would be repealed, but the first phase will remain and be implemented. This would mean most of the change to the formula assessment and associated processes would continue but the penalty, debt write-off and payment changes would no longer proceed. Option 4 -Implement the first phase and part of the second phase of the reforms 42. This option is the closest to the status quo. Under this option, parts of the reforms would be repealed. All of the first phase will remain and be implemented and some parts of the second phase that meet the objective of debt reduction would also be implemented. This would mean most of the change to the formula assessment and associated processes would continue as well as the penalty, and debt write-off provisions but the changes to payment options, the wider definition of income and the underestimation penalty would no longer proceed. Impact analysis of the options 43. The impacts of options one to four and the status quo option, and whether they meet the objectives in paragraph 31, are summarised in Table 1. 44. In 2011 it was determined that 60% of receiving carers and 42% of paying parents would be unaffected by the reforms in the amount of child support they are liable to pay or expect to receive. It is expected that a similar proportion of the current and future child support parents would be unaffected by the options on whether to delay, stop or proceed with the first phase of the reforms. For liable parents this is because they are on a low income and therefore are required to only pay the minimum amount of child support, whether under the old or new formula. For receiving carers who are on a welfare benefit, any child support paid is retained by the Crown to offset the cost of the benefit payments and is not passed on. The options considered in the RIS around the first phase would impact only on the remaining 40% of receiving carers and 58% of paying parents. 45. Option 1, to defer the reforms, would likewise defer the expected impact of the reforms mentioned earlier. Option 2, to repeal the reforms, would undo the expected impact on families discussed above. That is, those expecting to be better off would no longer be, and those expected to be worse off would presumably continue to receive their current levels of support. This would depend on whether the repeal alters the compliance behaviour of paying parents. It is possible that the repeal could result in some paying parents ceasing to be compliant due to perceptions of unfairness, leading to receiving carers being worse of£ 46. The status quo, options 3 and 4 would continue to implement the first phase of the reforms including the change to shared care and the formula calculation. The expected impact on families from the 2011 RIS would continue to apply. 10 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 12 of 94 4 7. Option 4 and the status quo are the options that propose to proceed with changes to debt and penalties in the second phase. Options 1, 2 and 3 would defer or repeal the second phase, and therefore the debt and penalty provisions. Around 125,000 paying parents are in debt, about 70% of paying parents. The total debt just exceeds $3 billion, an average of $24,250 per person. Around 75% of the debt is the penalty component. Of the penalty debt, about 4% relates to the late payment penalty, with the rest relates to the 2% monthly penalty rate. However, the average debt is not a good indicator of the spread of the impact of the changes. Nearly half of the 125,000 paying parents have a debt where the penalties are greater than the value ofthe assessment debt; 44% or 55,000 people. The older the debt, the higher the proportion of penalties. This smaller group will receive the greatest impact from the penalty write-off and penalty rate reductions proposed under the status quo and option 4. For example, a $1,000 missed payment after 2 years grows to $1,768 under the current rules. Under the proposed changes in the second phase, the same debt after 2 years would be $1,571, a reduction of$197 or nearly 20% ofthe original missed payment. 48. For some debtors the issue is the inability to make payments over and above current liabilities. Around 67% of domestic debtors have low incomes, around 63,500 people. Penalty debt write-offs will have a particularly positive impact on this group. 49. To the extent that the debt and penalty changes improve the timeliness ofpayments, and the payment of assessment debt by paying parents, there would be a corresponding impact on the receiving carers and their children. However, receiving carers do not receive penalty payments (75% of all debt), and receiving carers who are beneficiaries do not receive assessment debt as this is retained by the Crown. Around 25% of domestic assessed debt and around 50% of the international assessed debt is owed to receiving carers, the rest is owned to the Crown. The number of receiving carers expected to be impacted by the penalty and debt write-off changes is therefore expected to be much less than 70% of the total carers. 11 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 13 of 94 Table 1: Summary of the impacts of the options and the status quo.

The status quo of implementing the whole reforms have a higher level of ongoing administrative costs than the 1991 scheme, mostly as a result of the new, more detailed, formula assessment in the first phase of the reform. It is expected that the new formula will result in additional contacts from parents to discuss the assessment and update details. Likewise, customer calls are expected to be longer. Other aspects, such as the change in qualifying age and compulsory wage deductions, will also increase administrative costs. At the same time, some of the changes in the first and second phase are expected to reduce the level of administration through the automation of manual processes or ability to rely on existing information and call recording. The overall result for the status quo is an increase in administrative costs. This is mainly through costs associated with an increase in staff numbers. 51. Options 1 and 2 reduce the administrative costs compared to status quo as a repeal or significant delay in the new formula assessment would be expected to reduce the need for the additional staff in the near future. The positions have been filled so there would be some additional costs associated with a redundancy process. There would be some relatively small costs associated with rolling the systems back to the 1991 scheme and communicating the changes to parents. Overall Options 1 and 2 are expected to have administrative savings. 52. Option 1 seeks to defer the changes until a new business process and computer system is in place. It is intended that the new system will mean that implementation costs of changes are reduced, and the ongoing administrative costs are reduced. As a new technological solution has not yet been chosen it is not possible to determine the extent of any future administrative savings for delaying the child support reforms. 53. Options 3 and 4 retain the new formula assessment, and therefore the additional staff and associated administrative costs. Compliance impacts 54. The status quo of implementing the whole reforms have a higher level of compliance costs than the 1991 scheme, mostly as a result ofthe new, more detailed, formula assessment in the first phase of the reform. The formula assessment will now require additional information from the receiving carers, so most of the compliance costs fall on this group. Other aspects of the reforms may reduce compliance costs through providing a wider range of options for liable parents to make payments, such as qualifying payments or debt offsetting. However, the reforms will also introduce compulsory wage deductions for liable parents who have employment income. This will increase the compliance costs for employers who will be required to administer deduction notices. 55. Options 1 and 2 would reduce the compliance costs for receiving carers by removing or significantly delaying the requirement for them to provide additional information or set up compulsory wage deductions. 56. Options 3 and 4 retain the new formula assessment and therefore the additional compliance on receiving carers. They also will repeal some of the payment options proposed for liable parents. This could result in a small increase in compliance costs to make payments. 14 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 16 of 94 Option 3 will reduce the compliance costs for employers by removing the requirement for compulsory wage deductions and not replacing it with an alternative. Option 4 includes a voluntary wage deduction process, which will have compliance costs on employers if their staff request to have child support deducted from their wages. This option has lower compliance costs than the status quo, as the status quo includes a compulsory wage deduction process. A voluntary process is expected to impact on a smaller number of employers. Social, environmental or cultural impacts 57. There are no environmental or cultural impacts associated with any of the options considered above. There are social impacts from the options as they will potentially impact on the levels of fmancial support available to families with children, the timeliness of payments, and the level of debt. Some families have made financial decisions or shared care decisions on the basis of the reforms being implemented. Other risks 58. There is a risk around the timing of options 1 and 2. These will seek to repeal or change the parts of the Child Support Amendment Act that come into effect from 1 April 2015. Inland Revenue will need to amend various systems to roll back to the 1991 scheme in time for notices of assessment in February 2014. Ideally legislative change would need to be enacted 8 months to a year before the change is required to allow time to amend and test systems. However, Parliament will be dissolved between August and October 2014 and usually rises over January. Implementing these options would likely require urgent legislation and for Inland Revenue to begin system changes before the legislation has been enacted. There is a risk that either the legislation will not be enacted in time, making it retrospective, or that Inland Revenue would be unable to change systems in time, leading to incorrect assessments. 59. The current penalty rules impose a 2% a month compounding rate on defaults. This means that overall debt quickly escalates. Nearly half of all liable parents in debt have penalties higher than the assessment debt. The reforms will reduce the penalty rate to 1% after a year in default. Options 1, 2 and 3 will delay or repeal this change, meaning debt will continue to climb. Experience indicates that compliance levels fall as debt accumulates and ages, especially when penalty debt begins to exceed the core assessment. This is a risk that debt becomes unmanageable, impacting on perceptions of the scheme and ultimately the welfare ofthe children. Further analysis relating to Option 4 -completing the first phase and part of the second phase 60. In option 4 some, but not all, ofthe second phase would be implemented. This option would incorporate those aspects that have the greatest impact on debt, or which can be delivered at low cost in comparison to the other benefits expected to arise. Components that have limited benefits and significant costs or have a small impact on debt would not proceed. 61. A similar impact analysis is required on the different components ofthe second phase of the reforms to determine if they should form part of Option 4. The analysis is contained in the following table. 15 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 17 of 94 Impacts Option Meets Recommendation and net impact objectives Advantages Disadvantages Risks/Size 2.1 Keep wid er Not recommended. income definition A&C A fairer income measure.

A significant level of public consultation was undertaken on the original options for potential child support reform. There had also been consultation with a range of Government agencies on child support issues over several years. Feedback from these agencies had, wherever possible, been incorporated into the formulation of the original policy options and subsequent legislation. There was a general recognition from these agencies that the various issues with the child support scheme need to be addressed. 63. There was less opportunity to consult on the options in this RIS given the timing constraints on decision-making and the sensitivity of the changes. Treasury, the State Services Commission and the Department of Internal Affairs (in regards to the Government Chief Information Officer) were consulted. Their feedback is incorporated in the options considered. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 64. Inland Revenue supports option 4 (implement phase and part of phase 2 of the reforms). Proceeding with the first phase would provide more equitable financial support for children in a variety of circumstances. It would also better reflect many of the social and legal changes that have occurred since the introduction of the current scheme in 1991, in particular the greater emphasis on separated parents sharing the care of and fmancial responsibility for their children. 65. Inland Revenue supports some aspects of the second phase continue as enacted but that other aspects not proceed; aspects that were designed to provide general improvements to the operation of the child support scheme, particularly in regards to payments. 66. The aspects we support proceeding include the changes to the imposition of penalties, and the writing-off of penalties and debt, and a new voluntary wage deduction process to replace the proposed compulsory wage deduction process. These will encourage and facilitate parents to make timely child support payments for the benefit of their children, and to reduce debt. While these components have an implementation cost, the impact on debt across a significant number of child support parents justify the cost. 67. The associated cost of implementation is considered to exceed the expected benefits for the components we do not support proceeding. In most cases the benefits from these changes are now expected to impact on a much smaller group of parents than anticipated, and alternative existing process may exist to achieve the desired outcome, although at a higher compliance cost to those involved. 68. Overall, option 4 is recommended as it is close to the status quo in terms of the expected benefits to be delivered by the reforms, especially in relation to debt reduction, but at a significantly reduced implementation cost. 18 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 20 of 94 Summary of changes that are proceeding or not proceeding First Phase All aspects to proceed as enacted. Second Phase It is recommended that the following aspects continue: 2.3 reducing the maximum age of a qualifying child from under 19 to under 18, unless they are 18 and still in full-time secondary education-aligning with Working for Families age limit; 2.5 a two stage late payment penalty with an immediate 2% late penalty, with the remainder of the current 10% penalty only being charged if the debt remains unpaid after seven days; 2.6 a reduction in the ongoing monthly penalty rate from 2% to 1% after a year; 2.8 relaxing the circumstances in which penalties can be written-off, including when a liable parent enters into an instalment arrangement or is in serious hardship, when debt recovery is an inefficient use oflnland Revenue's resources or when only low levels of penalty debt are outstanding, and allowing Inland Revenue to write off assessed debt owed to the Crown on serious hardship grounds; 2.9 recognising re-establishment costs as a grounds for an administrative review; It is recommended that a new voluntary wage deduction be introduced. It is recommended that the following aspects no longer proceed: 2.1 a new definition of "adjusted net income", which includes income adjustments to taxable income, such as income in trusts and companies; 2.2 a penalty for receiving carers who are parents and who underestimate their income for the year; 2.4 compulsory deduction of child support from employment income, unless there are grounds for an exception such as privacy or cultural reasons; 2. 7 the ability to offset current payments against past debts where the liable parent and receiving carer swap roles (that is, where the child moves to live with the other parent); 2.10 the discretion to recognise other payments, such as payment of school fees, as qualifying as child support payments where they directly benefit the child. 69. The total implementation cost ofthe recommended option is estimated at $163 million over the ten year period. 70. The components that do not proceed could be reconsidered in the future if the implementation costs can be reduced as part of, or following, the Business Transformation programme. 19 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 21 of 94 IMPLEMENTATION 71. Changes to the child support reform programme would require amendments to the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 and to any consequential provisions in other legislation. These amendments would be required before 1 April 2016, when the second phase comes into effect, and ideally before January 2016 as notices of assessments and communication with child support parents are usually issued in February each year. 72. The legislative amendments could be introduced as a stand-alone bill or may form part of a taxation omnibus bill. The next taxation bill is expected to be introduced after the 2014 election is concluded. 73. The scope of the child support reform implementation pro gramme will be amended in accordance with Cabinet decisions and legislation. The programme will re-plan delivery of the remaining aspects of the reform accordingly, including any new performance indicators required. The child support reform implementation programme was subject to an independent review to determine why it was unable to deliver to the original timeframes. The recommendations of the review have been accepted and are being incorporated into the programme management to ensure the implementation of the revised reforms can be delivered on time. 74. Once implemented, Inland Revenue will enforce the new legislation as part of its usual business operations. 75. There is a risk that child support families will be confused about what the revised reforms mean for them. Communications will be prepared for child support families and key stakeholders to ensure they understand the changes. Inland Revenue websites will be updated, and an article included in a Tax Information Bulletin. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 76. A programme governance group will oversee the implementation of the changes to ensure the legislative changes are delivered correctly. The changes, once implemented, will be monitored by senior managers to ensure they achieve the objectives. Any issues will be raised through Inland Revenue's internal processes. Complaints and correspondence will also be analysed to identify any issues with the new legislation or the implementation. 77. In accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP), the legislation will be reviewed and remedial changes may be included on a future tax policy work programme, subject to resources and priority. 78. In general, Inland Revenue's monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the GTPP: a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP contemplates the implementation and review stage, which can involve post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 20 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 22 of 94 Regulatory Impact Statement Black hole tax treatment of research and development expenditure Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to address the problems with the cunent "black hole" tax treatment of certain research and development (R&D) expenditure. Generally, business taxpayers will try to reduce their income tax liability by claiming deductions for business expenditure, wherever possible, against their assessable income. "Black hole" expenditure is business expenditure that is not immediately deductible for tax purposes, and also does not fonn part of the cost of a depreciable asset for tax purposes and, therefore, cannot be deducted over time as depreciation. Black hole tax treatment of expenditure can produce economic dist01iions. A taxpayer may choose to invest in an area where they can deduct or depreciate their expenditure instead of investing in an area where they cammt. lf investing in the area that receives black hole tax treatment would have been the most efficient choice in the absence oftaxation, the taxpayer's investment decision has been distorted by tax settings. The prefened option would reduce these dist01iions, by allowing capitalised R&D expenditure to be either depreciated or deducted, depending on the pruiicular circumstances. Initial proposals to provide tax deductibility for capitalised R&D expenditure were consulted on via the release of a Govenunent discussion document on 7 November 2013. The discussion document proposed making capitalised development expenditure that creates an intangible asset with a reasonably ce1iain useful life part of the depreciable costs of the asset. Submitters generally accepted that this was the appropriate way to treat this expenditure. The discussion document also proposed allowing a deduction for capitalised R&D expenditure towards an unsuccessful intangible asset with a reasonably certain useful life when the asset is written off for accounting purposes. This proposal would have meant capitalised R&D expenditure towards intangible assets with uncertain useful lives would have remained non-deductible. A number of submitters were concerned that this would leave a significant category of capitalised R&D expenditure still never being deductible for tax purposes, and that this was not the appropriate treatment of expenditure on intangible assets with indefinite but finite useful lives. After consideration of this feedback, the proposals were altered to also make these costs deductible when the asset is written off for accounting purposes. The Treasury and the Ministry of Business, ltmovation and Employment were involved in the policy development of the options discussed in tl'lis RIS, and they agree with the conclusions and reconunendations made. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 23 of 94 There is some uncertainty around the estimated fiscal costs of the options, as significant assumptions were made in developing fiscal cost estimates, due to lack of source data and limited relevant additional information provided by submitters. There are no other significant constraints, caveats or uncetiainties concerning the analysis undertaken. The prefened option and the other alternative policy options will impose some additional compliance costs on businesses that wish to avail themselves of the proposed increased allowance of tax deductions for R&D expenditure. However, businesses would only incur these additional compliance costs in cases where they consider that the benefit to them of the increased allowance of deductions outweighs the costs. None of the policy options would impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. ;lr( ~~tVL1 Mike Nutsford Policy Manage P bey and Strategy Inland Revenue 27 March 2014 2 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 24 of 94 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Current tax rules 1. "Black hole" expenditure is business expenditure that is not ilmnediately deductible for tax purposes, and also does not form part of the cost of a depreciable asset for tax purposes and, therefore, cannot be deducted over time as depreciation. 2. Under current tax rules, a person is allowed an immediate deduction for expenditure they incur on research or development up until an intangible asset is recognised for accounting purposes. Further development expenditure is capitalised. 3. Capitalised development expenditure can only be depreciated (that is, deducted over the life of an asset) for tax purposes once there is "depreciable property" under the Income Tax Act 2007 (IT A). Expenditure on intangible property may only be depreciated if the intangible property is listed in schedule 14 of the IT A, which lists items of "depreciable intangible property". For an item of property to be listed in schedule 14, it must be intangible and have a fmite useful life that can be estilnated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition. 4. In the event that a research and development (R&D) project does not create a depreciable asset for tax purposes, the development expenditure that has been capitalised will be rendered non-deductible, either immediately or over a period of time. This includes capitalised development expenditure on assets that are completely unsuccessful, as well as intangible assets that are useful but are not listed in schedule 14. 5. Moreover, even if the project does create an asset that is listed in schedule 14, capitalised development expenditure incurred in creating the asset may still be rendered non- deductible, either immediately or over a period of tilne. As explained in paragraphs 6 and 7 below, this may occur because, although the expenditure has given rise to an asset that is depreciable for tax purposes, the depreciable costs of the asset have been interpreted to exclude development expenditure. 6. An i11terpretation statement issued by Inland Revenue takes the view that the depreciable patent costs (for a taxpayer who has lodged a patent application with a complete specification or had a patent for an invention granted) are limited to the administrative and legal fees incurred in the patent process.' According to Inland Revenue's view of the law, capitalised development expenditure relating to the invention that is the subject of the patent (or patent application) is potentially neither deductible nor depreciable for tax purposes. 7. Although the interpretation statement is confined to patents, it is likely that the depreciable costs of plant variety rights would be interpreted in the same way, given that they are both types of intellectual property rights obtained by registration following an R&D process. 1 Interpretation statement "Income tax treatment of New Zealand patents", Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 7 (August 2006), p 51. 3 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 25 of 94 The problem 8. Black hole tax treatment of expenditure can produce economic distortions. A taxpayer may choose to invest in an area where they can deduct or depreciate their expenditure instead of investing in an area where they cannot. If investing in the area that receives black hole tax treatment would have been the most efficient choice in the absence oftaxation, the taxpayer's investment decision has been distorted by tax settings. 9. The scale of the problem cannot be quantified with any degree of precision, as we do not have direct information on what projects would have been undertaken in the absence of taxation. The vast majority of R&D expenditure is already immediately tax deductible. However, there is still room for improvement. OBJECTIVES 10. The objectives against which the options are to be assessed are to: (a) ensure economic efficiency by ensuring that, as far as possible, investment decisions are not distorted by tax considerations; (b) provide certainty about the tax treatment of particular expenditures; (c) minimise compliance costs for taxpayers; and (d) ensure the coherency, consistency and integrity of the overall tax system. 11. Objective (a) is the key objective in this analysis because the aim of the review is to reduce the cases where tax rules may be discouraging R&D investments that would be undertaken in the absence of taxation. We recognise that there are likely to be trade-offs between these tax policy objectives. For example, the preferred option minimises economic distortions but will involve some compliance costs to ensure the integrity of the tax system. 12. It is also necessary to consider the Government's Business Growth Agenda (BGA), which emphasises the importance of building innovation to help grow New Zealand's economy. "Encouraging business innovation" is one of the seven key initiatives of the Building Innovation work stream, which recognises that enabling R&D is a key element in the innovation process. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 13. Several options have been considered for addressing the problem and achieving the stated objectives. These options are set out below. Option one 14. Option one is to retain the status quo. Under the status quo, capitalised development expenditure will continue to be neither deductible nor depreciable for tax purposes. 4 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 26 of 94 Option two 15. Option two is to allow failed capitalised de velopment expenditure, which the taxpayer intended would lead to an item of "depreciable intangible property'', to be depreciated over the estimated useful life ofthe asset the development expenditure was intended to create. Option three 16. Option three is to allow an immediate deduction for failed capitalised development expenditure, which the taxpayer intended would lead to an item of "depreciable intangible property", upon the intangible asset being written off for accounting purposes. Option four (preferred option) 17. Option four is to allow a one-offtax deduction for capitalised development expenditure upon the intangible asset to which it relates being written off for accounting purposes, for taxpayers who have developed intangible assets that are not depreciable for tax purposes. This would apply irrespective of whether the asset was useful for a period or a completely unsuccessful investment. Option five 18. Option five is to allow capitalised development expenditure that creates an intangible asset with an uncertain useful life to be depreciated over a given period of time. This would apply irrespective of whether the asset was useful for a period or a completely unsuccessful investment. Option six 19. Option six is to: • allow capitalised development expenditure that creates a useful intangible asset with an uncertain useful life to be depreciated over a given period of time; and • allow an immediate deduction for capitalised development expenditure that gives rise to a completely unsuccessful intangible asset upon the asset being written off for accounting purposes. Further proposals 20. Additionally, each of options two to six, would allow capitalised development expenditure that creates an intangible asset with a useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty at the time of its creation to be depreciated over that life. 21. As an integrity measure, each of options two to six would also involve the introduction of appropriate claw-back rules (outlined below). 22. In the event that an intangible asset that has been written off for accounting purposes becomes useful, it is proposed that any capitalised development expenditure previously allowed as a tax deduction would be clawed back as income. The clawed-back amount would then be able to be depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset, if the asset is depreciable. 5 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 27 of 94 23. In the event that an intangible asset that has been written off for accounting purposes is sold, it is proposed that any capitalised development expenditure previously allowed as a tax deduction (or the sale proceeds, if this amount is lower) would be clawed back as income.

The fiscal cost estimates should be treated with some caution. Due to lack of source data and limited relevant additional information provided by submitters, significant assumptions were made in developing them, for example: • the stock of capitalised R&D expenditure; • the percentage of capitalised R&D expenditure that will be depreciated; and • the R&D failure rate. 26. Inland Revenue has carried out sensitivity analysis around some ofthe assumptions and the fiscal costs do not vary materially. Compliance costs 27. The proposed changes are taxpayer-friendly, but will impose some additional compliance costs on businesses that wish to avail themselves of the proposed increased allowance of tax deductions for R&D expenditure. These additional compliance costs are associated with: • complying with a higher accounting standard than the new minimum requirements; 2 • claiming a deduction for expenditure that previously would have been non-deductible; and • application of the proposed claw-back rules for written off assets that become useful or are sold. 28. However, these additional compliance costs would only be imposed on those businesses that wish to avail themselves of the proposed increased allowance oftax deductions for R&D expenditure. Therefore, businesses would only incur these additional compliance costs in cases where they consider that the benefit to them of the increased allowance of deductions outweighs the costs. Furthermore, we consider that the proposed claw-back rules are important integrity measures which would not be expected to often require application. Social, environmental or cultural impacts 29. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with any of the options considered above. Net impact of all options 30. The preferred option (option four) addresses the problem by reducing the cases where tax rules could discourage R&D investments that would be undertaken in the absence of taxation. It also achieves all of the stated objectives. 2 We note that, when the Financial Reporting Act 2013 comes into effect on 1 April 2014, minimum financial reporting requirements will be reduced for many businesses. The cuiTent tax provisions that allow a tax deduction for R&D expenditure, and the proposal to allow a tax deduction for taxpayers who have developed intangible assets that are not depreciable for tax purposes, are linked to particular accounting standards. 10 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 32 of 94 31. Inland Revenue does not support options one, two, five and six because they do not fully address the problem and fail to achieve some or all of the stated objectives. We originally preferred option three (the discussion document's proposal) but after consideration ofthe feedback received, and further analysis ofthat option, it is no longer preferred. CONSULTATION 32. Public consultation was carried out via the release of a consultation document, Black hole R&D exp enditure : a government discussion document, on 7 November 2013. 33. The proposals in the discussion document were essentially option three in the above regulatory impact analysis. 34. Twelve submissions were received in relation to the discussion document. The submissions were generally supportive of the intent of the proposals to relieve black hole R&D expenditure. However, many submitters were concerned that the initial proposals would still leave a significant category of capitalised development expenditure never being deductible for tax purposes. These submitters argued that this was not the appropriate treatment of expenditure on intangible assets with indefinite but fmite useful lives. These submitters wanted the scope of the proposals widened to provide tax deductibility for - both successful and unsuccessful - capitalised development expenditure towards intangible assets that are not listed in schedule 14 of the IT A. 35. While it would be inappropriate, from an economic perspective, to allow tax deductibility for expenditure towards creating an asset that would not have been likely to have a finite life if successful, we recognise that technology tends to move at a relatively fast pace and that it is likely that R&D-generated assets will have limited lives, even if those lives are not capable of being estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty at the time of the asset's creation. We were therefore sympathetic towards the submitters' concern. 36. In order to respond to this concern, we considered alternative options that would eliminate black hole R&D expenditure on a prospective basis. This led us to alter the proposals, arriving at option four as our preferred option. 37. The Treasury and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment have been consulted and agree with our conclusions and recommendations. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 38. We recommend: • allowing capitalised development expenditure that creates an intangible asset with a useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty at the time of its creation to be depreciated over that life; and • allowing a one-off tax deduction for capitalised development expenditure upon the intangible asset to which it relates being written off for accounting purposes, for taxpayers who have developed intangible assets that are not depreciable for tax 11 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 33 of 94 purposes. This would apply irrespective of whether the asset was useful for a period or a completely unsuccessful investment; and • introducing appropriate claw-back rules that would apply when an intangible asset that has been written off for accounting purposes becomes useful or is sold. 39. The proposals would enable all capitalised R&D expenditure to be deducted (thereby providing certainty of tax treatment) and would reduce the cases where tax rules discourage R&D investments that would be undertaken in the absence of taxation, but without potentially providing a tax-subsidy to investment in R&D-generated intangible assets with uncertain useful lives. 40. The proposed tax treatment of successful capitalised development expenditure on intangible assets with reasonably certain useful lives is consistent with the usual tax treatment of capitalised expenditure that has created a depreciable asset. 41. The proposed tax treatment of failed capitalised development expenditure is consistent with the usual tax treatment of failed capitalised expenditure. While the proposed tax treatment of capitalised development expenditure that creates useful assets with uncertain useful lives is unusual, it has the effect of restricting deductions to cases where it is clear that the expenditure is of no on-going value. For this reason, we prefer it to depreciating the expenditure over a given period of time, which will inevitably be too short in some cases (implying a tax-subsidy) and too long in others. As technology tends to move at a relatively fast pace, it is likely that R&D-generated assets will have limited useful lives, even if those lives are not capable of being estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty at the time of the asset's creation. Therefore, the proposed treatment improves upon the status quo, as not allowing any deduction for expenditure that has created an asset with a fmite useful life is inappropriate. 42. While there may be some additional compliance costs (as compared to the status quo) in order to get a deduction, taxpayers will only incur these additional costs where they consider that the benefit to them of the increased allowance of deductions outweighs the costs. The preferred option minimises these compliance costs by allowing a one-off tax deduction for capitalised development expenditure rather than requiring taxpayers to depreciate failed expenditure or successful expenditure on assets with uncertain useful lives over time. IMPLEMENTATION Transitional approach 43. We considered three options (set out in the table below) for transitloning to the proposed new rules. We note that most of these options are linked in some way to the date of release of the discussion document (that is, 7 November 2013). The reason why this date was chosen, as opposed to a prospective date, is that this latter alternative may have created an undesirable incentive for taxpayers to defer their R&D spending in anticipation of the proposed new rules. 12 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 34 of 94 Table 2: Transitional options Option 1 Option 2 Option 3 (preferred option) All capitalised R&D In addition to allowing all expenditure (whenever capitalised R&D Only capitalised R&D incurred) relating to expenditure (whenever R&D that creates a expenditure incurred from assets created (that is , incurred) on new assets to depreciable intangible 7 November 2013 would recognised for tax be depreciated, pro-rated asset be eligible for purposes) from 7 depreciation deductions would be allowed for depreciation deductions.

Analysis of options 44. Option 1 only gives deductions for new R&D expenditure, whereas options 2 and 3 would give windfall gains to those who have incurred sunk costs in developing assets. Therefore, option 1 is the most targeted of the three options, with options 2 and 3 providing increasing recognition that the status quo is a poor outcome under tax policy frameworks through providing relief from black hole expenditure on an increasingly wider ambit of historical R&D expenditure. 45. Although option 3 would allow the widest ambit of depreciable expenditure, there would be higher compliance costs associated with apportionment and integrity issues in relation to old documentation of costs. Option 1 could have slightly higher compliance costs than option 2, associated with the need to go back and attribute expenditure to pre-and post-7 November 2013. 46. The annual fiscal cost of all three options would eventually converge. However, over the short to medium term, option 1 would be the least fiscally expensive, and option 3 would be the most fiscally expensive. 47. Options 2 and 3 offer an additional benefit in that they would reduce the bias that those who have incurred sunk costs developing an asset have towards selling the resulting asset over continuing to hold it. This bias exists because, currently, a purchaser of one of these assets can depreciate the entire purchase cost, which means that such assets are potentially more valuable to purchasers than to the person who has developed them. 13 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 35 of 94 Preferred transitional approach -conclusion 48. We prefer option 1, which only gives deductions for new R&D expenditure, because the fiscal cost incurred as a result of the proposed changes would be more closely aligned with the Government's objective of increasing new business R&D. 49. Options 2 and 3 would give windfall gains to those who made an economic decision to proceed with developing an asset in the expectation that development expenditure incurred from the point of asset recognition for accounting purposes would be neither immediately deductible nor depreciable. These options are estimated to be considerably more fiscally expensive over the short to medium term, but would provide limited additional benefit in reducing the bias that those who have incurred sunk costs developing an asset have towards selling the resulting asset over continuing to hold it. Further implementation details 50. If approved, the proposals will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. These changes would be included in the next available taxation bill after Budget 2014 and take effect from the 2015/ 16 income year. 51. When introduced to Parliament, commentary will be released explaining the amendments, and further explanation of their effect will be contained in a Tax Information Bulletin, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. 52. The proposals would have no systems implications for Inland Revenue but may result in some additional administrative costs, such as costs associated with publications to communicate the changes. These costs are expected to be insignificant and would be met within existing baselines. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 53. In general, Inland Revenue's monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The fmal stage in the GTPP contemplates the implementation and review stage, which can involve post- implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 14 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 36 of 94 Regulatory Impact Statement Calculating the fringe benefit arising from employment-related loans Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options for a remedial change to widen the group of employers who are eligible to use the market interest rate method of determining the fringe benefit arising from an employment-related loan. The issue arose out of concerns that some subsidiaries within banking groups could not use the method, even though the parent could. This leads to the subsidiaries overpaying fringe benefit tax, compared to the parent bank. The proposed change is consistent with the key objective as per the original policy intention, which was to ensure that persons who are able to easily determine the market interest rate on comparable loans to third parties can use the market interest rate method. A second objective was to ensure that tax considerations did not impact on economic efficiency. While our understanding is that only a limited number of organisations will be affected by the change, limitations on the available fiscal data have constrained the analysis. Estimates of the fiscal costs ($720,000 per annum) and other costs have relied on an extrapolation of industry provided figures, combined with the use of Inland Revenue's available information. Limited targeted consultation was undertaken. The New Zealand Bankers' Association brought the issue to Inland Revenue's attention, and wider consultation was not undertaken, due to the narrow, technical nature of their issue, the fact that they represent a large number of the affected persons, and the potential to address the issue promptly through an up- coming bill. Widening the group of entities eligible to use the market interest rate is unlikely to impose additional costs on businesses, particularly given that the use of the method is voluntary. Businesses that choose not to use the method may continue to use the prescribed rate, as set by regulation. None of the policy options impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. Marie Pallot Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 10 October 2014 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 37 of 94 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Fringe benefits 1. Remuneration received by a person in exchange for providing employment services is taxable. To prevent erosion of the tax base at the margins, certain non-monetary benefits provided by employers to their employees are also taxed, as fringe benefits. Fringe benefit tax (FBT) helps to ensure neutrality between paying employees in cash and in kind. One kind of fringe benefit that may be provided by an employer is a discounted loan. 2. Where an employer provides an employee with a loan with terms that are more favourable than the terms that the employee would be able to obtain from a third party, a fringe benefit arises. The amount ofthe fringe benefit is the additional amount of interest that would have been payable for a loan with similar terms, compared to the amount actually paid under the terms of the loan. Tax treatment of employment-related loans 3. There are two methods that may be used to calculate the fringe benefit arising from an employment related loan. Most employers use the prescribed rate method to determine the amount of the fringe benefit that arises. The prescribed interest rate is set by regulation, with reference to the prevailing variable first-mortgage housing rate determined by Reserve Bank survey. This ensures that the prescribed rate is in line with market rates. 4. In some cases, the prescribed rate will exceed the rate that a third party lender would offer an individual. This is because the prescribed rate is determined based on publicly advertised interest rates for first mortgages. However, many individuals can negotiate a lower rate than the advertised rate for this type ofborrowing. 5. Since 2006, persons in the business of lending money to the public (generally, financial institutions such as banks) have been able to elect to use the market interest rates to determine the fringe benefit that arises in relation to an employment-related loan, as an alternative to the prescribed rate method. The relevant market rate is the interest rate that would apply to a loan of the same kind, provided to a borrower belonging to a group of persons with comparable credit risk to the employee, dealing on an arm's length basis. 6. Employers who are not in the business of lending money to the public are not able to use the market interest rate method to value the fringe benefit from a loan, as they are not expected to have systems in place to monitor market rates without incurring undue compliance costs. In contrast, lenders will have these systems. 7. Where an employer who is in the business of lending money to the public elects to use the market interest rate method in relation to a loan, they are required to notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at least one year before the income year in which they will frrst apply the method, and must apply the method for at least two income years. This requirement is to prevent persons from switching between methods, to gain an advantage. 2 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 38 of 94 Problem defmition 8. The banking sector has found that the focus solely on the business of the employer has created issues in practice. A company may provide fringe benefits to the employees of other companies within the same group. In the case of a financial institution, the benefit may be a loan. However, the FBT rules treat the employees' employer as providing this benefit, so they may only use the market interest rate method to value the benefit if they are a lender themselves. 9. In practice groups of companies will share information among the members, and a financial institution within a group of companies can provide the information necessary to determine the market interest rate to other companies within the group. These companies form a readily identifiable class of employers who may be able to easily apply the market interest rate method, and may be treated as an extension of the policy that persons in the business of lending money to the public can apply the method. 10. The consequence ofthe status quo may be a higher FBT liability for the employer, and more FBT revenue for the Government. The status quo also creates some concerns regarding economic efficiency, as it encourages employing personnel through the lender(s) within the group, over other companies in the group that do not lend money to the public. 11. This may lead to tax considerations affecting decisions around which entity to employ persons through. This is particularly so for wholly owned groups, which function as a single economic unit, and who may otherwise be indifferent between separating certain (non- lending) functions into other companies or retaining them within the company which is lending. OBJECTIVES 12. The objectives of the proposed change are to: (a) ensure that persons who are able to easily determine the market interest rate of an employment-related loan can use the market interest rate method to determine their FBT liability; (b) maximise economic efficiency; and (c) minimise compliance costs. 13. One ofthe key features of the current rules for taxing employment-related loans is that persons do not incur undue compliance costs. Consistent with this policy choice, allowing a wider group of persons to apply the market interest rate method should not be pursued at the expense of increased compliance and administrative costs. Ensuring that persons who are able to easily determine the market interest rate of an employment-related loan may use the market interest rate method is consistent with limited compliance implications. 14. Maximising economic efficiency is a secondary consideration. The identified efficiency concern results from hiring decisions within groups which include a lender. Achieving this objective is likely to follow from widening the group of persons who may apply the market interest rate method, to include those associated with fmancial institutions. 3 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 39 of 94 REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 15. Two options have been identified to address the problem and meet the stated objectives, along with the status quo: • Option one: Employers who are a member of a wholly owned group of companies (which includes a person in the business of lending to the public) may use the market interest rate method. • Option two: Employers who are a member of a group of companies (which includes a person in the business of lending to the public) may use the market interest rate method. • Option three: Only employers who are in the business of lending to the public may use the market interest rate method (status quo). Groups of employers 16. The Income Tax Act 2007 provides rules for grouping companies which share common ownership. The test looks at the ownership of the companies and the extent to which the same owners have the same interest in each company. 17. For a company to be part of the same group of companies as another company, the same person or persons must generally have common voting interests of at least 66%. A person has a common voting interest where they own voting rights in both companies. 18. For a company to be part of the same wholly owned group of companies the common voting interest required is 100%. Therefore, a person who is in the same wholly owned group of companies as another person will always also be within the same group of companies as that person. 4 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 40 of 94 Meets Impacts Option objectives Fiscal/economic impact Administrative and Risks Net impact compliance impacts One a, band c Tax system Fiscal cost of approximately Minimal additional Minimal.

Option one is likely to have a fiscal cost of approximately $720,000 p.a. This represents a decrease in FBT of $1 million p.a. However, since FBT is deductible for the employer, there will be a corresponding increase in company tax by $280,000. The fiscal cost is based upon an extrapolation of information provided by the banking sector, for groups of companies. The reduced revenue will translate to a benefit for the affected employers, whose FBT liability has decreased by a corresponding amount. 20. The cost of Option two is expected to be largely similar to that of Option one (approx. $720,000 per annum) on the basis that most ofthe FBT effect is attributable to entities within the narrower wholly owned group. However, the wider coverage could be more relevant in the future, for example if a wholly owned subsidiary of a bank was to be partially sold. 21. The reduction in revenue arises because the market interest rate method and the prescribed rate method ascribe different values to the loan, with the prescribed rate method generally calculating a slightly greater benefit. 22. In both Option one and Option two there is a potential efficiency gain as the FBT outcome will no longer potentially impact on placement of employees within the group. The potential gain is greater for Option two, as it applies to a wider group; however this may be partially offset by the fact that employment through the financial institution or a company within the same wholly owned group is likely to be more substitutable than between the fmancial institution and the group companies which are not wholly owned. Social, environmental or cultural impacts 23. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with any of the options. Net impact 24. Option one achieves all three stated objectives. It expands the group of persons able to apply the market interest rate method to a slightly wider group of taxpayers who could be expected to easily apply the method, without posing significant risk. 25. Option two is similar to Option one, in that it meets all three of the stated objectives. However, Option two expands eligibility, and increases economic efficiency for to a slightly wider group of persons than Option one. 26. Option three presents no changes. CONSULTATION 27. Limited targeted consultation was undertaken. The New Zealand Bankers' Association (NZBA) advocated for members of groups of companies (common ownership of 66% or more) which include a lender to be able to apply the market interest rate method. The NZBA strongly supported this threshold, as some entities associated with its members are not wholly owned, but have minority interests. In support of their submission, they cited the fact that group companies would have the same information available as the lender, and identified 7 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 43 of 94 concerns that the status quo could lead to tax-induced biases in employing staff through lenders, where normal commercial considerations may favour other entities. 28. Wider consultation was not undertaken, in the interest of responding to this identified concern in as timely a manner as possible. This was seen as a potential opportunity for an incremental change consistent with the established policy. It was also seen as taxpayer- friendly and low-risk, and could be included in the upcoming taxation omnibus Bill, to secure prompt benefit for those affected. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 29. Option one benefits employers within the same wholly owned group of companies as a lender. Extending eligibility to apply the market interest rate method to these employers poses little risk as they are expected to be able to easily apply the method correctly. The exact cost of this option is estimated at approximately $720,000 p.a. 30. Option two benefits a slightly wider group of employers, those within the same group of companies as a lender. This necessarily includes all the persons affected by Option One and will affect a number of additional banking group companies which have minority shareholders. This option provides greater flexibility for the future. 31. Extending eligibility to these employers likewise poses little risk. This option is expected to have a fiscal cost to the government, and a corresponding benefit to the affected employers largely similar to that of Option one (approximately $720,000 p.a). 32. Either of these options would potentially result in an efficiency gain, as FBT outcomes would not affect hiring decisions within the affected group. 33. Inland Revenue's preferred approach is Option two: allowing employers in the same group of companies as a lender to apply the market interest rate method, on the basis that it better meets the first objective, by enabling a wider group ofpersons who could easily apply the market interest rate method to do so. Group companies should still have access to the necessary information, and the potentially wider approach does not seem to pose any additional risk. Several other provisions in the FBT rules are based on whether companies are within the same group. IMPLEMENTATION 34. Both Option one and Option two would require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow the groups of affected employers to use the rules. Option three (the status quo) does not require any changes to implement. 35. An amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 could be included in the tax bill scheduled for introduction in November 2014. Legislative amendments could apply from the date the Bill receives Royal assent. 36. The current legislation imposes requirements on a person who wishes to use the market interest rate method - they must notify the Commissioner at least one year before the income year in which they wish to use the method. They must then use the method for that and the following income year, to avoid flip-flopping. This would mean that, for an amendment Act 8 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 44 of 94 receiving assent in 2015, taxpayers with standard balance dates could give notice before 1 April2016, and begin applying the method from 1 April2017. 37. To facilitate adoption ofthe method, affected employers could be temporarily given the opportunity to elect to apply the method from the FBT quarter following the election. To integrate this with the requirement that the person apply the method for two income years, where this does not correspond with the start of an income year, the part of an income year where the rules are applied could be treated as a full income year. Such an exception to the ordinary rule is unlikely to lead to flip-flopping. 38. Implementation is not expected to lead to compliance costs for the affected employers. 39. Ifthe amendment is made, it would be publicised through inclusion in the commentary to the implementing bill. Inland Revenue would also include the item in a Tax Information Bulletin once the bill received Royal assent. 40. Inland Revenue would administer the changed rules through the ordinary business processes. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 41. There are no plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes after they become law. This is because the remedial change is consistent with the policy underlying the rules. If any specific concerns are raised, officials will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process. Also, the Income Tax Act 2007 is subject to regular review by officials. As per the normal process, there will be an opportunity for submissions to be made on the proposed changes during the select committee stage of the tax bill that any legislative change is contained in. 9 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 45 of 94 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 46 of 94 Regulatory Impact Statement Bodies corporate GST obligations This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to determine the appropriate GST treatment of bodies corporate. This is the second RIS that considers the GST treatment of bodies corporate; the first was prepared on 28 March 2014. This analysis follows submissions received on the discussion document GST Treatment of Bodies Corporate released on 6 June 2014, which sought public feedback on the approach preferred under the previous RIS (option 2 in this RIS). As a result of feedback received on the discussion document, the preferred option has changed to being option 4 (optional approach). There are four key constraints I caveats on the analysis: 1. Because of data limitations it is not possible to determine exactly how many bodies corporate are currently registered for GST, or would be required to register because they exceed the $60,000 registration threshold. (This threshold is made up of levies received by unit owners but could also be made up of sales of goods and services to third parties). 2. Again because of data limitations it is not usually possible for Inland Revenue to identify whether a GST return is from a body corporate. This means we have incomplete information on the number of bodies corporate which may have taken a tax position to claim input tax deductions in respect of leaky building repairs. 3. The estimate of the potential fiscal cost of refunds for leaky buildings is uncertain as it is based on a 2009 PricewaterhouseCoopers estimate of the costs associated with fixing weathertightness problems in multi-unit dwellings. 4. The estimate of the potential fiscal cost of cashing out reserves if all bodies corporate were to be deregistered is uncertain again due to data limitations. The estimate is based on an assumption about the average level of cash reserves held by registered bodies corporate. A range of options has been considered and measured against the objectives of providing certainty, consistency and fairness ofGST treatment whilst minimising compliance costs and disruption to current practices. There are no environmental or cultural impacts from these recommended changes. There are no other significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning this regulatory impact analysis other than those noted above. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 47 of 94 None of the policy options would restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, unduly impair private property rights or override fundamental common law principles. Marie Pallot Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 25 November 2014 2 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 48 of 94 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Background Bodies corporate 1. The GST system requires businesses and other entities to register for GST if they supply goods or services worth more than $60,000 in a 12-month period. Generally, GST -registered persons are required to file GST returns and pay GST on the majority of the goods and services they supply. In simple terms, the amount of GST that they pay is based on the value of these supplies less the GST cost of any inputs that they purchase from other GST registered persons. In this respect the GST system only taxes the "value added" by each business in a supply chain. 2. A body corporate is a legal entity created under the Unit Titles Act 2010 1 when multiple owners have unit title properties in an apartment building or similar complex. The body corporate is made up of all of the property owners and provides a way for the owners to act together with regard to their common and shared interests. Because bodies corporate always intend to spend all of their money, they are, in the ordinary course of events, largely tax neutral over time. Historic position 3. Currently, most bodies corporate (ofwhich there are approximately 13,800 in total) are not registered for GST and Inland Revenue's historic position has been to not allow bodies corporate to register. A High Court decision in Taupo Jka Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) appeared to support this position by suggesting that most residential bodies corporate would not be required to register for GST because they did not make supplies to unit owners for consideration. 4. However, despite this longstanding view, some bodies corporate have registered for GST (which is likely due to inconsistent administrative practice), including some that have been able to claim refunds in relation to leaky building repairs. Inland Revenue legal analysis 5. In an effort to resolve the inconsistency, Inland Revenue more recently undertook a legal analysis of the existing law and came to a view that bodies corporate could be considered to be providing services to their owners for consideration (in the form of body corporate fees). Under this interpretation, bodies corporate that receive more than $60,000 in levies (and potentially other payments) should be registered for GST. As with other taxpayers, bodies corporate below the $60,000 threshold would be able to register voluntarily. 6. This legal view was consulted on in IRRUIP7: Bodies Corporate-GST Registration which was released in May 2013. Forty-two submissions were received on the legal position and the appropriate policy outcome. Many submissions raised policy arguments as to why bodies corporate should not be required to register for GST. 1 Previously the Unit Titles Act 1972. 3 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 49 of 94 The problem 7. The main problem is that Inland Revenue's new interpretation of the law does not align with the longstanding practices of a large number of bodies corporate, who are not GST- registered. 8. Absent any policy or law change, these bodies corporate would need to change their behaviour to comply with Inland Revenue's new interpretation of the law. This could create compliance costs. 9. In addition, the fact that property owners in bodies corporate would be able claim GST refunds, whilst others such as stand-alone property owners could not, could lead to perceptions ofunfair tax outcomes. Policy process 10. In response to these submissions and concerns about the potential tax outcomes which could arise under this interpretation, the Minister of Revenue instructed officials to consider policy options for the GST treatment of bodies corporate. The Minister of Revenue indicated that a policy response was required to address three main concerns: • Uncertainty concerns-To ensure bodies corporate have certainty over how the GST rules apply to them. • Compliance cost concerns - To ensure bodies corporate that believed they were not required to register do not have to do so as a consequence ofthe recent Inland Revenue interpretation of the existing rules. • Fairness concerns -To ensure that owners of residential property affected by leaky building issues that have received compensation and who carry out repairs through a body corporate are not tax advantaged compared to residential property owners that do not have a body corporate through which to carry out the repairs. 11. Earlier this year, Cabinet agreed to the development of draft legislation to exempt supplies made by bodies corporate to their unit owners from GST. This would mean the majority of bodies corporate would not be able to register for GST. 12. This decision was publicly announced by the Minister ofRevenue on 6 June 2014 along with a proposed rule to allow GST -registered members of a body corporate to claim input deductions on their share of the expenditure incurred by the body corporate (known as the "look-through rule"). The exemption and look-through rule would apply from the date of announcement. The announcement was accompanied by a short discussion document GST treatment of bodies corporate. The document provided further detail on the exemption and sought comment on the proposed draft legislation. 13. On 18 July 2014, submissions on the discussion document GST treatment of bodies corporate closed. Fifty submissions were received. The majority of submitters did not support the proposal. Submitters argued that the compliance costs associated with the proposal would be significant (discussed further under option 2) . 4 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 50 of 94 Affected bodies corporate and impacts 14. Because of data limitations it is not possible to determine exactly how many bodies corporate are currently registered for GST, or would be required to register because they collect more than $60,000 in levies (and other payments in some cases). Despite this, it is likely that around 2,500 bodies corporate are currently registered for GST. 2 These taxpayers would be the least affected if the new interpretation of the law was followed. 15. The number of bodies corporate that would be required to register, if the current interpretation ofthe law was followed, could be as many as 3,100. 3 For most ofthese bodies corporate there would be compliance costs associated with GST registration but, in most cases, little or no net GST to pay. 16. Compliance costs would include transitional costs imposed on bodies corporate that are not currently registered, but would be required to register because they collect more than $60,000 in levies. These bodies corporate would need to be informed that their existing practice of not being registered for GST was incorrect (and the reasons why). There will also be compliance costs relating to what they need to do to comply with their ongoing GST obligations. These ongoing obligations would involve compliance costs associated with filing GST returns. These include charging GST and providing tax invoices to unit owners, paying GST to Inland Revenue, keeping tax records and possibly hiring the services of tax agents. 17. Most bodies corporate would have little or no net GST to pay over time. This is because the GST charged on body corporate fees would generally be offset by the ability for the body corporate to claim GST input credits when they spent the fees on insurance, repairs, maintenance and so on. 18. There would be GST to pay in some cases such as when the funds were used to pay for ground rent. 4 These GST costs would be passed on to underlying property owners in the form of higher body corporate fees. 19. Some bodies corporate may want to register, particularly those that would be able to receive GST refunds. For example, some bodies corporate may have built up long term maintenance funds. If these funds were raised while the body corporate was not registered, no GST would have been collected when they were levied, but input tax deductions would be available if they later registered. Given GST should be neutral for these taxpayers, the ability to claim input tax deductions with no output liability represents a windfall gain to these bodies corporate. 20. It is difficult to estimate the amount of GST refunds that bodies corporate could claim, nevertheless based on the number of bodies corporate required to register and an estimate of the average amount of cash reserves held by bodies corporate, the fiscal cost could be around 2 There are approximately 2,500 registered persons with either the words " body corporate" in the name they registered under, or who have separately identified themselves as a body corporate through their industry classification or their reported nature of business. 3 We have obtained infonnation from Land Infonnation New Zealand (LINZ) about the total number of bodies corporate (approximately 13,800) and the number of units in each body corporate. Consequently, if we make an assumption about the average body corporate fee we can work out roughly how many bodies corporate would exceed the $60,000 threshold based on the number of units. 4 Ground rent can be paid when the land underneath the building is owned by a person outside the body corporate. 5 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 51 of 94 $116 million or $23.2 million per annum over 5 years. 5 The fiscal cost could be higher if bodies corporate that were not required to register (bodies corporate that have supplies below $60,000) decided to voluntarily register. The windfall gain to this group would further lead to perceptions ofunfairness. 21. GST refunds are also likely to be available in cases where a registered body corporate has received a leaky building compensation payment 6 and has used the compensation to pay for repairs. There would be a fiscal cost associated with these refunds. The actual cost would depend on many factors, such as the cost of the repairs, how these costs are funded, and how many bodies corporate register for GST. Based on a 2009 estimate of the costs associated with fixing weathertightness problems in multi-unit dwellings, the fiscal cost could be as much as $58 million spread over the next 6 years. 7 22. It could be viewed as unfair for the GST system to allow GST refunds for a certain group of property owners but not for other property owners. Residential property owners are not generally able to register for GST so could not claim GST refunds if they paid for repairs themselves as opposed to the repairs being paid for by a registered body corporate. 8 This could lead to perceptions that the tax system is subsidising repairs for some owners but not for others. Key figures Total number ofbodies corporate 13,800 Number ofbodies corporate already registered for GST 2,500 Number ofbodies corporate that might be required to Up to 3,100 register ifthe new interpretation of the law was followed Fiscal cost of refunds ifunregistered bodies corporate $116 million decided to register for GST Fiscal cost of refunds associated with leaky building $58 million spread over the next reparrs 6 years OBJECTIVES 23. New Zealand's GST system applies broadly with very few exemptions. Accordingly, a wide range ofbusinesses, clubs and other organisations are required to register for GST. This 5 A maximum of 3, 100 bodies corporate may be required to register under the status quo option. As bodies corporate are not required to file annual accounts centrally, it is difficult to estimate the level of these reserves. However, a conservative estimate would suggest these reserves for a body corporate over the registration threshold could be over $250,000. 6 Compensation payments are not generally subject to GST as they do not relate to a supply of anything in return, or to a nonnal transaction through the supply chain. In contrast, when a GST-registered person makes an insurance claim, they are generally required to return GST in relation to the insurance payout due to a special deeming rule in the GST Act. 7 1n the 2009 PwC report Weathertightness -Estimating the Cost, it was estimated to cost $1.402 billion to fix weathertightness issues in multi-unit dwellings and that up to 31% of all weathertightness costs could be funded from compensation payments. (The remaining 69% would be funded by the building owners themselves.) This $1.402 billion cost was increased to $1.433 billion to take into account the increase in GST from 12.5% to 15%; 31% of $1.433 billion is $444 million. The GST input credits that could be claimed on $444 million would be $58 million, or $8 million per year until 2020. 8 1n the case of owner-occupiers there is no supply or consideration for GST to apply to as the owner provides accommodation to themselves. When a landlord rents a house to a tenant, the GST Act exempts this supply of residential accommodation to ensure that tenants are not disadvantaged relative to owner-occupiers. 6 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 52 of 94 broad-base, low-rate framework is a key reason why New Zealand's GST is regarded to be efficient, fair and relatively simple. 24. Other aspects of the GST system recognise that public acceptance and compliance with GST depends on minimising undue compliance costs and on taxpayers' perceptions of fair and consistent tax outcomes. These include the $60,000 registration threshold which reduces compliance costs for smaller suppliers, and the exemption for the supply of residential accommodation which ensures renters are not disadvantaged relative to owner-occupiers. 25. As described above, the new interpretation of the law regarding the GST treatment of bodies corporate has raised predominantly practical concerns related to certainty, compliance costs and fairness. Unlike most other entities, however, bodies corporate are expected to be fiscally neutral over time because they expect to spend all of the money they accumulate. 26. The objectives against which the options are to be assessed are: a) To provide certainty of GST treatment. Ideally, the policy should provide certainty for past periods as well as the future. b) To minimise compliance costs. This includes transitional costs such as requiring bodies corporate to adopt a different practice (by requiring registration or deregistration) or change a previous tax position as well as ongoing costs such as filing tax returns or paying GST. There are also potential flow-on costs to unit owners to consider. c) To provide fair and consistent tax outcomes between bodies corporate, other property owners, and other taxpayers who have similar circumstances. When assessing fairness there are three different comparisons that can be made: • Other property owners. One comparison is that a person who owns property through a unit title should face similar tax outcomes to a person who owns property under another type of property ownership (such as freehold property). • Other types of taxpayer. Consideration of the extent to which a body corporate is similar to other types of taxpayer such as a property management business or a sports club which provides organisational services for its members. • Other bodies corporate. To ensure consistency between different bodies corporate the policy should apply broadly with few exceptions. In saying this, in a GST system where most supplies are taxable, it is recognised that some entities that supply the same types of goods may be in or out of the GST system depending on whether they are over the compulsory registration threshold. 27. We recognise that there are trade-offs between these policy objectives. For example, because taxpayers have taken different tax positions, a policy which sought to reduce transitional costs by preserving a previous tax position could result in different tax outcomes for one taxpayer compared to another in a similar situation. 7 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 53 of 94 REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 28. Four policy options and the status quo were considered for addressing the policy problem and meeting the objectives. These were: Option 1: Retain the new interpretation of the law (status quo); Option 2: Change the law to remove all bodies corporate from the GST system (previously preferred option); Option 3: Exempt only supplies made by a body corporate to residential unit owners (apportionment model); Option 4; Give bodies corporate the option of whether or not to register for GST (preferred option); and Option 5: Introduce a higher GST registration threshold for bodies corporate. Option 1: Retain the new interpretation of the law (status quo) 29. Under option 1, Inland Revenue would finalise our interpretation of the existing law. Based on the work to date, this interpretation would conclude that bodies corporate that receive more than $60,000 of annual fees are required to register for GST. Other bodies corporate that receive less than $60,000 of annual fees could voluntarily register for GST. 30. As mentioned previously, this legal view was consulted on in!RRUIP7: Bodies Corporate - GST Registration which was released in May 2013. Forty-two submissions were received. Many submissions raised policy arguments as to why bodies corporate should not be required to register for GST. Much ofthe discussion below reflects submitter's comments. Certainty 31. The purpose of an interpretation statement is to provide certainty. However, it only provides certainty as to Inland Revenue's view of the law. Some bodies corporate who disagreed with Inland Revenue's interpretation of the law may choose to challenge the interpretation in the courts. This risk is increased by the fact that in the only New Zealand court case on this issue, Taupo Jka Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997), the High Court suggested that most residential bodies corporate would not be required to register for GST. 32. In addition there could be uncertainty as to whether bodies corporate would be required to revise past tax positions that were inconsistent with Inland Revenue's new interpretation, particularly for those bodies corporate who have not registered for GST. An operational practice statement could be used to provide guidance on how Inland Revenue planned to administer the new interpretation but this may not provide the affected bodies corporate with sufficient comfort on their prior tax positions. Fairness 33. Applying GST to unit title property ownership could be seen to be unfair because GST registration involves compliance costs that would not apply to other types of property ownership (i.e. individuals who own standalone houses). It could potentially discourage unit title ownership. 8 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 54 of 94 34. On the other hand, it could also be viewed as unfair that the GST system allowed GST refunds for a certain group of property owners but not for other property owners. Residential property owners are not generally able to register for GST so could not claim GST refunds if they paid for leaky building repairs themselves as opposed to the repairs being paid for by a body corporate. GST refunds could amount to $58 million. This could lead to perceptions that the tax system is subsidising repairs for some owners but not for others. Compliance costs 35. Requiring bodies corporate to register for GST could impose compliance costs on thousands of property owners and in most cases would result in little, if any, tax to pay. These costs and their impacts are described in paragraphs 15 to 18 of this RlS. The number of bodies corporate that may be required to register could be up to 3,1 00. 36. Bodies corporate could potentially be required to file or reassess GST returns for prior tax years and pay penalties and interest in respect of unpaid GST obligations. The impact on past tax positions could, however, be reduced by providing a grace period (either through legislation or operational practice) whereby the GST obligations would only be enforced prospectively, after the date that the interpretation statement was finalised. Option 2: Change the law to remove bodies corporate from the GST system 3 7. Option 2 would require a legislative amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 which would explicitly remove any body corporate that was established under the Unit Titles Act 2010 from the GST system. 38. This option would also be accompanied by a "look-through rule" that deems any third- party services provided to a body corporate (such as insurance and cleaning) to be provided directly to the underlying unit owners in proportion to their shares in the body corporate. Under this approach, if an underlying owner was running a GST -registered business on their property, they would be able to claim back their portion of the GST costs of goods and services purchased by the body corporate on their behalf. If instead, the owner was simply living in the property, they would not have to do anything and would be treated like any other final consumer. 39. This option was the preferred option in the previous RlS, and was consulted on in the 6 June 2014 discussion document. The discussion document suggested that the new rule take effect from the date that the document and draft legislation were released (6 June 2014). A savings provision was also proposed to preserve the tax positions of those bodies corporate which had registered for GST and taken tax positions prior to 6 June. 40. After receiving feedback from submitters, officials no longer prefer this option. Certainty 41. The proposed law change would provide certainty of GST treatment for future periods after the date the law was changed, while the savings provision would also preserve the tax positions of those bodies corporate which had registered for GST and taken tax positions prior to 6 June. 42. There has however been some uncertainty since the Minister made the announcement on 6 June 2014, especially because the proposal is not yet enacted. An operational statement was 9 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 55 of 94 released soon after the announcement (28 June 2014) which was intended to give bodies corporate guidance as to what they should do in the interim. The operational statement advised registered bodies corporate to continue to file GST returns until the proposal was enacted. Fairness 43. The look-through rule element of this option would ensure that a person who owns property through a unit title should face similar tax outcomes to a person who owns property under another type of property ownership. 44. The option would also prevent bodies corporate from claiming further GST refunds after 6 June 2014. Removing this ability to claim further GST refunds can be justified on the basis that it removes a tax advantage that is not available to other types of residential property owners such as standalone home owners. 45. Submitters considered this option to be unfair for those bodies corporate that would be required to deregister. Specifically, these bodies corporate would have returned GST on fees received while they were registered but would be unable to claim input tax when they spent the fees after deregistration. Given GST is meant to be neutral for these taxpayers, if this option were to be pursued there is a policy argument that registered bodies corporate should be able to claim a GST refund on cash balances held at the time of deregistration. While the fiscal cost of cashing out reserves would over time be neutral, the cost in year one could be around $77 million. 9 46. Finally, an issue with removing bodies corporate from the GST system is that other taxpayers may argue that they should also be removed from the GST system. For example, a sports or social club may argue that, like a body corporate, they face undue compliance costs from having to register for GST. Compliance costs 47. For the vast majority of bodies corporate that are not registered for GST, a retrospective law change would align the law with their existing practice and previous tax positions. This means they would not have to take any action with regard to either their past or future behaviour. 48. Submitters argued that the compliance costs associated with this option would be significant. The main compliance cost concern relates to the on-going cost of applying the look-through rule. 9 This estimated is based on the assumption that 2,500 bodies corporate would be required to deregister with average reserves of around $250,000. 10 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 56 of 94 49. The proposed look-through model has the advantages ofbeing conceptually "pure" in that it would ensure that GST -registered unit owners would be entitled to input deductions on their share of expenses incurred at the body corporate level. However, submissions highlighted that achieving any degree of accuracy in these calculations would mean imposing significant compliance costs on bodies corporate and unit owners. These concerns would largely fall into the following categories: • Measuring ownership interests in a body corporate; • Managing information flows; • Transitional issues associated with filing returns in the period between 6 June 2014 and the date of enactment of any changes. 50. It was stressed that, because the look-through calculations would need to be undertaken for every taxable period (possibly monthly), these costs would be recurring. Measuring ownership interests 51. The proposed look-through rule suggested that a registered unit owner would be able to claim input tax deductions in proportion to their "ownership interest", as defined in the Unit Titles Act 2010. Submissions noted, however, that an owner's share of the expenses incurred by the body corporate is measured in a number of different ways. For example, a ground floor tenant may not be required to contribute to elevator maintenance. As a result, allowing expenses to be claimed on an ownership interest basis could result in owners being attributed with a greater or lesser share of expenses than should be the case. 52. In practice, to ensure owners are attributed the correct share of expenses, the body corporate would be required to examine each invoice received and attribute it to the owners in the appropriate proportions. This would be a significant compliance burden-particularly for large bodies corporate. Managing information flows 53. In order for the look-through model to work, unit owners would need accurate information on expenses incurred at the body corporate level. Because input tax deductions represent the equivalent of cash refunds to unit owners, they will, like most registered persons, be motivated to access this entitlement as soon as they can. Bodies corporate would therefore be under pressure to report to suit the unit owner that has the most frequent filing obligations (potentially monthly). Currently bodies corporate are only required to report to owners on a very limited basis. 54. An additional complication could arise when registered unit owners enter or exit a body corporate (through the sale ofunits). The exiting member will want to know their entitlement up to the date of departure, which could result in further "out of cycle" calculations needing to be undertaken by the body corporate. Transitional issues 55. If the look-through model was legislated for, the estimated 2,500 bodies corporate currently registered would need to deregister as of 6 June 2014. They would also need to file final returns that unwound the position of returns filed in the period between 6 June 2014 and the date of enactment (which may be in late 2015). 11 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 57 of 94 56. As well as calculations required at the body corporate level, individual registered unit owners would also need to perform a ''wash-up" calculation, so their GST position accurately reflected the new law for the period. 57. Measures could be put in place to lower the compliance costs of the look-through but, in doing so, the rules will need to trade off simplicity for accuracy. A set of minimum requirements may be relatively easy for a body corporate to administer (although some may even struggle with this), but they are unlikely to result in unit owners' input tax deductions being truly representative of their share of costs incurred at the body corporate level. Irrespective of whether a simple or more complicated method is chosen, these costs will be recurrmg. Option 3: Exempt only supplies made by a body corporate to residential unit owners (apportionment model) 58. The apportionment model requires bodies corporate to calculate and claim the appropriate amount on input tax, as opposed to the unit owners. This approach involves deeming bodies corporate to be supplying accommodation to their unit owners. This would mean: • Supplies of accommodation in residential units would be exempt. Fees charged to residential units would not be taxable and the body corporate would not be able to claim input tax deductions in relation to those supplies. • Supplies of accommodation in units used for commercial purposes would be taxable. Fees charged to commercial units would be taxable and the body corporate would be able to claim input tax deductions in relation to those supplies. 59. Bodies corporate associated entirely with residential units would not be able to register for GST. Bodies corporate associated with commercial units or a mix of residential and commercial units would either be required to register for GST (if supplies exceed $60,000), or could voluntarily register (if supplies are below $60,000). Bodies corporate with a mix of residential and commercial units would need to apportion their input tax deductions based on the proportion of residential and commercial units. 60. This option and option two have much the same advantages and disadvantages in respect of certainty, fairness and compliance costs. Like the look-through model, the apportionment model has the potential to be conceptually pure, in that GST costs incurred at the body corporate level would be accessed by registered unit owners, but not by unregistered owners. However, the apportionment model has the advantage of not requiring details of invoices and payments to be passed through to unit owners. 61. On the other hand, this model has potential to impose significant compliance costs on bodies corporate. The body corporate will be required to identify the status of its underlying units and/or unit owners. This could be difficult given there are specific GST rules that define what is a commercial and residential dwelling, consequently, the status of the underlying unit may not always be clear. This may also give rise to privacy concerns for the unit owners concerned. If the body corporate did not make enquiries of unit owners this may result in input tax deductions being incorrectly claimed at the body corporate level or denying input deductions to unit owners that would, if they owned a stand-alone residence, be entitled to claim them. 12 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 58 of 94 Option 4: Give bodies corporate the option of whether or not to register for GST 62. Option 4 (preferred option) involves giving bodies corporate an option to register. This option would also require a legislative amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the option would only extend to supplies made to unit owners. Supplies to third parties (for example, car park rental to third parties) would be governed by the ordinary rules (i.e. a body corporate would be required to register if supplies to third-parties exceeded $60,000). Other legislative amendments would be necessary to: • clarify that services provided by bodies corporate to their members are "supplies" for GST purposes; and • address a base maintenance risk associated with bodies corporate choosing to register and deregister at times that would effectively mean that the majority of their spending was subsidised by the tax system. Certainty 63. Option 4 would provide certainty by clarifying that services provided by bodies corporate to their members are "supplies" for GST purposes. It would then allow bodies corporate the option of whether to make those supplies "taxable" by registering for GST. 64. Like option 2, this option would need to apply retrospectively in order to preserve tax positions taken by bodies corporate who had not registered for GST. 65. Unlike option 2, a savings provision would not be required to preserve tax positions taken by bodies corporate who had registered for GST as an optional approach would not prevent bodies corporate from being able to register for GST. Fairness 66. Previous fairness concerns surrounding registration of bodies corporate centred on their ability to access input tax deductions (and therefore refunds) for leaky building repairs. Because compensation payments are not subject to GST, this would result in a windfall gain for a registered body corporate when compared to an unregistered one, or a standalone homeowner. However, consultation has suggested that a practice may have emerged whereby the payers of compensation payments are reducing the amounts paid to registered bodies corporate to reflect any GST that the body corporate may be able to claim. This makes rational sense because a payer will always be motivated to make any settlement as small as possible. If this practice is now routine, the original concern regarding bodies corporate receiving windfall gains at the expense of the tax base (and gains that would not have been available to stand-alone homeowners) is mitigated. 67. Bodies corporate are only likely to register for GST if they expect to receive GST refunds. Not only would this raise revenue concerns, it could also lead to perceptions of unfairness. This concern could be addressed by imposing an output tax liability on relevant reserves (including funds from compensation payments) held by the body corporate at the time of registration. Such a liability would remove any windfall gain resulting from registration. 68. If this option were to be pursued, it will be necessary to align the application date with the introduction of the relevant legislation. This is necessary to prevent unregistered bodies corporate from registering before the enactment of any legislation in order to avoid the payment of output tax on their reserves. 13 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 59 of 94 69. Some bodies corporate may argue that since they are required to pay output tax when they register they should be entitled to an input tax refund on cash reserves held at the time of deregistration. This should not be necessary, however, as a body corporate would be able to deregister at any point in time and therefore is able to choose the most appropriate time to deregister -such as a time when their reserves are low. Cashing out reserves would also have fiscal implications as described in paragraph 45. In addition, those bodies corporate that are currently GST registered will not have entered the system in the expectation that their reserves would be cashed out on deregistration. To do so would provide those bodies corporate with a windfall gain. 70. To remove any residual incentives that bodies corporate may have to register and deregister on a regular basis, it would be desirable to also create a lock-in rule, whereby if a body corporate chooses to register after the effective date of these changes, they must stay registered for a minimum of four years. This would provide some clarity to a body corporate of the minimum compliance costs of registration and would also ensure that those looking to register only for short term gain, such as the GST advantages arising from a future compensation payment, would be discouraged from doing so. 71. Finally, adopting this option may set a precedent for other non-profit bodies to lobby for an increased threshold or a similar optional approach. Compliance costs 72. Option 4 has the lowest compliance cost of any option, as bodies corporate will be able to decide whether it is worthwhile to register for GST and bear the cost associated with registration. It is anticipated that this approach would require very few, if any, bodies corporate to take immediate action. 73. It is likely that only bodies corporate with GST registered unit owners (commercial bodies corporate) will want to register for GST. Registration may be worthwhile for these bodies corporate to avoid tax cascades - where the body corporate incurs unrecoverable GST which in turn would be passed on to unit owners. However, it is likely that many commercial bodies corporate may already be registered for GST, in which case they could remain registered. 10 74. There may be an onus on some bodies corporate to decide whether or not they should choose to register for GST. For some bodies corporate there would be costs associated with making this decision which could include paying fees to a tax agent to provide advice on their situation. Option 5: Introduce a higher GST registration threshold for bodies corporate 75. Taxpayers currently need to register for GST if they have more than $60,000 of taxable supplies. Option 5 would involve increasing the GST registration threshold for bodies corporate so that registration would be compulsory above the threshold and voluntary below the threshold. Like options 2, 3 and 4, this would require a legislative amendment to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 10 Of the number of registered persons that identified themselves as a body corporate, 60 percent identified themselves as a "commercial" body corporate. The remaining 40 percent identified themselves as a "residential" body corporate. 14 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 60 of 94 76. This option has the same advantages and disadvantages as option 4 with one exception: even with a very high threshold there could still be cases where a body corporate exceeds the threshold but does not wish to be GST registered. Consequently, these bodies corporate would still have to deal with all the compliance costs associated with GST registration. In this regard, the threshold would create a "cliff-face", particularly for those bodies corporate that temporarily breached the threshold temporarily due to a large one-off transaction. 77. Option 4 is preferred because it does not have the "cliff-face" associated with option 5. Some may argue that large bodies corporate should be required to register, however, for the reason discussed in paragraphs 15 to 18 there would be little benefit in these taxpayers registering. Summary of impact analysis 78. The following table summarises for each option which ofthe objectives it meets or partly meets (for the reasons described above) as well as the economic, administrative, fiscal and fairness impacts. None of the options have environmental, social or cultural impacts.

As mentioned earlier, Inland Revenue undertook a legal analysis of the existing law in order to resolve the uncertainty that had arisen as a result of body corporate GST refund claims. Inland Revenue Issues Paper -new interpretation of the law 80. In May 2013, Inland Revenue released Issues Paper IRRUIP7: Bodies Corporate-GST Registration to consult on our initial view that existing law would require bodies corporate that receive more than $60,000 of annual fees to be registered for GST. The issues paper set out an initial interpretative position for consideration and also raised some alternative views. It invited submissions on both the legal position and the appropriate policy outcome. 16 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 62 of 94 81. Forty-two submissions were received. Six submissions agreed with the approach taken in the issues paper, considering it both technically correct and appropriate. Three submissions were neutral. Thirty-three submissions disagreed with the approach taken in the issues paper. 82. Many submitters raised policy arguments as to why bodies corporate should not be required to register for GST. These included arguments that a body corporate is, in substance, just a vehicle through which various property owners co-ordinate to pay costs related to accommodation, through a central account, and that requiring bodies corporate to register for GST would impose compliance costs but would collect little additional tax revenue. Discussion document-policy proposal 83. To address these concerns, on 6 June 2014, the Minister of Revenue publicly announced his intention to introduce legislation that would exempt supplies made by bodies corporate to their unit owners from GST and that the exemption would apply from the date of announcement. The announcement was accompanied by a short discussion document GST treatment of bodies corporate. The document included and sought comment on the proposed draft legislation. 84. On 18 July 2014, submissions on the discussion document GST treatment of bodies corporate closed. Fifty submissions were received, some on behalf of a large number of bodies corporate. The majority of submitters did not support the proposal. Submitters argued that the compliance costs associated with the proposal would be significant. The main compliance cost concerns related to the application of the look-through rule as discussed in paragraphs 48 to 57. In addition, submitters were concerned with the transitional costs associated with the proposal, such as the unfairness of not refunding input tax on reserves (see discussion in paragraph 45) and the compliance costs associate with the retrospective application date (see discussion in paragraph 55). 85. As a result of the feedback received the preferred option is now option 4 as compared to the previous RIS that recommended option 2. Many submitters preferred the optional approach (option 4) or a higher threshold (option 5). Next steps 86. Once the Government has made a policy decision, officials will prepare draft legislation for introduction in the next omnibus tax bill scheduled for early in 2015. 87. The Treasury were consulted on and agree with the preferred option (option 4). CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 88. We recommend that the law be changed to give bodies corporate the option of whether to register for GST (option 4). For the reasons explained above, this option best achieves the objectives of providing certainty, consistency and fairness whilst minimising compliance costs and disruption to existing practices. The most effective way to meet these objectives would involve a date of introduction application date with a savings provision for tax positions taken prior to the date of introduction. 89. Retaining the existing law (option 1) is not supported as it does not address the problem, would only provide partial certainty and would not achieve the other objectives. 17 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 63 of 94 90. A GST exemption to remove all bodies corporate from the GST system (option 2) is not preferred as the compliance costs of applying the look-through rule would likely be high. Option 3 is not supported for compliance cost reasons associated with bodies corporate apportioning their input tax deductions. 91. A higher GST registration threshold (option 5) is not supported because ofthe "cliff-face" it creates for those bodies corporate that may make supplies in excess of the higher threshold. IMPLEMENTATION 92. The preferred option (option 4) would need to be implemented through a taxation bill. Draft legislation can be included in a bill scheduled for early 2015. 93. The proposed application date would be date of introduction. This is necessary to prevent unregistered bodies corporate from registering before enactment to avoid the payment of output tax on their reserves. While it is recognised retrospective application dates should generally be avoided, in this case it is necessary for the fairness and fiscal reasons discussed in paragraph 68. 94. The existing operational statement that was released on 28 June 2014 offers some certainty for the interim. It advises taxpayers to continue to follow the existing law until any legislation is enacted. This means that registered bodies corporate should continue to file GST returns in the nonnal manner. The operational statement also makes it clear that Inland Revenue will not require bodies corporate to register in the interim. 95. The new rules will be administered by Inland Revenue through ex1stmg channels. Compliance costs can be minimised by releasing clear and helpful guidance as to the operation of the new rules using existing Inland Revenue channels. Administration costs are expected to be negligible. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 96. Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 97. The fmal step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 18 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 64 of 94 Regulatory Impact Statement Cashing-out research and development tax losses Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of: • whether the current tax treatment of losses for research and development (R&D)- intensive start-up businesses is appropriate; and • the options to allow R&D-intensive start-up businesses more timely access to their tax loss deductions. Consultation on these issues took place via an officials' issues paper, R&D tax losses, released in July 2013, which sought feedback on various features of a proposed set of tax rules that would allow R&D-intensive start-up companies early access, by way of a "cash- out" (refund), to tax losses arising from qualifying R&D expenditure. Following a review of written submissions, officials from Inland Revenue and the Treasury met with a number of interested parties. Submissions were received from professional services firms, industry and other professional bodies, R&D companies and individuals, and were generally in favour of the proposal. Submitters raised issues with some of the proposed policy settings as well as overall concerns around the compliance costs of the initiative. Of particular concern were the proposed rules for the R&D wage intensity threshold, the proposed administration regime and the neutrality and integrity measures. The preferred option is to allow R&D-intensive start-ups to cash-out, or refund, their tax losses arising from qualifying R&D expenditure. This proposed initiative removes a barrier to investment in R&D start-ups which arises from the current treatment of tax losses. The estimated average fiscal cost of the proposed initiative is $15 million per annum. The accuracy of this estimate could be affected by changes in key assumptions, especially the number of companies who receive a cashed-out loss, the overall repayment rate of the cashed out loss (which depends on both the firm survival rate, and the ability to recover the value of the cashed-out loss from companies that sell intellectual property or undergo a change in ownership), and the timeframe for repayment. If the number of firms that receive a cashed-out loss or the repayment rate is higher or lower than expected, both the average fiscal cost and year-to-year variation could change. The administration regime for the proposed initiative has not yet been decided. This will be the subject of a Business Case scheduled to be determined by Cabinet in June 2014. It is therefore not possible to assess the compliance costs arising from the proposed administration regime in this RIS. However, the relative compliance costs of the various administration options will be one of the key criteria considered in the Business Case. Finalisation of the administration regime is also necessary before any changes can be legislated for. The proposed initiative will apply from income years starting on or after 1 April 2015. Legislative amendments to give effect to the measure should therefore be included in the next available omnibus tax bill which in turn means that the legislation is unlikely to be passed ahead of the 1 April 2015 start date. It is anticipated that there would be a degree of Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 65 of 94 retrospectivity compared to the start date, but as this initiative is advantageous to taxpayers this should not be of concern. Even with lBgislativB introduction in early 2015, it should be passed by the time that taxpayers' losses crystallise for the first year of the proposed initiative at the end of2015/16 income year. The Treasury were involved in the development of the policy options discussed in this RIS. There are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. None of the policy options considered impair private property rights, reduce market competition, or override common law principles. Instead, the preferred option is likely to increase incentives for businesses to be innovative. Taxpayers will incur compliance costs to satisfy the eligibility and reporting requirements of the initiative, but on the whole the proposed initiative is advantageous to taxpayers. David Carrigan Policy Director, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 21 March 2014 2 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 66 of 94 STATUS QUO 1. The tax system in New Zealand is based on the principle of broad-base, low-rate taxation, as set out in the Government' s Revenue Strategy. This means that alternative forms of income and expenditure are taxed as comprehensively and as evenly as possible. These principles ensure that overall tax rates can be kept low and even (thereby minimising the influence that taxation has over economic decisions), whilst also maintaining New Zealand' s revenue base. 2. The Government's policy of broad-base, low-rate taxation means that the current tax treatment of research and development (R&D) expenditure in New Zealand is largely consistent with the tax treatment of other forms of business expenditure. There are very few provisions that we expect will distort incentives to innovate. 3. There is an asymmetric tax treatment of profits and losses under the status quo which is particularly pronounced for R&D start-ups. This asymmetry arises because profit-making businesses can deduct expenses from their, or their group companies ', assessableincome in the year that these expenses are incuned. In contrast, loss-making businesses typically have to carry expenses that contribute to tax losses forward to future years, so they can be offset against future income. 4. This treatment for losses ensures that any deductions for expenses incurred during periods of loss can be offset against profitable group companies or eventually be utilised when the business begins to earn profits. It can, however, cause a delay in the utilisation of deductions for loss-making businesses relative to profitable ones or ones with profitable group compames. 5. Although the status quo creates a t1mmg asymmetry which can disadvantage loss- making businesses, there are good reasons for requiring taxpayers to carry losses forward or allowing taxpayers to offset their losses against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. Without these provisions there would be a strong incentive for businesses to create artificial losses as a means of receiving value from the loss. Under current tax settings, however, this risk will always be capped at the level of the otherwise net income of the group. As such, allowing offsets within a group or requiring taxpayers in general to carry losses forward are essential integrity measures in the tax system. PROBLEM DEFINITION 6. Small businesses can face particular challenges when carrying out R&D, often because of restricted access to capital and uncertain cash-flows during their early development. Although there are a number of possible reasons for this (see problem scope), these challenges are likely to be compounded by status quo tax settings, which delay the ability ofloss-making businesses to use their tax deductions. 7. There are two key tax issues here. Firstly, although the status quo provides mechanisms for tax losses to be utilised, they do cause a delay for loss-making start-ups relative to profitable ones. This creates a cash-flow bias against loss-making businesses or groups which is expected to be particularly significant for small, R&D-intensive start-ups. This is expected to have a negative impact on such businesses' propensity and ability to invest in R&D, and the probability of successful innovation. 3 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 67 of 94 8. Secondly, the status quo can also penalise businesses that do not generate sufficient profits to fully utilise their deductions or offset their losses. This is because current tax provisions effectively mean that losses can only be used going forward if the original owners subsequently engage in a profitable business. In cases where this does not occur, businesses will have incurred tax-deductible expenditures that cannot be utilised. While this is less of a problem for R&D start-ups as they are able to defer R&D expenses, the status quo still makes the use of expenditure contingent upon successful innovation (or future income earned by the same group of investors). The risk of incurring this potential additional sunk cost represented by expenditure that will not create a tax benefit is likely to provide an additional disincentive to invest in R&D projects at the margin. 9. Thus, the core problem considered in this RIS is the inability of R&D start-ups to access their tax deductions in a timely fashion, or even at all. 10. As mentioned above however, there are good reasons for the status quo. Refunding tax losses, instead of requiring these to be carried forward, would give rise to significant tax base risk. Specifically, this could encourage the creation of artificial losses by taxpayers to reduce their taxable income and could have the effect of reducing government tax revenue. As such, requiring taxpayers to carry losses forward is an essential integrity measure in the tax system, and there needs to be a strong case for changing this treatment of tax losses, particularly as the proposed initiative could be seen as a precedent for wider changes to the tax treatment of losses. Scope of the problem 1 1. Although many other businesses can also be said to suffer from similar cash-flow and capital constraints, there are strong theoretical and empirical grounds for believing that R&D- start-ups face particularly challenging obstacles. This is because of: • Information asymmetries - these arise when potential lenders have less information about the value of an R&D project than the company itself, which can lead to a break- down in the provision of financing that would be worthwhile if both parties were equally well informed. This is especially prevalent for R&D start-ups given: o the novel and/or experimental nature of R&D; o the lack of proven commercial experience; and o the lack of a proven market for the final product. • High sunk costs -which mean that R&D expenditures often have a low, or zero, resale value in the event of failure. This means that R&D start-ups often have little in the way of collateral that can be used to secure debt-financing. • High up-front costs - the natural profit cycle for innovative projects tends to involve high up-front costs and consequently, longer periods in tax loss. This implies that the problem faced by R&D start-ups is not just their overall ability to access capital, but also timely access to capital. 12. These challenges interact, potentially making it very difficult for R&D start-ups to access capital in a timely manner at an important stage of their development. In contrast, other businesses do not normally face the same difficulties when seeking lending, nor do they face the same level of uncertainty over their ongoing profits/losses. As a result, we consider the 4 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 68 of 94 scope of the problem to be limited to R&D-intensive businesses, particularly those that are small and in their start-up phase. Scale of the problem 13. There is an inherent difficulty in assessing the scale of the problem as the counterfactual is highly uncertain. Specifically, it is not possible to gauge the number and value of R&D businesses that could potentially have been successful (or would not otherwise have been impeded) in the absence ofthe capital and cash-flow constraints outlined above. 14. However, empirical evidence shows that small R&D-intensive businesses have a significantly lower probability of being successful with long-term loan applications than other businesses and that the probability of success decreases as R&D intensity increases. Venture capital can address some of these problems, but evidence from different countries indicates that small and medium businesses tend to rely on internal equity financing, and prefer to seek bank loans if external financing is required. However, recent evidence indicates that banks in New Zealand are not necessarily well engaged with the financing needs of small start-up businesses, and have relatively high le vels of risk aversion compared with UK and US banking models in suppmiing early stage companies or projects. 1 15. Nearly all submitters who commented on the problem definition, as presented in the issues paper, agreed with our overall characterisation of the problem, and that the scope should be targeted to R&D-intensive start-ups and pre-revenue taxpayers. OBJECTIVES 16. The overall objective of this policy review is to reduce a bias against investment in R&D start-ups arising from the current treatment of tax losses. Any policy option should also satisfy the objectives of the Government's Revenue Strategy, which seeks to achieve a fair and efficient tax system by: • maintaining revenue flows; • minimising economic distortions; • minimising compliance and administrative costs; and • minimising scope for avoidance and evasion. 17. It is also necessary to consider the objectives of the Government' s Business Growth Agenda (BGA). The BGA identifies business innovation as one of six key areas for building national innovation and growth. Current work in the business innovation work stream involves ensuring the business environment, including regulatory settings, is set to give businesses confidence to innovate. Removing barriers to investment in R&D start-ups arising from tax settings is entirely consistent with the Government's objectives in the BGA. 1 Boven. R . . Harland. C.. and Grace. L.

(Auckland: The New Zealand Institute. 20 I 0). 5 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 69 of 94 18. We recognise that there are likely to be trade-offs between the policy objectives. For example, the preferred option minimises economic distortions but will involve some compliance costs to ensure the integrity of the tax system. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS Options identification 19. As the core policy problem stems from the asymmetric treatment oftax losses under the status quo, the nature of the solution set is essentially binary; we can either maintain the status quo or consider ways to remove the asymmetry for the desired target group. 20. Removing the asymmetry would involve allowing certain businesses to access an amount of their tax loss deductions arising from qualifying R&D expenditure in the year that the expenditure is incurred. In practice, this means that eligible businesses would be entitled to a receipt (the cash-out) from the Government amounting to 28 per cent of their tax losses in each relevant tax year. In turn, businesses that access their tax losses early through a cashed- out loss would no longer be able to carry these losses forward to be deducted against future mcome. 21. This is the main policy option that has been developed as it directly addresses the identified policy problem. Although other options were initially considered as ways of removing the as ymmetry, these were discounted early on as they were not considered to directly address the core policy problem. Other options considered during the policy process were: • a profit-contingent loan; • a grant; • allowing taxpayers to carry their tax losses forward with interest; and • lowering the shareholder continuity threshold. 22. A profit-contingent loan was discounted because it did not address the tax distortion arising from the inability of R&D start-ups to access their tax losses in a timely fashion, or even at all. 23. A grant to R&D start-ups was also discounted as it did not remedy the policy problem, and would have had a significantly greater fiscal impact. 24. Allowing R&D start-ups to carry their tax losses forward with interest was discounted as it would not assist R&D start-ups with their cash-flow and capital constraints. While it would have addressed the distortion arising from R&D start-ups not being able to access their tax losses in a timely fashion, it would not have addressed the distortion arising from the potential wasting of the tax loss asset had the business failed to make a return. 25. Lowering the shareholder continuity threshold was raised by submitters as an alternative, and was briefly considered as a replacement for allowing R&D start-ups to cash- out R&D tax losses. Lowering the shareholder continuity threshold, with accompanying safeguards and measures to reduce risks around existing losses being used inappropriately, 6 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 70 of 94 would allow for greater changes in ownership without tax losses being forfeited. Companies that are capital~com;trained would be able to take on further equity from new shareholders without having to balance this against the forfeit of (some of) their accumulated tax losses. 26. Lowering the shareholder continuity threshold would not have addressed the same core policy problem. The R&D tax losses initiative is specifically targeted at assisting cash-flow and capital-constrained R&D start-ups who are unable to access their tax losses while the alternative proposal would be much broader, assisting any business that risked forfeiting tax losses through changing or introducing new shareholders. 27. In addition, sections EJ 22 and EJ 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007 allow taxpayers to allocate deductions for R&D expenditure taken under section DB 34 to a later income year after the shareholder continuity breach takes place. This means that R&D start-ups can already introduce new equity without forfeiting tax losses arising from R&D expenditure. Consequently, lowering the shareholder continuity threshold was not seen as a sufficiently close replacement to allowing R&D start-ups to cash-out R&D tax losses, and was not considered any further in the context of the current policy review. 28. As a result, although only one core policy option has been developed fully in this RJS, many variants of this option have been considered and consulted upon. These are discussed in the " options analysis" section below, and have been assessed with reference to the status quo. Description of the preferred option 29. Under the preferred option taxpayers that meet certain eligibility criteria will be entitled to cash-out a certain amount of their R&D tax losses. The benefit of the tax losses will be delivered by way of a cash refund equal to 28 percent of the tax loss. Only certain qualifying R&D expenditure will be permitted to contribute to the tax loss that can be cashed-out. A loss which has been cashed-out will no longer be eligible to be carried forward to be deducted against future income. 30. The key design features of the preferred option are set out below. Administration 31. In response to submissions concerned about the potential compliance costs of the proposed administration process, the administration process for the initiative is still under revision. This will be the subject of a Business Case that will determine whether the policy will be administered either by Inland Revenue only, or in partnership with Callaghan Innovation, the Crown entity that administers government funding to innovative businesses. This is scheduled to be determined by Cabinet in June 2014. Elig ibilily crileria 32. The proposed initiative will apply to R&D-intensive start-up companies who are in a tax loss position and resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. These requirements must also be met on a group basis, if the company is part of a group. 33. The initiative is restricted to certain companies only to ensure effective targeting. Companies listed on a recognised stock exchange are ineligible because they are not cash- flow and capital-constrained to the same degree as unlisted R&D stmi-ups. Also, companies 7 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 71 of 94 that have flow-through treatment of tax losses, such as look -through companies, are excluded. Any developments in this area, such as the establishment of a stock exchange that targets high-growth and innovative firms, will be followed closely. R&D wage intensity 34. Additionally, R&D -intensive start-up companies must spend at least 20 per cent of their total wage and salary expenditure on R&D to be eligible for a cashed-out loss. This measure includes shareholder salaries, contracted labour, and 66 per cent of expenditure on contracted R&D. This requirement must also be met on an overall group basis, if the company is part of a group. Definition of R&D 35. To be eligible for a cashed-out loss, a taxpayer must be carrying out eligible R&D. The proposed definitions of "research" and " development" are based on the New Zealand equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38 (NZIAS 38). This is consistent with the current definitions of "research" and "development" used in the Income Tax Act as well as by Callaghan Innovation. Guidance will be provided to support potential applicants. 36. The agency that administers the definition (Callaghan Innovation or Inland Revenue) and the way in which the definition is legislated for (as a process or as a statutory test) is dependent on the result of the Business Case. Excluded expenditure 37. Certain expenditure items will not be eligible expenditure. They are: • interest expenses on R&D; • the purchase of existing R&D assets; • R&D undertaken offshore; and • finance lease payments for R&D equipment. 38. Expenditure on "operating leases", as defined in the Income Tax Act, will be included as eligible expenditure. Operating leases are typically shorter-tetm leases that are not substitutes for financing a purchase with debt (these are "finance leases" and will remam excluded). Amount of R&D tax losses to be cashed out 39. Qualifying taxpayers will be able to cash out, for the relevant year, the lesser of: • 1.5 times their eligible R&D salary and wage expenditure; • total tax losses; • total qualifying R&D expenditure; and • the overall cap on eligible R&D tax losses. 8 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 72 of 94 40. The initial cap will be set at $500,000 of losses, which amounts to a cashed~out loss of $140,000. This will rise eventually to $2 million, equivalent to a cashed-out loss of $560,000. This cap reduces its fiscal risk, especially in the early years of the new rules when there will be uncertainty over the response of R&D start-ups to the changes. Gradually increasing the cap will help ensure that the benefits ofthe cashed-out loss will not be reduced by an increase in demand for R&D inputs that will result in an increase in the cost of carrying out R&D, rather than an increase in R&D itself. 41. The 1.5 times multiplier applied to the R&D salary and wages expenditure is intended to help R&D start-ups cash-out losses that are incurred as a result of other non-salary and wage R&D expenditure. The different ways of calculating the amount of the cashed-out loss is necessary to ensure R&D start-ups with and without a large proportion of salary and wage expenditure to total expenditure (subject to meeting the wage intensity threshold) have similar access to the policy. Loss recovery events 42. The overall policy intent is to provide a temporary cash-flow benefit for R&D start-ups that will be repaid out of their future taxable income. However, of the R&D start-ups that derive a return from the investment, not all derive a return that is taxable. Often the return is not realised until the intellectual property is sold. If the value of the cashed-out loss is not recovered from the sale proceeds, then the interest-free loan becomes a grant, and the fiscal risk of the policy is much greater. 43. As an integrity measure, we propose that loss recovery should take place for the R&D start-up when a taxpayer with a cashed-out loss or investor makes a capital return, but only to the extent of the cashed-out loss. The " loss recovery events" would be when: • the company sells intellectual property; • when 90 per cent of shares in the company are sold; • the company becomes non-resident (for tax purposes); or • the company is liquidated. 44. The liability to return the value of the cashed-out loss is the responsibility of the company rather than the shareholder for compliance reasons. A threshold of 90 per cent, rather than 100 per cent, accounts for management interests being retained in situations when private equity sells out. Although the liability is on the company, we expect that shareholders will indirectly bear this liability as any buyer knowing of the loss recovery rules should pay less for the shares than they would otherwise. 45. If the company changes its tax residence or liquidates, we propose that there be a deemed sale of intellectual property at its market value and that losses be recovered to the extent that a profit is made on that deemed sale. Mechanism to recover losses 46. R&D start-ups will be required to reinstate their tax losses through a cash payment if a loss recovery event takes place. The payment to reinstate losses will not be deemed income 9 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 73 of 94 • for tax purposes, but represents the loan repayment necessary to convert their cashed-out losses back into losses arising from R&D expenditure tO-carry forward to apply again~t future mcome. 47. To illustrate how this would work in practice, a taxpayer eligible for a cashed-out loss has in year I a $100 cashed-out loss (equivalent to $28) and $100 of losses being CatTied forward. In year 2, the taxpayer sells intellectual property receiving a capital return of $500. This is a loss recovery event and the taxpayer is required to return the value of the cashed out loss - $28 - to Inland Revenue in order to have their loss of $100 reinstated. Consequently, the loss is reinstated and the taxpayer will now have $200 of losses being carried forward to apply against future taxable income. Analysis of the preferred option Economic implications 48. The preferred option is expected to: • provide some relief for the financing constraints faced by R&D-intensive start-ups during the initial loss-making phase of the innovation cycle; and • reduce the amount of any tax losses accumulated by R&D start-up companies that will be forfeited in the event of failure. 49. This is expected at the margin to have a positive impact on incentives to invest in R&D and the likelihood of successful innovation. It is not possible to quantify these benefits as there are no comparable policies in operation elsewhere. However, in bringing forward the benefits of deductibility, the proposal essentially transfers a timing advantage from the Government to eligible businesses. It is expected that this timing advantage will be much more valuable to target businesses (cash-constrained R&D start-ups) than to the Government. Therefore, the primary economic impact of the proposal (taking into account the opportunity cost to the Governn1ent of delayed tax revenue, but before taking into account administration/implementation costs) is expected to be positive at the margin. 50. It is important to point out that this option is not the same as a conventional tax subsidy such as an R&D tax credit. This is because, prima facie, this option does not alter a compan y's overall tax liability as any tax deductions that are taken early can no longer be taken in the future. However, the option does provide a time value of money benefit to eligible businesses as it reallocates tax benefits from the future to the present. This benefit is expected to be of value for target businesses as the reallocation across time also coincides with a rebalancing of tax liabilities from periods ofloss to periods of profit. 51. Since the start of initial policy development, the OECD have also recently indicated that 'R&D tax incentives should be designed to meet the needs of young, innovative " stand alone" firms without cross-border tax planning opportunities' 2 . This is because: • Young businesses are considered to play a crucial role in employment creation, with evidence from 15 OECD countries over 2001-11 indicating that young firms (aged 5 2 M aximising the benefits of R&D tax incentives for innovation. OECD policy brief, October 2013 10 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 74 of 94 years or less) generated almost 50 per cent of all new jobs created despite accounting for only 20 per cent of total (non-financial} business employment. 3 • The global tax system is considered to create an uneven playing field for small, domestic businesses vis-a-vis large multinationals which can take advantage of cross- border tax planning opportunities. 4 52. As a result, this option is expected to be well targeted. Fiscal costs 53. Allowing early access to tax losses involves an opportunity cost to the Government from the tax loss that is cashed-out. Although this amounts to a reduction in tax revenue in the year that losses are cashed-out, this is partially recovered when businesses eventually make assessable income. This is because losses that are accessed early can no longer be carried forward to be offset against future income. As a result, the direct fiscal costs of the policy largely amount to a timing concession (relative to the status quo) for businesses at the expense of the Government. 54. However, in the case of those businesses that never become profitable (or do not generate profits sufficient to cover the value of the cashed-out loss), the cashed-out loss will effectively amount to a (pmtial) grant. Technically however, this is the " correct" (i.e. neutral) tax treatment for businesses that do not generate sufficient profits. 55. Our estimates of the fiscal costs of the policy indicate that the net effect of these various factors will result in an annual average fiscal cost to the Government of $15 million per annum. This estimate is based on evidence from the R&D business survey on the number of businesses expected to satisfy the eligibility criteria for the policy, a11d information from IR4 income tax returns about the value of their losses. Administration/implementation costs 56. The overall administration and implementation costs for a scenario where Inland Revenue partners with Callaghan Innovation are currently estimated at $2.9 million for 2014115, $4.4 million for 2015116 and $1.8 million thereafter from 2016117. These estimates are expected to be an upper limit for a rm1ge of options. 57. As noted above, the administration regime for the initiative has not yet been decided. This will be the subject of a Business Case, This is scheduled to be determined by Cabinet in June 2014. Compliance costs 58. Compliance is an important element of this initiative, as although the overall policy is business-friendly, the desired target group (R&D-intensive start-ups) is unlikely to be well equipped to deal with a high compliance burden. In addition, evaluation of the recently discontinued R&D tax credit revealed that a non-trivial p01tion of the benefits were captured by professional tax advisory services rather than R&D businesses. However, certain 3 Maximising the benefits of R&D tax incentives for innovation. OECD policy brief, October 2013 4 Maximising the benelits of R&D tax incentives for innovation. OECD policy brief, October 2013 II Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 75 of 94 compliance measures are necessary to ensure that the initiative is not gamed or abused by applicants. 59. Key changes made to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers have seen the R&D wage intensity measure change and the loss recovery rules simplified, which are discussed in detail in the consultation section. 60. It is not possible to assess the compliance costs ansmg from the proposed administration regime, as this has not yet been determined. However, it is known that R&D start-ups are not equipped to handle a high compliance burden. Consequently, the relative compliance costs of the various options will be one of the key criteria considered in the Business Case. Regardless of the outcome of the Business Case, the information that taxpayers will be expected to provide as pm1 of the application process is intended to be consistent with the information an R&D start-up would be expected to have on hand as part of effective project management, and maintaining intellectual property records and accounting systems. 61. Although the initiative will inevitably place a compliance burden on applicants, and it is not possible to quantify these compliance costs, it is expected that these costs will (for most businesses) be outweighed by the benefits, especially for R&D start-ups with appropriate information management systems, as noted above. The compliance costs of applying to Callaghan Innovation for a government grant for R&D funding also provide a useful guide on reasonable compliance costs proportionate to the size of the cashed-out loss. It is also expected that compliance costs would be highest in the first year that a taxpayer applies for a cashed-out loss. With many R&D stat1-ups likely to be eligible to receive a cashed-out loss for a number of income years, compliance costs should reduce over time as taxpayers become increasingly familiar with the compliance requirements of the policy. Risks 62. The primary policy risk is that the initiative could be seen as a precedent for a more general change to the tax treatment of losses, noting that the stock of tax losses was calculated to be $44 billion in 2010. This risk should be mitigated by making it very clear that this is a very narrow proposal targeted specifically at removing a tax impediment to innovative start- up ventures. 63. We have explored the sensttivtty of the estimated fiscal cost to changes in key assumptions. In particular, this includes the number of firms who receive a cashed-out loss, the overall repayment rate of the cashed out loss (which depends on both the firm survival rate, and the ability to claw-back from firms that sell intellectual property or undergo a change in ownership), and the timeframe for repayment. This additional sensitivity analysis indicates that if the number of firms who receive a cashed-out Joss or the repayment rate is higher or lower than expected, both the average fiscal cost and year-to-year variation could change. 64. Another risk is that the initiative is poorly targeted and includes taxpayers outside the target group of R&D start-ups. This would reduce the effectiveness of the policy while increasing its fiscal cost. This occurrence is thought to be of relatively low risk as the eligibility requirements are relatively narrow and focus on excluding companies that are able to use their tax losses or are not cash- t1ow and capital-constrained. 65. There is some risk that taxpayers could attempt to recharacterise non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure to meet the eligibility requirements or inflate the size of their cashed-out 12 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 76 of 94 loss. This risk will be mitigated by using wage and salary expenditure to determine eligibility and as a basis (with a multiplier to approximate other R&D expenditun~) for calculating the amount of the cashed-out loss. Wage and salary expenditure is harder to recharacterise compared with other types of expenditure. Social, environment and cultural impacts 66. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with the preferred option. Net impact of the preferred option 67. As mentioned above, the proposal can be considered as transferring a timing advantage from the Government to eligible businesses. On balance, this timing advantage is expected to be much more valuable to target businesses (cash-constrained R&D start-ups) than to the Government, and is therefore expected to have a positive impact at the margin on incentives to invest in R&D as well as the likelihood of successful i1movation. 68. On balance, the preferred option largely meets the objectives of the project. Allowing R&D start-ups to access their tax losses from qualifying R&D expenditure reduces the distortion from the current tax treatment of losses. There is some fiscal risk but the overall estimated cost of the option is lower than that of a grant as this option only provides a timing advantage to R&D strut-ups that is repayable out of future returns. Pruticular emphasis has been placed on providing a balance around reducing compliance and administration costs with minimising avoidance and evasion following public consultation; however, the administration regime is still to be determined. The proposed initiative is consistent with the Business Growth Agenda as it removes a barrier to investment in innovative businesses. 69. As a result, it is expected that the net benefits of the policy (before taking into account administration and implementation costs) will be positive relative to the status quo. We also consider it highly unlikely that the overall administration costs will change the nature of this assessment as this analysis has considered an administration regime option with a relatively high cost-although we note that these are still subject to finalisation in the Business Case. CONSULTATION 70. An officials' issues paper, R&D tax losses was released by the Treasury and Inland Revenue for public consultation on 23 July 2013. A total of 24 submissions were received from a range of submitters including professional services firms, industry and other professional bodies, R&D companies and individuals. 71. Officials have also undertaken discussions with tax policy officials from the United Kingdom and Australia to discuss their experience with the operation of similar R&D tax initiatives. Submissions on the policy framework 72. The response from submitters was broadly positive, with the intent of the policy generally well received. Submitters were concerned with the overall complexity and compliance burden of the proposed solution, which would make it difficult and/or expensive for small R&D start-ups to comply with the policy's requirements. They felt that the overly 13 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 77 of 94 • restnct1ve nature of the eligibility criteria and a possibly time-consuming and complex application process were likely to be most problematiG in this an~a. 73. Submitters also suggested alternatives to a cashed-out loss. It was questioned whether the tax system is the appropriate vehicle to provide an R&D incentive. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment has much greater expertise in assessing what is "true" R&D, and using the tax system adds complexity to what could be a much simpler loan scheme. A relaxation of the shareholder continuity rules was also proposed. The cunent requirement of 49 per cent of the original shareholding to maintain continuity is seen as a problem for many R&D start-ups, who breach the continuity threshold through the addition of new equity, and forfeit tax losses. Allowing taxpayers to cash-out losses addresses a problem, rather than the root cause of the current shareholder continuity rules. 74. As a result of consultation, we focused on updating the policy design with changes that we believed would alleviate compliance costs and complexity. These changes are noted in the policy detail section. 75. The alternatives suggested have not been considered further as they do not address the particular policy problem of the inability of R&D start-ups to access in a timely fashion, or at all, their tax losses. The loan scheme suggestion will reduce the cash-flow constraint faced by R&D start-ups, but not the wasted losses. The shareholder continuity proposal is less targeted and there are already provisions in the Income Tax Act which allow losses arising from R&D expenditure to be protected from a breach. Submissions on policy details 76. As mentioned above, submitters generally agreed with the overall objectives of the proposals as described above. However, written submissions on the issues paper and later meetings and conversations between submitters and Inland Revenue and Treasury officials also focussed on the detailed policy proposals put forward in the issues paper. 77. Although many of the features of the final policy proposal are consistent with the issues paper, the following table sets out the specific proposals that attracted the most submissions. For each issue it restates the original policy proposal and, if the final policy proposals have been altered as a result of consultation, what has changed and why. Where key submission points were not advanced as part of the final proposal, it explains the reasons why they were not considered appropriate: 14 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 78 of 94 Issues paper proposal R&D definition The issues paper proposed using the definitions of ·'research ' ' and "development" that are already used in NZIAS 38 and the Income Tax Act 2007. Submissions One group of submitters (mostly from professional services firms and industry bodies) noted that there is already a level of familiarity with this definition , which makes it more appropriate than developing new one. The alternative view (mostly from R&D companies) is that this definition will require R&D start-ups, which are understandably unfamiliar with accounting standards, to seek expensive external assistance. Officials' response It is proposed that Callaghan Innovation will determine the R&D eligibility of the applicant on behalf of Inland Rev;enue. The agencies' definitions of ' ' research " and " development'" do not materially differ as Callaghan Innovation 's definitions of " research " and " development ", like the ones currently in mse in the Income Tax Act 2007, are based on the New Zealand equivalent to International Accounting Standard 38 (NZIAS 38) . Concerns raised by submitters are valid , but some sort of definition of R&D is inevitable . Guidance to applicants should help reduce compliance costs in this area . The agency that administers the definition (Callaghan Innovation or Inland Revenue) and the way in which the definition is legislated for (as a proces s or as a statutory test) is dependent on the result of the Business Case. R&D wage intensity I Submitters raised concerns that using the R&D wage It is proposed that companies must spend at least 20 percent of intensity measure proposed in the issues paper would their total wage and salary expenditure on R&D to be eligible The issues paper proposed that companies must spend at severely curtail access to the policy because R&D start- for a cashed-out loss.

Excluded activities The issues paper proposed a list of excluded activities based on the previous R&D tax credit, as well as excluding clinical trials and late stage software development. This was based on officials' concerns, based on experiences with the previous R&D tax credit, that despite these activities being associated with technological progress , they may not actually meet the definition of R&D. Including these activities could pose a fiscal risk as expenditure on these activities is significant. Excluded expenditure The issues paper proposed the following exclusions: Interest expenses on R&D. The purchase of existing R&D assets. R&D undertaken offshore. All lease payment s for R&D equipment. Expenditure funded by government grants or research funding. Submitters opposed the exclusions of clinical trials, and provided further information of what they entail. Clinical trials go through a number of stages. In general, stage one and two clinical trials are exploratory in nature while stage three (and four , if undertaken) confirms existing findings from earlier trial s. Submitters also opposed the exclusion of late stage software development and requested greater clarity around the exclusion. Submitters generally accepted that there were aspects of software development that were not R&D, especially in the area of 'e nd-user testing ', but detailed guidelines should be provided around what is and what isn 't R&D in this space . Submitters noted that many R&D start-ups are not able to finance the purchase of capital equipment with either debt or equity, but can only afford to lease the equipment initially. We propose using Callaghan Innovation's list of spec ific exclusions from their Growth grant, which li sts excluded activities that will not be considered R&D. This is si milar to the list of excluded activities already proposed in the issues paper and that was used for the previous R&D tax credit. The list is not exhaustive and activities not listed must still satisfy the R&D definition. If the Business Case is not approved and Callaghan Innovation is not involved in the administration ofthe policy, it is likely to be preferable to revert to the list of excluded activities propo se d in the issues paper. The two li sts are materially the same , but using the list based on the previous R&D tax credit will provide additional familiarity for Inland Revenue. The proposal is largely consistent with the issues paper. These expenses were excluded on the basis that they may distort economic decisions, endanger the integrity of the policy , or create inequity between taxpayers in a similar position . Leasing and financing with debt are not substitutes im this situation . Excluding this expenditure would reduce the qualifying R&D expenditure unnecessarily for the tm ;geted group. Officials therefore propose not excluding expenditure on operating (shorter-term) leases . Expenditure funded by government grants has also been removed from the exclusion list as this expenditure is generally not deductible , and therefore does not contribute to a loss . Loss recovery rules I Submitters were concerned that such an approach would To address these concerns, we propose that when 90% 0f the involve significant compliance and administration shares in the company are sold , loss recovery is triggered for The issues paper proposed that loss recovery should take I concerns around knowledge of the level of cashed-out the company. 16 ..

For the reasons set out in the "Regulatory Impact Analysis" section of this statement, we recommend that a set of tax rules be enacted that would allow R&D-intensive stm1-up companies to "cash out" (or refund) their tax losses arising from qualifying R&D expenditure, rather than carrying the loss forward to deduct against future income. 79. We also recommend that the revised rules have the key features set out from paragraph 29 of the "Regulatory Impact Analysis" section. 80. The Treasury was consulted and agrees with our conclusions and recommendations. IMPLEMENTATION 81. The proposed initiative will have some system implications for Inland Revenue which contribute to the implementation costs. Both the systems implications and implementation cost will vary depending on the administrative option chosen. 82. The proposed initiative should apply from income years starting on or after 1 April 2015. It should therefore be included in the next available omnibus tax bill scheduled for later this year, which in turn means that the legislation will not be passed ahead of the 1 April 2015 start date. It is anticipated that there would be a degree of retrospectivity compared to the start date, but as this initiative is advantageous to taxpayers this should not be of concern. Even with legislative introduction in early 2015, it would be passed by the time that taxpayers' losses crystallise for the first year of the policy on 31 March 2016. 83. The changes will be communicated to taxpayers through the usual legislative means, including a detailed commentary to the bill when introduced and a summary of the final rules in a Tax Information Bulletin once the enacting legislation has received Royal Assent. Inland Revenue will also provide guidance for potential applicants on eligible R&D. 84. The proposed initiative is a complement to other tax and non-tax R&D incentives. The R&D grant programmes administered by Callaghan Innovation target more mature innovative businesses relative to the smaller and younger R&D stm1-ups targeted by the R&D tax losses policy. 85. Taxpayers will continue to self-assess their tax liability; however, their R&D eligibility and R&D expenditure will be assessed by either Inland Revenue or Callaghan Innovation. This is necessary to reduce a fiscal risk arising from taxpayers outside the target group of R&D stm1-ups erroneously claiming a cashed-out loss or applicants recharacterising non- R&D expenditure to obtain a larger cashed-out loss. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 86. Monitoring the effect of these changes will fall under Inland Revenue's responsibilities under the generic tax policy process (GTTP). The GTTP is a multi-stage process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage of this process contemplates the implementation and review stage, which can involve Inland Revenue conducting a post-implementation review of the legislation and identifying any remedial issues. 18 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 82 of 94 Regulatory Impact Statement Review of the implementation of the simplified filing requirements for individuals' legislation Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question addressed in this statement is whether the implementation of legislation for simplified filing requirements for individuals (SFRI), which was enacted in 2012 and is not due to take effect until the 2016-17 year, is a sound investment. Inland Revenue considers that a significant proportion of the projected revenue gains of $217 million from SFRI will be eroded due to the changes expected under Inland Revenue's Business Transformation (BT) Programme, which is aimed at simplifying New Zealand's tax administration system. As a result, the SFRI legislation should not be implemented. The policy underlying the SFRI legislation was set three years ago. At that time, the Government was concerned about the inherent tension between individuals who are not required to file an income tax return and those who are. This tension gives rise to complexity in meeting obligations and creates fairness and equity concerns for some individuals. Individuals who are required to file an income tax return may have a tax debt in one year and receive a refund in another year. For individuals who are not required to file, however, there is no incentive to file an income tax return in order to square-up in years of tax debt, but they can easily claim any available refunds. The practice of filing income tax returns in those years in which an individual is due a refund is referred to as "cherry picking" and has become prevalent especially with the introduction of personal tax summary (PTS) intermediaries. This practice has also resulted in a situation where large amounts of revenue are being paid out in refunds, without a reciprocal obligation on taxpayers to pay any tax debt. SFRI legislation is aimed at addressing the fairness and equity concerns by removing the ability for people to cherry pick and by removing the requirement for others to file income tax returns. Inland Revenue's current BT thinking for individual salary and wage earners is for more streamlined processes with salary and wage earners' information being provided by third parties such as employers and banks to Inland Revenue and Inland Revenue undertaking the necessary calculations. This should lead to a more accurate P AYE structure, which means fewer people in a refund or tax debt position at the end of the year. If it were adopted, the current BT vision will represent a significant change in direction in dealing with end of year tax debts and refunds and draws into question the assumptions on which the SFRI legislation is based, and therefore whether it should now be implemented. Inland Revenue' s review of the implementation of the SFRI legislation concluded that the benefits and policy outcomes sought by SFRI can be delivered by BT but in a more coherent way that aligns with our vision of a proactive and efficient tax administration. The preferred option is to repeal the SFRI legislation. This is intended to reduce compliance costs and confusion for a large group of individuals who would need to change their interactions with Inland Revenue under SFRI and then again under BT. We acknowledge, Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 83 of 94 however, that there may be a negative effect on public trust and confidence in the tax administration system due to major changes being enacted and then repealed prior to implementation. Repealing the SFRI legislation will also reduce administration costs for Inland Revenue as it will avoid creating resource contention issues across Inland Revenue's entire change portfolio and BT. In particular, highly skilled FIRST resources would have been needed to work on SFRI at a time when these resources would be required for BT. The most significant dependency of the analysis is the ability oflnland Revenue to deliver the BT programme by the indicative timeline. If Inland Revenue does not implement the BT programme and deliver the expected benefits of an improved PAYE structure by 2019-20, then this will affect Inland Revenue's assessment ofthe SFRI investment. No public consultation was undertaken on the option to repeal the SFRI legislation. We considered there would be very little benefit in consulting with the affected groups because repeal would be taxpayer-friendly, and the affected groups would not have adjusted their behaviour in line with the SFRI changes as these changes are not due to take affect for another three years. Even so, Inland Revenue hosted a conference "A Tax Administration for the 21st Century'' in June 2014. Some tax practitioners and representatives from PTS intermediaries who attended the conference questioned the relevance of the SFRI legislation given the current BT vision and supported the repeal ofthe SFRI legislation. There are no other significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. The preferred option does not impact private property rights, restrict market competition, or override fundamental common law principles. The status quo option will reduce the net amount of refunds available to individuals and this will also affect the current business model of the personal tax intermediary market. These implications were canvassed in the July 2011 Regulatory Impact Statement Simplifying filing requirements for individuals and record-keeping requirements for businesses. Ro Grindle \\ Ac ·ng Deputy Commissioner, Change ~land Revenue 22 July 2014 2 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 84 of 94 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Background 1. New Zealand's current tax administration is heavily reliant on paper-based processes such as the annual return-filing system. These processes are both costly and time consuming as they increase taxpayer contacts with Inland Revenue. In the last 10 years, the number of contacts with taxpayers has increased significantly and the resulting processing has created considerable pressure on the administration ofthe tax system. The increase in contacts is due in part to the expansion oflnland Revenue's responsibilities into social policy administration and the requirement for social policy recipients to file an income tax return. 2. Also driving the increase in contacts is the large number of individuals able to self- select to file an income tax return in years in which they are due a refund. This has resulted in a significantly increased workload for Inland Revenue as people re-enter the annual filing system. Some taxpayers are required to file an income tax return (and pay any tax debts) simply because they are, for example Working for Families (WfF) recipients, whereas other taxpayers who are not required to file, have the ability to "cherry pick" the years they filed on the basis of whether they are to receive a tax refund or have a tax debt. This practice has become prevalent especially with the introduction of personal tax summary (PTS) intermediaries and has also resulted in a situation where a large amount of revenue is being paid out, without a reciprocal obligation on taxpayers to pay any tax debt. 3. The simplified filing requirements for individuals (SFRI) initiatives introduced in 2012 are aimed at addressing fairness and equity concerns by stopping people cherry picking, and removing the requirement for WfF recipients to file income tax returns. Previous Cabinet decisions 4. In June 2010, Cabinet agreed to the release of the discussion document, Making tax easier, which outlined various proposals for transforming the way that Inland Revenue engages with employers, businesses and individuals \[EGI Min ( 1 0) 1111 0\]. 5. In August 2011, in response to feedback on the discussion document, several initiatives were developed and considered by Cabinet, namely: • an "e" awareness campaign and enhancements to Inland Revenue's online service for individuals (no legislation was required); • amalgamating two major tax returns, theIR 3 and personal tax summary (PTS) returns; • delinking the requirement to file a personal tax return if the person is receiving Working for Families (WfF) tax credits. ("WfF delinking"); and • requiring a person to file income tax returns for the past four years, if they are not otherwise required to file, but they choose to do so , to prevent cherry picking of refunds ("4+ 1 square-up"). 6. The three legislative initiatives were to take effect from 1 April 2015. 3 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 85 of 94 7. Cabinet agreed to the package of initiatives and their inclusion in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Bill. \[EGI Min (11) 17/14, CAB Min (11) 30/8\] 8. In early April 2012, it was identified by Inland Revenue that if the package of initiatives were to be implemented it would have placed significant pressure on Inland Revenue's ability to implement any future change initiatives, including the Student Loan Redesign Project (which was already underway) and the Child Support Reform Programme (which was in the initial stages of implementation). 9. At the time, Cabinet was advised by Inland Revenue that there was a way to deliver a less resource intensive and system-reliant solution for the package of initiatives, but it would involve not proceeding with the amalgamation of the IR 3 and the PTS returns. Cabinet agreed that in the interest of maintaining maximum organisational stability for and flexibility within Inland Revenue, the amalgamation of the two returns was removed from the Bill. Cabinet also agreed that the implementation dates for the two remaining legislative initiatives; WfF decoupling and the 4+1 square-up would be deferred for two years (the 2016-17 income year). \[EGI Min (12) 6/17, CAB Min (12) 12/6C\] 10. The Cabinet decisions were included in the officials' report that was delivered to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on 30 April 2012. There were no other significant changes made to the package of initiatives in the following Parliamentary stages. 11. The Bill containing the SFRI initiatives was enacted in November 2012. 12. The "e" awareness campaign and enhancements to Inland Revenue's online service for individuals are well underway. Key initiatives under this campaign include eUptake specific marketing to migrate more taxpayers to Inland Revenue's digital space and direct taxpayer education on Inland Revenue's online services and reduce use of cheques. High-level review of the implementation of the SFRI legislation 13. In December 2013, the Minister of Revenue directed Inland Revenue to undertake a high-level review of the benefits, costs and impacts of implementing the SFRI legislation and to consider the viability of the SFRI investment in the light of the recent progress on the Business Transformation (BT) Programme. This direction was in response to concerns raised by Inland Revenue about its ability to implement the legislation by the legislative dates and the need to seek further funding to implement the legislation. 14. Inland Revenue's review concluded that the likely outcomes from BT will mean that implementing the SFRI legislation is now no longer a sound investment. This conclusion was based on Inland Revenue's examination of the benefits and costs of implementing SFRI and how BT will affect the policy outcomes sought under SFRI. SFRI impacts 15. The estimated revenue gains expected from SFRI were $217 million over a period of seven years, starting from the 2016-17 year. These gains mainly result from the 4+ 1 square- up initiative, as individuals will no longer be able to cherry pick the years in which to file an income tax return based on whether they receive a refund. They will instead be required to file tax returns for the last four years in addition to the current year in which they have chosen to file an income tax return. 4 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 86 of 94 16. The estimated cost to implement SFRI is in the vicinity of $3 5 million to $45 million. Inland Revenue currently has $14.463 million to implement the SFRI legislation 1 . A further $20 million to $30 million will be required to implement the legislation. 17. By the end of the 2018-19 year (the year before BT is expected to start delivering benefits linked to streamlining P AYE), Inland Revenue would have spent a cumulative $3 5 million to $45 million implementing the SFRI legislation for estimated revenue of $36 million. 2 This means the return on investment for the period up to 2018-19 would be between $0.80 to $1.03 for every dollar spent. 18. The original analysis undertaken in 2011 determined that the 4+ 1 square-up would affect 310,000 individuals and the WfF decoupling change would affect 330,000 individuals. The 4+ 1 square-up group has now increased to over 500,000 due to the efforts of PTS intermediaries. The impacts of these initiatives were canvassed in the July 2011 Regulatory Impact Statement Simplifying filing requirements for individuals and record-keeping requirements for businesses. How Business Transformation affects SFRI 19. Inland Revenue is currently embarking on a Business Transformation (BT) programme, a once-in-a-generation opportunity to simplify New Zealand's tax administration system. This is more than a "computer" project - rather, it is a comprehensive transformation of Inland Revenue's operating model. This is likely to include future policy changes. 20. The outcome roadmap for BT noted by Cabinet in August 2013 displays the desired outcomes of transformation, grouped in four stages. Stage 1 focuses on securing digital services including streamlining the collection of P AYE information and is due to be delivered between years 1 to 6 of the programme. Stage 2 ofBT envisages streamlining business taxes and will include work on improving the accuracy ofPAYE deductions. Stage 3 will focus on the delivery of social policies Inland Revenue administers. Stage 4 looks at other taxes. 21. Inland Revenue's current BT thinking for salary and wage earners is for more streamlined processes with salary and wage earner information being provided to Inland Revenue by third parties and Inland Revenue undertaking the necessary tax calculations. This should lead to a more accurate P AYE structure, which means fewer people in a refund or tax debt position at the end of the year. With real-time information and analytical tools, refunds would automatically be given out removing the need for people to file an income tax return to get a refund, and debts would be automatically rolled over to new periods, so "cherry picking would be non-existent. 22. If it were adopted, the current BT VISion would represent a significant change in direction in dealing with end of year under and over payments of P AYE and draws into question the assumptions on which the SFRI legislation are based, and therefore whether it should now be implemented. 1 This amount comprises appropriated funds of $6.263 million and delegated authority for Inland Revenue to spend up to $8.2 million from its capital reserves. 2 The $36 million is based on the revised revenue gains expected from SFRI. It comprises $4 million in 2016-17, $7 million in 2017-18, and$25 million in 2018-19. 5 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 87 of 94 23. On current plan, it is envisaged BT will deliver a more improved P AYE structure by the 2019-20 year. This would make P AYE more accurate and make a significant difference to reducing, over time, the number of individuals who would need to square-up at the end ofthe year. 24. The benefits arising from BT stages 1 and 2 that are relevant to the consideration of SFRI are as follows: • BT stage 1 will deliver more accurate P AYE, therefore reducing the need for square-ups by improving the accuracy of tax codes being used by customers, providing near real-time validation of tax codes, and integrating information collection requirements and rules for PA YE into payroll software to minimise errors on a pay-period basis. Inland Revenue's recent experience with student loans has shown that getting people on the right tax code early reduces down- stream errors and increases repayment levels. • BT stage 2 will follow with further improvements in PA YE, including integrating withholding requirements and rules for PAYE into payroll software to increase the accuracy of withholding deductions on a pay-period basis and deploying upfront analytical tools to validate and verify data. 25. The BT changes for individual salary and wage earners and their expected impacts, outcomes and benefits are set out in diagram 1. Improving the accuracy of tax codes being used by individual salary and wage earners and providing near real-time validation of tax codes would mean deductions are accurate from the outset. This will mean reduced year-end square ups and more accurate assessment of social policy entitlements through improved income data. The benefits from BT would include reduced administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for individuals. Diagram 1 v • Tax codes and deductions checked up front at the start of employment • Information validated at the point of entry Change • lnfonnation received sooner y • Deductions accurate from the outset Impact • Able to detect and correct deductions sooner y • Reduced year-end square-ups Outcome • More accurate assessment of social policy entitlements through improved income data y • Reduction in administrative costs from less processing and fewer customer interactions • Reduction in compliance costs, as customers will have fewer interactions with Inland Revenue Benefits • Reduction in debt and recovery activity, as there will be fewer people needing to square-up 26. The revenue gain estimates for BT stage 1 indicate financial benefits of $500 million- $700 million and economic benefits (improved customer experience and compliance cost savings) of $1 billion-$2.2 billion over a 10-year period. Most of these benefits are expected to be realised from 2019-20 onwards. Inland Revenue is not in a position to provide a detailed yearly break-down at this time. 6 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 88 of 94 27. The estimates of the BT benefits will be validated as part of the first detailed design business case, which is expected to be completed in November 2014. This process will include consultation with customers and third parties to confirm the nature, extent and timing of these benefits. 28. Diagram 2 highlights the interplay between BT and SFRI. The bottom row of boxes indicates the cumulative net effect of the SFRI investment for the period from 2013 to 2021. The first year in which the SFRI investment becomes positive (the estimated revenue exceeds estimated costs) is the 2019-20 year, and this is when BT is also expected to start delivering its benefits of more accurate PAYE and reduced need for individuals to square-up. The positive outcomes which were expected to arise from SFRI in 2019-20 and beyond will not now be realised as the revenue gains from SFRI will cease from that point. Diagram 2 Year SFRI (Cumulative net impact- revenue minus costs ($million) WfF 4+1 square-up delivered delivered SFRI/BT crossover The first stage of BT will deliver more accurate P AYE and reduced need for square-up The next stage of BT will make further improvements in P AYE deductions II 1 19.610 1 1 63.310 1 J 29. In the 2019-20 year the SFRI benefits will cease as the SFRI policy settings are superseded by the BT policy settings. 30. The intersection of SFRI and BT would also potentially cause significant taxpayer confusion given that the two projects are operating to significantly different policy settings. This could lead to increased taxpayer contacts with Inland Revenue as taxpayers require more assistance to understand the changes and this would give rise to increased costs for both parties. 31. Inland Revenue's review concluded that the SFRI legislation should not be implemented on the basis that the revenue gains of $217 million from SFRI will be eroded by BT. On current plan, BT will deliver a more improved P AYE structure, which will make PA YE more accurate and substantially reduce the number of individuals with a material refund or tax debt at the end of the year. Consequently, as SFRI was only ever seen as a "back-end" solution (i.e., stopping people "cherry picking" thereby reducing the incentive to file) to a "front-end" problem of inaccurate PA YE deductions during the year, the policy outcomes sought under SFRI will not be realised from 2019-20 onwards. 7 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 89 of 94 OBJECTIVES 32. The objectives of this review are to ensure that: a) changes made to the current tax administration for individual salary and wage earners align with the BT vision of a proactive and efficient tax administration; b) the Government's revenue base is maintained; c) Inland Revenue can maintain its organisational stability and flexibility so that it can manage its change portfolio including BT; d) individual salary and wage earners have certainty of tax treatment and compliance costs are minimised. 33. The key objective in this analysis is objective (a). This is because the BT vision will set the future framework in which all policy changes will need to comply with. There may need to be a trade-off between the objective of maintaining the Government's revenue base and the other objectives. For example, implementing the status quo will address the cherry picking issue (and the revenue leakage) but it is also inconsistent with the BT vision and is likely to put pressure on Inland Revenue to manage its current change portfolio. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 34. Inland Revenue's high-level review considered a range of options for addressing the problem definition and achieving the objectives. These options ranged from implementing the SFRI legislation in whole, in part and not at all. 3 5. We also considered scaling back the SFRI legislation in order to mm1m1se implementation costs. However, as the underlying premise of the SFRI initiatives did not align well with the BT vision, the scale back options were not further explored. Furthermore, although it would have been possible to implement the 4+ 1 square-up change without the need to deliver WfF delinking, it would not have been sensible to deliver WfF delinking without the 4+ 1 square-up as it would still have allowed WfF customers to cherry pick. 36. The options analysed in this RIS are: • Option 1 -implement the SFRI legislation as enacted (status quo). This option would commence with the development of a better business case, which would examine both the solution and costs in more detail and establish how this initiative will be funded. • Option 2 -repeal the SFRI legislation. Under this option taxpayers will continue to have the ability to cherry pick until the BT measures are implemented in 2019-20. Analysis of options 37. The tables below set out our assessment of the two options against the objectives and summarises the impacts of each of option relative to the status quo. 8 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 90 of 94 TABLE 1: ANALYSIS OF OPTION 1 Impacts Option Meets Net impact objectives Administrative and compliance Economic and fiscal impacts impacts Equity and risks 1.

There are both social and cultural impacts associated with the options considered above. The SFRI initiatives address concerns of fairness and equity with the current tax administration system. Although some taxpayers are required to file (and pay any tax debts) simply because they are, for example WfF recipients, other taxpayers who are not required to file, have the ability to "cherry pick" the years they filed on the basis of whether they were to receive a tax refund or had a tax debt. Repealing the SFRI legislation will mean that the current tax administration will continue to be unfair for those taxpayers that are required to file and may negatively affect their trust and confidence in the current tax administration system. This could in tum impact on taxpayer compliance overall. 39. There are no environmental impacts associated with any of the options. Net impact of all options 40. The preferred option to repeal the SFRI legislation (option 2) addresses the problem by removing an inefficient means to reforming the tax administration for salary and wage earners in the light of the BT vision. It also achieves most of the objectives - that is, it ensures changes that are inconsistent with the BT vision are not made, and compliance and administrative costs are minimised overall. 41. Inland Revenue does not support the status quo (option 1) because it does not address the problem and is inconsistent with the current BT vision. CONSULTATION 42. Inland Revenue has not undertaken public consultation on the option to repeal the SFRI legislation. We considered there will be very little benefit in consulting with the affected groups on the preferred option of repealing the SFRI legislation on the basis that repeal will be see as taxpayer friendly, and these groups would not have adjusted their behaviour in line with the SFRI changes as these changes are not due to take affect for another three years. 43. In June 2014, Inland Revenue hosted the conference "A Tax Administration for the 21st Century''. Some tax practitioners and representatives ofPTS intermediaries who attended the conference questioned the relevance of the SFRI legislation in the light of BT vision and supported its repeal. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 44. Inland Revenue recommends that the SFRI legislation be repealed, as: • it is now no longer a sound investment given the BT programme of change; • on current plan, BT will deliver the benefits of SFRI (i.e., stop "cherry picking" and reduced return filing leading to fewer customer contacts) but will do so in a more proactive and efficient way. 11 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 93 of 94 • the intersection of SFRI and BT is likely to cause compliance costs and confusion for taxpayers given that the two initiatives are operating under significantly different policy settings; • it will help Inland Revenue to better manage its entire change portfolio and BT. 45. Given the above, we consider the repeal of the SFRI legislation to be preferable to implementing the legislation. Furthermore, repealing the SFRI legislation would reduce administrative and compliance costs overall. The status quo option would have the opposite effect. IMPLEMENTATION 46. Repeal legislation should be included in the next available taxation bill, which IS scheduled for introduction in November 2014. 4 7. Although the SFRI legislation is enacted it still has a further three years before it takes effect. Therefore, repealing the legislation as soon as possible will ensure that there is sufficient time to signal to the affected groups that the SFRI changes are not being implemented. The Minister of Revenue will issue a media statement on the proposed repeal when the tax bill containing the repeal legislation is introduced into the House. Once enacted, Inland Revenue will communicate the repeal as part of its business as usual communications relating to legislative changes. 48. Repealing the SFRI legislation will not negatively impact the affected groups. Individuals will continue to have the ability to cherry pick the years in which they have a refund and WfF recipients will file annual income tax returns but most of these recipients are either in a refund position and will file anyway, or are required to file under another tax law. Additionally, repealing the SFRI legislation should avoid taxpayer confusion that could have resulted from the intersection of SFRI and BT - two reforms operating under significantly different policy settings. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 49. There will be opportunities for interested parties and the general public to comment on the SFRI legislation and its repeal if the preferred option is adopted, both through submissions on the taxation bill containing the repeal, and as part the BT programme. This is because Ministers instructed officials to ensure that the policy outcomes that the SFRI legislation sought to address are included in the BT programme. 50. In general, Inland Revenue's monitoring, evaluating and reviewing of new legislation takes place takes under the GTPP. The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 12 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2015–16, Research and Development, and Remedial Matters) Bill Regulatory Impact Statements Page 94 of 94
Regulatory Impact Statement Bright-line test for sales of residential property Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options for the detailed design and implementation of the proposed "bright-line test". On 14 May 2015, the Government announced plans to introduce a bright-line test to help buttress the current "intention test" in the current land sale rules. The "intention test" makes gains from the sale of land taxable when bought with an intention of resale. This "intention test" is difficult to enforce due to its subjectivity. This test is particularly difficult to enforce in relation to residential property because of its high volume and churn. This analysis was informed by public feedback on proposals contained in the officials' issues paper Bright-line test for sales of residential property, which was released on 29 June 2015. Fourteen submissions were received on the issues paper. Submissions generally focused on the design of the bright-line test and raised concerns regarding the complexity of the rules and departures from existing land sale rules. Several changes have been made to the design of the bright-line test in response to submissions, and to provide greater clarity in the rules. Exact figures for the fiscal and compliance cost impacts are not available because Inland Revenue does not currently have accurate data on the types and levels of land sales occurring or how much is collected currently from the land sale rules. The data for these areas is expected to improve as new information disclosure requirements for property come into force and Inland Revenue implements a new form to better monitor taxable land sales. The options identified would not impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. The options which introduce a bright-line test will impose additional costs on businesses when they have sales subject to the bright-line test which would not otherwise have been taxable. We consider that this impact is likely to be minor, and is potentially balanced out by the reduced compliance costs for those who would otherwise have been caught by the "intention test" but the bright-line test makes this position clearer. Peter Frawley Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 7 August 2015 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The Government is concerned with high house prices, particularly in the Auckland area. Property speculation is seen as one of a number of causes of the current prices. Other possible causes, both on the supply and demand sides, are being separately considered. The attractiveness of property speculation, when compared with other forms of investment increase, if the gains are able to be realised untaxed, when gains from other investments are taxed. Residential property churn 2. There is significant churn and short term speculation in residential property, particularly in Auckland. Share of Auckland dwelling sales within 1, 2, and 3 years Sold within Share of sales Std error Confidence interval 1 Year 8.4% 0.2% 8.0%-8.7% 2 Years 17.4% 0.3% 6.9%-17.9% 3 Years 26.1% 0.3% 25.5%-26.7% Source: MBIE analysis of Corelogic data 3. In addition to this, there is evidence of particularly fast churn for new titles and developments in Auckland. The evidence suggests, from 2009-2013 59% of all new titles were disposed of within a year and 29% of new developments in North Auckland were traded within 3 months. Income tax compliance 4. The Income Tax Act 2007 contains provisions that impose income tax on certain property transactions. The key provision that imposes income tax on property transactions is section CB 6, which taxes land bought with an intention or purpose of disposal. 5. This “intention test” is difficult to enforce as it relies on a judgement about a taxpayer’s subjective intention. In addition the high volume of transactions in residential property creates addit ional difficulties in enforcing the “intention test”. Investigators in Inland Revenue report this means that the scale of transactions has to be close to that of a business before they can be certain that the land sale rules apply. 6. As a result, investigations by Inland Revenue suggest that many people whose gains from the sale of land are taxable are not returning this income. The Government is concerned about this non-compliance. Bright-line test 7. To address these concerns, the Government, as part of Budget 2015, announced a series of measures aimed at providing clearer tax rules for property transactions and providing more useful information to Inland Revenue to assist in its enforcement of those rules. There was also increased funding to Inland Revenue to investigate people who may not be correctly returning income from taxable property sales. The main change is the introduction of a “bright-line” test that will, in general terms, make the disposal of residential property taxable if the property is bought and sold within a two-year window (subject to certain exceptions). 2 8. The bright-line test was seen as a way to deal with the issue of property speculation in the short-term and to help buttress the “intention test”. 9. In order to provide more useful information to Inland Revenue to enforce the tax laws, two further changes were announced: a) Vendors and purchasers will generally be required to provide their IRD numbers (and, if they are tax residents of another jurisdiction, also provide their foreign tax identification number) at the time of transfer. b) The second proposal is that an offshore person will be required to provide evidence of a New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to obtaining an IRD number. 10. These changes were canvassed in the regulatory impact statements Sellers and purchasers of real property required to supply their IRD numbers and tax information numbers, and Requiring non-resident IRD number applicant to have a New Zealand bank account. 11. This RIS deals wit h the main change: the bright-line test. Specifically it deals with the question of how best to design and implement a bright-line test in order to ensure that it meets the stated objectives. 12. The Government directed the Treasury and Inland Revenue to explore options of how best to design and implement a bright-line test. This led to the release of the Officials’ Issues Paper Bright-line test for sales of residential property. The issues paper proposed a two-year bright-line test with the following key design features: • The two-year period for the bright-line test runs from the date a person has title for the property transferred to them and ends at the time the person enters in a contract to sell the property. An additional rule applies for sales “off the plan”. • The bright-line test will apply only to residential land. Residential land includes land where there is an arrangement to build a dwelling on it. Resident ial land does not include business premises or farmland. • The bright-line test will generally not apply to a person’s main home. A person can only have one main home. The main home exception applies to properties held in trust. There are rules preventing trusts being used to obtain the exception for multiple properties. • The bright-line test will not apply to property acquired through an inheritance and rollover relief is available for property transferred under a relationship property agreement. • Losses arising from the bright-line test will be ring-fenced so they may only be used to offset taxable gains from other land sales. • A specific anti-avoidance rule applies to counter companies and trusts being used to circumvent the bright-line test. 3 OBJECTIVES 13. The objectives are: a) Provide an easier rule for Inland Revenue to enforce to target short-term speculation in residential property. b) Minimise the number of sales made taxable that were acquired without an intention of resale. c) Minimise compliance costs for taxpayers in complying with the bright-line test. 14. The first objective is to provide an easier to enforce rule to supplement the current “intention test”. This is particularly targeted towards the problems of enforcement in relation to short-term property speculation. 15. As the primary goal is to supplement the existing “intention test”, the second objective is to minimise the degree to which any rule captures the gains from sales not bought with an intention of resale. 16. The third objective is to minimise compliance costs for taxpayers. This will involve minimising the complexity of the rules, making them easy to understand as well as aligning the rules with the existing land sale rules where possible. 17. These three objectives may conflict. An easy to enforce rule may make the gains from some sales taxable when the property was not bought with an intention of resale. In addition, rules that are easier for Inland Revenue to enforce can increase compliance costs for taxpayers in some circumstances. The analysis will need to balance these objectives. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 18. Two options for designing a bright-line test are considered below. • Option 1: Two year bright-line test • Option 2: Three to five year bright-line test 19. We note that as the Government announced that it will introduce a bright-line test we did not consider the status quo to be a viable option. Option 1 (officials’ preferred option) 20. This option would create a rule that requires income tax to be paid on the gains from the sale of residential property bought and sold within two years. The intention test would still make gains from the sale of land taxable if bought with an intention of resale. 21. This would supplement the intention test with an unambiguous objective test. As a result, it would make the land sale rules easier to enforce. 22. The objective nature of the rule means that it would capture people with no intention of resale but are forced to sell due to circumstances outside of their control. However, we consider this risk is low, as generally when property is bought and sold within two years it is likely to have been purchased with an intention of resale. 4 23. This rule is expected to raise an additional $5 million per annum in addition to any income expected from property compliance audit activity. 24. This option creates an economic distortion as it creates a “lock-in” effect. In other words, it creates an incentive for people to hold property for longer than two years to avoid the bright-line test. For example, a person may avoid selling a property at the highest price, within two years to avoid the bright-line test. The person who is offering the highest price can presumably put the property to its most valuable use. This means that people may not undergo otherwise efficient transactions and put property to its most valuable use due to the bright-line test. 25. On balance we consider that a two-year bright-line period best balances the competing objectives of having an easy to enforce rule to deal with the short-term speculation in residential property while ensuring that it does not capture many sales that were acquired without an intention of resale. 26. This is Inland Revenue’s preferred option. 27. There are a number of detailed design issues with this option. These design issues have large impact on the degree to which this option meets the objectives. 28. These detailed design issues are considered in the section “further analysis of options 1 and 2”. Option 2 29. This option would create a bright-line similar to option 1, however with the period of the bright-line being longer at potentially three or five years rather than two years. 30. This option has similar impacts as option 1 but with greater effect owing to its longer period. It would best meet the objective of creating an easy to enforce rule and would have the greatest positive fiscal and administrative impact. 31. However, this option has the greatest risk of capturing sales that were acquired without an intention of resale. 32. As a result, this is not Inland Revenue’s preferred option. 33. There are a number of detailed design issues with this option, these are considered in the section “further analysis of options 1 and 2”. Summary of analysis of options 34. The table below summarises the impact analysis of the options. 5 Option Meets objective? Impacts Net impact Fiscal Economic Administrative Compliance Fairness 1 – Two year bright-line Meets objective (a) Largely meets objective (b) Partially meets objective (c) The 2 year bright- line is expected to raise an additional $5 million per annum, which is based on a number of behavioural assumptions, which are inherently difficult to quantify, such as the number of sales that would be delayed in order to exceed the two- year holding period. The actual revenue collected under this option may be significantly more if the behavioural responses are different to those assumed. This option would create a “lock-in” effect as people have an incentive to hold property for longer than 2 years. This would result in an economic distortion as people may not undergo otherwise efficient transactions due to the bright-line test. This option creates an easier to enforce rule which will decrease administration costs for Inland Revenue. Compliance costs will decrease for people currently taxed under existing rules as this option reduces ambiguity. Compliance costs will increase for other people caught by the bright-line as they have new tax obligations. The bright-line test will make enforcement easier and help ensure people pay their fair share of tax. May be seen as unfair as persons who sell within two years are treated differently from those who are able to delay their sale beyond two years. Ensures the key difficulty of enforcement where there is a high churn of properties is targeted while not capturing significant numbers of persons who had no intention of resale. 2 – Three or five year bright-line Best meets objective (a) Least meets objective (b) Partially meets objective (c) No estimate of revenue gain has been made, but we expect it would be greater than the $5 million estimated for option 1. This option would have similar lock-in effects to option 1. This option would have the greatest impact in reducing the administration costs involved in applying the “intention test” for Inland Revenue. Compliance costs would likely be greater than for option 1. This is because additional sales will be caught by the rules which are less likely to be taxable under the current rules. This option has similar fairness impacts as option 1. Provides easiest to enforce measure of the options. However, it is likely to capture significant numbers of persons who had no intention of resale. 6 Further analysis on options 1 and 2 – detailed design of bright-line test 35. There are a number of design issues for the bright-line test which require separate impact analysis. The analysis is summarised in the tables below. 36. The design of the bright-line test is intended to support the objectives. The design is based on having clear objective rules and as a result there are few exceptions and where there are exceptions they are tightly defined. This helps to ensure that the bright-line test is clear and unambiguous. Start and end dates for bright-line 37. Determining the start and end dates for the bright-line involves a trade-off between providing rules that are easy for Inland Revenue to enforce and avoiding complexity through creating rules inconsistent with the existing land sale rules. Residential land 38. The bright-line test could apply either to all land or just to resident ial land. The key trade-off between these two options is between targeting the bright-line test to the main issue of high churn of residential property and creating a difficult boundary. Issue Options Advantages Disadvantages Recommendations Start date Date agreement for sale and purchase entered into Little scope for manipulation. Consistent with existing land sale rules and therefore easier to comply with Creates uncertainty at point of sale as this date may not be known to seller or IR at point of sale Not recommended Difficult for Inland Revenue to enforce Date of registration of title Clear date recorded on Landonline Is the last stage in purchase process so could be perceived as unfairly shortening bright- line Recommended Clear and easy to apply rule End date Date agreement for sale and purchase entered into Until this date, seller does not have legal rights against the purchaser. As a result there is less scope for manipulation Less clear than registration as not recorded on Landonline Recommended Date of registration of title Clear date recorded on Landonline Scope for manipulation – it is possible to artificially defer this date. Not recommended Too easy to manipulate 7 Main home exclusion 39. One key design issue is whether the bright-line test should apply to a person’s main ho me. Inherited and relationship property 40. The current land sale rules provide special treatment for inherited property and relationship property. The analysis below considers whether special treatment should apply under the bright-line test for these transactions. Options Advantages Disadvantages Recommendations Apply bright- line to all land Removes difficult boundary questions in defining residential land Is not as well targeted towards main issue of high churn of residential property. The lock-in effect is greater as it affects businesses decisions whether to replace their commercial property with more productive premises. Not recommended Apply bright- line to just residential land Focuses towards main issue of high churn of residential property No lock-in effect for commercial property where lock-in effect is most distortionary Creates difficult boundary- drawing questions for defining residential land Recommended Targeted towards main objective and minimises lock- in effect Options Advantages Disadvantages Recommendations Don’t exempt main home Greater revenue gains. Less exceptions from bright-line creates a clearer more objective test. Taxing gains on the main home is likely to have little public acceptability. Not recommended Exempt main home Greater public acceptability. Property is less likely to have been bought with an intention of resale if it is the seller’s main home. Less revenue gains, and bright-line becomes more subjective Recommended Consistent with existing land- sale rules 8 Inherited property Relationship property Options Advantages Disadvantages Recommendations No relief Fewer exceptions from bright-line test mean rules are simpler to apply and enforce. Bright-line would apply in circumstance where person acquired property due to an inheritance and never intended to acquire the property. Not recommended Limited rollover relief Would align the relief with current land sale rules. Provides partial relief for persons who did not intend to acquire the property. Only partial relief is available for close relatives, relationship partners, or charities. This means persons would be captured by the bright-line test in some circumstances even though they never intended to acquire the property. Not recommended Limited rollover relief with subsequent exemption Means bright-line will not apply to close relatives of the deceased where they did not intend to acquire the property and only acquired due to inheritance. Relief is only available if the person is a close relative, relationship party or charity. Other persons would be captured even though they never intended to acquire the property. Not recommended Full rollover relief with subsequent exemption Bright-line would not apply in any circumstance where person acquired property due to an inheritance and never intended to acquire the property. More exceptions mean rules are more complex, and difficult to enforce. Recommended This option is more consistent with objective (b). Although more exceptions make the rules more complex, we consider it is justified in circumstances where the person not only had no intention of resale, but had no intention to even acquire the property. Options Advantages Disadvantages Recommendations No relief Fewer exceptions from bright-line mean rules are simpler to apply and enforce. Bright-line test could apply in circumstances where persons did not have an intention of resale and only acquired it due to a relationship break down. Not recommended Limited rollover relief Aligned with current land sale rules Provides partial relief for persons who did not have an intention of resale Bright-line test will apply in some circumstances where relationship partner only acquired property due to relationship breakdown and did not have an intention of resale. Recommended The relief for relationship property is narrower than that for inheritance. However for a relationship property settlement the parties have more choice 9 Losses 41. The bright-line test creates a particular revenue risk. People can ensure that their losses are realised while any gains are. The analysis below considers the most appropriate treatment of losses under the bright-line test to address this risk. Land-rich companies and trusts 42. The current land sale rules can be avoided through holding property in a company or trust and transferring control of the company or trust rather than selling the land itself. The analysis below considers how best to address people avoiding the bright-line test through the use of land-rich companies and trusts. about whether they receive the property. In addition the property was likely to have been obtained during the relationship so they will likely have intended to acquire the property Full rollover relief with subsequent exemption Bright-line test would not apply in circumstance where person only acquired property due to a relationship breakdown and did not have an intention of resale More exceptions mean rules are more complex, and difficult to enforce. Not recommended Options Advantages Disadvantages Recommendations Fully allow losses No economic distortions Significant revenue risk as people will accelerate unrealised losses and defer unrealised gains Not recommended Revenue risk significant Ring-fence losses arising solely under the bright- line test Reduces revenue risk Note that losses from property sales that are also taxable under the current land sale rules (ie, that are not solely taxable under the bright-line test) will not be ring-fenced, thereby mitigating any distortions. Creates an economic distortion where people without offsetable gains will under-value risky investments Recommended Revenue risk mitigated Revenue account declaration Reduces revenue risk Creates potentially unfair asymmetry – taxpayers have to declare intention of resale for loss, but gains are taxed regardless of declaration Would complicate the tax system Not recommended Revenue risk is better addressed with ring-fencing as this creates less asymmetry and potential unfairness 10 Other impacts 43. There are no social, cultural, or environmental impacts associated with the broad options and the specific design options. CONSULTATION 44. Treasury and Inland Revenue released an officials’ issues paper titled Bright-line test for sales of residential property on 29 June 2015. A total o f 14 submissions were received. 45. Three submissions supported the bright-line test and three did not support it. Submissions in favour of the bright-line test submitted that the bright-line test appeared to be a reasonable addition to the current intention test to ensure that property investors declare the income they are required to. Submitters who did not support the bright-line test to be unprincipled and likely to only apply to persons who are forced to sell property due to circumstances outside of their control. 46. One submitter proposed reducing the bright-line period to one year, and one submitter proposed extending the period to 4 to 5 years. 47. The majority of submissions focused on the design of the bright-line test. There were five main areas of concern raised by submitters. These were: • The start date of the bright-line period • The scope of the main home exception • Loss ring-fencing • The proposed land-rich co mpany rule • Submitters also proposed new exceptions to the bright-line 48. The majorit y o f concerns regarding these issues was that the proposed design is not fully aligned with the current land sale rules. Submitters were concerned that the areas of departure would create greater complexity and they were typically not taxpayer friendly. 49. While officials accept that departure from existing land sale rules can cause complexity we consider that where the design of the bright-line test is not aligned with current land sale Options Advantages Disadvantages Recommendations Comprehensi- ve rule Rules would be accurate and robust Increased complexity and compliance costs Not recommended Complexity does not appear to be justified as at present it does not appear there are large numbers of people avoiding the land sale rules through the use of companies or trusts. Anti- avoidance rule Less complexity and compliance costs Less robust and creates uncertainty Recommended Targeted towards main issue without being overly complex 11 rules it is generally to ensure the bright-line test achieves its goal of being an objective, easy to enforce rule. 50. We have made several changes to the technical detail of the proposal in response to submissions and to address complexity concerns raised by submitters. These include: • Clarifying the time when a person’s ‘main home’ is determined • Clarifying the end date of the bright-line where there is no contract to sell the property • Limiting the definition of arrangement for residential land so that it only includes arrangements which the seller is a party to • Clarifying that bare land capable of being used for residential purposes is residential land • Creating a new ‘bright-line’ rule for habitual sellers • Enabling more trusts to use the main home exception by loosening the proposed restrictions on trusts using the main home exception • Defining what is a land-rich company and trust • Setting out what amount of change of ownership is required to trigger the proposed anti-avo idance rule CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 51. Inland Revenue supports option 1. We consider that option 1 provides the best targeted option and provides easier enforcement of the land sale rules against the key problem of short term speculation in residential property. Option 1 achieves this while not covering many sales that were not bought with an intention of resale. 52. The design of the bright-line test is intended to support the objectives. The design of the bright-line is based on having clear objective rules and only a few tightly defined exceptions. This helps ensure that the bright-line is clear and unambiguous. IMPLEMENTATION 53. Legislative change to the Income Tax Act 2007 would be required to implement either option 1 or 2. 54. Any legislative amendments required to implement option 1 or 2 could be included in a bill introduced prior to the application date of 1 October 2015. 55. Inland Revenue will be required to update forms and co mmunication material. Inland Revenue is developing a new attachment to income tax returns to assist in implementing and reporting on the land sale rules. 56. Inland Revenue will administer the bright-line test. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 57. Inland Revenue is putting in place new systems for administering the bright-line test including a new form to monitor property sales subject to the bright-line test. In addit ion, as noted above, as part of Budget 2015 further measures are being introduced to provide more useful information to Inland Revenue about land sales. These measures will enable Inland 12 Revenue to have better information about the level of compliance with the land sale rules and the revenue generated by the bright-line test. 58. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to these changes, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process. This regulatory impact statement incorporates minor typographical changes made after it was submitted to Cabinet. This includes: • Adding page numbers • Correcting option number cross-references. 13
Regulatory Impact Statement Information sharing between Inland Revenue and the Accident Compensation Corporation Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options that would enable Inland Revenue to share addit ional informat ion wit h the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). The informat ion is required to enable ACC to fulfil its legislative obligations in relation to the ACC Scheme. Inland Revenue has legal authority to share specific information with ACC. This has been a long standing authorised process under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Inland Revenue has identified that some of the sharing of information with ACC which is taking place under the provisions of a Memorandum of Understanding currently falls outside the remit of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This information is necessary to enable the calculation of levies, provision of invoices to for payment, the determination of the level of entitlements/compensation that an injured individual is entitled to receive. In sharing information in this way, there is a trade-off between the privacy rights of individuals and the need for government agencies to provide efficient, high quality services. However, the recommended design of the approach would provide considerable efficiencies for the government, whilst having a minimal effect on an individual’s right to privacy. This is because ACC would only receive information that it is lawfully entitled to collect in its own right and Inland Revenue would not collect additional information on behalf of ACC. For the customer this would mean only providing their details to government once. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has been consulted and is supportive of the proposal. It does not see any significant privacy risk with the current sharing, given the information is provided to ACC for a legitimate purpose. We have not identified any other significant gaps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints, caveats or uncertainties. The preferred option in this statement does not impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest or override fundamental common law principles. The preferred option in this statement has an administrative impact that will be neutral as it will be undertaken on an agreed fee for service basis. Keit h Taylor Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 27 October 2015 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (the TAA) creates an obligation of secrecy for officers of Inland Revenue. This obligation is necessary to protect the integrity of the tax system, which includes taxpayer perceptions of that integrity, and the responsibilities of those administering the law to maintain the confidentiality of affairs of taxpayers. 2. However, under section 81(4) of the TAA, there is a list of circumstances in which this obligation has been removed. One such instance refers to the ability of Inland Revenue to legally provide certain information to ACC to enable it to carry out its legislative functions. The scope of the information able to be provided is set out in sections 82 and 85E of the TAA. The operational transfer of this information, safeguards and governance are set out in a Memorandum of Understanding (the Memorandum) between the two parties. 3. The secrecy obligation and the exception highlight the policy trade-off between ensuring the confidentiality of taxpayer information with the desire for efficient administration of the tax system and government services. 4. Inland Revenue has identified that some of the sharing of information which has taken place in accordance with the Memorandum that is not permissible under the TAA. The additional identified information, and the permissible information, is required by ACC to calculate employer levies and produce invoices to employers for payment. The information is also used to determine the level of compensation that an injured individual is entitled to receive. 5. The sharing of the additional information is a breach of the secrecy provisions by Inland Revenue. It is also a possible breach of privacy under the Privacy Act 1993. 6. Inland Revenue subsequently held discussions with ACC to determine the key information required by ACC to fulfil its functions and obligations under its legislation. There would be a significant customer impact if the current arrangement was discontinued. For example, the calculation of employer levies would not be able to be done and invoices would not be able to be issued for many employers. For customers who receive compensat ion, the level of entitlement/compensation would not be able to be accurately determined. 7. Inland Revenue and ACC held discussions with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner concerning the possible breach of privacy. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner does not see any significant privacy risk with the current sharing given the information is provided to ACC for a legitimate purpose. 8. If Inland Revenue and ACC were to continue to share this information without legislative change or other legal authorisation there is a risk of breaching the Privacy Act 1993 and the secrecy provisions of the TAA. 9. Inland Revenue has determined that the information is reasonable and necessary for ACC to receive in order to administer the ACC Scheme. Given this, Inland Revenue has continued to share the required information with ACC. 2 10. ACC is authorised to collect the information to be shared in its own right. 1 However, ACC cannot always rely on customers to communicate their current circumstances or any change in those circumstances, for example, a change in business status or earnings. This situation can lead to inaccurate calculation of levies and compensation payments which can lead to insufficient payment of levies or overpayments for compensation, fraud and even prosecution action. Sharing this information will enable timely, efficient and accurate calculation of levies and compensation to be made. 11. Section 81BA of the TAA provides a framework for Inland Revenue to share the information it holds with other Government agencies. Any sharing of information under these provisions requires legislative approval through an Order in Council. 12. This regulatory impact statement addresses the problem of how Inland Revenue may share addit ional information wit h ACC in order for ACC to fulfil its legislative obligations. 13. The new information to be shared, in addition to that currently permitted, will be limited to: Information for the purposes of assessing levies • If an income tax return has been filed; • Name of employer who paid schedular payments; • Customer identifiers – that is, name, address, date of birth, IRD number, New Zealand Business Number; • Customer contact details – that is, phone number and email address; • The date a customer’s address was updated; • If a partner in a partnership; • Income as a beneficiary of a trust; and • Start date of salary or wage employment. Information for eligibility of earnings related compensation • Customer identifiers – that is, name, address, date of birth, IRD number, New Zealand Business Number; • Customer contact details – that is, phone number and email address; • Balance date; • If an income tax return has been filed; • If a partner in a partnership; • The partners of a partnership; • Income as a beneficiary of a trust; • Trustees of a trust; • Start date of being a private domestic worker; • Cease date of being an employer; and • Cease date of being a private domestic worker. Benefits of the information sharing 1 Section 246 of the Accident Compensation Act 2001. 3 14. Sharing information between Inland Revenue and ACC will improve the accuracy and timeliness of the calculation of employer levies and compensation payments. 15. Inland Revenue and ACC have already started developing this memorandum for the sharing of information that ACC is legally able to collect as stated above in paragraph 10. The agencies have also detailed how they will follow established process to determine the mechanisms to transfer, store and dispose of data. In addition, the memorandum of understanding will include processes to ensure data integrity and manage the reversal of incorrect data. It will also include provisions for monitoring the success of the information sharing, as well as provisions on controls and the use of the data by third parties. Prior to completing the memorandum the two agencies will undertake more detailed work determining privacy risks. OBJECTIVES 16. The objectives of this review are to: • implement an information sharing mechanism between Inland Revenue and ACC to enable Inland Revenue to legally share addit ional information under the TAA; • enable ACC to carry out its legislative functions which include the calculation of employer levies, provision of invoices for employers for payment, the determination of the level of entitlement or compensation that an injured individual is entitled to receive; and • provide safeguards to the privacy rights of individuals. 17. One of the aims of the Government’s Better Public Services reforms is to ensure the public sector undertakes a more collaborative, cross agency approach to supporting citizens and gaining efficiencies. Making better use of information and information sharing between Government agencies is one method of gaining greater efficiency and improving outcomes for the public. For the customer this would mean only providing their details to government once. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 18. While Inland Revenue has identified five possible options to meet the objectives these have not as yet been costed: • Option 1: The status quo is maintained in the interim until an Order in Council under the information sharing framework in section 81BA of the TAA is made. • Option 2: The status quo is maintained indefinitely. • Option 3: The informat ion sharing ceases. • Option 4: The information is collected by ACC. • Option 5: An information matching under the Privacy Act 1993. 4 Option 1: The status quo is maintained in the interim until an Order in Council under the information sharing framework in section 81BA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is made 19. Under Option 1, an Order in Council under section 81BA of the TAA would be made to enable Inland Revenue to legally share addit ional informat ion wit h ACC. 20. In the interim period before the Order in Council the objectives are not met. However, once the Order in Council is in place all objectives will be met. 21. Inland Revenue considers that it is acceptable to maintain the status quo in the interim period to ensure the integrity of the ACC Scheme and the provision of efficient government services. In addition, as noted earlier, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner does not see any significant privacy risk with the current sharing given the information is provided to ACC for a legitimate purpose. Option 2: The status quo is maintained indefinitely 22. If Inland Revenue and ACC were to continue to share information without legislative change or other legal authorisation, there is a risk of breaching the Privacy Act 1993 and the secrecy provisions of the TAA. 23. Inland Revenue’s view is that it would not be acceptable to maintain the status quo indefinitely because this would mean a perpetual breach of secrecy. As a result option 2 is not recommended. Option 3: The information sharing ceases 24. The information is required by ACC to calculate employer levies and produce invoices to employers for payment. The information is also used to determine the level of compensation that an injured individual is entitled to receive. There would be a significant customer impact if the current arrangement was discontinued. For example, the calculation of employer levies would not be able to be done and invoices would not be able to be issued for the majority of employers. For customers who receive compensation, the level of ent it lement/compensation would not be able to be accurately determined. 25. As a result option 3 is not recommended. Option 4: The information is collected by ACC 26. The information required is currently held by Inland Revenue. Should ACC seek this informat ion direct ly fro m its customers it would require them to tell government the same information on numerous occasions. This is administratively inefficient and not in line wit h Better Public Services. 27. As a result option 4 is not recommended. 5 Option 5: An information matching under the Privacy Act 1993 28. Inland Revenue could provide data to ACC through information matching under the Privacy Act 1993. However, this would not capture the additional required information as the information needed by ACC is not limited to specific data points. 29. As a result option 5 is not recommended. Summary of impacts of options Option 1 Option 2 Option 3 Option 4 Option 5 Fiscal implications for the Government None. None. Possible loss of revenue and loss of productivity given an inoperative and non- funded scheme. Loss of revenue and loss of productivity given an inoperative and non-funded scheme.

Inland Revenue has consulted with the ACC and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on this machinery of government amendment. 31. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner is supportive of our proposal. It does not see any significant privacy risk with the current sharing given the information is provided to ACC for a legitimate purpose. 32. ACC have been consulted on this proposal and are supportive given it will enable them to fulfil their legislative obligations and their administrative responsibilities for the scheme. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 33. Officials recommend making an Order in Council to support information sharing under Option 1. We consider that this option would enable ACC to fulfil its legislative obligations in the administration of the ACC Scheme. IMPLEMENTATION 34. The preferred option (Option 1) does not require Inland Revenue to alter its current information collection practices. As noted earlier in paragraph 15, Inland Revenue would not collect addit ional information on behalf of ACC. Inland Revenue would establish processes to monitor and audit the use of its data by ACC, and ensure that Inland Revenue’s tax secrecy obligations are maintained. 35. Also, as noted in paragraph 10, under the proposed arrangement ACC would only receive information that it is lawfully ent it led to collect in its own right. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 36. The Order in Council is subject to the review provision in the Tax Administration Act. The proposed review would be carried out after the new framework has been in operation for five years, and would be tabled in the House of Representatives by the Minister of Revenue, after consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. Such a review would allow for consideration of whether the objectives of the new framework have been achieved. Since the review would be made public, it should be transparent as to how the new framework is being applied. 7
Regulatory Impact Statement Repeal of KiwiSaver kick-start payment Agency Disclosure Statement 1. This regulatory impact statement has been prepared by the Treasury in consultation with Inland Revenue. 2. It was prepared following a request from the Minister of Finance to provide advice on options to reduce the fiscal cost and improve the target effectiveness of the KiwSaver scheme and in particular explore the removal of the $1,000 kick-start payment paid to all new enrolees in the scheme. The advice was requested in advance of Budget 2015 and therefore has been prepared urgently. 3. The analysis in this statement has been prepared following the completion of the Inland Revenue-led KiwiSaver Evaluation and relies on its findings. 4. The analysis has not focussed on the effect of policy options on national saving as was the case with the KiwiSaver policy changes announced with Budget 2011. Instead, the analysis is concerned with addressing the poor value for money and target effectiveness (leakage) of KiwiSaver subsidies. 5. There has been only limited consultation because of Budget sensitivity and a likely behavioural response. The KiwiSaver Evaluation is the best available evidence (including evidence from focus groups and empirical study) of the efficiency and effectiveness of the scheme and it is unlikely that public consultation would provide further insights. Manager, Financial Markets The Treasury 6 May 2015 Regulatory Impact Statement: Repeal of KiwiSaver kick-start payment - 6 May 2015 1 Executive summary 6. The recent Inland Revenue Evaluation finds that KiwiSaver is a very costly voluntary savings scheme which has not substantially increased savings despite encouraging enrolment of a large number of individuals. This regulatory impact statement analyses the options for changes to KiwiSaver policy settings, the forecast fiscal savings and likely behavioural responses. 7. The options to reduce fiscal cost (and therefore increase the value for money of the scheme) involve reducing or removing the subsidies: the $1,000 kick-start payment and/or the annual member tax credits. Options to address target effectiveness of the scheme - increasing the extent to which KiwiSaver encourages additional saving among those who would otherwise face a diminution of living standards in retirement - are more difficult. 8. This regulatory impact statement addresses these options and concludes that the choice to change KiwiSaver subsidies depends on Ministers relative prioritisation of competing fiscal demands and encouraging saving in the scheme. Status quo and problem definition 9. The KiwiSaver scheme currently costs around $800 million in subsidies per annum and the Government has spent in excess of $6 billion on it since inception in 2006. There are currently two subsidies: a one-off $1,000 kick-start payment paid to all new enrolees in the scheme (the kick-start) and an annual member tax credit paid to members of up to a maximum of $521 (annual MTC). The scheme also has ongoing Inland Revenue administration costs. 10. A seven year evaluation of KiwiSaver concluded in 2014 (the Evaluation) and the Evaluation reports will be published soon (we expect in line with Budget 2015). The Evaluation has broadly found that the scheme has been successful in attracting significant numbers of members and Inland Revenue’s role in the scheme has functioned well. However, the scheme has delivered very poor value for the Crown’s subsidies. A high degree of leakage to people outside the target group for KiwiSaver and substitution from other savings has occurred. Estimates range from zero to one- third of KiwiSaver balances representing new household savings. It should be noted that the maximum annual MTC has already been halved from its original level together with other changes to KiwiSaver with Budget 2011 and this improved the value for money of the scheme. Figure 1 below illustrates the changes in contributions to KiwiSaver accounts.

The Minister of Finance requested that the Treasury provide some options for changes to KiwiSaver to reduce headline costs to the Crown and to reduce the degree of leakage. Objectives 12. The objectives for any changes to KiwiSaver policy settings are to: a. Improve the value for money of the KiwiSaver scheme and reduce the headline costs to help achieve the Government’s fiscal objectives; and b. Improve the target effectiveness of the KiwiSaver scheme (i.e. reduce the leakage to non-target individuals) without discouraging increased levels of private household savings and a long-term savings habit among the target population of the KiwiSaver Act. 13. The KiwiSaver Evaluation highlighted the success of the administrative simplicity of the scheme. It broadly concluded that the Inland Revenue’s role as a clearing house for contributions and the administrative design and interplay between members, employers, Inland Revenue and providers had been a major contributing factor to the large degree of uptake. Likewise, the automatic enrolment features of the scheme have been effective at ensuring high rates of enrolment among salary and wage earners. Therefore, an objective is to retain the principal administrative features of KiwiSaver. Regulatory Impact Statement: Repeal of KiwiSaver kick-start payment - 16 March 2015 3 14. There is a timing constraint as the Minister of Finance aims to achieve these objectives with the passing of Budget 2015. Background Policy Considerations D ifficulties in d efining the target population fo r Kiw iSaver fo r “ value fo r m oney” 15. The value for money of KiwiSaver policy is a measure of how much it costs the Government to prompt an additional dollar of savings from the target population. Value for money is related to the degree of leakage from payment of the Crown subsidies to individuals outside of the target population. 16. Assessing value for money is difficult due to the imprecision inherent in the wording of the purpose in section 3 of the KiwiSaver Act. That purpose refers to boosting savings among “individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement’. 17. The target population of KiwiSaver is thus a sub-set of individuals aged 18-64; children and those who have reached the eligibility age for New Zealand Superannuation (65) are outside. However, it is not possible to identify this sub-set by reference to income bands or employment status (or other measures commonly used to define eligibility for Government support). In order to overcome this problem, the value for money analysis in the Evaluation is based on the self-reporting by respondents to surveys conducted by Colmar Brunton in 2010 and 2014 and is also based on the methodology in a Treasury Working Paper by Law, Meehan, Scobie (2011). D ifficu ltie s in addressing leakage 18. In order to assess whether KiwiSaver had successfully helped the target group, two conditions had to be satisfied (which were the best proxies available for the stated purpose of section 3 of the KiwiSaver Act). 19. First, the individual in question had to have reported an expected retirement income shortfall, measured as the difference between the annual income they said they expected to have in retirement (the median was $35,000) and that which they said they would need to meet their basic needs (the median was $33,000). Only 20% of KiwiSaver members had an expected retirement income shortfall. The proportion of non KiwiSaver members who reported an expected retirement income shortfall was similarly low, at 24%. 20. Law, Meehan and Scobie (2011) undertook regression analysis to try and identify factors associated with the levels of individuals’ expected retirement income shortfalls (or excesses). The key result was that only two factors were associated with a reduced likelihood of reporting an expected retirement income shortfall. These were having higher income, or being a non salary / wage earner (i.e. being self employed, unemployed or not in the labour force). In both cases, however, the relationship is w e a k. These two factors are far from being perfect predictors of whether or not a KiwiSaver member belongs to the target group. 21. The second necessary condition was that upon joining KiwiSaver that individual had to substantially increase their savings as a result. In particular more than 30% of an individual’s contributions to KiwiSaver had to represent additional savings. Only a third of individuals who reported a retirement income shortfall met this additional condition. Regulatory Impact Statement: Repeal of KiwiSaver kick-start payment - 6 May 2015 4 22. Only 7% of KiwiSaver members met these two conditions and therefore belonged to the programme’s target group.1 93% of KiwiSaver members did not meet one or both conditions so are described as contributing to leakage from the scheme. 23. The figure for leakage of 43% which Inland Revenue have used in their Value for Money report in the Evaluation (but sourced from Law, Meehan and Scobie (2011)) relaxes the first of these two conditions. In particular, rather than calculating expected retirement income shortfalls based on the annual income individuals said they would need to m e e t t h e ir b a s ic n e e d s, the calculation uses the higher level of income individuals said they would need to be c o m fo r ta b le (the median was $45,000). 24. Regardless of definition much of the following logic applies: For a policy change to improve leakage, at least one of three things would be required. a. First, more people could be somehow caused to have an expected retirement income shortfall. However, this is obviously not desirable. b. Second, the extent to which KiwiSaver generates additional saving would need to increase. It is not at all clear how this could be achieved and indeed recent evidence (Law and Scobie (2014)) suggests KiwiSaver may not be delivering any additional savings amongst members on average. c. This leaves reducing membership of KiwiSaver amongst individuals who do not report an expected retirement income shortfall (80% of members). To achieve this would require being able to easily identify these people. However, this would be extremely difficult given the aforementioned inability to define the target population for KiwiSaver using conventional socio-economic metrics or identifiers (such as income). Targeting m easures to im prove leakage is d iffic u lt 25. Even if KiwiSaver membership were restricted to those on relatively low incomes or only salary and wage earners, w e w o u ld n o t e x p e c t to s e e a s u b s ta n tia l im p ro v e m e n t in le a kag e . Furthermore, such changes would add to the complexity of the scheme, which would undermine the success of the administration of KiwiSaver as identified in the Evaluation. Therefore implementing targeting measures which improve leakage is difficult. Available Options 26. We therefore look below at measures to improve the value for money of the scheme by reducing its costs. 27. The options available to improve value for money include to: a. Remove the kick-start or reduce its scope or generosity; and/or b. Remove the annual MTCs or reduce the scope or generosity. 1 It is likely that a similarly low proportion of people who were not members of KiwiSaver at the time of the study would be part of the programme’s target group as defined. Regulatory Impact Statement: Repeal of KiwiSaver kick-start payment - 16 March 2015 5 28. A more fundamental review of the purpose in section 3 of the KiwiSaver Act to address the aforementioned problems arising from the imprecise definition of a target population would be officials’ preferred option. However, this option is not within the scope of the present exercise which was to identify measures to improve KiwiSaver effectiveness in light of the Evaluation and reduce fiscal cost. 29. The option analysis in the following uses forecasts of KiwiSaver enrolments (and the associated fiscal cost of subsidies) provided by Inland Revenue. The fiscal savings from the available options are shown in illustrative examples in table 1 below: Table 1 - Annual estimated fiscal savings from illustrative changes to KiwiSaver kick-start and Mem ber Tax Credit ($m) - based on IRD prelim inary BEFU data Option 1 1 2014/152015/162016/172017/182018/19 KickS tart 1 1 1 Removed Removed for 1 1 1 1 17\*175 126 106 107 under 18s 1 1 2 \*28131312 Member Tax Credit 1 1 1 1 Removed 1 1 - 709756795 832 Halved\*\* 1 \_\_ - 339 362 381 399 \* Assuming a Budget next-day effective date \*\*Assuming half of the non-salary-and-wage-earners left KiwiSaver or took contribution holidays after the policy change and the same proportion of dollar amount saved in 2014/15 applies to pre-reduction forecasts in subsequent years. Remove o r reduce the g enerosity o f the kick-start 30. A removal of the kick start would save fiscal costs which, under present policy settings and given present trends in KiwiSaver membership, are expected to be $175m in 2015/2016 falling to $107m by 2018/19. By reducing the headline cost of the scheme, the value for money of the policy would be improved (as set out below). 31. The removal of the kick-start would reduce the attractiveness and enrolment rate into KiwiSaver by the self-employed. Regression analysis in Law, Scobie and Meehan (2011) also found that the self-employed are less likely to fall within the target population of the KiwiSaver Act, however, that relationship is weak. Therefore, removal or reduction of the kick-start may marginally improve the target effectiveness. 32. The behavioural response from salary and wage earners would likely be lower than for the self-employed because for many salary and wage earners, the greater incentive for joining KiwiSaver is related to the employer contributions of minimum 3% of gross income in addition to ongoing annual MTCs. Therefore removal or reduction of the kick-start would reduce fiscal costs without reducing savings rates, thus increasing value for money. Change the scope o f e lig ib ility fo r the kick-sta rt - under-18s not eligible 33. Removal of the kick-start altogether for those under-18 years of age would reduce the headline cost and therefore improve value for money. This option would also improve target effectiveness because under-18 year olds are outside of the target group for the policy. Assuming that this simply delays the point at which people join (i.e. someone Regulatory Impact Statement: Repeal of KiwiSaver kick-start payment - 6 May 2015 6 who would have joined in 2015 when aged 16 will now join in 2017 when they turn 18) this option generates estimated annual fiscal savings of $28m in 2015/16 falling to $12m in 2018/19. Remove o r reduce the generosity o f the annual MTCs 34. Removing the annual MTCs completely would save fiscal costs which, under present policy settings and given present trends in KiwiSaver membership, are expected to be $709m in 2015/16 rising to $832m in 2018/19. 35. These estimates take account of the current distribution of annual MTCs and include a behavioural response (ceasing making contributions) from those people with no salary or wage income such as the self-employed. 36. No reduction in contributions to the scheme (which would include a reduction in contributions, increases in members taking contribution holidays or a reduction in enrolment) by salary and wage earners is assumed as a result of removing (or reducing) the annual MTCs. This is because annual MTCs for most people in this group will be substantially smaller than the compulsory 3% employer contribution to KiwiSaver which will continue to provide a substantial incentive to both join and contribute to KiwiSaver. This is supported by observations of the contributions rate after the Budget 2011 changes to KiwiSaver annual MTCs (see figure 1 above). 37. The annual MTCs however may have more of a sustained incentive effect on making contributions (at least up to contributions of $1,042.86 per annum) to KiwiSaver than the kick-start which merely encourages joining the scheme. 38. The annual MTCs also have higher marginal utility to lower income earners. Evidence suggests that lower income earners are more likely to be in the KiwiSaver target group (however the relationship is quite weak). Therefore, removing or reducing the annual MTCs may marginally reduce the (already low) target effectiveness. Change the scope o f e lig ib ility fo r annual MTCs 39. As discussed above, it is very difficult to target KiwiSaver subsidies, including the annual MTCs to the target population of the policy with reference to conventional socio­ economic indicators such as income. While those on higher incomes were found in Law, Meehan and Scobie (2011) to have less of a saving 'problem’, the relationship between higher incomes and a lack of a retirement savings deficit is very weak. 40. Therefore, we have not considered policy options to change the scope of eligibility for the annual MTCs. Retaining su c c e s s fu l elements o f KiwiSaver 41. As the KiwiSaver Evaluation highlights, the scheme has had administrative success. The enrolments in the scheme have exceeded expectations. The automatic enrolment features have also been successful in boosting and retaining participation in a savings scheme and opt-out rates are declining. Therefore changes should not compromise the administrative efficiency. Impacts 42. The likely impacts of the proposals considered in this statement are as follows: Regulatory Impact Statement: Repeal of KiwiSaver kick-start payment - 16 March 2015 7 43. On KiwiSaver members: a. There is likely to be a limited effect on savings behaviour if the proposed changes to the kick-start and/or annual MTC are pursued; b. If the kick-start is reduced or removed then new enrolees in KiwiSaver will have lower KiwiSaver balances at retirement due to reduced subsidies (and returns on those amounts); and c. If the annual MTCs are reduced or removed then KiwiSaver members will have lower KiwiSaver balances at retirement due to the reduced subsidies (and returns on those amounts). 44. On KiwiSaver providers: a. Lower numbers of KiwiSaver members (particularly among the self-employed and children) and therefore lower revenues from fees and/or a greater number of dormant accounts (if affected individuals stop contributing); and b. Cost of preparing revised publicity material and amended staff training requirements, particularly in the period immediately after implementation. We expect that the impacts will be low if providers can rely on normal turnover of publicity material and on Inland Revenue publicity material. The legislation to give effect to this proposal will provide relief to KiwiSaver providers for compliance with disclosure requirements. 45. On employers: there may be some impacts on information and education provided to employees about KiwiSaver, however, much of this is provided by Inland Revenue in any case. 46. On Inland Revenue: a. Administrative costs of changing systems to remove the relevant subsidies. In the case of a removal of the kick-start, this amounts to $210,000 (including contingency). Changes to the annual MTCs will require more significant system changes and would require a 12-month lead in time and a costing is not available. 47. On other Government agencies: a. Administrative costs of changing publicity material and guidance on KiwiSaver subsidies. National saving, one-off enrolm ent and HomeStart 48. The analysis has focussed on fiscal savings from changes to KiwiSaver. We have not undertaken a comprehensive analysis of the effects of these policy changes on other policy issues which have been discussed in the context of KiwiSaver changes in the past. 49. The 2011 Budget changes to KiwiSaver removed the tax-free status of employer contributions to KiwiSaver, halved the annual member tax credit and increased the compulsory employer and employee contribution rates to 3%. A future one-off enrolment exercise was also announced, subject to a fiscal surplus. The Treasury’s advice in advance of those changes analysed the effect of policy options on national savings (and the NilP). The current advice has not analysed those matters, however, we note that if the same logic were applied, a reduction in KiwiSaver subsidies would positively affect national savings based on available evidence. 50. The Government still intends to conduct a one-off enrolment exercise when fiscal conditions allow. This would increase membership in KiwiSaver by taking advantage of Regulatory Impact Statement: Repeal of KiwiSaver kick-start payment - 6 May 2015 8 individuals’ inertia as individuals are more likely to stay put in the scheme once already enrolled (and required to actively take steps to “opt-out”). This would only have a positive effect on national saving under the condition that the increased cost from annual MTC payments (public dis-saving) did not exceed the additionality in private saving, which Law, Meehan & Scobie (2011) estimates to be one-third. 51. Individuals who are not engaged in personal financial management and thus myopic about retirement saving can also have welfare-enhancing outcomes if their decision to save is made for them by automatic enrolment. It is possible that these are the individuals most likely to passively remain in KiwiSaver following auto-enrolment. Individuals who are saving appropriately will at best not experience any improvement in welfare, while individuals who are already saving too much may have their welfare reduced. 52. Finally, the Government’s HomeStart policy allows KiwiSaver members to use the annual member tax credit payments towards a first home deposit under that scheme. We have not considered the extent to which a reduction in the generosity of the kick start and annual member tax credits will affect the future success (or otherwise) of the HomeStart policy. Consultation 53. We have consulted with inland Revenue in relation to the policy options and implementation of these within the constraints of Budget 2015. The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (Consumer and Commercial Law section) were consulted. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet was informed. 54. The consultation was necessarily limited due to the Budget sensitivity of this matter and the Ministerial prioritisation given to it. Conclusions and recommendations 55. Removing of reducing the generosity of KiwiSaver subsidies would improve the value for money of the scheme. However, it is highly unlikely that the target effectiveness can be materially improved if the target group remains as defined by the Act. 56. The extent and scope of a reduction or removal of the KiwiSaver subsidies (i.e. whether to cease the kick-start or annual MTCs or adjust their generosity) would depend on the relative prioritisation Ministers wish to give to competing fiscal strategy concerns and Government policies. Implementation plan 57. Amendments to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 will be required to give effect to the proposals contained herein.. Amendments will also be required to the Securities Act 1978 and Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (for those providers who have transitioned over to the new regime) to provide relief to KiwiSaver providers whose offer documents and investment statements may breach disclosure rules because those documents will still contain the current rules relating to investors’ entitlement to the kick-start and/or annual MTCs. 58. In order to achieve the desired fiscal savings in respect of the removal of the kick-start, it will be necessary to announce the policy change and pass the legislation at the same time. This is because fiscal savings would be undermined if individuals could enrol in Regulatory Impact Statement: Repeal of KiwiSaver kick-start payment - 16 March 2015 9 the scheme in the period between announcement of the policy change and a law change. 59. Inland Revenue is confident that it can implement a complete removal of the kick-start payment effective from Budget day (and also later dates). No major administrative barriers to implementation have been identified for a complete removal of the kick-start payment. Changes are required in the IRD’s SAP computer system (which sits outside of FIRST) but not to the FIRST system. There are some implementation issues relating to processing of different types of enrolees that Inland Revenue have reported to the Minister of Revenue about and are resolving. 60. A 12-month lead-in period is required for changes to annual MTCs means that people making contributions after the changes will be aware of any reduction in generosity of subsidy. Monitoring, evaluation and review 61. As explained above, the impetus for the consideration of current changes was the conclusion of the seven year Inland Revenue-led KiwiSaver Evaluation. That Evaluation focussed on the public policy outcomes of KiwiSaver. No further evaluation of this kind is planned for KiwiSaver and indeed may not even be possible due to limitations on availability of household savings data. Therefore, it is not expected that future evaluation of the current policy change proposal will be carried out other than standard collection of enrolment and contributions data by Inland Revenue. 62. However, it will be possible to assess the fiscal cost of the scheme by comparing enrolment and contributions data with the cost to the Government of KiwiSaver incentive payments, and judge value for money. Broadly if the ratio improves, this will indicate success, but it will not indicate whether the policy has become more targeted. 63. There are no other plans to review this proposal to change KiwiSaver policy. Regulatory Impact Statement: Repeal of KiwiSaver kick-start payment - 6 May 2015 10
Regulatory Impact Statement Requiring non-resident IRD number applicant to have a New Zealand bank account Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question addressed in this statement is whether requiring non-residents that apply for an IRD number to first have a New Zealand bank account would improve Inland Revenue’s ability to verify the identity of the non-resident. Currently, there is no statutory requirement for any IRD number applicant to have a New Zealand bank account. There are changes being proposed as part of Budget 2015 that will seek to modify current tax laws related to property transactions and assist Inland Revenue in enforcing compliance with these rules. This is because the Government is concerned that there is potentially low compliance in respect of tax on property transactions. However, by its nature, the scope of the problem cannot be accurately quantified. In particular, a Budget 2015 proposal would require all parties to a property transaction to obtain an IRD number and provide that number to Land Information New Zealand as part of the transaction process. In order to buttress this initiative and improve Inland Revenue’s ability to enforce tax laws on non-residents that buy and sell New Zealand residential property, the Government has directed that non-residents should, as a prerequisite to getting an IRD number, be required to have a New Zealand bank account. Therefore, this statement considered two options: • Option 1 - Not requiring evidence of a New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to a non-resident obtaining an IRD number (the status quo and preferred option). • Option 2 - Legislating to require evidence of a New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to a non-resident obtaining an IRD number.1 Although it is finely balanced, Inland Revenue has concluded that option 1 is preferable. Inland Revenue’s specific concerns with option 2 are that: • It is not apparent that, for individuals, the general anti-money laundering (AML) checks that a New Zealand financial institution would carry out would yield significantly more information than Inland Revenue collects as part of the current IRD number application process; ^The remainder of this statement, consistent with the draft legislation, uses the term “offshore person” in preference to “non-resident” where appropriate. This is because, “non-resident” has a specific meaning in a tax context and that meaning is not completely synonymous with the target group for this measure. Note also that this statement uses the term “bank account” as shorthand for the types of account covered by the draft legislation. • It is likely that the information obtained on bank account opening will be collected in any event once Phase 2 of the planned AML roll-out occurs. Any advantage that is obtained is therefore only likely to be temporary in nature. In saying this, Inland Revenue has considered the options largely from a tax policy perspective. As highlighted by the Treasury comment in paragraph 36 of this statement, there may be other “whole of government” reasons for preferring Option 1 that Inland Revenue is not best placed to comment on. Inland Revenue has consulted with the Treasury, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Ministry of Justice in relation to these options. No public consultation was undertaken on the proposal because of time constraints. The rule is to take effect from 1 October 2015. Public consultation will therefore take place in the usual way during the Select Committee process. The options identified would not impair private property rights or reduce market competition. However, we note that requiring offshore persons to have a bank account would impose additional costs on those people. Emma Grigg Policy Director Inland Revenue 18 June 2015 1. The Government is concerned with high house prices, particularly in the Auckland area. Property speculation is seen as one of a number of causes of the current prices. Other possible causes, both on the supply and demand sides, are being separately considered. The attractiveness of property speculation, when compared with other forms on investment, will increase if the gains are able to be realised untaxed, when gains from other investments are taxed. 2. The Income Tax Act 2007 contains provisions that impose income tax on certain property transactions. Examples are section CB 6, which taxes land bought with the intention of disposal and section CB 7, which taxes land acquired for the purposes of a business dealing in land. However, although the Act creates these obligations, the Government is concerned that compliance with these provisions is relatively low. 3. In order to investigate compliance with the Income Tax Act provisions, Inland Revenue does have the capacity to access records of land transfers in New Zealand - but this process is historic, rather than in real-time. Information received may also, depending on the nature of the request, not give a complete picture of the activities of a particular taxpayer. 4. Further, the Government considers that compliance by non-residents might be particularly low. This may come about as a result of ignorance of the tax rules. However, it is recognised that enforcing tax rules on non-residents is very difficult, especially those with only limited involvement with New Zealand. The fact that Inland Revenue is not aware of certain transactions means that the scope of the problem is not able to be quantified. 5. To address these concerns, the Government, as part of Budget 2015, announced a suite of measures aimed at providing clearer rules and providing more useful information to Inland Revenue to assist in its enforcement of the rules, including increased funding to Inland Revenue to investigate property compliance. The main legislative change is the introduction of a “brightline” test that will, in general terms, make the disposal of residential property taxable if the property is bought and sold within a two-year window (subject to certain exemptions). A regulatory impact statement for that change will accompany the enabling legislation, expected in the second half of 2015. 6. In order to improve Inland Revenue’s ability to enforce the tax laws, two further changes were announced: • Vendors and purchasers will be required to provide their IRD numbers (and, if they are tax residents of another jurisdiction, also provide their foreign tax identification number) at the time of transfer. This information will be provided to Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) as part of the transfer documentation and then forwarded to Inland Revenue. As such a requirement would be given effect by changes to the Land Transfer Act, Inland Revenue has prepared a separate regulatory impact statement on this proposal: Sellers and purchasers of real property required to supply their IRD numbers and tax information numbers. An important feature of the proposal to provide IRD numbers is that all parties to a relevant land transaction will be expected to have an IRD number, even if they are offshore persons. • The second proposal is that an offshore person will be required to provide evidence of a New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to obtaining an IRD number. Status quo and problem definition 7. This regulatory impact statement deals with the second proposal: the requirement to have a New Zealand bank account. The Government considers that requiring offshore persons to have a New Zealand bank account will assist in improving compliance by providing Inland Revenue with more confidence that it knows who it is dealing with by first ensuring that a person has first satisfied a financial institution’s anti-money laundering (AML) verification of identity requirements. 8. The net effect of these changes will be that in order to purchase property, an offshore person must have an IRD number and in order to get the IRD number they must first have a New Zealand bank account. Status quo 9. Under section 35 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has a power to prescribe forms. Section 35 has a broad ambit - unless the forms are prescribed elsewhere (such as in regulation), the content of the form is simply required to be related to the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. The current IRD number application form is prescribed under this authority, as are other standard forms that taxpayers are familiar with, such as income tax and GST returns. 10. Under this authority, the Commissioner has previously determined that a person applying for an IRD number must provide documentation to support their assertion of identity. The relevant IR595 (application for IRD number by an individual) requires the applicant to provide at least one “Category A” document and one “Category B” document. Category A documents are formal government-issued documents such as a passport or birth certificate. Category B documents are identification documents of a slightly less formal variety, such as a student identification card or an “offer of employment letter”. In order to cater for offshore applicants, Inland Revenue will accept “non-New Zealand” documentation such as foreign passports and drivers’ licences. 11. Similar requirements exist for “non-individuals” (such as companies and trusts) that apply for an IRD number. 12. The current administrative practice is not to issue an IRD number to an applicant unless the relevant documentation is in order. 13. Under current AML rules, financial institutions are required to perform customer due diligence and report suspicious transactions. There is a proposed Phase 2 of the AML that will cover other relevant professionals such as real estate agents, conveyancers and solicitors. Objectives 14. The key objective is to increase the effective enforcement of current tax rules related to property transactions, as supplemented by changes announced as part of Budget 2015. The requirement for a New Zealand bank account could achieve this by providing increased confidence that Inland Revenue knows who it is dealing with by first ensuring that a person has satisfied a financial institution’s anti-money laundering (AML) verification of identity requirements. 15. This objective needs to be considered in light of the additional constraint faced by Inland Revenue at the present time, which is its inability to make significant system changes in advance of the relevant stage of development of its Business Transformation. Regulatory impact analysis 16. The Government has directed that the bank account option be considered as part of the package of Budget 2015 changes. Therefore, the options considered are: • Option 1 - Not requiring evidence of a New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to an offshore person obtaining an IRD number (the status quo and preferred option). • Option 2 - Legislating to require evidence of a New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to an offshore person obtaining an IRD number. Option 1 - Status quo 17. Under the status quo the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will continue to use her power under section 35 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to prescribe forms to collect the information she feels necessary to fulfil her statutory obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system.2 18. This is the option preferred by Inland Revenue. Option 2 - Legislating a bank account requirement 19. Under this option the Tax Administration Act 1994 would be amended to specifically provide that evidence of a New Zealand bank account must be provided by an offshore person to the Commissioner as a prerequisite to obtaining an IRD number. 20. On balance, this option is not preferred, principally because: • It is not apparent that, for individuals, the general anti-money laundering checks that a New Zealand financial institution would carry out would yield significantly more information than Inland Revenue collects as part of the current IRD number application process; • It is likely that the information obtained on bank account opening will be collected in any event once Phase 2 of the planned AML roll-out occurs. Any advantage that is obtained is therefore only likely to be temporary in nature. Impact analysis Option 1 - Status quo 21. The status quo does not require an offshore person to be subject to the AML rules before obtaining an IRD number. 22. The Commissioner has an ability to prescribe forms necessary for the administration of the tax system. This means she can collect information she considers necessary, 2 Inland Revenue considers that the Commissioner could, in theory, require a bank account under her existing statutory powers, but has not chosen to exercise her authority to impose such a requirement. including information that a New Zealand financial institution would ordinarily collect under its AML obligations. 23. It is Inland Revenue’s view that there is no impediment to the Commissioner requiring evidence of a bank account under the current law. However, it is not considered a desirable requirement given the extra compliance burden it would impose for relatively little gain in terms of the administration of the tax system. 24. As mentioned above, an individual applying for an IRD number currently has to provide at least one “Category A” document and one “Category B” document. It is Inland Revenue’s view that this form of identity verification is broadly similar to that undertaken by financial institutions as part of its standard AML customer due diligence. 25. Non-individual applicants also have to provide identity documents related to the applicant. A company, for example, will need to provide their certificate of incorporation. In saying this, it is recognised that the information gathered by Inland Revenue on the underlying controllers or shareholders of a non-individual applicant is not currently comprehensive. This is because such information is not strictly necessary to the administration of the tax system - the applicant (in this case, the trust or company) is a New Zealand tax resident and it is at that level that any tax liability will arise. 26. The identity of individuals that control other entities may not be easy to obtain in the event of default on tax obligations - especially if publically available records, such as the Companies Register, did not contain information on these individuals. The information that a financial institution would obtain in respect of natural persons that control a “non­ individual”, such as a trust or company, is therefore likely to be more complete than that obtained by Inland Revenue. Option 2 - Legislating a bank account requirement 27. As set out in the preceding paragraphs, the degree to which the bank account requirement provides additional verification of identity depends on whether the bank account holder will be an individual or non-individual. 28. In the case of individuals, there is the benefit that identity is verified against an independent source under AML procedures. However, the information that a financial institution obtains under its standard AML procedures would not provide materially more information than the standard IRD number application would yield in any event. 29. On the other hand, the case for the bank account requirement seems to be stronger for non-individuals. AML procedures require a financial institution to also conduct customer due diligence on the “beneficial owners” (which is a defined term in the AML rules) of such entities including, in the case of companies, individuals with effective control over the company and individuals that ultimately own more than 25% of the company. This information is greater than that required by Inland Revenue as part of its standard IRD number application process for non-individuals. 30. On this basis, there is a strong argument for imposing the bank account requirement, at least in respect of non-individual IRD number applicants. However, there are other important considerations that factor against that argument: • Land Information New Zealand’s “Standard for verification of identity for registration under the Land Transfer Act 1952” document similarly requires the practitioner giving effect to a land transaction to verify the identity of the interested party; Phase 2 of the AML roll-out has yet to occur. Inland Revenue understands that Phase 2 will impose AML obligations on a broader group of professional bodies, including solicitors, conveyancers and real estate agents. As the majority of land transactions occur with the assistance of one of these professionals, AML requirements will in the future be applied to parties to a land transaction in any event. 31. Finally, there is a proposal to impose a positive obligation on a person that becomes an “offshore person” to provide the Commissioner with a bank account at that point. Although this provides a theoretical robustness to the rules, there is a risk that this obligation will not be complied with and therefore the proposed rule will be circumvented. 32. After taking these factors into account, Inland Revenue considers that the proposed bank account requirement would: • for individuals, be of no real benefit; and • for non-individuals, be of benefit, but this would only be temporary. 33. Although information obtained, particularly on non-individuals, may be useful during that window, on balance, it is not considered desirable to introduce rules to address an issue that will almost certainly be addressed through other means in the near future. 34. The table below summarises our analysis of the options (including the status quo) and includes comments on the impacts of the options on Inland Revenue and affected persons. Table: Analysis Option Meets objective? Impacts N et impact Economic / revenue impact Administrative impact Compliance impactFairness 1 - Not requiring evidence of a New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to an offshore person obtaining an IRD number (status quo) Meets objective in part. Inland Revenue has powers to enforce tax obligations and some comfort as to the identity of IRD number applicants obtained by Inland Revenue, but there are recognised deficiencies in respect of non-individual applicants. None, other than those identified as part of the broader suite of property tax measures announced as part of Budget 2015. No change. Inland Revenue continues to use the current application forms and processes. No change. Applicants must provide documentation set out in the relevant IRD number application form. Applicants are required to provide relevant documentation, some of which is tailored for offshore applicants (such as foreign passports). Addresses the problem definition in part because Inland Revenue already collects information on IRD number applicants. Meets the objective in part. For individuals it is considered that the Commissioner already obtains adequate verification of identity as part of the current IRD number application process. Impacts OptionMeets objective? Economic / revenue impact Administrative impact Compliance impact Fairness Net impact 2 - Legislating to require evidence of a New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to an offshore person obtaining an IRD number. Meets the objective in part. As discussed above, will provide more complete information on individuals that control entity/trust structures, but this information deficit seems likely to be filled in the near future in any event when AML Phase 2 takes effect No direct impact other than those identified as part of the broader suite of property tax measures introduced as part of Budget 2015. Increased administration costs for Inland Revenue. The existing forms would need to be altered to reflect the legislative requirement. The primary legislation will need to be amended. The requirement for a person to provide a bank account to the Commissioner in the event that they become an “offshore person” will require a separate process to be established to process and record these disclosures. Increased. Offshore persons would need to establish a New Zealand bank account that meets the statutory requirements and provide evidence of that account to Inland Revenue. These costs are not expected to be significant, but will require an offshore person to at least either go through the standard AML checks with a New Zealand institution or find a foreign agent of a New Zealand bank in order to have the relevant AML checks performed. It is potentially arguable that imposing a requirement on offshore persons that does not apply to residents is discriminatory. However, the bill introducing these changes has been subject to the standard Bill of Rights vetting process that applies to all legislation and no issues have been raised. However, Inland Revenue has looked at international precedent and is not aware of any comparable jurisdiction that requires evidence of a domestic bank account as a prerequisite to obtaining a tax identification number. Addresses the problem definition in part because it will increase information potentially available to Inland Revenue - particularly for non-individuals. However, it will increase compliance and administration costs and will likely only be of temporary benefit in practice. CONSULTATION AND IMPACT 35. Inland Revenue has not consulted with potentially impacted parties (such as financial institutions) because of time constraints. The Treasury, The Reserve Bank of New Zealand and Ministry of Justice were consulted on the policy proposal. 36. Treasury agrees with Inland Revenue’s conclusion that the requirement for an offshore person to have a New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to obtaining an IRD number provides limited benefit from a tax compliance perspective. However, Treasury notes that the requirement may have housing market benefits by adding stricter AML checks for entities that are “offshore persons” purchasing properties in New Zealand. The requirement also provides the option to later require offshore persons to use the bank account to purchase property in New Zealand should future analysis show that purchasers using funds from dubious sources is a problem. 37. No public consultation was undertaken on the proposal because of time constraints. Public consultation will therefore take place in the usual way during the Select Committee process. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 38. Although it is finely balanced, we recommend Option 1: status quo. In order to be justified, the benefits to the tax system of requiring a New Zealand bank account would need to outweigh the compliance costs imposed on IRD number applicants and administration costs on Inland Revenue itself. Our view is that, although there may be short-term gains, these are difficult to quantify and there will be no net benefit to the tax system in the long run. Any advantage is likely to be limited to non-individuals, and even then only until such time as AML Phase 2 is implemented. 39. We consider that any legislation that implements option 2 should be reassessed at the time AML Phase 2 takes effect to ascertain whether it is, at that stage, only duplicating information available through the expanded AML obligations. 40. Option 2 increases compliance costs for affected persons and administration costs for Inland Revenue and, in practice, is likely to provide only a short term material benefit in terms of meeting the stated objective. 41. In reaching this conclusion, we note that we have considered the options largely from a tax policy perspective. As highlighted by the Treasury comment in paragraph 36 of this statement, there may be other “whole of government” reasons for preferring Option 1 that Inland Revenue is not best placed to comment on. IMPLEMENTATION 42. Option 1 does not require legislation to implement. Legislative change is required to implement option 2. 43. Any legislative amendments required to implement option 2 will be included in the Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Information) Bill and are intended to take effect from 1 October 2015. Material will be provided as part of the standard bill introduction process. 44. Inland Revenue will be required to update forms and communication material prior to the proposed implementation date of 1 October 2015. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 45. Other than the review mentioned in paragraph 32, there are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes to give effect to any legislative amendment required to implement option 2. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to these changes, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP).
Regulatory Impact Statement Sellers and purchasers of real property required to supply their IRD numbers and tax information numbers Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The primary question addressed in this RIS is whether requiring sellers and purchasers of real property to supply their IRD number and, if they are resident in another jurisdiction, their tax information number (TIN) (which is the overseas equivalent of an IRD number) would improve Inland Revenue’s ability to effectively collect tax on property transactions. Changes have been proposed as part of Budget 2015 to modify current tax laws and assist Inland Revenue in enforcing compliance with the current and new rules. To support this work, the Government has proposed that all parties to a property transaction must have an IRD number and provide that number to LINZ before the sale and purchase transaction can proceed. Where the person is currently a tax resident of another jurisdiction, they will also be required to provide any TIN issued to them by the relevant government authority of that other jurisdiction. These requirements would not apply where the property is to be the purchaser’s main home. This information will be supplied to Inland Revenue for the enforcement of any tax liabilities that may arise. Inland Revenue may also supply the information to overseas tax authorities along with details of the sale and/or purchase transaction, in accordance with existing New Zealand legislation (including New Zealand’s tax treaties). The initiative is intended to improve Inland Revenue’s ability to enforce the income tax obligations of those who buy and sell New Zealand real property (including any potential income tax liabilities in relation to rental income). It is also intended to help prevent people who are resident in another jurisdiction from evading foreign tax on their New Zealand land sale or purchase by ensuring that the foreign tax authority can match the transaction with the taxpayer. This RIS considers three options: • option 1: not requiring IRD numbers and TIN numbers to be provided to LINZ upon sale or purchase of real property (the status quo and not Inland Revenue’s preferred option). • option 2: requiring IRD numbers and TIN numbers to be provided to LINZ (and passed on to Inland Revenue) upon sale or purchase of real property (Inland Revenue’s preferred option). • option 3: requiring IRD numbers and TIN numbers to be provided to LINZ upon sale or purchase of real property (and passed on to Inland Revenue), with an exception in the case of purchasers for whom the property will be their main home (not Inland Revenue’s preferred option). Inland Revenue expects that option 2 would enhance Inland Revenue’s abilities to enforce the income tax obligations of those who buy and sell New Zealand real property by 1 ensuring that Inland Revenue can link the taxpayer with the relevant property transaction. In light of the new ‘brightline’ test for property bought and sold within two years that will apply from 1 October 2015, this ability will be even more important. Inland Revenue also expects that option 2 would help prevent non-residents from evading foreign tax on their New Zealand land sale or purchase by ensuring that the foreign tax authority can match the transaction with the taxpayer. The exact level of benefits has not been quantified. This is partially because Inland Revenue does not have accurate data and partially because of time constraints. The actual compliance costs likely to be imposed by the proposal have not been accurately determined because of time constraints, but are not expected to be high given that information which verifies sellers’ and purchasers’ identities is already supplied to LINZ. There will be additional compliance costs for those who do not already have IRD numbers (which would generally be non-residents). The number of property transfers in the financial year ending 30 June 2014 was 176,500. Inland Revenue has concerns in relation to option 3, which would provide for an exemption in the case of purchasers for whom the property will be their main home. Inland Revenue considers that compared to option 2, option 3 would not reduce compliance costs for such purchasers. This is because we expect that most of those purchasers will already have an IRD number. Adding an exemption also makes the rules more complicated as purchasers and conveyancers would also need to consider another rule. Further, we have concerns that the benefits of collecting the information will be reduced under option 3 compared to option 2. For example, some individuals who are purchasing their main home could still be subject to tax if they have a regular pattern of buying, improving, and selling their main home. Another example is where the owner changes the use of the property (for example, after living in the house as their main home, they move into a different house and use the first house as an investment property, thus deriving a rental income stream from it). Under option 3 Inland Revenue would not be provided with the information that would help to investigate this. On balance, Inland Revenue prefers option 2. Inland Revenue has not consulted with sellers and purchasers of real property or their representatives on these options because of time constraints. The Treasury, LINZ, and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner were consulted on the policy proposal. LINZ and Inland Revenue will consult on regulations made under the new legislation which will provide the details of exemptions to the policy (such as the main home under option 3, and classes of land such as Maori freehold land where the compliance costs are likely to be high) and to describe detailed information to be collected. The design of the policy under these regulations could mitigate some of the compliance costs identified in this Statement. The options identified would not impair private property rights or reduce market competition. However, we note that both options 2 and 3 (requiring IRD numbers and TIN numbers to be provided to LINZ upon sale or purchase) will impose compliance costs on sellers, purchasers, and conveyancers. 2 Emma Grigg Policy Director, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 5 June 2015 3 Status quo and problem definition 1. The Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA 2007) contains provisions that impose income tax on certain property transactions, and also on rental income earned from property. Examples of income tax provisions relating to certain property transactions are section CB 6, which taxes land purchased with the intention of disposal and section CB 7, which taxes land acquired for the purposes of a business dealing in land. However, although the ITA 2007 creates these obligations, the Government is concerned that compliance with these provisions may be relatively low. 2. In order to investigate compliance with the ITA 2007 provisions, Inland Revenue does have the capacity to access records of land transfers in New Zealand - but this process is historic, rather than in real-time. Information received may also, depending on the nature of the request, not give a complete picture of the activities of a particular taxpayer. 2. Further, the Government considers that compliance by non-residents might be particularly low. This may come about as a result of ignorance of the tax rules. However, it is recognised that enforcing tax rules on non-residents is very difficult, especially those with only limited involvement with New Zealand. The fact that Inland Revenue does not have the data involving certain transactions means that the scope of the problem is not able to be quantified. 3. To address these concerns, Budget 2015 is introducing a suite of measures aimed at providing clearer rules and providing more useful information to Inland Revenue to assist in its enforcement of the rules, including increased funding to Inland Revenue to investigate property compliance. The main legislative change is the introduction of a “brightline” test that will, in general terms, make the disposal of residential property taxable if the property is bought and sold within a two-year window (subject to certain exemptions, such as if the property was the person’s main home). This change is expected to apply from 1 October 2015. ' ‘ 4. In order to improve Inland Revenue’s ability to enforce tax laws, including the proposed brightline rules, two changes are expected: • Vendors and purchasers will be required to provide their IRD numbers (and, if they are also resident in another jurisdiction for tax purposes for tax purposes, their foreign TIN) at the time of transfer. This information will be provided to LINZ as part of the transfer documentation and then forwarded to Inland Revenue. All parties to a land transaction will be expected to have an IRD number, even if they are non-resident. Thus, non-residents intending to buy or sell New Zealand property will need to obtain an IRD number before they can finalise their property transaction. The Government proposes that those who are purchasing a property with the intention of that property becoming their main home should be exempt from the requirement. • The second proposal is that a non-resident will be required to provide evidence of a New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to obtaining an IRD number. 5. These proposals will apply from 1 October 2015 to align with the introduction of the brightline test. 4 6. This regulatory impact statement deals with the first proposal: the requirement for buyers and sellers to provide their IRD number (and, if they are also resident in another jurisdiction for tax purposes, their foreign TIN) at the time of transfer. Status quo 7. Currently, the Land Transfer Act 1952 requires purchasers and sellers to provide identification information (such as their passport or drivers licence) upon sale or purchase of a house. There is currently no requirement for IRD numbers or TIN numbers to be provided. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is able to obtain information about property sales from LINZ under her existing powers, but the taxpayer and the property transaction are not always clearly linked, which can make enforcement more difficult. 8. Further, under New Zealand’s international treaties, Inland Revenue must supply tax information that it holds relating to non-residents to the tax authority in that other country. Where a non-resident has a foreign tax liability resulting from the sale or purchase of New Zealand real property and Inland Revenue does not hold the TIN, the correct matching of the taxpayer’s identity to the transaction can be difficult for the tax authority of that person’s home jurisdiction. This means that in some circumstances non-residents could potentially be evading foreign tax on their New Zealand land sale or purchase. Objectives 9. The objectives of this reform are: a) to increase the effective enforcement of current tax rules relating to property transactions, as supplemented by changes introduced as part of Budget 2015 (this is the primary objective). b) to help prevent non-residents from evading foreign tax on their New Zealand land sale or purchase by ensuring that the foreign tax authority can link the transaction with the taxpayer (this is a secondary objective). 10. The proposal will apply from 1 October 2015. The reason for introducing the proposals at this time is to support the introduction of the brightline test, which also applies from 1 October 2015. 11. These objectives need to be considered in light of the additional constraint faced by Inland Revenue at the present time, which is its inability to make significant system changes in advance of the relevant stage of development of its Business Transformation programme. Regulatory impact analysis 12. This statement considers three options: • Option 1: not requiring IRD numbers and TIN numbers to be provided to LINZ upon sale or purchase of real property (the status quo and not Inland Revenue’s preferred option). • Option 2: requiring IRD numbers and TIN numbers to be provided to LINZ (and passed on to Inland Revenue) upon sale or purchase of real property (Inland Revenue’s preferred option). 5 • Option 3: requiring IRD numbers and TIN numbers to be provided to LINZ upon sale or purchase of real property (and passed on to Inland Revenue), with an exception in the case of purchasers for whom the property will be their main home (not Inland Revenue’s preferred option). Option 1 - Status quo 13. Under the status quo IRD numbers and TIN numbers do not need to be provided to LINZ (and passed on to Inland Revenue) upon sale or purchase of real property. 14. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is able to obtain information about property sales from LINZ under her existing powers, but the taxpayer and the property transaction are not always clearly linked, which can make enforcement more difficult. 15. The problems with current enforcement would be exacerbated once the new brightline rules have been introduced if the status quo is retained. This is because taxpayers will be liable for tax in relation to the sale of their property in a wider range of circumstances, but Inland Revenue would have to rely on other tools to address enforcement issues. 16. Potentially less New Zealand tax revenue is collected as a result of information about the taxpayer and the property transaction not always being clearly linked. To the extent that this enables tax evasion, this could make property investment more attractive than other forms of investment. 17. To the extent that foreign tax jurisdictions cannot link the taxpayer and the New Zealand property transaction, the foreign taxpayer may be evading foreign tax (for example, a capital gains tax) in their home country. If they are evading then home country’s tax on their New Zealand property transactions, this could make it cheaper and more attractive for non-residents to invest in New Zealand property. 18. These effects are not quantifiable as we do not have sufficient information about the problem. 19. This option is Inland Revenue’s least preferred option. Option 2 - Requiring IRD numbers and TIN to be provided to LINZ 20. Under this option, the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Land Transfer Act 1952 would be amended to require all parties to a property transaction to have an IRD number and to provide that number to LINZ before the sale and purchase transaction can proceed. Where the person is currently a tax resident of another country, they will also be required to provide the TIN issued to them by the tax authority of that other country, and the relevant country code. This information will be supplied to Inland Revenue for the enforcement of any tax liabilities that may arise. Inland Revenue may also supply the information to overseas tax authorities along with details of the sale and/or purchase transaction, in accordance with existing New Zealand legislation (including our tax treaties). 21. Inland Revenue expects that option 2 would enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to enforce the income tax obligations of those who buy and sell New Zealand real property. Inland Revenue also expects that it would help prevent non-residents from evading foreign tax on their New Zealand land sale or purchase by ensuring that the foreign tax authority can match the transaction with the taxpayer. The exact level of benefits has not been 6 quantified. This is partially because Inland Revenue does not have accurate data and partially because of time constraints. 22. The number of property transfers in the financial year ending 30 June 2014 was approximately 176,500. The actual compliance costs likely to be imposed by the proposal have not been accurately determined, but are not expected to be high given that identity verification information is already supplied to LINZ. A conveyancer is likely to spend an additional 1-5 minutes entering information into Landonline, resulting in an additional cost of between $4 and $20 for purchaser and seller. There will be additional compliance costs for those who do not already have IRD numbers (which would generally be non­ residents). 23. Analysis is required to fully understand the administrative impacts. These have not yet been completed nor quantified due to time constraints. They would include but are not limited to: • Customer contacts for LINZ and Inland Revenue. • Processing time and staff costs to issue additional IRD numbers. • Implementation costs which will include an evaluation of the IRD number application processes for non-residents. • For LINZ, data entry for manual dealings received by LINZ, responding to information requests (e.g. data on numbers of overseas tax residents purchasing property), queries about the policy and servicing Ministerial queries. • Implementation costs may also include an evaluation of other systems costs to ensure the right tax treatments are applied. • Training materials, communications and website updates. • Potentially for LINZ (and/or Inland Revenue) various costs associated with capture, transfer and storage of property/tax data. 24. This is Inland Revenue’s preferred option. Option 3 - Requiring IRD numbers and TIN numbers to be provided to LINZ unless the property is to be the main home 25. This option is a variation on option 2. Under option 3 there would be an exemption in the case of purchasers for whom the property will be their main home. 26. Inland Revenue considers that when considered against option 2, on balance option 3 would be unlikely to reduce compliance costs overall for such purchasers. This is because of the following factors: • we expect that most of those purchasers will already have an Inland Revenue number, so they will not have additional compliance costs in obtaining an IRD number; • as noted above for option 2, a conveyancer is likely to spend an additional 1 -5 minutes entering the information into Landonline, resulting in an additional cost of between $4 and $20 for purchaser and seller. Under option 3, compliance costs will be at the lower end of the scale for those exempted from providing information; • however, adding an exemption also makes the rules more complicated as purchasers and conveyancers would also need to consider whether another rule applies. (Although concerns regarding complexity could potentially be mitigated to an extent depending on the design of the exemption.) 7 27. Further, we are concerned that the benefits of collecting the information will be reduced under option 3 compared to option 2. For example, some individuals who are purchasing their main home could still be subject to tax if they have a regular pattern of buying, improving, and selling their main home. Another example is where the owner changes the use of the property (for example, after living in the house as their main home, they move into a different house and use the first house as an investment property, thus deriving a rental income stream from it). Under option 3 Inland Revenue would not be provided with the information that would help to investigate this. 28. Inland Revenue notes that these concerns regarding complexity could potentially be mitigated to an extent depending on the design of the exemption. 29. Option 3 is not Inland Revenue’s preferred option. However, option 3 is preferred over option 1 (the status quo). Impact analysis 30. The table below summarises our analysis of the options (including the status quo). 8 Table: Analysis O p tio nM e e ts o b je c tiv e ?

Other impacts 31. There are no social, cultural or environmental impacts. 32. Fiscal impacts are likely to be positive, but are not able to be quantified. CONSULTATION AND IMPACT 33. Apart from Inland Revenue and LINZ, impacted parties are likely to be purchasers and sellers of real property, and conveyancers. Inland Revenue has not consulted with purchasers and sellers of real property or their representatives because of time constraints. The Treasury, LINZ, and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner were consulted on the policy proposal. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 34. We recommend option 2. Inland Revenue expects that option 2 would enhance its ability to enforce the income tax obligations of those who buy and sell New Zealand real property. Inland Revenue also expects that it would help prevent non-residents from evading foreign tax on their New Zealand land sale or purchase by ensuring that the foreign tax authority can match the transaction with the taxpayer. The exact level of benefits has not been quantified. This is partially because Inland Revenue does not have accurate data and partially because of time constraints. 35. The actual compliance costs likely to be imposed by option 2 have not been accurately determined, but overall are not expected to be high given that information which verifies their identity is already supplied to LINZ. There will be additional compliance costs for those who do not already have IRD numbers (which would generally be non-residents). 36. Compared to option 2, option 3 would still provide revenue and tax integrity benefits, although these would not be as high as under option 2. Overall, we consider that option 3 would have similar or potentially higher compliance costs than option 2. This is because adding an exception makes the rules more complicated as purchasers and conveyancers would also need to consider another rule. (Inland Revenue notes that these concerns regarding complexity could potentially be mitigated to an extent depending on the design of the exemption). Accordingly, we do not consider that the potential benefits of option 3 outweigh the potential costs. IMPLEMENTATION 37. Option 1 does not require legislation to implement. Legislative change would be required to implement either option 2 or 3. 38. Any legislative amendments required to implement option 2 or 3 could be included in a bill to amend the Land Transfer Act 1954 and the Tax Administration Act 1994, and could be implemented from 1 October 2015. Regulations are likely to be included as part of this work to provide the details o f exemptions to the policy (such as the “main home” under option 3, and classes of land such as Maori freehold land where the compliance costs are likely to be high) and to describe detailed information to be collected. 1 39. Inland Revenue will be required to update forms and communication material prior to the proposed implementation date of 1 October 2015. 40. LINZ will be required to make administrative and system changes to the Landonline electronic land transfer service, consult with conveyancers on the changes, and conduct a change management process to ensure the policy and requirements are understood. 41. It is proposed that regulations will provide the details of exemptions to the policy (such as the “main home” under option 3, and classes of land such as Maori freehold land where the compliance costs are likely to be high) and to describe detailed information to be collected. The design of the policy under these regulations could help to mitigate some of the compliance costs identified in this analysis. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 42. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate, and review the changes to give effect to any legislative amendment required to implement options 2 or 3. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to these changes, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP).
Regulatory Impact Statement Information sharing Arrangement with Australia for the recovery of student loan debt Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to implement an information-sharing mechanism between Australia and New Zealand for the recovery of student loan debt. This analysis follows approval by Cabinet in August of last year to negotiate and progress towards an agreement with Australia for the purpose of exchanging information to assist in the recovery of New Zealand student loan debt held by borrowers currently residing in Australia. Negotiations with Australian officials included a test data exchange to examine the ability of the Australians to perform the relevant information exchange and the likely benefits to New Zealand for having such an exchange. In assessing the likely revenue benefits and determining the cost of the exchange, assumptions were made regarding the frequency of exchange and number of borrowers whose details will be matched under the proposed facility. Estimation of the revenue benefits and analysis of the problem also makes assumptions about the extent of the overseas-based borrower population residing in Australia. Because of the lack of quality contact details held for borrowers overseas, particularly for borrowers in default, it is difficult to ascertain what proportion of these borrowers are in Australia. The information-sharing mechanism requires amendment to both Australian and New Zealand legislation. Further work needs to be undertaken to develop the required legislative changes. No public consultation was carried out in respect of the proposed Arrangement. Extensive consultation occurred between Inland Revenue officials and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner to ensure that the potential privacy impacts have been identified and properly considered. Additionally, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade was consulted with regards to the appropriate international instrument to support the proposed exchange of information. There is no legislation accompanying this Arrangement. However, legislation will be required before exchange of information under this Arrangement can become operational. The required legislation could be included in a student loan scheme bill scheduled for introduction in the second half of this year. None of the proposed options are expected to impair private property rights, reduce market competition, or override common law principles. Chris Gillion Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 10 February 2015 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Overseas-based-borrower debt 1. There is currently over $683 million owing in overseas student loan default. In 2015 this is likely to increase to $880 million, which will represent well over 90 percent of all student loan default. Approximately 65 percent of overseas-based borrower default is estimated to be held by borrowers residing in Australia. 2. Overall, repayment rates for overseas-based borrowers are very poor. Nearly 80 percent who had a repayment obligation on 31 March 2014 failed to make their payments. 3. The key to collecting overdue repayments is holding up-to-date contact details for defaulters. Inland Revenue holds some form of contact details for only approximately 30 percent of overseas-based borrowers. This lack of contact details makes engaging with overseas-based borrowers difficult, including those borrowers based in Australia. Previous initiatives 4. In order to address the high levels of non-compliance by overseas-based borrowers, several initiatives have been introduced over the last four years to increase the quality of contact details held by Inland Revenue for overseas-based borrowers. 5. From 2012, borrowers applying for a repayment holiday were required to also provide details for an alternative contact person based in New Zealand. In 2013, legislation was amended to ensure all borrowers have an obligation to notify the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of any change in their contact details. 6. Additionally, Inland Revenue has an information match with the New Zealand Customs Service, which allows Inland Revenue to receive the contact information from the arrival cards of serious defaulters. There is also an information-sharing agreement with the Department of Internal Affairs, which allows Inland Revenue to receive contact details from passport applications and renewals for overseas-based borrowers who are either in default of their repayment obligations or whose contact details appear not to be up-to-date. 7. Inland Revenue also entered into contracts with private debt collection agencies in Australia in 2013, which allowed these agencies to locate borrowers’ contact details and pursue debt collection activities on behalf of Inland Revenue when required. 8. The exchange of information underlying the proposed Arrangement follows these initiatives in scaling up the overseas-based borrower compliance initiative which began in 2010 (and initially focused on borrowers based in Australia). The initiative is run by Inland Revenue, which reports on its progress quarterly to the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment and the Minister of Revenue. Status quo 9. There is currently no written understanding in place to facilitate and support an information-sharing mechanism between New Zealand and Australia to assist in the recovery of student loan debt. 10. At the Australia-New Zealand Leaders’ meeting held in February 2013, it was agreed that officials from Australia and New Zealand would work together to investigate the possible implementation of a reciprocal student debt recovery scheme on a without-prejudice basis. 2 11. Following the Australia-New Zealand Leaders’ meeting held in February 2014, the Prime Ministers welcomed progress on work to set up a mechanism to share data to assist New Zealand to recoup unpaid student loans in Australia, with the option of New Zealand providing reciprocal assistance should Australia adopt an overseas-based borrower regime in the future. 12. In August 2014, Cabinet agreed that New Zealand officials would enter into formal negotiations with their Australian counterparts in relation to an agreement to exchange information to assist in the recovery of student loan debt \[CAB Min (14) 26/22 refers\], 13. There is a concern that the status quo is not sufficient, as there is no official political commitment between Australia and New Zealand to assist in the recovery of student loan debt. As mentioned above, Australia has previously signalled an intention to cooperate with New Zealand in the recovery of student loan debt; however, this intention is not currently formalised in any manner. Assistance in recovery of student loan debt in Australia would be beneficial to New Zealand, as there is a high level of student loan default held by borrowers currently residing in Australia. Problem definition 14. The problem addressed in this RIS is limited to implementation of an agreement following negotiations with Australian officials, as Cabinet approved these negotiations in August 2014. This RIS therefore identifies the implementation options available for an agreement for the assistance in the recovery of student loan debt between Australia and New Zealand. 15. After formal negotiations with Australian officials, which took place in September to December of 2014, it has been decided that the type of agreement that is acceptable to both jurisdictions is an Arrangement. An Arrangement is of less than treaty status and instead embodies a moral and political commitment. 16. In this context, this RIS is concerned with how to progress the exchange of information between Australia and New Zealand to assist with the recovery of New Zealand student loan debt held by borrowers residing in Australia. 17. This RIS does not consider a legally binding agreement (treaty) as an option. Formal negotiations with Australian officials have indicated that their preferred option for an international instrument is an Arrangement. OBJECTIVES 18. The objectives are to: (a) Support an information exchange between the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and Inland Revenue in relation to New Zealand student loan borrowers residing in Australia. (b) Commit Australia to enter into a mechanism for the exchange of information for information on student loan borrowers. This will require consensus with Australian officials. (c) Gain access to contact information for New Zealand student loan borrowers in a cost-effective way. 3 (d) Achieve (c) in a timely manner, recognising that the quicker Inland Revenue can make contact with these borrowers, the more successful the initiative is likely to be. (e) Maintain flexibility to negotiate debt recovery terms, including information requests from Australia to New Zealand on Australian borrowers living in New Zealand (reciprocity). 19. The primary objective is to advance an information exchange between the ATO and Inland Revenue in relation to New Zealand student loan borrowers residing in Australia (objective (a)). The objectives (b), (c), (d) and (e) concern the specific criteria to be considered when trying to achieve (a). 20. The ability to maintain flexibility, particularly for the purpose of potentially providing reciprocal facilities in the future for sharing information on Australian borrowers residing in New Zealand (objective (e)) is likely to involve more lengthy negotiations. Accordingly there is a trade-off between objectives (d) and (e). 21. For an information exchange to become operational, both Australia and New Zealand will require passing amendments to current legislation to allow for the sharing of information. This means that the earliest any information exchange will be operational is the middle of 2016. 22. Following consultation with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, and as stated in the proposed Arrangement, any information sharing will be canned out in accordance with applicable privacy laws in both jurisdictions. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 23. This RIS considers the status quo (option one) and one alternative (option two) as options to address the stated problem and achieve the desired objectives. Status quo (option one) 24. There is cunently no written understanding between Australia and New Zealand that allows for assistance in the collection of student loan debt. Accordingly, there is currently no ability or mechanism to share information with Australia for the purpose of obtaining contact details on student loan borrowers. 25. If the status quo is retained, the ability to implement an information exchange with the ATO is substantially reduced. 26. Negotiations between Australian and New Zealand officials have indicated that it is preferable for there to be a high-level written understanding or arrangement in place to facilitate an information-sharing mechanism between tax departments in each jurisdiction. 27. Therefore, if the proposed Arrangement is not made, there is no support for an information exchange mechanism to assist in the recovery of New Zealand student loan debt held in Australia. 28. If the information exchange is still pursued, re-negotiations with Australia officials will be required to ascertain whether it is possible to implement an information-sharing mechanism either without a high-level agreement or with another kind of high-level 4 agreement (for example, a treaty). This is likely to substantially delay the implementation of an information exchange and the likely benefits. Enter into an Arrangement (option two) 29. Option two is for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to enter into an Arrangement with the Commissioner of Taxation (Australia) for the exchange of information on New Zealand student loan borrowers residing in Australia. The information exchange proposed under this Arrangement will require changes to both Australian and New Zealand legislation. In particular, it will require amendment to the tax secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and further changes to either the Tax Administration Act or the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. 30. This proposed Arrangement is a high-level document that embodies a moral and political commitment. It allows for the exchange of information between the ATO and Inland Revenue. This information exchange would allow Inland to receive up-to-date contact details for New Zealand student loan borrowers residing in Australia through matching borrower details against the ATO database of Australian taxpayers. Inland Revenue would then be able contact those individuals to keep them engaged with their loan obligations and, where appropriate, recover outstanding student loan amounts. 31. To indicate the potential benefits of the proposed Arrangement, a test information- match occurred in November 2014 between the ATO and Inland Revenue, using a sample of New Zealand student loan borrower data. 32. The high-level data match process involved the following: • Inland Revenue selected 1,000 active student loan cases. • The cases were sent securely in two batches to the ATO. • The ATO performed an information-match. • A high-level report was provided to Inland Revenue. 33. The results of the test match were as follows: Confidence Group 1 (up-to-date contact details) Group 2 (contact details not up-to-date) Total High confidence of match 483 96.6%38476.8% 86786.7% Low confidence of match 3 0.6%224.4% 252.5% No match 91.8%58 11.6%676.7% Inconclusive match5 1.0%367.2%41 4.1% TOTALS500 100.0%500 100.0%1,000100.0% 34. This table outlines the degree of confidence of the information-match performed by ATO using the data Inland Revenue sent on New Zealand borrowers. This data was separated into two groups of borrowers. Group 1 consisted of borrowers for whom Inland Revenue believed it had up-to-date contact details. Group 2 consisted of borrowers who were not considered to have up-to-date contact details currently registered with Inland Revenue. 35. This test match indicates that an information exchange between the ATO and Inland Revenue is likely to be a good source of contact details for New Zealand borrowers residing in Australia. 5 36. The results of this test match were used to estimate the likely revenue benefits from an information-exchange mechanism. Additional assumptions were made regarding the frequency of exchange and volume of borrowers’ details sent to the ATO for matching. These benefits were estimated to be around $NZ10 million in repayments (additional to the repayments already being received under the overseas-based borrower compliance initiative) for the first year. Subsequent years are estimated to have a similar increase in borrower repayments from new contacts made as well as from those contacted in previous years who have continued to make their repayments. 6 37. This table summarises our impact assessment of the options. \*The Arrangement is able to be easily amended in the future to incorporate reciprocal information sharing. However, there is no explicit provision in the Arrangement to cover information sharing on Australian student loan borrowers in New Zealand. 3 C/3 © 3 a E © • C/3 Cd © c/3 X > © © ■—1 !— t\*1 M 2 4 g o - | r\* 53 © £ © X £ C/3 £ © z T3 3 3 3 i © > o D- 3 s \* s C/3 © C/3 © © t - © 3 § O 3 C/3 © -x l . s § g § i , X 5- 3 z -T O cd 3 £ 3 cd X X -X 3 3 cd Id t-H ts © 0 X 3 0 X E ^ 2 © © oO 3 g ©s- ^ > O 92 © > X- 1 X 33 O D .SE < N o 3 © C/3 t-H 3 0 < -a Risks No formalised political commitmenl from Australia to 3 cd \_o 3 © \*X 3 to 3 53 > o o ©h O C/3 C/3 \_o Id 53 © £ "53 X £ © £ -a 3 3 3 -x 3 © £ © bD 3 3 3 2 3 3 X 0 3 ^ to < | c S ecedent in tional at ion for New d student loan covery - may § 2 -x £ 3 3 22 © 3 £ 3 !— Xh © © © 0 £ N Sfg CO cd debt re 3 © O Clh £ ~o o o bU 3 C/3 3 < 3 2 3 © N n c < $ N 3 3 t— c © E SC ^ 13 E g-t5 £ B ^ O “ U C/3 .3 © N 3 a.'\_g « Z E E •= .c 2 § E '| Xh © C/3 > Announcements have been made regarding the intention of 0 3 C/3 C/3 Environmental, soci and cultural Australian and NewZealand to work together for student loan debt recovery.Failure to proceed might be perceived negatively.Change in cultural perception - signals t borrowers in Australi that Inland Revenue i able to obtain contacl information from ATO. 08 Q. £ Fh ,o <D O 3 O © X- © 3 X- ©h <Z) 3 \_cd C/3 •— t3 3 \_ © “ . 3 © £ 0 ”2 ^ w Compliance No compliance cosi borrowers.

CONSULTATION 38. Inland Revenue officials have developed the proposed Arrangement in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner, the Australian Treasury and the ATO. The New Zealand Treasury and the Ministry of Education have also been consulted on the proposed information exchange and proposed Arrangement. 39. In particular, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner has been consulted with regards to the privacy impacts and relevant information safeguards in the development of the text of the Arrangement. Inland Revenue officials will continue to consult with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in the drafting and preparation of the legislation required to implement the information exchange. 40. The Australian and legal divisions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have been consulted extensively with regards to the most appropriate international instrument to bring the information exchange into effect. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 41. Inland Revenue’s recommendation is for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to enter into an Arrangement with the Commissioner of Taxation (Australia). This option meets all of the objectives outlined above. 42. The Arrangement solidifies the intention for Australia to assist New Zealand in the recovery of its student loan debt through an information-exchange facility (objective (b)). 43. The status of the Arrangement allows the exchange of information to become operational pending the enactment of legislation to allow information to be shared between Australia and New Zealand for this purpose. The information-exchange mechanism is expected to become operational in the second half of 2016 (objective (d)). 44. The Arrangement supports a one-way information exchange between Australia and New Zealand to assist New Zealand in the recovery of its student loan debt held in Australia. However, the nature of an Arrangement means that it is able to be amended in the future for the purpose of supporting a reciprocal information exchange (objective (e)). 45. This service is to be provided on a cost-recovery basis. Australian officials have provided Inland Revenue with an indicative cost of $1,143,600 (AUD) over five years. The results of the test match indicate that the ATO is a reliable source of information on New Zealand borrowers based in Australia (objective (c)). 46. Entering into an Arrangement is considered to be preferable to the status quo because it ultimately supports an information exchange with the ATO to assist in the recovery of New Zealand student loan debt (objective (a)), while the status quo does not support this. IMPLEMENTATION 47. The Arrangement is required to be signed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the Commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office. 8 48. In order for the exchange of information facility to be operational, legislation will need to be passed in both Australia and New Zealand to allow for the relevant sharing of information. In New Zealand, legislative amendments would need to be made to secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Further amendments would be required, which could be included in either the Tax Administration Act 1994 or the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. Those amendments could be included in a student loan scheme bill, scheduled for introduction in the second half of 2015. 49. Following the approval of the Arrangement, a service-level arrangement will be drafted between Australian and New Zealand officials. This document will govern the operational details of how the information exchange will be carried out, and it will be able to be amended where necessary to ensure efficient operation of the information-exchange mechanism. 50. The Arrangement includes guidelines for the use of information. Specific operational details of the handling of information and appropriate safeguards will be included in the service-level arrangement. 51. Broadly, the exchange of information is intended to work as follows: at the request of the New Zealand Central Authority1, the Australian Central Authority will take all appropriate steps to provide directly to the requesting Central Authority, as promptly as possible, any information it holds on: • the most recent residential address of a student loan borrower; and • the contact information for a student loan borrower. 52. Inland Revenue will then use the contact details in normal student loan collection processes for overseas-based borrowers. 53. An impact assessment has been completed within Inland Revenue. This assessment indicates that the administrative impacts of this proposal are likely to be minimal. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 54. The Arrangement provides that Central Authorities may carry out an annual review of the Arrangement, and additionally may review the whole or part of the Arrangement at the request of either Central Authority. This is outlined in paragraph 10 of the Arrangement. 55. Once this proposal is operational, its results and evaluation will be included as part of quarterly reporting on the overseas-based borrower compliance initiative to the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment and the Minister of Revenue. 1 The New Zealand Central Authority refers to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or a person authorised by the Commissioner. The Australian Central Authority refers to the Commissioner of Taxation or a person authorised by the Commissioner. 9
Chris Gillion Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 23 June 2015 Regulatory Impact Statement Charitable organisations for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to provide student loan borrowers working overseas for a charitable organisation better access to an interest write-off on their loan. This policy ensures that the differing treatment with regards to interest for New Zealand-based and overseas- based borrowers does not affect a borrower’s decision to volunteer for a charitable organisation overseas. To assess the likely administrative and fiscal impacts, assumptions have been made about the numbers of expected applications from charitable organisations and borrowers seeking an interest write-off. These are based on the number of applications received in previous years and further assumptions about the volumes of applications if the preferred option is implemented. The amount of interest foregone is approximate, based on average loan balance and the current interest rate. These assumptions do not materially affect the analysis in this RIS. Officials consulted on details of the preferred option with other government agencies, in particular with the Ministry of Education, the Treasury, the Department of Internal Affairs’ Charities Services, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Social Development. No public consultation was carried out in respect of the preferred option. Due to the difficulty and cost involved in identifying individuals and organisations that might be affected from the change in process, and the expected benefit from consulting widely, it was considered that a full public consultation process and its associated costs would have been disproportionate to the expected benefits and the magnitude of the impact. The preferred option will require a legislative amendment to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (and a consequential amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007). The required legislation could be included in the student loan scheme bill which is scheduled for introduction in the second half of this year. None of the proposed options are expected to impair private property rights, reduce market competition, or override common law principles. The preferred option does not involve any additional compliance costs on businesses or charitable organisations. STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Background 1. Student loan borrowers who are New Zealand-based do not pay interest on their student loans, while overseas-based borrowers do. There are some circumstances where an overseas- based borrower may be treated as New Zealand-based and therefore eligible for the interest write-off. 2. An overseas-based borrower may apply to be treated as New Zealand-based and receive the interest write-off when they are volunteering or working for token payment for an approved charitable organisation for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 (“the Act”). This policy aims to ensure that interest does not create a disincentive for borrowers wishing to volunteer overseas. 3. The policy was intended to ensure that only students working for bona fide charitable organisations would benefit from the concessionary treatment. It pre-dated implementation of the Charities Act 2005, and the introduction of Charities Commission register in February 2007 which introduced more rigorous requirements for the registration of charities. 4. To qualify as a charitable organisation for the purposes of the Act, the organisation must be listed in the Student Loan Scheme (Charitable Organisations) Regulations 2011 (the Regulations). If not listed, the organisation must apply for inclusion in the Regulations and provide evidence that it meets criteria established by the Government when the policy was introduced in 2006. To benefit from the interest write-off, each borrower must make an individual application to Inland Revenue with evidence their volunteer work meets requirements specified in Schedule 1 of the Act.1 5. The Regulations are also used in defining the eligibility for KiwiSaver member tax credits. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, KiwiSaver members are eligible for member tax credits provided they are working overseas as a volunteer or for token payment for a charitable organisation named in the Regulations. Status quo - the current process 6. The current process for a charitable organisation to obtain approval for the purposes of the Act involves Inland Revenue’s assessment against the criteria set out below in paragraphs 7-8. Once assessed, the charities must then be submitted to Cabinet and approved to be added to the Regulations via Order in Council. 7. In March 2006, the Government established the following criteria for listing charitable organisations in the Regulations: • The organisation must carry on charitable activities\* 2 and be established for charitable purposes; and • It must have been established and operating for at least two years. ^ A borrower must provide the Commissioner with evidence the work they are doing is for the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness, or the ravages of war or natural disaster, or improving either the economy or educational standards of a country which is on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s list of countries receiving development assistance. 2 The borrower must also provide evidence as specified in footnote 1, which limits the borrower to a subset of charitable activities in order to be eligible for the interest write-off. 2 8. In addition consideration should be given to: • the credibility of the organisation (with the presence in at least five countries being an indication of the organisation’s credibility); • the not-for-profit status of the organisation; • whether it has recognised record keeping • whether it is publicly accountable • the monitoring and evaluation processes it has in place; and • whether it has a New Zealand base (but this is not a determinative criterion). 9. The requirement for a charity to be listed in Regulations, combined with the length of time it takes to add a charitable organisation, can mean a borrower who meets the policy intent is denied access to the interest write-off. 10. As noted earlier, for an individual borrower to be entitled to an interest write-off, they must make an application to Inland Revenue with evidence that they are working for an approved charitable organisation and carrying out work that meets criteria specified in Schedule 1 of the Act3 Problem definition 11. The current process for approving charitable organisations is inefficient, as it does not always meet the policy intent of providing interest relief for borrowers volunteering overseas for a charitable organisation. There is also a duplication of processes which are already in place for assessing charities for an income tax exemption. 12. One of the five most common reasons a borrower’s individual application for an interest write-off is denied is that the charitable organisation is not listed in the Regulations at the time the borrower is volunteering overseas. This can be partially attributed to the slow process involved in adding an organisation to the Regulations. 13. It is helpful to illustrate the steps in the current process and how this may impact on a borrower gaining access to the interest write-off provision. Of particular concern is the situation where an organisation is only prompted to apply to be an approved charitable organisation for the purposes of the Act because one or more of their prospective or current volunteers has a student loan. When an organisation applies to Inland Revenue, it must be assessed against the criteria set out in paragraphs 7-8. This often involves correspondence between Inland Revenue and the organisation to gather the appropriate information to support their application. Once Inland Revenue is satisfied the organisation meets the criteria, it is recommended to Ministers, and subsequently Cabinet, for approval. Following Cabinet approval, an Order in Council can take a minimum of 4 weeks to draft, depending on the Parliamentary Counsel Office’s availability. The Order in Council must be presented to the Cabinet Legislation Committee before a second approval by Cabinet and signing by the Governor General. An Order in Council cannot come into effect earlier than 28 days after date of publication in the Gazette. 3 See footnote 1 3 OBJECTIVES 14. The objectives are to: (a) provide an interest write-off to borrowers who are volunteering overseas for charitable purposes (b) have an efficient and timely process for assessing a charitable organisation’s application for charitable status (c) reduce administration costs for Inland Revenue (d) reduce compliance costs for charitable organisations (e) ensure integrity of the process and mitigate abuse of the interest write-off provision. 15. The key objective, objective (a), reflects the original policy intent, which was to ensure student loan interest did not deter borrowers from volunteering with charitable organisations overseas. The remaining objectives concern the efficiency and effectiveness of the process. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 16. Three options were considered to address the problem identified above: retaining the status quo, delegating the authority for approval of organisations to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, and backdating the effective approval date of the charitable organisations. Option one - status quo 17. The status quo is to continue the current process, which is set out in paragraphs 6-10. The authority to approve charitable organisations would remain with Cabinet. As a consequence, there would continue to be a delay, as outlined in paragraph 13, between when an organisation applies to be a charitable organisation for the purposes of the Act and when the Order in Council comes into effect, adding it to the Regulations. 18. All charities seeking to be included in the Regulations and therefore be a charitable organisation for the purposes of the Act will continue to be required to apply to Inland Revenue and provide information in support of the criteria outlined in paragraphs 7-8. Option two - Delegate the authority for the approval of charitable organisations to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (Officials’ preferred option) 19. Option two would involve the delegation of authority to approve charitable organisations for the purposes of the Act to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Once approved, a charity will be added to a list of charitable organisations for the purposes of the Act (“the approved list”). Such a list is already published on Inland Revenue’s website. 20. The Commissioner could utilise current process for the assessment of charities for income tax exemptions and therefore reduce the duplication of assessing a charity separately for the purposes of income tax and the student loan scheme. It is proposed that the Commissioner will automatically approve charities that are registered with Charities Services, or already approved by Inland Revenue for an exemption from income tax. 4 21. Charities that are already registered with Charities Services would not be required to apply to Inland Revenue for inclusion in the list, because their charitable status will have already been established through the Charities Services process. Similarly if a charity has already been assessed and approved by Inland Revenue for an exemption from income tax, the charity will be automatically added to the approved list for the purposes of the Act4. 22. Under this proposal, when a borrower volunteering for an organisation that already has charitable status with Charities Services, or has been approved by Inland Revenue for an income tax exemption, applies to Inland Revenue for the interest write-off, the organisation will automatically be approved and consequently added to the approved list. 23. Charities that are not registered with Charities Services, or approved by Inland Revenue for an income tax exemption, will still be required to apply to Inland Revenue. However, the process is likely to be quicker, as the charity will be able to be immediately added to the approved list once Inland Revenue has completed the assessment. This is unlike the current process, which requires two Cabinet approvals and the subsequent Order in Council to come into effect before the charitable organisation is added to the approved list. 24. Those charities referred to in paragraph 23, will be assessed against the existing criteria set out in paragraphs 7 - 8 with the exception of the two year rule. To ensure consistency with the criteria used by Charities Services and by Inland Revenue when assessing charities for an income tax exemption, the requirement of a charity having been established and operating for two years could be removed for charities that apply and are assessed on the existing criteria. 25. This option would also decrease compliance costs for applicant organisations, as those that are already registered with Charities Services or approved by Inland Revenue for an exemption from income tax will not be required to provide additional documentation to Inland Revenue to support their application. 26. The application requirements and process for individual borrowers would not change. To qualify for the interest write-off, a borrower will still be required to provide Inland Revenue with evidence that they are volunteering for a charitable organisation and carrying out work specified in Schedule 1 of the Act5. 27. It is proposed that the Commissioner would also have the authority to remove a charitable organisation from the approved list if she becomes aware that the organisation no longer meets the charitable criteria, such as when the organisation has been de-registered by Charities Services. This will increase the integrity of the approved list by mitigating the risk of borrowers working for charities that no longer meet the criteria. 28. The removal of an organisation from the approved list will not affect the eligibility of borrowers to an interest write-off if they volunteered for the organisation during the time period that the organisation was on the approved list. 4 Charities registered with Charities Services are automatically approved for an income tax exemption, and Inland Revenue follows Charities Services criteria when independently assessing an organisation for an income tax exemption. 5 See footnote 1 5 Option three - Change rules around effective date 29. Another option considered would be to retain the Cabinet approval process but change the rules around the effective date that an organisation becomes a charitable organisation for the puiposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and is added to the approved list. This would potentially involve retrospective legislation. 30. This could allow for the approval to be backdated to the beginning of the tax year or to another earlier specified time from which Inland Revenue and Cabinet are satisfied the organisation meets the charitable criteria. 31. This would give more borrowers access to the interest write-off. Charitable organisations would still be required to apply to Inland Revenue and provide information to support their application in line with the criteria set out in paragraphs 7-8. The time delay outlined in paragraph 13 would still occur, however this delay would be less likely to restrict a borrower’s access to the interest write-off as they could still be able to claim an interest write off dependent on the effective date. 32. To ensure the charitable organisation met the criteria at the earlier point in time, Inland Revenue may need additional information from the organisation, potentially increasing compliance costs. In addition, detennining the effective start date and applying a date retrospectively would be more complex to administer. 6 33. This table summarises our impact assessment of the options.

Does not address the problem definition. Option two — delegate the authority for the approval of charitable organisations to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue a, b, c, d, e Negative. Expected to result in more applications for interest write-off being accepted, with interest foregone of approximately $1,000 per student per year6. Estimated to be $30,000 interest forgone per year7. Overall expected to decrease. Reduce administration costs for Inland Revenue in processing applications. There will be a small administrative cost for Inland Revenue in moving from a non-disputable to a disputable decision. Reduce administration cost for Cabinet and reduce use of Cabinet time. Reduction in compliance costs for charitable organisations - those already registered with Charities Services or approved by Inland Revenue for income tax exemption are automatically accepted. Increase support to borrowers volunteering for an overseas charitable organisation. Potentially some time delays if organisations that are not automatically approved are slow to provide necessary infonnation. Overall positive, as allows better access to interest write-off in line with the policy intent. Reduction in administrative costs mitigates, and potentially outweighs, small fiscal cost. Objectives: (a) provide an interest write-off to borrowers who are volunteering overseas for charitable purposes (b) have an efficient and timely process for approving a charitable organisation applying for charitable status (c) reduce administration costs for Inland Revenue (d) reduce compliance costs for charitable organisations (e) ensure integrity of the process and mitigate abuse of the interest write-off provision 6 Based on the average loan balance held by Inland Revenue at 30 June 2014 of $19,731 and the current interest rate of 5.3% p.a 7 This estimate is based on the following assumptions about borrower applications: 25% increase in the number of applications currently approved (one of the top 5 reasons a borrower’s application is currently declined is due to the borrower working for a charity that is not currently approved), and an increase in the number of individual applications by 30% (using the year with the highest volume of borrower applications and assuming all new applications are also approved). 7 O p tio n sD o es it m eet th e Im p a c ts o b je c tiv e s (a , b , c , d , e)?

Expected to result in more applications for interest write-off being accepted (but less so than option 2). Small increase in administration costs for Inland Revenue. Extra decision involved in deciding what effective date should apply for each organisation. Small increase in compliance costs - may increase the information some organisations are required to provide to Inland Revenue to support application. Increase support to borrowers volunteering for overseas charitable organisations. Potentially some time delays if organisations that are not automatically approved are slow to provide necessary information. Small positive effect; likely to give rise to greater access to interest write-off for borrowers volunteering overseas. Objectives: (a) provide an interest write-off to borrowers who are volunteering overseas for charitable purposes (b) have an efficient and timely process for approving a charitable organisation applying for charitable status (c) reduce administration costs for Inland Revenue (d) reduce compliance costs for charitable organisations (e) ensure integrity of the process and mitigate abuse of the interest write-off provision 8 CONSULTATION 34. The following agencies were consulted on option two and support the proposal: the Ministry of Education, the Treasury, the Department of Internal Affairs’ Charities Services, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Social Development. 35. The Ministry of Education raised a concern around organisations which might cease to become charitable remaining on the approved list. To address this concern, officials recommend that the Commissioner is also given the power to remove a charitable organisation from the approved list if she becomes aware that it no longer meets the criteria. 36. There was no public consultation carried out in respect of option two. This decision not to consult was made in consideration of the difficulty and cost involved in identifying individuals and organisations that might be affected from the change in process, and the likely (marginal) benefit from consulting widely. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 37. Inland Revenue recommends proceeding with option two - delegating authority to approve charitable organisations for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 38. This proposal meets all five objectives. An interest write-off is provided to borrowers who are working for a charitable organisation overseas and who meet specified criteria, which meets the original policy intent as reflected in objective (a). 39. Objective (b) is achieved, as the process removes the requirement for Cabinet to approve each charitable organisation and the subsequent addition to the Regulations by Order in Council. 40. The delegation of authority to the Commissioner also reduces administration costs for Inland Revenue, as there would be automatic approval of charitable organisations that are already registered with Charities Services or approved by Inland Revenue for an income tax exemption (objective (c)). This will decrease the duplication of assessing charities separately for income tax and student loan scheme purposes. 41. The automatic approval and removal of the requirement for charitable organisations to apply if they are already registered with Charities Services also reduces compliance costs for many charitable organisations, achieving objective (d). 42. The integrity of the approved list is maintained (objective (e)) by giving the Commissioner the authority to remove a charity if she becomes aware it no longer meets the criteria. This will apply to any charity on the approved list. 43. Options one and three also achieve objective (a) and (e), as they both continue to provide an interest write-off to borrowers working overseas for volunteer organisations and use the existing criteria for inclusion in the Regulations. 9 44. Option three allows backdating of the effective date that the organisation is deemed charitable for the purposes of the Act, which makes the process more effective in providing eligible borrowers with access to the interest write-off, and therefore partially meets objective (b). However, option three does not meet objectives (c) or (d) and may increase the administration costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs of charitable organisations. IMPLEMENTATION 45. To implement option two, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue could assess charitable organisations that apply to be a charitable organisation for the purposes of the Act in the following way: i. Automatic approval: Charitable organisations that are already registered with Charities Services, or independently approved by Inland Revenue for exemptions from income tax, would be automatically approved for the purposes of the Act. ii. Consideration under existing criteria: Applications from other charitable organisations would be processed by Inland Revenue and considered in accordance with the existing criteria set out in paragraphs 7 -8 (without the need to be established and operating for two years). 46. To ensure consistency of the criteria used for the organisations automatically approved with those charities individually assessed for the purposes of the Act, the requirement of a charity having been established for two years could be removed for charities that apply and are assessed on the existing criteria. 47. Charitable organisations already listed in the Regulations will automatically be added to the new approved list at the time when the Regulations are revoked. These charities will not need to be re-assessed in order to be included on the approved list which replaces the Regulations. The approved list will continue to be published on Inland Revenue’s website. 48. Decisions on registration of resident charitable organisations with Charities Services in accordance with the Charities Act 2005 are made by an independent Charities Registration Board. The Board tests each application against a set of nine criteria, which are intended to provide assurance that the organisation operates in accordance with the Charities Act 2005, meets minimum standards of reporting, and is publicly accountable. Each of the officers in a registered charity must also be qualified as an officer under the Charities Act 2005. 49. Charities Services tests applications for registration of non-resident charitable organisations against the same criteria, but the organisation must also demonstrate a strong connection with New Zealand. 50. The charitable organisations that are registered in accordance with paragraphs 48 and 49 are automatically accepted by Inland Revenue as eligible for an exemption from income tax. However, Inland Revenue also has an internal process for assessing applications for income tax exemptions from non-resident charitable organisations that are unable to be registered by Charities Services because they cannot demonstrate a sufficient connection with New Zealand. 10 51. An organisation will be able to dispute the Commissioner’s decision to decline adding a charity to the approved list. Where possible this will use existing processes in place - for example, the disputes resolution process provided for in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 52. The necessary legislative amendments to bring option two into effect could be included in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Bill planned for introduction in October of this year. It will be necessary to concurrently revoke the Student Loan Scheme (Charitable Organisations) Regulations 2011. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 53. In general, Inland Revenue’s monitoring, evaluating and reviewing of new legislation takes place takes under the GTPP. The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would be prioritised in the context of the current Tax Policy Work Programme, and any proposals would go through the GTPP. 11
Regulatory Impact Statement Options for optimising the effectiveness of the bright-line test Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis o f options for optimising the effectiveness and the integrity o f the “bright-line test” proposed in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill. On 14 May 2015, the Government announced plans to introduce a bright-line test to buttress the “intention test” in the current land sale rules. The proposed bright-line test would require income tax to be paid on any gains from the disposal o f residential land that is acquired and disposed o f within two years, subject to some exceptions. The Government also announced plans to investigate the introduction o f a withholding tax to collect revenue arising under the bright-line test. The analysis in this RIS was informed by public feedback on proposals contained in the officials’ issues paper Residential land withholding tax, which was released on 31 August 2015, and further discussions with practitioners involved in the conveyancing process. The issues paper proposed the introduction o f a withholding tax to collect revenue on gains from the sale o f residential property to improve compliance with the bright-line test. The preferred option is to introduce a withholding tax, similar to that proposed in the officials’ issues paper. It is designed primarily as a collection mechanism for the proposed bright-line test and so is not intended to raise Crown Revenue. As the preferred option would apply to a subset o f bright-line sales, it would collect a portion o f revenue arising under the bright-line test. The exact fiscal and compliance cost figures for the proposed bright-line test are not available because Inland Revenue does not currently have accurate data on the types and levels o f land sales occurring or how much is collected under the current land sale rules. The data for these areas is expected to improve as new information disclosure requirements for property come into force and Inland Revenue implements a new form to better monitor taxable land sales. The analysis in this RIS needs to be considered in light o f the additional constraint faced by Inland Revenue at the present time, which is its inability to make significant systems changes in advance o f the relevant stage o f development o f its Business Transformation programme. This proposal has been subject to public consultation and the design features take a number o f these comments into account. However, owing to time constraints, the time provided for submissions was slightly shorter than the time ordinarily provided under the Generic Tax Policy Process. Further, the time between receiving submissions and reporting on the final design was compressed. As a result, we cannot be sure that the nature and scale o f the 1 impacts and any potential unintended effects o f the proposal have been fully considered in this analysis. We note that the Bill will be subject to a public consultation process as part o f consideration by Select Committee. Carmel Peters Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 09 November 2015 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The Government is concerned with high house prices, particularly in the Auckland area. Other possible causes, both on the supply and demand sides, are being separately considered, but property speculation is seen as one o f a number o f causes o f the current prices. The attractiveness o f property speculation, when compared with other forms o f investment increases, if the gains are able to be realised untaxed, when gains from other investments are taxed. 2. The main change arising from the Budget 2015 property measures is the proposed introduction o f a “bright-line” test that will require income tax to be paid on any gains from the sale o f residential property that is bought and sold within two years, with some exceptions. 3. The purpose o f the bright-line test is to supplement the “intention test” in the current land sale rules. The intention test makes gains from the sale o f real property purchased with an intention o f disposal taxable. The intention test can be challenging to enforce due to the difficulty in proving a person’s intention upon acquisition, which is a subjective test. The bright-line test is intended to deal with the problem by supplementing the intention test with an objective test. 4. If enacted, the bright-line test will generally apply to property acquired under an agreement for sale and purchase entered into on or after 1 October 2015. Legislation for the proposed bright-line test is included in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill. 5. In addition to these measures, the Government announced that it would investigate the introduction o f a withholding tax for non-residents sellers to collect revenue arising under the bright-line test. The Government directed Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to develop a withholding tax that could be implemented by mid-2016 to improve compliance with the bright-line test. 6. This regulatory impact statement deals with the question o f how to optimise the effectiveness o f the bright-line test and support the integrity o f the new rules. Compliance with tax obligations 7. New Zealand taxes its tax residents on their worldwide income. New Zealand also taxes foreign investors on income that is sourced in New Zealand. When a foreign investor has a branch or controls a subsidiary in New Zealand, tax can be imposed on the New Zealand-sourced income o f that branch or subsidiary in the same way as it would be on New Zealanders. However, when the foreign investor does not have a New Zealand presence, it is more difficult for New Zealand to collect tax from them. 8. New Zealand’s tax system operates on the principle o f voluntary compliance, which relies on taxpayers understanding their tax obligations and how the wider tax system works. 9. Foreign investors may not always have the same level o f understanding as taxpayers based in New Zealand, and they do not have the same level o f connection to New Zealand that would otherwise create an intrinsic incentive to voluntarily comply with their New Zealand tax obligations. 3 10. While voluntary compliance is an important feature o f New Zealand’s tax system, withholding taxes are imposed on many types o f income where there is likely to be a tax liability and there is the possibility o f unenforceability or evasion. Withholding taxes are important in these situations because they ensure that the relevant tax is paid out o f the amount due to the payee before the payee gets control o f the funds. Under New Zealand’s tax rules, the Commissioner o f Inland Revenue (the Commissioner) has the ability to impose penalties on taxpayers who knowingly fail to deduct withholding tax from a payment they have made and on those who have withheld tax for any purpose other than for payment to the Commissioner. 11. Existing withholding taxes in the New Zealand tax system include withholding taxes on: • employment income; • interest and dividends; • payments to certain contractors (including special rules for non-resident contractors, entertainers and insurers); and • distributions from trusts. 12. In these situations, it is likely that the payee will have a New Zealand tax liability in relation to the income they receive, and in order to ensure the satisfaction o f that liability, tax on that income is withheld before the payee receives the income. 13. The Commissioner also has a number o f powers to enforce the tax obligations o f taxpayers to assist in the collection o f taxes.1 One concern is that these measures are not always administratively practical or effective when the taxpayer has no presence in New Zealand. 14. New Zealand can request help to collect tax from foreign investors from overseas revenue authorities under its various international agreements, including the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, bilateral double tax agreements and tax information exchange agreements. These agreements allow for the exchange o f tax-related information and assistance in the collection o f taxes. While these are useful tools in enabling the Government to collect tax, they are a backstop and should not be the primary tool. 15. We are not able to quantify the size o f the problem. This is because to date, Inland Revenue has not had access to detailed information about compliance with the existing land sale rules. However, information collection measures introduced in the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 will provide more useful information to Inland Revenue about land sales in the future. This information will enable Inland Revenue to have better information about compliance with the land sale rules and in particular, the proposed bright-line test. The Commissioner may impose a number of monetary penalties, including, for example, late filing, shortfall, and late payment penalties. The Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out when and at what rates such penalties may be charged. This ensures that penalties for breaches of tax obligations are imposed impartially and consistently, at a level that is proportionate to the seriousness of the breach. In addition, the Commissioner has powers available to recover amounts of unpaid tax. These powers include requiring deductions from payments made to the defaulter by any other person, and court action. 4 OBJECTIVES 16. The objective is to both optimise the effectiveness and support the integrity o f the proposed new bright-line test. 17. Optimising the effectiveness o f the bright-line test involves maximising compliance with the new bright-line test, having regard to other factors such as compliance and administrative costs. 18. Supporting the integrity o f the new bright-line test (which, if enacted, will form part o f the tax system) is important in ensuring that New Zealand’s tax system can effectively rely on the principle o f voluntary compliance. The “integrity o f the tax system” is defined in section 6 o f the Tax Administration Act 1994 as including (among other factors) the responsibilities o f taxpayers to comply with the law, and taxpayer perceptions o f the integrity o f the tax system. 19. In addition to the stated objective, the fiscal, economic, administrative, compliance, and fairness impacts o f each feasible option will be assessed. 20. The fiscal impact is the likely effect o f a given option on Crown Revenue. The bright- line test has been forecasted to raise approximately $5 million per year. As this analysis is targeted at optimising the effectiveness o f the bright-line test, none o f the feasible options identified and analysed in this statement are intended or expected to raise revenue, but may lend themselves to collecting a portion o f the $5 million. The $5 million per annum figure forecasted for the bright-line test is based on a number o f behavioural assumptions, which are inherently difficult to quantify, such as the number o f sales that would be delayed in order to exceed the two-year holding period. The actual revenue collected under the two-year bright- line test may be significantly more if the behavioural responses are different to those assumed. 21. The economic impact o f each feasible option will also be assessed, in particular, whether compliance with New Zealand’s tax rules more generally may be affected and whether there may be possible flow-on effects in the residential housing market given that the proposed bright-line test is targeted at short-term churn and speculation in residential housing. The bright-line test has already been identified as creating a “lock-in” effect as people will have an incentive to hold onto property for longer than two years - this is an economic distortion as people may not undergo efficient transactions due to the bright-line test. The economic impact o f each option identified in the regulatory impact analysis is over and above that o f the proposed bright-line test. 22. An important component o f any recommended approach is the administrative impact. Thus, the impact analysis o f the feasible options includes whether, and to what extent, a particular option requires changes to systems in order to administer it, for example, whether changes are required to Inland Revenue’s computer systems or other processes, and/or whether a particular option requires the use o f additional resources to implement a solution or identify and investigate cases o f non-compliance. 23. Conversely, the recommended approach should not unduly impose compliance costs, although some compliance costs are to be expected. The regulatory impact statement Bright- line test for sales of residential property noted that the bright-line test would increase compliance costs for those whose sales o f residential property were not previously taxable under the intention test as they would be required to start accounting for income tax on their property sales. The compliance impacts identified in the impact analysis are over and above those identified for the proposed bright-line test. 5 24. As noted previously, New Zealand’s tax system operates on the principle o f voluntary compliance, which relies on taxpayers understanding their tax obligations and how the wider tax system works. Where there is unfairness or a perception o f unfairness present in the tax system, people may be less willing to voluntarily comply with their tax obligations, which may undermine the integrity o f the New Zealand tax system. Fairness (and the perception o f fairness) is accordingly an important part o f the principles underpinning the integrity o f the tax system. As the New Zealand tax system relies heavily on people voluntarily complying with their tax obligations, we consider that the fairness impacts o f any feasible option are significant in determining whether the option meets the stated objective. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 25. We note that the identification and analysis o f a full range o f practical options to achieve the Government’s stated objective has been constrained by a number o f factors: • time available for policy design and consultation; and • Inland Revenue’s need to limit the amount o f significant or complex changes within its legacy systems in advance o f the relevant stage o f development o f its Business Transformation programme. 26. Further, the Government directed Treasury and Inland Revenue officials to develop a withholding tax to improve compliance with the bright-line test. 27. However, to assess whether the design o f a withholding tax folly meets the stated objective, we have also evaluated the Commissioner’s current tools for collection and other possible non-regulatory approaches to determine whether they may also be appropriate for optimising the effectiveness and integrity o f the proposed bright-line test. 28. Four options for optimising the effectiveness and integrity o f the bright-line test are considered below: • Option 1: Rely on existing compliance measures (the status quo); • Option 2: Status quo, but provide more guidance on tax obligations; • Option 3: Status quo, but review effectiveness o f bright-line test in three to four years; and • Option 4: Introduce a withholding tax on sales o f residential property made within the two-year bright-line period that: (a) is restricted to instances where the seller is an offshore person; (b) applies to all sellers. 29. Options 1-3 are non-regulatory responses, while option 4 is a regulatory response that would require both administrative and legislative changes. 30. Option 4 is divided into two possible approaches, with option 4(a) applying in instances where the seller o f residential property is an “offshore person”, and option 4(b) applying to all sellers regardless o f their onshore/offshore status. We consider that these two differences in scope to be significant enough to warrant undertaking a foil impact analysis for each approach. The overall effectiveness o f both options 4(a) and 4(b) are dependent on a number o f key design features. These features are discussed in further detail in the section titled Further analysis of option 4 - detailed design issues. Our recommendations regarding these design issues have informed our impact analysis on option 4. Option 1: Rely on existing compliance measures (the status quo) 6 31. This option would require no legislative amendment and would instead rely on the Commissioner’s existing tools for collection and enforcement, which we have outlined above and have also summarised below. It would also rely on the standard “business-as-usual” response to new legislation outlined in the regulatory impact statement Bright-line test for sales of residential property - this will include updating forms and communication material. To assist in the implementation o f the bright-line test, Inland Revenue is also developing a new attachment to income tax returns. 32. As discussed in the regulatory impact statement Bright-line test for sales of residential property, one o f the concerns with the “intention test” in the current land sale rules is that it is difficult for the Commissioner to enforce due to difficulties in establishing intent and the high volume and chum o f residential property sales. The proposed bright-line test is designed to be an unambiguous and objective test. This in itself would improve compliance with, and the enforceability of, the land sale rules in the Income Tax Act 2007. 33. The status quo would be problematic from an enforcement perspective. The Commissioner has a number o f tools available to assist in the collection o f taxes, for example, late filing, late payment and shortfall penalties. In addition, the Commissioner has powers available to recover amounts o f unpaid tax. These powers include requiring deductions from payments made to the defaulter by any other person, and court action. However, where the taxpayer has no presence or other assets in New Zealand, these tools and powers are not always administratively practical or effective. 34. Note that in situations where there is the possibility o f unenforceability or evasion o f a tax liability, withholding taxes are commonly imposed before the payee receives the income. Withholding taxes are important in these situations because they ensure that the relevant tax is paid out o f the amount due to the payee before the payee gets control o f the funds. This is discussed in further detail in the section titled Status quo and problem definition. However, in the case o f residential property sales, the Commissioner’s current tools for collection and enforcement do not include a withholding tax. 35. New Zealand can request help to collect tax from foreign investors from overseas revenue authorities under its various international agreements, including the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, and bilateral double tax agreements and tax information exchange agreements. These agreements allow for the exchange o f tax-related information and assistance in the collection o f taxes. While these are useful tools in enabling the Government to collect tax, they should only act as a backstop. 36. Inland Revenue does not have detailed data about the compliance o f non-residents with their New Zealand tax obligations on their New Zealand-sourced income. However, there is anecdotal evidence that compliance with the land sale rules to date has been low, particularly in relation to non-residents. New information collection and reporting measures introduced from 1 October 2015 regarding residential land sales should provide better quality information in the future, but using this data to form views about compliance rates and trends regarding the proposed bright-line test will not he possible for several years. 37. Option 1 is not Inland Revenue’s preferred option. It would make the tax system less coherent as a whole, given that withholding taxes are required in relation to other forms o f income in similar circumstances (that is, where a payee is likely to have a tax liability and where there may be enforceability or evasion concerns). The absence o f a withholding tax as part o f the Commissioner’s current tools for collection and enforcement is not practical where 7 the taxpayer has limited or no presence in New Zealand, which is where voluntary compliance with New Zealand’s tax rules is less likely to occur. There is also a strong risk that this could create a perception that foreign investors are not paying their “fair share o f tax” in relation to income derived from residential land, and that their tax obligations are not being sufficiently enforced, thereby undermining the integrity o f the tax system. Option 2: status quo, but provide more information guidance on tax obligations in relation to residential property 38. This option is a non-regulatory response that is similar to option 1, but in addition to the Commissioner’s existing powers for collection and the standard “business-as-usual” response to new legislation, it would also involve additional information being provided and education campaigns being run in an effort to boost levels o f voluntary compliance in relation to the new bright-line test (and potentially the other land sale rules). 39. Targeted education campaigns have been utilised by Inland Revenue in the past to deliver messages regarding significant changes to the tax system and to ensure those affected understand their obligations, for example in the child support area. 40. A similar strategy could be used for the proposed bright-line test, with the level o f detail o f the information provided and the medium dependent on the target audience. 41. However, a major limitation with this approach is that it requires in-depth knowledge o f the appropriate medium in other jurisdictions to best ensure that the appropriate audiences are covered. As previously mentioned, Inland Revenue does not currently have access to detailed information about land sales in New Zealand. Information collection measures introduced in the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 and the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 will provide more useful information to Inland Revenue about land sales in the future. However, in order to be able to understand characteristics o f and patterns surrounding residential land sales, for example, the country o f residence o f those involved, the data over the medium term will need to be evaluated to ensure effective targeting. 42. In addition, the success o f this option is dependent on another major assumption - that non-compliance with the proposed bright-line test will arise from a lack o f information and knowledge about the tax implications o f sales o f residential land. There will be instances where an improved understanding o f the tax rules and one’s tax obligations in relation to a particular transaction may lead to higher levels o f compliance. However, there will be taxpayers who, regardless o f their level o f knowledge, will not voluntarily comply with their tax obligations. 43. As noted in option 1, the Commissioner’s standard tools for collection and enforcement in relation to general income tax liabilities are not always practical where the taxpayer has limited or no presence in New Zealand. As a result, withholding taxes are commonly imposed in other situations where there is the possibility o f unenforceability or evasion o f a tax liability, before the payee receives the income. Withholding taxes are important in these situations because they ensure that the relevant tax is paid out o f the amount due to the payee before the payee gets control o f the funds. This is discussed in further detail in the section titled Status quo and problem definition. However, in the case o f residential property sales, the Commissioner’s current tools for collection and enforcement do not include a withholding tax. 8 44. Option 2 is not preferred. As noted in option 1, the absence o f a withholding tax would make the tax system less coherent as a whole given that withholding taxes are required in relation to other forms o f income in similar circumstances (that is, where a payee is likely to have a tax liability and where there may be enforceability or evasion concerns). Further, while option 2 may assist in increasing taxpayers’ awareness and understanding o f their tax obligations in relation to residential property sales, it will not increase compliance with the proposed bright-line test in instances where voluntary compliance is unlikely to occur regardless o f the extent o f taxpayer education. It would also require the use o f Inland Revenue resources to implement. Option 3: status quo, but assess levels of compliance with the bright-line test in three to four years 45. This option is also similar to option 1 in that it relies on the Commissioner’s existing powers for collection and enforcement and the standard “business-as-usual” response to new legislation, but it also introduces an explicit requirement that the effectiveness o f the proposed bright-line test be reviewed in three to four years (when it is expected that those who purchased on 1 October 2015 or shortly after, and sold at or prior to the two-year mark, to file their income tax return). 46. Some submissions on the officials’ issues paper Residential land withholding tax expressed concern that until Inland Revenue has undergone its Business Transformation Programme, it would be unable implement an effective and efficient withholding tax. These submissions therefore recommended delaying the implementation o f a withholding tax on income derived from sales o f residential property, and Inland Revenue should first conduct a review o f the effectiveness o f the proposed bright-line test. 47. The review o f the effectiveness o f the proposed bright-line test under this option would involve analysing data on land sales collected under the new Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 and the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015 and identifying areas o f risk and non- compliance. Identification o f specific areas o f non-compliance would allow for better targeting o f Inland Revenue’s resources. 48. In addition, the resulting analysis could assist in determining whether a separate regulatory response to optimise the effectiveness o f the proposed bright-line test is, in fact, required. It may also provide useful information for shaping the scope o f any regulatory response, such as a withholding tax, which has been identified as a feasible option in options 4(a) and 4(b). 49. One advantage o f this approach is that it may turn out that the Commissioner’s current powers for collection and enforcement are sufficient in ensuring high levels o f compliance with the proposed bright-line test. Conversely, if there are low levels o f compliance with the proposed bright-line test, the Commissioner will need to rely on her existing tools and powers to remedy the non-compliance in the period prior to the review, and a regulatory response would also need to be subsequently designed. 50. As noted in options 1 and 2, the Commissioner’s standard tools for collection and enforcement in relation to general income tax liabilities are not always practical where the taxpayer has limited or no presence in New Zealand. As a result, withholding taxes are commonly imposed in other situations where there is the possibility o f unenforceability or evasion o f a tax liability, before the payee receives the income. Withholding taxes are important in these situations because they ensure that the relevant tax is paid out o f the 9 amount due to the payee before the payee gets control o f the funds. This is discussed in further detail in the section titled Status quo and problem definition. However, in the case o f residential property sales, the Commissioner’s current tools for collection and enforcement do not include a withholding tax. 51. As noted in option 1, the absence o f a withholding tax would make the tax system less coherent as a whole given that withholding taxes are required in relation to other forms o f income in similar circumstances (that is, where a payee is likely to have a tax liability and where there may be enforceability or evasion concerns). Given the structural inconsistency with other types o f income that this would create, and the apparent low levels o f compliance with the current land rules to date in relation to residential property, option 3 as a “wait and see” type approach is not Inland Revenue’s preferred option. This is because it would likely shift the problem to a later date and require the use o f the Commissioner’s resources to collect unpaid amounts o f tax that arose in the review period.2 Inland Revenue’s preference is to optimise the effectiveness o f the proposed bright-line test as soon as the new rules take effect. Like options 1 and 2, the “wait and see” strategy o f option 3 may undermine the integrity o f the tax system if there is a public perception that foreign investors, particularly in residential property, are not paying their “fair share o f tax” in New Zealand. Option 4: introduce a withholding tax on sales of residential property (“residential land withholding tax” or “RLWT”) 52. This option would introduce a withholding tax on sales o f residential land (“residential land withholding tax” or “RLWT”) where the seller acquires the property on or after 1 October 2015 and has subsequently disposed o f the property within two years. The meaning o f “residential land” and how the two-year ownership period is calculated would directly follow the proposed bright-line test. 53. As noted in the section titled Status quo and problem definition, an important feature o f New Zealand’s tax system is the existence o f withholding taxes on many types o f income where there is likely to be a tax liability and the possibility o f unenforceability or evasion. In these situations, it is likely that the payee will have a New Zealand tax liability in relation to the income they receive, and tax is accordingly withheld before the payee receives the income. 54. With the proposed introduction o f the bright-line test, it highly likely that sellers who sell residential property within two years will have a tax liability in New Zealand in relation to income from that property. As noted, the Commissioner’s standard tools for collection and enforcement in relation to general income tax liabilities are not always practical where the taxpayer has limited or no presence in New Zealand. In the case o f bright-line sales made by overseas sellers, it would be consistent with New Zealand’s broader approach to withholding taxes to withhold tax from the amount received by the seller. 55. As New Zealand currently only taxes the disposal o f land in very limited circumstances, there has been no imperative to have a withholding tax on property-related transactions. Further, because under current law tax is generally imposed only when certain intention tests are met, it would be practically difficult to identify situations where tax should be withheld. 2 As discussed in option 1, there are likely to be limits to the effectiveness of the Commissioner’s abilities to collect these tax debts when the taxpayer has no or very limited presence in New Zealand. 10 56. In situations when tax is likely to be imposed on income from a disposal (such as where there is a broader capital gains tax), many countries consider withholding taxes on sales o f real property to be an effective collection mechanism. Countries with property withholding taxes include Canada, Japan, and the United States. In addition, Australia has recently announced that it is introducing a withholding tax on sales o f certain interests in land by foreign investors to support its capital gains tax. 57. The RLWT would require the seller’s conveyancer or solicitor involved in the conveyancing process (the withholding agent) to withhold an amount from the proceeds o f the sale before the funds are released to the seller. The withholding agent would then be required to pay this amount to Inland Revenue. 58. The RLWT has been designed as a collection mechanism for the bright-line test, which means that RLWT is a non-final withholding tax and the seller would be able to offset the amount o f RLWT withheld against their income tax liability arising under the land sale rules. If the amount o f RLWT withheld exceeds their final income tax liability, they would be entitled to a refund. 59. Two separate approaches have been identified under option 4. Option 4(a) restricts the application o f the RLWT to instances where the seller is an offshore person. Option 4(b) would apply to all sellers regardless o f their offshore status. Under both options, there would be an exemption for transfers o f inherited property or property transferred under a relationship property agreement. 60. Changes to Inland Revenue’s systems would be required to implement options 4(a) and 4(b). These options would impose additional compliance costs on taxpayers selling residential property, and would incur administrative costs. The administrative and compliance costs o f 4(b) are likely to be higher than option 4(a), for the reasons discussed below. 61. The extent to which the two approaches under this option meet the objective o f supporting the integrity of, and optimising compliance with, the bright-line test is dependent on a number o f key design features. These key design issues are considered in further detail in the section titled Further analysis of option 4 - detailed design issues. Option 4(a): applies to sellers who are offshore persons 62. As noted in the discussion on options 1-3, the Commissioner’s existing tools are not always practical or effective when the taxpayer has limited or no presence in New Zealand. Other areas o f the income tax rules currently recognise this practical concern and use a withholding tax to assist in the collection o f taxes where there is likely to be a tax liability and where there may be issues with enforceability or evasion. 63. New Zealand imposes withholding taxes on many types o f New Zealand-sourced income derived by non-residents. For example, non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) is imposed on certain types o f passive income such as dividends and royalties, and a form o f withholding tax called “schedular payments” is imposed on non-residents performing a contract activity. These withholding taxes are imposed on the payer, who is usually resident in New Zealand, which makes enforcement and collection easier. 11 64. The RLWT proposed under option 4(a) would only apply where the seller is an “offshore person”, a concept introduced in the Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015. In response to submitters’ concerns relating to the difficulties o f establishing whether a person is an offshore person (particularly relating to non-individuals), it is proposed that the definition be modified to be simpler and more prescriptive. In particular, the requirements in relation to trusts have been made clearer. 65. An individual is an offshore person if they are not a New Zealand citizen who has been physically present in New Zealand within the previous three years or a holder o f a residence class visa who has been physically present in New Zealand in the previous year. It is proposed that a non-individual will be an offshore person if, in the case o f a company, any o f its directors are offshore persons, it is constituted outside New Zealand, or 25% or more o f shareholders are offshore persons. This is broadly based on definition o f “overseas person” in the Overseas Investment Act 2005, which provides for the screening and consent o f proposed overseas investment in sensitive New Zealand assets, with modifications. It is also proposed that a partnership will be an offshore person if any o f its partners are offshore persons. A trust will be an offshore person if any o f its trustees or settlors are offshore persons. In addition, a trust will be an offshore person if all its beneficiaries are offshore persons, or if at least one beneficiary is an offshore person and has received a distribution from the trust within the last six years. For further discussion on this issue refer to paragraphs 103-118. 66. Given the general difficulty faced in collecting tax from foreign investors and other non-residents with limited presence in New Zealand, the introduction o f a withholding tax under option 4(a) is Inland Revenue’s preferred approach. To minimise some o f the potential compliance costs under this option, particularly those borne by withholding agents, some-self certification may be required by sellers regarding whether or not they are an offshore person. 67. This option does not explicitly provide for the main home exception available under the proposed bright-line test. However, the main home exception would not apply to most offshore persons anyway, so withholding under this option where no tax liability exists is unlikely to occur. 68. While we see this option as increasing the effectiveness o f the bright-line test by increasing compliance with the new rules and other options may also do the same, we also view this option as optimising compliance with the bright-line test, due to its impact on fairness as well as compliance and administrative costs. The compliance costs o f the withholding tax under this option would legally fall on the person with the ultimate tax liability, i.e. the seller. As the withholding tax under this option would only apply to offshore persons, it is expected to increase the perception that foreign investors are paying their “fair share o f tax” in New Zealand, thereby enhancing the integrity o f the tax system. Option 4(b): applies to all sellers regardless of offshore status 69. We identified option 4(b) as a possible option - a withholding tax as outlined in option 4(a), but applying regardless o f the offshore status o f the seller. 70. Officials consider that this would be the most effective way o f ensuring maximum compliance with the proposed bright-line test. Another advantage o f this approach is that it would reduce some compliance costs, as there would be no determination required as to whether a person is an offshore person or not. 12 71. However, we would expect overall compliance costs and administrative costs to increase relative to option 4(a). This is because there would be a greater number o f transactions that require withholding. The number o f sales likely to be affected is unknown, because there will be a number o f behavioural effects associated with the introduction o f the bright-line test, which are inherently difficult to quantify - one o f these is the number o f sales that would be delayed in order to exceed the two-year holding period. 72. Income from many o f these sales will be exempted under the bright-line proposal because they relate to the seller’s main home. Accordingly, tax would be more likely to be over-withheld under option 4(b). This would increase compliance costs as such taxpayers would need to apply for refunds. It would also increase administrative costs, because Inland Revenue would need to process these refunds. 73. It may be possible to develop exemptions that relate to the main home to address situations o f over-withholding. These exemptions would need to be clear and robust and would take more time to work through than is possible under current timeframes. Any such exemptions would increase the complexity o f the rules. 74. While Inland Revenue is able to implement a withholding tax under option 4(a), implementation solutions are restricted by Inland Revenue’s ability to make significant systems changes ahead o f the appropriate phase o f its Business Transformation Programme. This means that it would be very difficult for Inland Revenue to implement and administer a withholding tax on all sales o f residential property made within two years o f acquisition. 75. Thus, option 4(b) is not recommended at this point in time. Summary of analysis of options 76. The table below summarises the impact analysis o f the identified options. 13 O p t i o n Meets objective?

N o t r e c o m m e n d e d 16 Further analysis of option 4 - detailed design issues 77. As noted above, the extent to which option 4 meets the objectives depends on a number o f detailed design features o f the RLWT. These detailed design issues require separate impact analysis and this analysis is summarised below. 78. These key design features were areas we consulted on as part o f the submission process for the officials’ issues paper and submitters’ views have been taken into account in our recommendations as they provided valuable feedback on the compliance burden likely to occur with each feature and option. The RLWT withholding rate 79. The officials’ issues paper proposed a “lower o f ’ approach, whereby the amount o f the RLWT to be withheld would be the lower o f 10% o f the total sales price (“the default rate”) and 33% o f the seller’s gain (i.e. total sales price - seller’s acquisition price) (“the standard rate”). In most cases, we would expect the standard rate to apply, but the default rate acts as a back stop to prevent significant over-taxation where the seller’s acquisition price is unable to be obtained. 80. We recommend that the “lower o f ’ approach proposed in the issues paper be used as it strikes a balance between creating a collection mechanism that approximates the amount o f tax payable under the bright-line test and making the process straightforward for the withholding agent, while also reducing the risk o f significant over-taxation. 81. Ideally, the RLWT should neither under nor over tax the seller. However, for the RLWT to retain simplicity and reduce the compliance burden faced by taxpayers, the amount withheld will not be exactly the same as the seller’s ultimate income tax liability. As discussed previously, the Commissioner’s powers for enforcement and collection can be limited in some situations, and for this reason, we recommend that the RLWT should be more likely to over tax rather than under tax. As a result, the standard rate proposed in the issues paper used the top marginal tax rate o f 33% (which is consistent with the default resident withholding tax rate on dividends where no tax rate has been provided) rather than the lowest marginal tax rate o f 10.5%, for example. 82. During consultation, it was raised by some submitters that a 33% rate would always result in over-taxation in relation to sellers that are companies; they suggested a 28% rate would be more suitable. Officials agree and recommend that where the seller is a company, the standard rate should be 28% x the seller’s gain. 83. To mitigate the risk o f over-taxation and potential cash-flow issues for sellers, we recommend that sellers should be able to file an interim income tax return following the payment o f RLWT to the Commissioner in order to obtain a refund, rather than having to wait to until the end o f the income year. Submitters considered this to be an important factor in making the withholding tax practical and effective.

In general, withholding taxes are used to ensure that the relevant tax is paid out o f an amount due to a person before the recipient gets control o f the funds. The recipient may have an incentive to spend the funds before tax has been paid, which is generally why tax administrations “clip the ticket” before the money reaches the recipient. In finding an appropriate party to clip the ticket, we consider it should be the person with the least to gain from failing to comply with the rules - this is normally the payer o f the amount. This is particularly relevant to the problem here, because the RLWT under option 4 is aimed at enforcing the seller’s tax liability under the bright-line test, where the seller may not otherwise comply with their tax obligations. 85. The officials’ issues paper proposed that the withholding agent should be a solicitor or conveyancer involved in the property conveyancing process (“the conveyancing agent”) and not the buyer or seller themselves.3 This is because they already have professional obligations to discharge in relation to the conveyancing o f property and this would more naturally form part o f those other obligations. They also have the systems and trust accounts needed to manage the funds involved in the settlement o f property, which is important in terms o f ensuring the integrity o f the withholding process. 86. The majority o f submitters agreed that neither the buyer nor seller should be the default withholding agent and proposed that the seller’s conveyancing agent should be the withholding agent. This is because they have ready access to the required information to determine whether the seller would be eligible for an exemption from withholding and it would minimise the required interaction between the buyer’s and seller’s conveyancing agents. This reduces the compliance burden imposed on the conveyancing agents and their clients. In addition, a major advantage identified by submitters was that it would make the However, many other countries place the withholding obligation on the buyer, but they expect the buyer to use the services of a solicitor to discharge their withholding obligations. 18 withholding tax a lot fairer - the compliance costs o f the withholding tax would be borne by the seller. 87. Officials do not consider the issue to be as clear cut. There are a number o f advantages to requiring the buyer’s conveyancing agent to withhold on the buyer’s behalf. The first is that it follows other withholding taxes (both in New Zealand and overseas), where the withholding agent is the first payer in the chain. Other advantages include that a secondary obligation can be placed on the seller’s conveyancing agent if the buyer’s agent fails to withhold, the funds are more likely to flow through a New Zealand bank account, and it would not create a potential conflict between the seller and their conveyancing agent where withholding could go against a client action. 88. Officials consider the advantages and disadvantages o f both options to be finely balanced. There are marginal compliance cost benefits to the proposal that the withholding agent be the seller’s conveyancing agent. On the other hand, there are marginal revenue integrity benefits to the proposal that the withholding agent be the buyer’s conveyancing agent. 89. Officials consider that the better approach, on balance, is the proposal that the withholding agent be the seller’s conveyancing agent as long as sufficient other revenue integrity measures can be put in place as part o f the overall structure o f the proposed RLWT. 90. Where the buyer is the withholding agent, we recommend that they should be required to provide a statutory declaration stating they have fulfilled their withholding obligations. We consider this necessary to protect the integrity o f the RLWT. We understand that while it is possible to complete a property transfer without a conveyancing agent, only very few people do. RLWT should not encourage people to undertake their own conveyancing simply in order to circumvent the application o f the withholding tax.

When should the Commissioner be paid before other disbursements? 91. In situations where the buyer’s conveyancing agent withholds RLWT, the amount withheld would be paid to Inland Revenue and the remaining funds would then be passed to the seller’s conveyancing agent, who would use the funds to pay the seller’s mortgages and outstanding local government rates, before paying the remaining amount to the seller. 92. Where the seller’s conveyancing agent withholds RLWT, the issue o f whether the withholding tax should be paid first (that is, before mortgages on the property) arises. 93. The issues paper proposed that the Commissioner should be paid before other disbursements. 94. If withholding tax is collected first, this would be consistent with the situation where the buyer’s conveyancing agent withholds RLWT. It also provides the same result as other withholding taxes such as PAYE, as tax is withheld by the payer before the payee receives the balance. 95. If withholding tax is not collected first, there would be an incentive for an offshore seller to effectively strip out the profits from the sale by increasing their mortgage prior to the sale in order to avoid payment o f RLWT. This may be particularly problematic where the mortgagee is an overseas lender, as in those situations, New Zealand Reserve Bank lending ratios will not be relevant. 96. Where there is a resulting unpaid tax liability, this behaviour could be subject to penalties for tax evasion. However, because the offshore person is unlikely to have any presence in New Zealand, the Commissioner would need to rely on the existing rules for collecting tax. Under these rules it is more difficult to collect tax from offshore persons. Accordingly, if RLWT is not collected in these situations then the objective o f the RLWT rules is significantly undermined. 97. Therefore Inland Revenue’s preferred approach is for the Commissioner to be paid before other disbursements, as it is (in substance) consistent with other withholding taxes and it would be the most effective approach from an integrity perspective. 98. However, submitters on the officials’ issues paper considered that the Commissioner should not be paid before the seller’s other creditors. Their reasons centred on the fact that it could leave insufficient funds to discharge the seller’s mortgage, resulting in delays in settlement, or prevent settlement from occurring in some cases. Submitters also noted that income tax does not usually have priority in circumstances o f liquidation. However, officials consider that the better comparison in this context is with other types o f withholding taxes, which are paid first. 99. Officials were asked to consider alternative options to address submitters’ concerns while still providing an acceptable level o f integrity. 100. An option suggested by one submitter was for RLWT to be paid first, but the mortgagee releases title on the basis that when the seller’s ultimate tax liability in relation to the sale is calculated, Inland Revenue could repay the amount o f overpaid tax directly to the mortgagee. 20 Under this approach, the mortgagee would effectively step into the shoes o f the seller. This could involve relatively high administrative and compliance costs. There would need to be criteria for Inland Revenue to determine whether the refund should be provided to the mortgagee, for example, on the basis that the seller has no ultimate tax liability, or that Inland Revenue has determined that there is no abuse. Further, it may be difficult to implement as the mortgagee may not have sufficient information about the seller in order to claim the refund from Inland Revenue. 101. Officials considered whether specific anti-abuse rules could target avoidance situations, for example, requiring RLWT to be paid before other disbursements where the seller has deliberately geared up prior to the sale or has an arrangement with an associated party. Any anti-abuse rules would need to be applied by the withholding agent rather than by Inland Revenue, so from a practical perspective, the rules would need to be straightforward and able to be easily determined. 102. To address to an extent the concerns raised by submitters in relation to delays in settlement (or non-settlement), it is proposed that the Commissioner should be paid before other disbursements unless the disbursement relates to a mortgage held by a New Zealand- registered bank (or a New Zealand-registered non-bank deposit taker). Officials consider that this rule should provide a reasonable level o f integrity as priority would apply in situations where abuse is particularly likely to occur. This rule should also be relatively straightforward for withholding agents to apply. Definition of offshore person/information requirements Individuals 103. For individuals, an offshore person (as defined in the recently enacted Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015) is a person who is: • not a New Zealand citizen or does not hold a New Zealand residence class visa; or • a New Zealand citizen and has been away from New Zealand for more than three years; or • a holder o f a New Zealand residence class visa and has been away from New Zealand for more than one year. 104. Several submitters on the issues paper asked for further detail around what would be required to satisfy this test. We propose the following criteria. 105. The withholding agent would need to be satisfied that the seller meets the requirements for non-withholding. 106. It is anticipated that in most cases a New Zealand citizen or holder o f a residence class visa who is selling within two years could satisfy the proof requirement by meeting with their New Zealand conveyancing agent in person and showing them their passport. The conveyancing agent would be able to take a copy o f the documentation and record that they have seen the person in New Zealand (as the person is currently in New Zealand, this means that they will not be an offshore person). 107. If an individual person is selling their property from outside New Zealand, a certified statement or other suitable proof from the seller that they are not an offshore person should be provided to the withholding agent. This could include evidence o f flights to New Zealand within the relevant time. 21 108. The proposed requirements for sellers to provide further information on their offshore status go beyond the recently enacted information requirements for requiring IRD numbers on property transactions as specified in the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015. However, we consider that, in order to make the proposed withholding tax effective and to minimise compliance costs for agents, this additional information is necessary. In practice, for individuals this information would likely have been captured by conveyancing agents as evidence anyway. Non-individuals 109. The issues paper proposed that for an entity or an arrangement (e.g. a company or a trust), an offshore person could be a person who is either incorporated overseas or who is owned or controlled (legally or beneficially) 25% or more by offshore persons. This is based on the definition o f “offshore person” as defined in the recently enacted Tax Administration Amendment Act 2015. 110. Concerns were raised by submitters around the potential difficulties for withholding agents to determine whether a non-individual is an offshore person. This could be complex and involve high compliance costs if the withholding agent needs to verify the underlying ownership o f an entity or trust. We also have some concerns with the 25% threshold in relation to certain arrangements (in particular, partnerships and trusts). 111. Accordingly, we consider that the test for non-individuals (including arrangements) should be modified to be more certain and to ensure revenue integrity. 112. For a company (including a unit trust) to qualify for the non-offshore exemption, the following conditions should be met: • the company is registered in New Zealand; and • all directors o f the company are non-offshore individuals; and • not more than 25% o f the shareholder decision-making rights o f the company are held by offshore persons. 113. This could be satisfied, for example, by proof such as: • a copy o f the company’s New Zealand registration; and • a copy o f each director’s New Zealand passport or residency visa sighted during a meeting with the conveyancing agent; and • a statement from each director that, to their knowledge, no more than 25% o f the shareholder decision-making rights o f the company are held by offshore persons. 114. For partners o f a partnership, we propose that if any o f the partners is an offshore person, then the RLWT should apply. This will ensure integrity is retained. 115. We propose that discretionary trusts should be considered offshore and subject to RLWT if either a settlor or trustee is an offshore person (as defined above). 116. In addition, the trustees o f a discretionary trust have the ability to shift the tax liability to one o f the beneficiaries by distributing the income to the beneficiary and treating it as beneficiary income. In order to ensure that the gain does not escape tax by being transferred to an offshore beneficiary, the RLWT should also apply to gains o f trusts where: • all o f the beneficiaries o f the trust are offshore, or 22 • one or more o f the beneficiaries are offshore, and the offshore beneficiary received a distribution from the trust within the last six years. 117. This should limit instances o f abuse. At the same time, it would ensure that most ordinary family trusts that only hold the family home would not be subject to RLWT solely because some o f its beneficiaries reside overseas. 118. A corporate trustee would be able to qualify for the non-offshore exemption if it met both the company and trust criteria above. Certification 119. Pure self-certification is not recommended in this instance, due to the funds potentially at stake - the two outcomes for RLWT are withholding and no withholding, while for the majority o f other withholding taxes, the two outcomes both involve withholding, but at different rates. Pure self-certification could create an incentive to fraudulently self-certify as not an offshore person, thus reducing the effectiveness o f the withholding tax.

Penalties play an important role in ensuring that taxpayers, including withholding agents, do not have an incentive to not comply with their tax obligations. The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for a number o f monetary penalties, for example, late payment penalties and shortfall penalties. 121. To maintain overall coherence o f the penalties regime, we recommended as a starting point, the existing penalties that apply to withholding regimes should apply to withholding agents who have not complied with their withholding obligations. 23 122. In some cases, it is possible for criminal penalties, including “absolute liability offences” to apply. For example, failing to keep documents required to be kept by tax law is an offence punishable by a fine not exceeding $12,000. During consultation, some submitters expressed concern in relation to the potential application o f criminal penalties. While they agreed that monetary penalties were appropriate, they were concerned that applying criminal penalties in relatively “low level” cases could have overly severe consequences for conveyancing agents. We note that potential criminal penalties are relatively few in number, but are critical to the integrity o f the tax system. They apply to all persons with tax obligations. 123. However, unlike other withholding regimes, we do not recommend also making the conveyancing agent responsible for the underlying amount that should have been withheld. This is because they are an intermediary in the process and neither the purchase amount nor sales proceeds belongs them. To do so would likely increase the cost o f professional indemnity insurance, potentially substantially. 124. Other countries which place the withholding obligation on the buyer are able to hold the buyer liable for the amount that should have been withheld. However, since we are recommending a departure from that approach, we do not consider it appropriate to hold the buyer liable for the underlying amount o f withholding tax that should have been withheld. A buyer would have limited ability to ensure that the seller’s conveyancing agent does the right thing. 125. In addition, we consider that Inland Revenue should be able to inform the relevant professional body o f the withholding agent about a failure to withhold where the failure appears to be negligent or fraudulent. 126. We also consider that the buyer should be held liable for the amount o f RLWT that should have been withheld, if the buyer and seller are associated persons.

Treasury and Inland Revenue officials released an officials’ issues paper titled Residential land withholding tax on 31 August 2015. Submissions closed on 2 October 2015 and a total o f 16 submissions were received, including from those in the conveyancing industry. 128. In addition to this, a workshop was held on 10 September 2015 with representatives from the Auckland District Law Society, New Zealand Law Society, and the New Zealand Society o f Conveyancers to discuss the proposals in the issues paper. The intent o f the workshop was to inform submitters in compiling their written submissions and to provide officials with an indication o f submitters’ views prior to the receipt o f written submissions. 129. Support for the proposal was mixed. While some submitters supported the proposal, other submitters submitted that the measure should not proceed if the revenue that would be directly collected by the measure is less than the potential compliance and administrative costs. Officials note that while revenue directly raised from the measure is important, a key objective o f the proposed measure is to support the integrity o f the bright-line test as part o f the wider tax system. 130. Submissions generally focused on whether the buyer’s conveyancing agent or seller’s conveyancing agent should be the withholding agent and the likely compliance impacts associated with both approaches, as was requested in the issues paper. The majority o f submitters expressed their preference for the seller’s conveyancing agent to be the withholding agent. This is due to a number o f reasons, including the fact that the seller’s conveyancing agent is likely to have more detailed information about their client and that the seller’s conveyancing agent deals with other disbursements at the time o f settlement. Submitters raised a number o f points as to why the withholding agent should not be the buyer’s conveyancing agent - in particular, it would not be fair to require buyers to bear the compliance cost o f withholding when it is the seller who has the ultimate tax liability and sellers may not want to disclose private information (for example, personal details about all beneficiaries o f a family trust). While officials note that imposing the obligation on the buyer’s conveyancing agent would not necessarily mean that the compliance costs are borne by the buyer, the points raised in the submissions have informed our analysis on who should be the withholding agent under option 4. 131. The issues paper proposed to give the Commissioner priority over other disbursements made at the time o f settlement - that is, for RLWT to be paid before the seller’s other disbursements. This is Inland Revenue’s preferred approach, as it is (in substance) consistent with other withholding taxes and it would be the most effective approach from an integrity perspective. However, submitters did not believe that the Commissioner should be paid before other disbursements made at the time o f settlement, as it could prevent some sales from being completed. 132. To address the concerns raised by submitters to an extent, it is proposed that the Commissioner should be paid before other disbursements unless the disbursement relates to a mortgage held by a New Zealand-registered bank or non-bank deposit taker. Officials consider that this rule is likely to prevent situations that are particularly problematic from an 25 integrity perspective, and should be relatively straightforward for withholding agents to comply with. 133. Many submitters expressed concern about the difficulty o f identifying who is an “offshore person”, particularly in the case o f non-individuals. This may be impractical and difficult when there are many levels in the structure o f a company and it is not immediately clear who the underlying owner is. This concern has been taken into account in the design o f the RLWT under option 4(a). In addition, option 4(b) has also been identified and analysed as an alternative approach by subjecting all bright-line sales to the withholding tax. 134. A few submitters also raised concerns about whether Inland Revenue is able to implement a new withholding tax, given the age o f Inland Revenue’s current computer system and the limited ability to make changes to it before the completion o f Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme. Some submitters proposed that the implementation o f a withholding tax should be delayed until the relevant part o f the Business Transformation Programme has been completed and detailed data is available on compliance with the bright- line test. Inland Revenue is able to make the appropriate systems changes to implement the withholding tax, but to address submitters’ other points, we have identified as a feasible option and analysed whether a review in three to four years would meet the objective o f optimising the effectiveness o f the bright-line test (option 3). 135. Submitters also made comments about detailed design features o f a withholding tax under option 4. We have taken these comments into consideration in our design o f the policy details. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 136. Inland Revenue supports option 4(a). We consider that option 4(a) would optimise the effectiveness and support the integrity o f the bright-line test. With the proposed introduction o f the bright-line test, it highly likely that overseas sellers who sell residential property within two years will have a tax liability in New Zealand in relation to income from that property. It would be consistent with New Zealand’s broader approach to withholding taxes to withhold tax on the payment received by the seller. 137. Given the general difficulty faced in collecting tax from foreign investors with no physical presence in New Zealand, we consider that options 1-3 would not improve compliance with the bright-line test and could undermine the integrity o f the tax system if there is a perception that foreign investors, particularly in the area o f residential property, are not paying their “fair share o f tax” in New Zealand. Option 4(b) would not optimise the effectiveness o f the bright-line test due to the significant additional compliance and administrative costs relative to option 4(a). 138. While option 4(a) involves greater up-front administration costs, compliance costs and is not expected to raise Crown Revenue (as it is simply a collection mechanism), we consider that it would meet the objective o f optimising the effectiveness, and supporting the integrity of, the bright-line test. However, the extent to which a withholding tax would meet the objectives is dependent on the key design features we have outlined in this regulatory impact statement. 26 IMPLEMENTATION 139. Legislative change to the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994 would be required to implement option 4. Any legislative amendments required to implement option 4 could be included in a bill introduced before the end o f 2015. 140. The Government has indicated that a withholding tax under option 4 should be effective from 1 July 2016. To ensure that Inland Revenue has the appropriate systems changes in place and that practitioners involved in the withholding process are well informed o f their obligations, any legislative amendments should be enacted by the end o f March 2016. 141. In addition, Inland Revenue would be required to update forms and communication material that can be distributed to withholding agents and other parties potentially impacted by the withholding tax. One possibility would be to distribute information forms to real estate agents to distribute to their clients. 142. The withholding tax under option 4 would be administered by Inland Revenue. 143. Whilst Inland Revenue has mechanisms in place to collect various taxes, it does not have existing administrative arrangements to collect the proposed RLWT. 144. Where a withholding agent has failed to withhold when required, penalties would apply and where there has been a negligent or fraudulent failure to withhold, Inland Revenue would work closely with the relevant professional body to ensure that appropriate action is taken. 145. In designing option 4, officials sought feedback from representatives on the compliance costs associated with administering a withholding tax. This feedback informed the key design features preferred by officials as set out in the regulatory impact analysis section o f this statement. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 146. Inland Revenue is putting in place new systems for administering the bright-line test including a new form to monitor property sales subject to the bright-line test. In addition, further measures have been introduced to provide more useful information to Inland Revenue about land sales. These measures will enable Inland Revenue to have better information about cases where withholding tax should be withheld and whether or not it has actually been withheld. 147. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to these changes, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP). 148. Inland Revenue monitors, evaluates and reviews new legislation under the GTTP. The GTTP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used for tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The implementation and review stage o f the GTTP involves reviewing the legislation after implementation and identifying any issues. 149. Inland Revenue officials will continue to make themselves available for discussion with affected parties in the design o f a RLWT under option 4(a). 27
Regulatory Impact Statement GST on cross-border services and intangibles Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis o f options to apply Goods and Services Tax (GST) to cross-border services and intangibles consumed in New Zealand (including e-books, music, videos, and software purchased from offshore websites). Currently, GST is not usually collected on cross-border services and intangibles, which results in competition and fairness concerns by New Zealand businesses, as well as a revenue gap in New Zealand’s GST system. This analysis follows submissions received on the discussion document GST: Cross-border sendees, intangibles and goods released on 18 August 2015, which sought public feedback on a proposal to require offshore suppliers o f services and intangibles to New Zealand resident consumers to register and return the GST. The analysis also considered international developments to address this issue, including the OECD guidelines on GST and cross-border services and intangibles which are connected with the work on “base erosion and profit shifting” (BEPS). In addition, consideration has been given to approaches adopted in the European Union, and a number o f countries including Australia, Norway, Switzerland, South Africa, Japan and South Korea. There are three key constraints / caveats on the analysis: 1. Because o f data limitations it is not possible to accurately determine how many offshore suppliers could be required to register and return GST under the preferred option. Experience in similar countries suggests that around 100 offshore suppliers may register if the preferred approach is adopted. 2. Again owing to data limitations it is not possible to determine exactly how much is spent on services and intangibles purchased offshore and consumed in New Zealand. Officials’ best estimate that around $270 million per annum is spent on services and intangibles from offshore suppliers. This estimate means that around $40 million o f GST is forgone on these purchases. This amount could be growing at a rate o f 10% per annum. 3. The extent to which the GST treatment o f services and intangibles purchased from offshore influences consumers’ purchasing decisions is uncertain. Other factors such as product range, availability and price (exclusive o f GST) may have a greater impact on consumers’ decision to purchase from an offshore supplier as opposed to a domestic supplier. A range o f options has been considered and measured against the objectives o f providing certainty, consistency and fairness o f GST treatment whilst minimising compliance costs and disruption to current practices. There are no environmental or cultural impacts from these recommended changes. There are no other significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning this regulatory impact analysis other than those noted above. 1 The proposals could impact on the level o f competition by discouraging offshore suppliers from entering or continuing to supply to the New Zealand market. However, this impact may depend on the extent to which compliance costs are imposed on offshore suppliers and the extent to which consumers alter their purchasing behaviour in response to the change. The preferred option would likely impose some compliance costs on offshore suppliers as they would be required to register and return GST. These compliance costs are likely to be comparable to (if not lower than) the compliance costs already imposed on domestic businesses associated with registering and returning GST on domestic supplies. The preferred option also contains a number o f compliance savings measures to ensure compliance costs imposed on offshore suppliers are minimised. The application o f GST on services and intangibles purchased from offshore suppliers may also impact New Zealand consumers’ purchasing decisions. As noted above, the impact is likely to be limited as other factors such as product range, availability and price (exclusive o f GST) may have a greater impact on consumers’ decisions than the application o f GST on these services and intangibles. None o f the policy options identified is expected to unduly impair private property rights or override fundamental common law principles. Note that this RIS only considers the application o f GST to cross-border services and intangibles. The application o f GST to low-value imported goods will be considered at a later time following separate public consultation. Marie Pallot Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 21 October 2015 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. In principle, GST should apply evenly to all consumption that occurs within New Zealand as this helps to ensure GST is fair, efficient and simple. However, GST is not typically collected on cross-border services and intangibles (including internet downloads and online services) purchased from offshore websites. 2. When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased services from offshore and online digital products were not yet available. Therefore, at that time the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing cross-border services outweighed the benefits o f taxation. 3. The growth in online purchases means that the volume o f imported services on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant. This raises the question o f whether the existing tax rules will remain suitable and sustainable in the future. 4. Many domestic providers feel the existing tax settings place them at an unfair disadvantage when compared with offshore businesses supplying products with no GST added to the price. There are a number o f reasons why New Zealand consumers may purchase services offshore, such as overall cheaper prices, product availability, and convenience. However, ideally, the tax treatment should not be a factor in consumers’ purchasing decisions. 5. It is likely that up to $40 million o f GST is forgone on cross-border services and intangibles per year. The growth o f imported services is a relatively recent development and the amount is expected to continue to grow - estimates vary but the growth could be around 10 percent per year. International considerations 6. The non-collection o f GST on cross-border services and intangibles is an international issue faced by countries that have a GST or Value Added Tax (VAT) system. The OECD is in the process o f developing guidelines which focus on establishing an international set o f principles for determining when countries should have the right to tax such supplies. 7. The guidelines were publicly released on 5 October 2015. The guidelines suggest that, for remotely supplied services and intangibles, the consumer’s usual place o f residence is the predominant test for determining which country has the right to tax. They also suggest that offshore suppliers could be required to register and return the GST on remote supplies, as is the case in the European Union. The guidelines are expected to be finalised later this year. 8. The offshore supplier registration model has been adopted in the European Union for cross-border services and intangibles as well as a number o f countries, including Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, Japan and South Africa. The countries that have implemented such a system report some success in collecting GST or VAT. 9. Australia also announced plans to introduce the model as part o f their 2015 Federal Government Budget. While some o f the detail is still subject to consultation, the broad framework o f the proposed rules is consistent with the OECD guidelines and the system that operates in Europe. Australia intends to implement its proposed rules on 1 July 2017. 3 Establishing New Zealand’s right to tax 10. Before considering the various options, it is first important to determine which cross­ border services and intangibles New Zealand should tax. New Zealand and other countries’ GST systems seek to tax domestic consumption. This is done taxing imports (as well as other goods and services supplied domestically), and not taxing exports. 11. In the case o f cross-border goods, the place o f consumption will be clear - the consumption occurs in the country o f import. There is less certainty when applying GST to cross-border services and intangibles. In many cases it is not clear where the consumption occurs and therefore which country has the taxing right. A number o f proxies could be used to determine place o f consumption, such as the location o f the consumer, location o f the supplier, or the residence o f the consumer. 12. Without international consensus on taxing rights, it is possible that services could be taxed in multiple jurisdictions or not at all. The OECD has been developing a set o f guidelines addressing these issues o f double taxation and non-taxation that may arise from inconsistencies in the application o f VAT/GST to international trade. 13. The OECD draft guidelines and growing international practice suggest that New Zealand should apply GST to “remote” services and intangibles supplied to New Zealand- residents. Remote services are services where it is not necessary for the supplier and customer to be in the same location when the services are supplied - such as if, for example, a person downloads a song from a website. These services can be distinguished from “on-the- spot” services, where the supplier and the customer are usually required to be in the same location as the supplier in order for the services to be physically performed - for example, the services provided by a hairdresser. 14. In relation to remote services, residence is internationally regarded as a reasonable proxy for determining where a cross-border service or intangible will be consumed. It is recommended that New Zealand follow international consensus to avoid double taxation or double non-taxation in international trade. Therefore, the options considered seek to apply GST to remotely supplied services and intangibles received by New Zealand residents. OBJECTIVES The options outlined in this RIS seek to achieve two main objectives: (a) Address the non-taxation of cross-border services and intangibles 15. New Zealand’s GST is a “consumption tax”. Consumption taxes seek to tax consumer spending on goods and services. The country that has the right to tax this consumer spending is generally the country in which the good or service is consumed. This is known as the “destination principle”. 16. Conversely, goods and services that are exported, and therefore consumed offshore, are generally untaxed - that is, exports are zero-rated, meaning GST is charged at a rate o f zero percent and businesses can claim GST back on their inputs. Allowing exporters to claim back GST on their inputs ensures that GST is not a cost on business or offshore consumers. 17. If countries apply the destination principle and also recognise that GST is a tax on consumers and not businesses, double taxation and non-taxation in cross-border trade should 4 largely be averted. Services and intangibles that are exported are zero-rated in most jurisdictions so if jurisdictions do not tax incoming services and intangibles this can lead to double non-taxation. This result is inconsistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST system which seeks to tax virtually all New Zealand based consumption. 18. Therefore, the options discussed in this RIS seek to address the issue o f the non-taxation o f cross-border services consumed in New Zealand. As discussed above, around $40 million o f GST is forgone on cross-border services and intangibles per year growing at a rate o f 10 percent per year. (b) Reduce competitive distortions 19. In principle, GST should apply evenly to all consumption that occurs within New Zealand as this helps to ensure GST is fair, efficient and simple. When GST does not apply evenly it has the potential to distort consumer behaviour. Domestic businesses argue that the fact that no GST is charged on services purchased from offshore businesses but, is charged when services are purchased from domestic businesses, is distorting consumers’ purchasing decisions in favour o f offshore businesses. 20. Therefore, the second objective is to reduce any distortive effects that GST may have on consumers’ purchasing decisions. However, any option discussed must also ensure that domestic businesses are not advantaged as compared to offshore businesses as a result o f any proposal. Objectives against which the options are to be assessed 21. The objectives against which the options are to be assessed are: • Certainty and simplicity: The GST rules should be clear and simple to understand, so that taxpayers are aware o f the GST treatment o f a particular supply and then GST obligations. • Efficiency of compliance and administration: Compliance costs for taxpayers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue should be minimised as far as possible. • Neutrality: Taxpayers in similar situations carrying out similar transactions should be subject to similar levels o f taxation. • Effectiveness and fairness: The option must have the ability to meet the objectives o f collects the forgone revenue and reducing the distortions the current treatment brings about. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 22. Three policy options and the status quo were considered for addressing the policy problem and meeting the objectives. These were: Option 1: Require non-resident suppliers to register and return GST on services and intangibles supplied to New Zealand resident customers. 5 Option 2: Require the New Zealand resident customer to return the GST on services and intangibles supplied by non-residents (known as a reverse charge mechanism). Option 3: Require financial institutions to return the GST on credit/debit card transactions involving services and intangibles purchased from non-resident suppliers. Option 4: Retain the current GST treatment where no GST is collected on services and intangibles supplied by non-residents. This is the status quo option to which the other options are being assessed against. 23. All o f the options (apart from option 4) impact New Zealand resident consumers as they will likely bear the cost o f the application o f GST on purchases o f services and intangibles received from offshore suppliers. The extent to which the resident consumer will bear the cost will depend on the effectiveness and rate o f compliance o f each option. 24. With regard to option 1, the extent to which New Zealand resident consumers will bear the GST will also depend on whether the offshore supplier passes the cost on to the consumer. This may be industry or firm specific and depend on factors such as business practices and the elasticity o f demand for products. Option 1: Offshore supplier registration (officials’ preferred option) 25. Option one involves offshore suppliers or offshore electronic market places registering and returning GST on services and intangibles consumed in New Zealand. This option therefore primarily impacts offshore suppliers and offshore electronic market places. 26. Under this option offshore suppliers and marketplaces would be required to register and return GST if their supplies o f services to New Zealand-resident customers exceed a certain registration threshold in a 12-month period. This option is consistent with how GST is collected on domestic supplies o f goods and services. 27. The offshore supplier registration model is endorsed by the draft OECD guidelines - Guidelines on place of taxation for business-to-consumer supplies of services and intangibles - which were released December 2014 and are expected to be finalised later this year. 28. This option has been adopted in other countries, for example members o f the European Union, and other countries such as Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, Japan and South Africa have also recently adopted this option. Australia has recently proposed to apply GST to cross-border services and intangibles from 1 July 2017 using an offshore supplier registration system. Certainty and simplicity 29. Adopting a system that is widely used internationally and is, therefore, familiar to international suppliers should make this option relatively simple to apply in practice. For example, the European Union has collected VAT on services and intangibles using this option since 2003. Given the European Union is the largest VAT market, many international suppliers will be familiar with this system and already be registered and returning VAT in Europe. 6 30. In addition, given New Zealand’s GST system is broad-based, with a single rate and few exemptions, it is expected to be relatively simple for offshore suppliers to comply with as compared to countries with multiple VAT/GST rates and exemptions. Efficiency of compliance and administration 31. This option is relatively efficient to administer given systems are already in place to register domestic suppliers. Since New Zealand’s GST system is relatively simple, compliance costs should be minimal and consistent with (if not lower than) the compliance cost imposed on domestic businesses in registering and returning GST. 32. Implementing simplified registration processes that are tailored to offshore suppliers will assist in reducing the compliance costs associated with the new rules (see the implementation section for more information on the simplified registration system). 33. As a further compliance cost reduction measure, offshore suppliers would not be required to register in New Zealand unless their supplies exceeded a certain registration threshold. This means that offshore suppliers that supply a minimal level o f services to New Zealand residents would not have to register. The rules contain other features that are designed to reduce compliance costs for offshore suppliers. A discussion o f these features is included in further analysis on option 1: Offshore supplier registration model. Neutrality 34. This option is neutral because offshore suppliers will be subject to the same rules as those applying to domestic businesses. Consequently, for tax purposes consumers should be indifferent as to whether they purchase a remote service from a domestic or offshore supplier as both suppliers would be required to return GST on that service. Effectiveness and fairness 35. The effectiveness and fairness o f this option may depend on the extent to which liable offshore suppliers comply with the rules. Since New Zealand’s tax system is based on voluntary compliance, the system relies on the fact that the vast majority o f people do the right thing and comply with their tax obligations. This is largely because our tax system is fair and coherent. It is expected that most offshore suppliers would comply with our rules for the same reasons, albeit there will be some differences in the enforcement mechanisms adopted. 36. When similar rules to those proposed in this document have been applied in other countries, offshore suppliers, particularly large international suppliers that account for the majority o f cross-border services and intangibles, have demonstrated a willingness to comply. For many o f these suppliers, failure to comply with their obligations would pose a significant risk to their reputation. Furthermore, to generate a similar level o f compliance for New Zealand, the option adopts similar and consistent rules with the rules that apply in those other countries. 37. There are a number o f detailed design issues with this option. These design issues have a significant impact on the degree to which this option meets the objectives. These detailed design issues are considered in the section “further analysis o f option 1”. 7 Option 2: Reverse charge 38. Under this option, when a New Zealand consumer purchases services or intangibles from an offshore supplier, they would be required to return GST by making a separate payment to Inland Revenue or pay the GST as part o f a end o f year tax return (as opposed to the GST being included in the price paid). This is known as a ‘reverse charge’. This option therefore primarily impacts New Zealand resident consumers that purchases services and intangibles from offshore suppliers. 39. New Zealand already has a limited reverse charge rule for services purchased by New Zealand businesses from non-residents. It applies to the extent the services relate to 5% or more to non-taxable activities, such as those o f a financial institution. 40. Under this option the existing reverse charge would be expanded to apply to individual consumers that purchase services and intangibles from offshore suppliers. 41. Like New Zealand, other countries (particularly in the EU) apply reverse charges as the primary collection method in relation to business-to-business offshore supplies o f services and digital goods. Canada also uses this approach to collect GST on offshore supplies o f services to non-registered individuals. The tax is due by the end o f the month following the calendar month in which the amount for the services was paid or became payable. Certainty and simplicity 42. The main disadvantage with this option is that a large number o f taxpayers will be required to return GST, as compared to options 1 and 3 where a comparably small number o f offshore suppliers or financial institutions would be required to return the GST. The amount o f GST paid by each consumer is likely to be relatively small. 43. Given this option has the potential to impact a large number o f consumers that are unfamiliar with returning GST there is likely to be less certainty as to how the GST rules apply. Consumers would also be required to identify whether or not they are purchasing the service from a New Zealand resident supplier and only return GST on services received by non-resident suppliers. Efficiency of compliance and administration 44. As discussed above, this option would impose compliance costs on a relatively large group o f consumers that purchase services from offshore suppliers for relatively small amounts o f GST. Given that a large proportion o f individual taxpayers are currently not required to file tax returns this option has the potential to require a large number o f taxpayers to file returns. 45. Administrative costs are also likely to be significant as this option would involve the development o f a new system o f receiving GST payments. Either a new tax form would need to be developed or existing end o f year tax returns would need to be amended. Resources would also need to be allocated to ensuring consumers complied with their tax obligations, by promoting awareness, providing guidance materials and dealing with enquiries, errors and refunds. Neutrality 46. If applied consistently and successfully, GST would be returned on both services provided domestically and from offshore. However, the method o f collection would differ significantly depending upon whether the supplier was offshore or onshore. Effectiveness and fairness 47. When this option has been applied in other jurisdictions its success has been limited. This is likely due to a number o f factors such as lack o f awareness o f the requirement to return GST given that consumers are accustomed to GST being included in the purchase price, and the difficulty o f enforcing a reverse charge on such a large taxpayer base. 48. In many cases, the New Zealand purchaser may not realise they are buying from an non­ resident supplier. For example, an offshore supplier could have a New Zealand domain name (.co.nz) or a separate chain o f New Zealand retail stores. Option 3: Financial institutions return the GST 49. Option 3 would impact financial institutions (e.g. New Zealand banks) and other payment intermediaries that would be required to add GST to New Zealand issued credit/debit cards at the time that services are purchased from an offshore supplier. 50. How this collection option would apply in practice would need to be determined through consultation with financial institutions. However, one possible approach would be for the financial institution to add GST to the consumers’ credit or debit card when the following conditions are met: • The card is not physically present when the transaction occurs (e.g. instead o f swiping the card, the customer supplies the credit card number). • The supplier o f the service is not in New Zealand. • The billing address for the card is a New Zealand address. Certainty and simplicity 51. The development o f an automated system to apply GST to purchases o f remotely supplied services could be complex. The system would need to identify purchases that would not be subject to GST, such as ‘on-the-spot’ services consumed outside o f New Zealand (for example, overseas accommodation) and international travel1. It is unclear as to whether financial institutions have the necessary information and therefore there would be a risk that GST would be applied to services consumed outside o f New Zealand. 52. Consumers’ use o f online intermediary payment systems would have to be considered. Although a credit/debit card is still used, from the perspective o f the financial institution it may be difficult to determine who the ultimate supplier o f the service is, and therefore, whether GST should be charged. For example, it would be difficult to exclude an industry type (such as overseas accommodation providers) if the payment was made through intermediary payment systems. One solution would be to require the intermediary payment 1 International travel is currently zero-rated because it is a service that is considered to be consumed outside of New Zealand. 9 provider (as opposed to the financial institution who issues the credit or debit card) to collect the GST in such cases. 53. Another disadvantage with this option is that it has not been implemented in any other country. There is no international experience on how well this option will work, what practical difficulties could arise and what compliance costs would be involved. The success o f this option would also depend on financial institutions agreeing to develop and implement a system. Efficiency of compliance and administration 54. While there would be some costs involved in setting up the collection system, the collection o f GST from credit and debit cards would be an automated process. Automated processes for collection have the potential to significantly lower the cost o f collection and the compliance costs. 55. There are only a relatively small number o f New Zealand credit and debit card issuers. This should make it easier for the Government to work with those involved to develop practical and realistic processes to address any implementation issues which may arise. Neutrality 56. This collection system would only collect GST on services purchased with a New Zealand issued credit or debit card. Consequently, payment by other means would not be captured under this system. For example, services paid for using overseas bank accounts including overseas domiciled credit/debit cards and consumers could also use online banking to make payments to overseas suppliers. Effectiveness and fairness 57. This option is limited to collecting GST on New Zealand issued credit and debit cards and therefore may not easily respond to future developments in the way consumers pay for services online. Therefore, the longevity o f this system could be an issue. 58. As discussed above, if the collection system cannot accurately distinguish between services consumed in New Zealand and services consumed outside o f New Zealand, there is a risk that some services will be over taxed or subject to double tax as the overseas jurisdiction may also seek to apply GST/VAT to the services. This would negatively impact the fairness o f this option. Option 4: Status quo 59. Under the status quo, GST would not be collected on supplies o f cross-border remote services and intangibles received by New Zealand residents. As a result the competitive distortions between domestic and offshore suppliers would continue and the Government would not collect $40 million on services and intangibles that are consumed in New Zealand. Certainty and simplicity 60. As GST is not collected on cross-border supplies o f services and intangibles, this option is associated with greater certainty and simplicity when compared to the other options. 10 Efficiency of compliance and administration 61. As offshore suppliers are not required to return GST on supplies o f services and intangibles to New Zealand resident consumers, there are fewer compliance and administration costs associated with this option. Neutrality 62. This option is the least neutral o f those considered, as the tax treatment o f a remote service consumed in New Zealand will depend on whether the service is purchased from a domestic or offshore supplier. These differences in tax treatment may distort consumers’ decision making, as purchases o f remote services from an offshore supplier are not subject to GST, while those from domestic suppliers are generally taxed. Effectiveness and fairness 63. Many domestic suppliers feel that the current tax settings place them at an unfair disadvantage when compared with offshore suppliers who are not required to return GST on supplies o f services and intangibles to the same customers. The perception that the GST rules are ineffective in evenly taxing consumption in New Zealand may undermine compliance with tax rules more generally. 64. Domestic suppliers may also restructure their affairs in order to take advantage o f the non-collection o f GST on services supplied from offshore. This may further exacerbate the risk to the GST base and the competitive unfairness. Summary of the analysis of the options 65. The table below summarises the impact analysis o f the options. I m p a c t s O p t io nO b j e c t i v e s m e t o r p a r t l y m e t E c o n o m ic im p a c tC o m p li a n c e c o s t & a d m i n i s t r a t i v e im p a c t F is c a l im p a c t F a ir n e s s im p a c t s Option 1: Require non-resident suppliers to register and return GST on services and intangibles supplied to New Zealand resident customers. Best meets objective (a) Best meets objective (b) This option would reduce distortions on consumers’ purchasing decisions that arise from the differences in tax treatment between domestic and offshore suppliers. This option would result in some additional compliance costs for offshore suppliers. However, this impact is mitigated by several features of the rules that are designed to reduce compliance costs. Estimated net gain in revenue of up to $40m per year. Improves fairness as offshore suppliers will largely be subject to the same rules that apply to domestic businesses. 11 Option 2: Require the New Zealand resident customer to return the GST on services and intangibles supplied by non­ residents (known as a reverse charge mechanism). Partly meets objective (a) Partly meets objective (b) This option would reduce distortions on consumers’ purchasing decisions that arise from the differences in tax treatment between domestic and offshore suppliers. However, the extent to which this occurs may depend on the extent to which there is widespread compliance with the rules. This option would impose significant compliance on New Zealand resident consumers and would result in additional administrative costs. No estimate of the fiscal impact of this option is available, though it would be expected to result in lower revenue gains than option 1 as a result of non­ compliance with the rules. This option would improve fairness in the system to the extent that neutrality between domestic and offshore suppliers can be achieved. Option 3: Require financial institutions to return the GST on credit/debit card transactions involving services and intangibles purchased from non-resident suppliers. Partly meets objective (a) Partly meets objective (b) This option would reduce distortions on consumers’ purchasing decisions that arise from the differences in tax treatment between domestic and offshore suppliers. However, the extent to which this occurs may depend on the effectiveness of the system in identifying transactions that should be subject to GST. This option could result in lower compliance costs than option 1, as there are likely to be fewer entities required to return GST and this could be achieved through automated processes. However, significant challenges in implementing the option have been identified, and it has not been adopted in other countries. The revenue impact is likely to be similar to option 1 if the system was effective at identifying transactions that should be subject to GST. This option would improve fairness in the system to the extent that neutrality between domestic and offshore suppliers can be achieved. Option 4: Retain the current GST treatment where no GST is collected on services and intangibles supplied by non­ residents. Does not meet objective (a) Does not meet objective (b) This option results in distortions on consumers’ purchasing decisions due to differences in the tax treatment between domestic and offshore suppliers. This option is not associated with significant compliance or administration costs. The revenue impact will be neutral, however, the Government will not collect $40 million on services and intangibles that are consumed in New Zealand. This option is perceived to result in significant unfairness, which may undermine compliance more generally. Further analysis on option 1: Offshore supplier registration model 66. Option 1 involves requiring non-resident suppliers to register and return GST on services and intangibles supplied to New Zealand resident customers. There are a number o f design issues for the offshore supplier registration model which require separate impact analysis. The detail design aspects o f option 1 are as follows: • zero-rating the supply o f remote services and intangibles to New Zealand GST- registered businesses; • adopting a broad definition o f remote services and intangibles (including digital services and more traditional services); • requiring offshore suppliers to register and return GST if their total supplies o f remote services and intangibles to New Zealand residents exceed $60,000 in a 12- month period. However, offshore suppliers would not be required to register if they 12 predominantly made supplies to GST-registered businesses and their supplies to New Zealand resident consumers were less than $10,000 in a 12-month period; • requiring offshore suppliers to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident on the basis o f two non-conflicting pieces o f evidence, and an alternative method may be prescribed by the Commissioner o f Inland Revenue if the offshore supplier does not have the necessary information; • implementing a simplified registration and return process to reduce compliance costs for registered offshore suppliers; • In some situations, requiring an electronic marketplace or intermediary to register instead o f the principal offshore supplier. 67. The analysis o f these design issues are summarised in the tables below. Zero-rating supplies of services and intangibles to GST-registered New Zealand businesses from the rules 68. One key design issue is whether offshore suppliers should be required to return GST on supplies o f remote services and intangibles to New Zealand GST-registered businesses, or whether GST should apply only to supplies to New Zealand-resident final consumers. I s s u eO p t io n s A d v a n t a g e sD is a d v a n t a g e s R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s Should the rules zero- rate supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses? Exclude supplies to New Zealand GST- registered businesses unless the offshore supplier and GST- registered recipient agree to zero-rate the supply. This option allows the rules requiring tax invoices to be relaxed, as unregistered recipients will not have the ability to claim back GST charged on the services they receive. This would result in lower compliance costs for offshore suppliers. This option is consistent with the approach taken in most other jurisdictions that have adopted an offshore supplier registration model for services and intangibles, and is more consistent with the draft OECD guidelines. The option to zero-rate these supplies will allow non-resident businesses to claim back any New Zealand GST incurred in making these supplies which ensures GST is neutral for these businesses. This option requires offshore suppliers to determine whether they are supplying to a registered business or an individual customer, which could require the collection of additional information in some cases. However, as other countries have adopted offshore supplier registration systems that do not require offshore suppliers to return GST on business-to-business supplies, it is likely that many suppliers have implemented systems to operate in this environment. Offshore suppliers will also be able to rely on businesses customers GST number to determine their registration status. Additionally, to further reduce compliance costs, an offshore supplier would also be able to agree with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on an alternative method of determining whether customers are GST- registered businesses. Recommended 13 69. It is proposed that if a GST-registered business is inadvertently charged GST they would need to seek a refund from the offshore supplier. However, if the value of the supply is less than $1,000, the offshore supplier could provide a tax invoice which would allow the GST-registered business the ability to claim back the GST in their normal GST return. This would reduce the compliance costs imposed on offshore suppliers associated with returning inadvertently charged GST on low-value transactions. At the same time a threshold set at $1,000 reduces the fiscal risks associated with GST-registered businesses claiming back high value amounts of GST charged by offshore suppliers. Scope of the cross-border services and intangibles that are subject to the rules 70. In designing the rules, a broad scope could be adopted that applies GST to all cross­ border supplies of remote services and intangibles. Alternatively, the rules could apply only to certain supplies of digital services and intangibles. I s s u eO p t i o n s A d v a n t a g e sD is a d v a n t a g e sR e c o m m e n d a t i o n s What services and intangibles should the rules apply to? Apply the rules to a wide range o f remote services and intangibles This option is more consistent with the broad-based GST system in New Zealand, which tends to avoid issues with classifying services into particular categories for fairness and efficiency reasons. Using a broad definition may ‘future-proof the rules, as more prescriptive legislation may need to be frequently updated to reflect changes in the types of services that become available. This option has not been implemented in other countries, though it has been announced to apply in Australia. Therefore unintended consequences could arise from a broad definition of remote services that encompasses traditional cross-border services that are supplied remotely, such as consultancy, accounting or legal services. However, these impacts may be reduced if business-to-business supplies are excluded from the rules, and if the registration threshold is set $60,000. Recommended 14 Require offshore suppliers to return GST at a rate o f 15% on all supplies to New Zealand resident consumers and businesses. This option would mean offshore suppliers would not have to determine whether they were supplying to a business or an individual customer, which may reduce compliance costs for some. This option would have little value from a revenue perspective as GST-registered businesses would be in a position to claim back GST charged. This option would pose a fiscal risk if an offshore supplier charged GST to a New Zealand business but did not pay the GST to Inland Revenue as the New Zealand business would be entitled to an input tax deduction. Not recommended 71. An exception to the broad definition of services is the supply of telecommunication services to New Zealand residents, specifically the supply of international mobile roaming services. Currently, if these services are supplied by a domestic telecommunication provider to a New Zealand resident customer abroad the services are zero-rated. At the time these rules were introduced it was considered that these services were consumed outside of New Zealand, and therefore, should not be subject to GST. 72. Under the proposed framework, where residence is used as a proxy for consumption, these services should be subject to GST as they are considered to be consumed in New Zealand. This would be consistent with the treatment of international mobile roaming services in majority of OECD countries (excluding Australia and Japan). 73. Ministers preference is to retain the current zero-rated treatment of international mobile roaming services, which is consistent with the treatment in Australia, and to keep a watching brief on any further developments in Australia. Registration threshold 74. Establishing a registration threshold for offshore suppliers of services and intangibles is intended to reduce compliance costs for small suppliers and suppliers that do not make many supplies to New Zealand residents. A lower threshold (such as NZD $10,000 of supplies to New Zealand residents over a 12 month period) or a threshold based on the domestic threshold (NZD $60,000 of supplies to New Zealand residents over a 12 month period) could be adopted. 15 Apply the rules only toThis option would This option couldNot recommended digital supplies ofapply GST only to distort consumers’ services and intangiblesdigital services that are decisions on whether to electronically delivered. purchase services Offshore suppliers maythrough digital or non- be more familiar withdigital channels.

I s s u eO p t io n sA d v a n t a g e sD is a d v a n t a g e sR e c o m m e n d a t i o n s What registration threshold should apply to offshore suppliers of remote services? A registration threshold equal to the domestic registration threshold (NZD $60,000) This option is consistent with the registration threshold that applies to domestic suppliers. This will result in competitive neutrality as offshore suppliers and domestic suppliers will be subject to the same registration requiremnts. This option would also result in lower compliance costs for suppliers that make a relatively small volume of supplies to the New Zealand market. Evidence -from other countries suggests that a small number of large suppliers account for a significant proportion of the total revenue collected from offshore registrants. A higher threshold may increase the incentive for some offshore suppliers to break up their supplies into different entities in order to stay under the registration threshold. A higher registration threshold may be associated with less revenue being collected, as fewer suppliers would be required to register and return GST on their supplies. Recommended A registration threshold that is lower than the domestic registration threshold (for example, NZD $10,000) A lower registration threshold would increase the revenue collected, though this may be outweighed by additional compliance costs for offshore suppliers. A lower threshold would be more consistent with the European Union that has no threshold, and other countries that tend to have low thresholds. A registration threshold that is lower than the domestic registration threshold may reduce the competitive neutrality between domestic and offshore suppliers. Not recommended Determining whether a customer is a New Zealand resident 75. The discussion document compared the EU approach, where an offshore supplier is required to determine where a customer has their residence based on two non-conflicting pieces of evidence (for example, payment information, customer address, and Internet Protocol (IP) address), with the proposed Australian rules, which would require them to take ‘reasonable steps’ to determine the residency status of the consumer. I s s u eO p t io n sA d v a n t a g e sD is a d v a n t a g e sR e c o m m e n d a t i o n s How should an offshore supplier determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident? A requirement to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident based on two non-conflicting pieces of evidence. This option has greater certainty and simplicity for offshore suppliers to apply. This option is also consistent with the rules that apply in the European Union and therefore offshore suppliers are likely to have already developed systems to apply this option. Some offshore suppliers may not have access to two non-conflicting pieces of evidence. To address this issue it is proposed that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be able to prescribe an alternative method to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident. Recommended 16 A requirement to take reasonable steps to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident This option allows more discretion for offshore suppliers to determine the residence of their customers. The option creates uncertainty about what would be acceptable as a “reasonable step” to determine a customer’s residence. This could increase offshore suppliers’ compliance costs. Not recommended Simplified registration and return process 76. The discussion document proposed that offshore suppliers could be required to register under the domestic system or have the option of registering under a simplified “pay only” system. 77. “Pay-only” registration systems are tailored for offshore suppliers that have no GST to claim and make payments only. The main benefit of a pay-only system is that the system can be very simple. Since these offshore suppliers are not claiming any GST they are relatively low-risk from a revenue perspective. The usual checks and balances focussed on ensuring that input tax deductions/refimd claims are correct can be relaxed. The processes and information requirements around registering for GST could also be simplified. I s s u eO p t io n sA d v a n t a g e sD i s a d v a n t a g e s R e c o m m e n d a t i o n s What registration system should offshore suppliers be required to use. Simplified ‘pay only’ registration system. A ‘pay only’ registration system may lower compliance costs for suppliers that are in a pay only position. This should encourage compliance with the rules. Administrative systems would be required to be developed. However, the development of a ‘pay only’ system can be incorporated into the Inland Revenue business transformation process. Recommended Domestic registration system. Using the domestic registration system would not require any new administrative systems. New Zealand’s domestic registration system is already, by international standards, very simple to comply with. Offshore suppliers are treated in the same way as domestic suppliers. Offshore suppliers who are only required to return GST will be subject to the same requirements and processes that are in place for suppliers who return and claim GST. This may increase the compliance costs imposed on ‘pay only’ offshore suppliers. The domestic registration system will initially be available until a ‘pay only’ system is developed as part of the Business Transformation Programme. Still available for offshore suppliers that want to return and claim GST. 17 Electronic market places 78. To further reduce compliance costs offshore suppliers who supply services via an electronic marketplace would not be required to register and return GST. The marketplace (such as an app store) would instead be treated as the supplier and be required to register. The electronic marketplace is generally in a better position to register and return GST on supplies compared with the underlying supplier. Typically, the electronic marketplace would be larger, better resourced and have a closer relationship with the customer. Requiring the electronic marketplace to register therefore may reduce compliance costs as a large number of smaller suppliers may not be required to register. CONSULTATION 79. The discussion document GST: Cross-border services, intangibles and goods was released on 18 August 2015, and sought public feedback on the proposal to require offshore suppliers of services and intangibles to register and return the GST along with a number of key design features. 80. A number of telephone conferences were held with members of the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD and the Tax Executives Institute (Indirect Tax chapter). This included a number of representatives of offshore suppliers that supply to the global marketplace, and therefore have experience with the offshore supplier registration systems that have been adopted in other countries. 81. A total of 76 submissions were received in response to the discussion document. The proposals in the discussion document were received well, with most submissions supporting the proposed approach for taxing cross-border services and intangibles. A strong theme was the importance of minimising compliance costs for offshore suppliers, to maximise compliance and reduce the risk the rules could restrict the supply of services and intangibles to New Zealand. 82. Of the 76 submissions, 23 were from individuals (30%), 8 were from offshore businesses and professional associations (11%), and 25 were from New Zealand businesses and professional associations (40%). An additional 15 submissions followed a standard form provided by a domestic industry representative. 83. The table below outlines the some of the initial proposals contained in the discussion document, the submissions received on the proposal and the recommend action following consideration of the submissions: Initial proposalSubmissions Preferred approach Basic framework of the rules The discussion document proposed that supplies of remote services and intangibles by an offshore supplier to New Zealand-resident consumers will be subject to GST. A broad definition of “services” was proposed, which includes both digital services and more 78% of submissions agreed with the proposal for services and intangibles, with 92% of submissions on the point supporting a distinction between “remote” and “on- the-spot” services. 81% of submissions agreed with a broad definition of services. The proposal in the discussion document should be retained. 18 traditional services. Supplies to New Zealand registered businesses Submissions were sought on whether offshore suppliers should be required to return GST when they supply services and intangibles remotely to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. 90% of submissions supported excluding supplies to GST- registered businesses. Supplies of remote services and intangibles to GST- registered businesses should not be subject to GST, unless the supplier and recipient agree that the supply is zero­ rated. Registration threshold The discussion document sought submissions on the level of the registration threshold, specifically whether a lower threshold (such as $10,000) or a threshold based on the domestic registration threshold ($60,000) is preferred. 19 submissions preferred a nil threshold, 1 submission preferred a $10,000 threshold and 20 submissions preferred the domestic registration threshold of $60,000 or higher. 9 submissions considered that the threshold should not count supplies to GST-registered businesses. Offshore suppliers should be required to register when their total supplies of remote services and intangibles to New Zealand residents exceed $60,000. Identifying whether a customer is resident in New Zealand The discussion document compared the European Union (EU) rules, where an offshore supplier is required to determine place of residence based on two non-conflicting pieces of evidence, with the proposed Australia rules, which require ‘reasonable steps’ to be taken. Offshore suppliers expressed a preference for rules that provide certainty and use commercially available information, including the EU rules. Submissions requested extra flexibility where two non-conflicting pieces of information are not available. It is proposed that offshore suppliers be able to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident based on two non-conflicting pieces of evidence. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue would also be able to prescribe an alternative method, in cases where two pieces of non­ conflicting evidence are not commercially available. New Zealand GST-registered businesses inadvertently charged GST If a GST-registered business is inadvertently charged GST, the business would be required to seek a refund from them, rather than claim a deduction in their GST return. 4 submissions supported this proposal, 6 submissions argued that if a registered business is incorrectly charged GST, they should be entitled to claim an input tax deduction in their GST return. If a GST-registered business is inadvertently charged GST, they should seek a refund from the supplier. If the value of the supply is less than $1,000, the offshore supplier could instead provide a tax invoice which would allow the GST-registered purchaser to claim back the GST in their normal GST return. 84. A strong theme was the importance of minimising compliance costs for offshore suppliers, to maximise compliance and reduce the risk that the rules could restrict the supply 19 of services and intangibles to New Zealand. This risk has been mitigated by designing the rules to make it as easy as possible for offshore suppliers to comply, which will be complemented by simplified registration and return processes. In addition, the registration threshold would prevent many small suppliers from being required to register under the rules. 85. In response to submissions, several legislative requirements would be relaxed to further reduce compliance costs for offshore suppliers, who would: • not be required to issue tax invoices, as supplies of GST-registered businesses would not be subject to GST at the 15% rate; • generally be able to make adjustments in their GST return to take into account refunds of inadvertently charged GST to GST-registered business customers, within two years of the original supply; and • have an automatic exception from the requirement to keep records in New Zealand and to keep records in English. 86. Recent amendments require an offshore supplier to have a fully functional New Zealand bank account in order to obtain an IRD number, in order to ensure that an offshore person is first subjected to New Zealand’s anti-money laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism rules. Offshore suppliers should be excluded from this requirement in order to reduce the compliance costs associated with registering for GST. 87. Currently, registered businesses are required to express amounts in New Zealand dollars at the time of supply. As offshore suppliers often charge customers in a foreign currency, this would involve significant compliance and transaction costs. Therefore, this requirement would be relaxed, allowing offshore suppliers to elect to convert amounts into NZD at the time of filing their return. A two year Tock-in’ rule would ensure that an offshore supplier could not gain an advantage from switching between these methods. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 88. The recommended option is to implement option one as outlined in this RIS, specifically offshore suppliers or an offshore electronic marketplace would be required to register and return GST on remote services and intangibles supplied to New Zealand resident consumers. Offshore suppliers would only be required to register if their total supplies of remote services and intangibles to New Zealand residents exceeded $60,000 in a 12-month period, unless the offshore supplier is only making supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses. 89. A broad definition of services would be adopted that would apply GST to all cross­ border supplies of remote services and intangibles (this would include digital services and more traditional services, such as legal and accounting services). This approach is consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based GST system. Offshore suppliers would be required to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident on the basis of two non-conflicting pieces of evidence, or to agree with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on an alternative method. 90. Supplies of remote services and intangibles to GST-registered businesses should not be subject to GST, unless the offshore supplier and GST-registered recipient agree to zero-rate the supply. The option to zero-rate these supplies will allow non-resident businesses to claim back any New Zealand GST incurred in making these supplies, which ensures GST is neutral for these businesses. 20 91. Out of the options considered, option one best achieves the objectives and is consistent with draft OECD guidelines on taxing cross-border services and intangibles, as well as being consistent with international practice. When similar rules have been applied in other countries anecdotal evidence is that they have been relatively successful at collecting the forgone GST. To generate a similar level of compliance for New Zealand the recommended option aims to adopt similar and consistent rules with the rules that apply in other countries. 92. Given the simplicity of the New Zealand GST system, the rules should be relatively simply to comply with compared with other countries that have different GST/VAT rates and multiple exemptions. This should further promote compliance with the rules. IMPLEMENTATION 93. Minsters’ preference is to implement the rules on 1 October 2016. Considering legislation is expected to be introduced in November 2015 (and if that legislation is enacted in the first half of 2016), this timeframe should give offshore supplies around 6 months to adapt their systems to comply with the new rules. This timeframe is consistent with submissions that suggested that offshore suppliers would need at least 6 months to adapt their systems depending upon the complexity of the rules. If there is a delay in the enactment of the legislation there is a risk that some offshore suppliers may not have enough time to adapt their system to comply with the new rules. 94. To implement the proposals, Inland Revenue is developing a simplified registration system that will be tailored to the requirements of offshore suppliers, informed by best practice in other countries and the recommendations in the draft OECD guidelines. 95. A simplified ‘pay only’ GST return will be developed as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme. The system for processing GST returns is scheduled to be replaced with a new system during the first quarter of 2017. Therefore, it is proposed that offshore suppliers could initially begin with a default six-monthly taxable period, running from 1 October 2016 to 31 March 2017. This would mean the first return offshore suppliers will file will use the simplified ‘pay only’ GST return. 96. A default six-monthly taxable period would also provide a ‘soft start’ to the new rules, for example, if an offshore supplier is late to register for GST, they would be able to backdate their registration to 1 October 2016 for up to six months without interest or penalties. During this interim period, two-monthly filing could also be allowed as an option as otherwise offshore suppliers may face foreign exchange risk during the longer 6-month period. 97. From 1 April 2017, offshore suppliers would file quarterly. This is intended to reduce compliance costs for offshore suppliers as quarterly filing periods align with filing requirements for equivalent rules in other jurisdictions. 98. Compliance costs can be further minimised by releasing clear and helpful guidance as to the operation of the new rules. Inland Revenue resources will be allocated to develop and provide tailored educational material that will be easily accessible to offshore suppliers. 21 MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 99. Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 100. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review o f legislation, and the identification o f remedial issues. Post­ implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. Opportunities for external consultation are built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result o f the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 22
