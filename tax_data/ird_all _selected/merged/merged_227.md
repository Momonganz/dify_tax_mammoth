The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings – a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (FBT) PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 00/08 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 97/6, published in Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 5 (May 1997), but its period of application is from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2004. For clarification purposes, some minor changes have also been made. BR Pub 97/6 applied to FBT periods commencing after 30 June 1997 and ending before 1 July 1999. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of paragraph (m) of section CI 1 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of a non-monetary benefit by a charitable organisation to an employee of that organisation. In this Ruling, the term “charitable organisation” has the meaning that it has in the Act for the purposes of the FBT rules. That is, in relation to any quarter or (where FBT is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) any income year, any society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund (not being a local authority, a public authority, or a university) to which, in the quarter or income year, section KC 5(1) applies. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •For the purposes of the proviso to section CI 1(m), a non-monetary benefit which is provided to an employee of a charitable organisation is not received by that employee in relation to the carrying on of a business by the charitable organisation if the employee receives the benefit in the course of an activity of the charitable organisation which involves carrying out any of the organisation’s charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes, even if income is received by the organisation in the course of carrying out that activity. •For the purposes of the proviso to section CI 1(m), a non-monetary benefit which is provided to an employee of a charitable organisation is received by that employee in relation to the carrying on of a business by the charitable organisation if the employee receives the benefit in the course of an activity which both: •cannot be characterised as carrying out any of the organisation’s charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes; and •constitutes a profession, a trade, a manufacture, or an undertaking which is carried on for pecuniary profit (even if that profit is to be applied solely for the purposes of the charitable organisation). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 4 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 14th day of August 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 00/08 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR 00/08 (“the Ruling”). Background The charitable organisation exemption from fringe benefit tax (FBT) does not apply to any benefit that is provided by a charitable organisation to an employee in the course of the employee’s employment in a business activity of the charitable organisation. The issue is whether the FBT exemption applies to benefits provided by charitable organisations that carry on their charitable objects in a business-like manner, and which have a record and expectation of making surpluses of income over expenditure. Legislation Section CI 1 defines the term “fringe benefit” for the purposes of the FBT rules. The relevant parts of that section, for the purposes of the Ruling, state: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, means any benefit that consists of - (a)The private use or enjoyment, in relation to the employee ... of a motor vehicle ... (b)The availability for the private use or enjoyment of the employee ... of a motor vehicle ... (c)Any loan that is owing, by the employee,... (d)Any subsidised transport: (e)... any contribution to any sick, accident, or death benefit fund ... (f)... any specified insurance premium or any contribution to any insurance fund of a friendly society: (g)Any contribution in relation to an employer of an employee, to any superannuation scheme: (h)Any benefit of any other kind whatever,... being, as the case may be, private use or enjoyment, availabil- ity for private use or enjoyment, a loan, subsidised transport, a contribution to a fund referred to in paragraph (e), a specified insurance premium or a contribution to an insurance fund of a friendly society, a contribution to a superannuation scheme, or a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee; but does not include - ... (m)Any benefit that, in any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) any income year, is provided or granted by or on behalf of an employer, being a charitable organisation, to an employee of the employer: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to any such benefit to the extent that the benefit is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, primarily and principally in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of, any employ- ment, in relation to the employee, that consists of any activity or activities performed by the employee in the carrying on, by the employer, of a business: \[Emphasis added\] “Business” is defined in section OB 1 as including any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit. “Charitable organisation” is defined for the purposes of the FBT rules as: ... any society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund (not being a local authority, a public authority, or a university) to which ... section KC 5(1) applies. Section KC 5(1) applies to certain named institutions (paragraphs (ae) to (bv)), and, more generally, to: (aa)A society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and the funds of which are, in the opinion of the Commissioner, applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philan- thropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 5 (ab)A public institution maintained exclusively for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ac)A fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in para- graph (aa), by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual: (ad)A public fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): “Charitable purpose” is defined in section OB 1 as including: ... every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community: The Act does not define “benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes”. Application of the legislation The charitable organisation exemption from FBT contained in paragraph (m) of section CI 1 only applies to the extent that the employee does not receive the benefit in the course of the organisation carrying on a business. The Ruling addresses the issue of when a charitable organisation will and will not be carrying on a business for the purposes of the charitable organisation exemption from FBT. “Business” is defined in section OB 1 as including “any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit”. \[Emphasis added\] The Court of Appeal in Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 considered that underlying the Act’s definition of “business” and the use of the word in the context of a taxation statute, is the fundamental notion of the exercise of an activity in an organised and coherent way that is directed to an end result—the making of pecuniary profits. The Court said that the existence of a business activity is determined on the basis of the nature of the activity and whether the taxpayer has the intention of making a pecuniary profit in carrying out that activity. The Court stated, at page 61,691: Statements by the taxpayer as to his intentions are of course relevant but actions will often speak louder than words. Amongst the matters which may properly be considered in that inquiry are the nature of the activity, the period over which it is engaged in, the scale of operations and the volume of transactions, the commitment of time, money and effort, the pattern of activity, and the financial results. Many charitable organisations engage in activities on a continuous and ongoing basis, commit time, money and effort to those activities and conduct a large volume of transactions, and so will have these characteristics of a business. The issue is therefore whether a charitable organisation that budgets for and has a record of making surpluses of income over expenditure, has the intention of making a profit. If it is carried on for profit, it will be a “business” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. English cases have held that the fact that a charity makes a profit does not mean that it is carried on “for profit”. In Trustees of the National Deposit Friendly Society v Skegness UDC \[1958\] 2 All ER 601, the House of Lords found that a charity’s objects are to advance the charitable purposes for which it is established. If profit-making is not one of its purposes, but is only a means of achieving those purposes, the charity is not carried on “for profit”. In Customs and Excise Commissioners v Bell Concord Educational Trust Ltd \[1989\] 2 All ER 217, the Court held that the question of whether or not an organisation is carried on “for profit” must be answered by reference to the objects for which that organisation is established, as contained in its constitution, and not by reference to the budgeting policy of that organisation. Thus, a charitable organisation that carries on its activities in a business-like manner and which has the intention and record of making surpluses, is not carried on “for profit”, unless the organisation’s constitution states that one of its purposes is to make a profit. As such organisations are not carried on “for pecuniary profit”, they are not carrying on a “business” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act and the FBT exemption. The Commissioner considers that Parliament did not intend the word “business” in the proviso to paragraph (m) of section CI 1 to include any charitable organisation which operates in a business-like manner and which intends to make surpluses. Such an interpretation would mean that most successful charitable organisations, in carrying on their charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes, would be carrying on businesses for the purposes of the Income Tax Act and so would be subject to FBT in respect of benefits they provide to their employees. The proviso to the exemption contained in paragraph (m) would apply to most charitable organisations, making them subject to FBT and the exemption from FBT contained in paragraph (m) would generally not apply. Only those charitable organisations that could show that they did not operate in a business-like manner, or did not intend to make surpluses, either in the short or long-term, would not be carrying on a business and would be exempt from FBT. The Commissioner considers that this wide interpretation of the word “business” in the proviso to paragraph (m) of section CI 1 is not correct. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 6 Instead, the Commissioner considers that the proviso to paragraph (m) of section CI 1 only applies to business activities which are carried on by charitable organisations but which are not, themselves, charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural activities. Such business activities may be conducted to assist the achievement of charitable purposes and the income produced by them may be applied to the charitable purpose. However, the business activities that the proviso applies to are not the intrinsically charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural activities of the organisation. A distinction between the charitable (running and administering a charity, and providing charitable services) and the non-charitable purposes of a charity was drawn in Oxfam v City of Birmingham District Council \[1975\] 2 All ER 289. That case concerned section 40 of the United Kingdom General Rate Act 1967 that applied to premises or hereditaments that were occupied by a charity and wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. The House of Lords considered whether Oxfam’s gift shops were on premises wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. The House of Lords found that, although the gift shops were used for purposes that indirectly related to the achievement of the objects of the charity (selling donated goods to raise money for the charity), the premises were not wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. In reaching this conclusion, the House of Lords drew a line between the use of premises for purposes which are the charitable purposes of the charity and the use of premises for purposes which, though purposes of the charity, are not charitable purposes. Lord Cross said (at page 293): The wording of s 40(1) of the 1967 Act shows that the Legislature did not consider that the mere fact that a hereditament in question is occupied by a charity justifies any relief from rates. That is only justified if the hereditament is being used for the ‘charitable purposes’ of the charity. So the first question which arises is: what are the ‘charitable purposes’ of a charity as distinct from its other purposes? The answer must be, I think, those purposes or objects the pursuit of which make it a charity - that is to say in this case the relief of poverty, suffering and distress. Oxfam identifies the fact that a charitable organisation can carry out both charitable and non-charitable activities. However, not all of the “non-charitable” activities carried on by a charitable organisation will constitute business activities. Only benefits provided to employees of a charitable organisation in relation to the carrying on of a business by or on behalf of the organisation will be subject to FBT. The distinction between an organisation carrying out the functions for which the organisation was established and an organisation carrying on a business was examined in Port Chalmers Waterfront Workers Union v CIR; New Zealand Waterfront Workers Union v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,059 (High Court); CIR v Port Chalmers Waterfront Workers Union (1996) 17 NZTC 12,523 (Court of Appeal). That case concerned section 61(23) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 61(23) (section CB 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994) provides an exemption from income tax for the income of a friendly society, except so far as that income is derived from business carried on beyond the circle of its membership. In Port Chalmers, the High Court drew a distinction between a friendly society carrying on a business as a trading organisation and a friendly society discharging its functions as a friendly society. It said that where the friendly society is discharging its functions as a friendly society, it is not carrying on a business even though it may conduct transactions that have a commercial flavour. This distinction was accepted by the Court of Appeal. The Ruling interprets paragraph (m) of section CI 1 as drawing a similar distinction as that drawn in Port Chalmers between the activities of a charitable organisation which discharge the purposes for which the organisation was established (the discharging of its charitable, benevolent, or philanthropic objects) and the charitable organisation carrying on a business as a trading organisation. A charitable organisation is not carrying on a business for the purposes of paragraph (m) when it discharges its charitable objects, even though it may discharge those purposes in a business-like manner. The effect of the Ruling is that the activities involved in carrying out the charitable objects of a charitable organisation, or directly facilitating the carrying out of the charitable objects (such as fundraising or administrative or clerical activities) will not be treated as being business activities for the purposes of paragraph (m). However, trading activities carried on to raise funds for the charity, which are not themselves the charitable purposes of the charity, will be treated as business activities of the charitable organisation if they satisfy the “business” test set out in the Income Tax Act, ie if those activities are carried on for the purpose of making a pecuniary profit. Thus, when a charitable organisation’s employees are engaged in carrying out the charitable purposes of the organisation, any benefits provided to them are not provided in the course of employment in a business activity of the organisation. The benefits will therefore be exempt from FBT under paragraph (m) of section CI 1. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 7 However, when a charitable organisation’s employees are engaged in activities of the organisation which are not in themselves charitable and which constitute business activities of the organisation, any benefits provided to them will be provided in the course of employment in a business activity of the organisation. These benefits will not be exempt from FBT under paragraph (m). An employee may be employed by a charitable organisation in a range of activities, some of which relate to the carrying out of the organisation’s charitable purposes or other non-business activities of the organisation and some of which are non-charitable business activities. Such an employee may receive benefits from the organisation in connection with both the business and non-business types of activities. Section CI 1(m) exempts benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations from FBT except to the extent that the benefit is received principally or primarily in relation to the employee’s employment in a business carried on by the charitable organisation. The phrase “to the extent that” does not, in this instance, mean that the benefit should be apportioned. In other contexts, it has been held that the words provide for the possibility of apportionment. However, in section CI 1(m) Parliament has also used the phrase “primarily and principally”. This use of “primarily and principally” is inconsistent with the concept of apportionment; rather the phrase means that where the requirement is for the most part true for that element, the section is satisfied completely. There is no need for an apportionment and, consequently, in the context of section CI 1(m), the phrase “to the extent that” is to be interpreted as meaning “where”. Thus, a benefit provided to an employee who engages in both the business and non-business activities of a charitable organisation will only be subject to FBT if the employee receives that benefit principally and primarily in relation to the carrying out of the organisation’s business activities. In other cases the benefit will remain exempt from FBT. As a guide, the Commissioner considers that an employee will receive a benefit principally and primarily in relation to their employment in a business activity of the organisation where: •the benefit arises primarily in connection with such a business activity, rather than in connection with a non-business activity, or •the benefit arises equally in connection with both the business and non-business activities carried out by the employee, but the employee is predominantly employed in the business activities of the employer. Note that the Ruling does not apply to employers that are local authorities, public authorities, or universities. These organisations are excluded from the definition of “charitable organisation” for the purposes of the FBT rules, so the charitable organisation exemption contained in paragraph (m) of section CI 1 does not apply to them. Fringe benefits provided by these organisations will be subject to FBT unless some other exemption applies to them. Examples It will be a question of fact in each case whether the particular activities of a charitable organisation are activities that are not the inherently charitable activities which the organisation was established to carry out and are also activities which constitute a business for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. The following activities are examples of activities likely to be characterised as not being business activities of the charitable organisation (and, hence, any benefits provided to employees of the organisation in connection with these activities will be exempt from FBT). Note that this is not intended to be an exhaustive list of such activities: •Activities directly related to carrying out the objects of the charity, but which also have an income component. For example: •A school or polytechnic established to provide education that charges fees for the provision of the educational services. •An organisation established to provide assistance to a disabled or disadvantaged group that provides services to those people for payment (eg residential accommodation services in return for board). •An organisation established to provide relief and assistance to the poor that runs a secondhand shop in order to provide affordable goods to that group. •Appeals for funds for the charity’s purposes. •Passive investment and management of the funds of the charity, as long as the charitable organisation does not carry on a business of fund investment. •Administration of the above activities. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 8 An activity that is carried on by the charitable organisation that does not involve the organisation carrying out its charitable objects, but which involves the sale of goods or services for valuable and adequate consideration on a similar basis to business enterprises carried out by private individuals and with a view to making a profit, is likely to constitute the organisation carrying on a business. Any benefits provided to employees in connection with such an activity will be subject to FBT under the proviso to paragraph (m). Example 1 A charitable trust has the principal purpose of providing education through a private school. The trust is a charitable organisation for the purposes of the FBT rules, as it is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and its funds are applied wholly or principally for charitable purposes (the advancement of education) within New Zealand. The trust charges tuition fees and has had surpluses of income over expenditure for the last three income years. It provides a car to its school principal for work and private use. The trust is not liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the private use or availability for private use of the car provided to the principal. This is because the benefit is provided by a charitable organisation to an employee who is employed in respect of the charitable organisation carrying out its charitable objects. The employee is not employed in a separate business activity carried on by the school. Example 2 A company conducts a farming business on land adjacent to the school. All the shares in the company are held for the benefit of the school charitable trust referred to in Example 1, and the company’s constitution provides that the assets and profits of the farming business must be applied exclusively to the promotion of the objects of the school charitable trust. The company provides a car to its farm manager for his work and personal use. The company is liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the provision of the car to the farm manager, because the farm manager receives the benefit in relation to his employment in a business (the farm) carried on by the company. Example 3 The same facts as in Example 2, except in this case the farming operation is carried out by the company, in a business-like manner, for the purpose of the practical component of the school’s agricultural courses. In this situation the farming operation relates to the carrying on of the educational charitable objects of the school and the availability of the car for private use by the farm manager is not subject to FBT. Example 4 A polytechnic charitable organisation offers a course on working in the hospitality industry. As part of that course the polytechnic operates a restaurant where the students gain experience in preparing food and waiting on tables. The restaurant is open to the public and patrons pay for their meals. The polytechnic provides the hospitality course supervisor with a van for restaurant use. The van is also available for the supervisor’s private use. The supervisor is employed in carrying out the polytechnic’s charitable purpose of providing education to the students in the hospitality course. Because of this, the van is not provided in relation to the supervisor’s employment in a business carried on by the polytechnic and its availability for private use is not a benefit that is subject to FBT. Example 5 A polytechnic runs a cafeteria that is open to students and the general public. The cafeteria is not operated as part of any polytechnic course. The cafeteria is an activity of the polytechnic that cannot be characterised as carrying out the polytechnic’s charitable purposes of providing education. Further, it is a commercial trading activity carried on with the intention of making a profit. The cafeteria is therefore a business run by the polytechnic. The polytechnic employs a person to prepare food for the cafeteria. Once a week, this employee is also employed by the polytechnic to provide instruction in the hospitality course run by the polytechnic. The employee therefore is employed in both the business operations (the cafeteria) and the charitable activities (providing education in the hospitality course) of the polytechnic. The polytechnic pays for the employee’s membership to an off-campus fitness centre. This benefit arises because of the employee’s employment with the polytechnic, and does not specifically arise in relation to either her employment in the cafeteria or her employment in the hospitality course. However, because the employee’s employment in the cafeteria takes up 80% of her time, the benefit arises principally and primarily in relation to her employment in a business activity of the polytechnic. The benefit is therefore not exempt from FBT under paragraph (m) of section CI 1 and will be subject to FBT. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 9 DIRECTORS’ FEES AND GST PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 00/09 directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity: •the engagement of the natural person as a director will be excluded from the term “taxable activity” due to the application of section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity; •the provision by the third party of the services of the natural person director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the third party has not been engaged as a director of a company. If the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that third party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the person’s services as a director of the company: •If a natural person is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company and the engagement is part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity: •the engagement of the natural person director will fall within the proviso to section 6(3)(b) and the services will be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity; •the provision by the third party of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. If the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that third party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the person’s services as a director of the company: •If an employee, as part of his or her employment, is engaged as a director of a third party company by way of a contract between his or her employer and the third party company: •the engagement of the employee will fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso to the section does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on a taxable activity of This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 6(3)(b), 8, and 57(2)(b). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement, occupation, or employment as a director of a company. The engagement may either be by direct contract between the director and the company for whom the person acts as a director, or by a third party appointing, or agreeing to provide, a director to a company. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •If a natural person is engaged as a director and the services are not undertaken as part of carrying on the person’s own taxable activity, the engagement will be excluded from the term “taxable activity” due to the application of section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity: •If a natural person is engaged as a director as part of carrying on his or her taxable activity, the proviso to section 6(3)(b) will apply and the services will be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. If the person is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, the person will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the directorship services: •If a natural person is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company and the person has not accepted the Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 10 the employee; •the provision by the employer of the services of a director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the employer is not engaged as a director of a company. If the employer is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that employer will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the employee’s services as a director of the company: •If an employee is engaged by a third party company to be a director of that company, where: the employee is required to account to the employer for the directors fees received; there is no contract between the employer company and the third party company; and where the employee does not undertake the services as part of carrying on his or her own taxable activity: •the engagement as director will be excluded from the term “taxable activity” due to the application of section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity; •if the employer is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, the employer is required to account for GST on the consideration received for the supply of services to the employee, i.e. permitting the employee to be a director. •If a partner in a partnership accepts an engagement as a director of a company as part of the partnership’s business: •the activity of the partner, in accepting the engagement as a director, falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso to the section does not apply as, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership in terms of section 57(2)(b); •the provision by the partnership of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the partnership is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the partner’s services as a director of the company as it is considered to be part of the normal taxable activity of the partnership. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to supplies made within the period 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of August 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 11 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 00/09 In July 1988 the Department issued PIB 175 containing, at page 26, a further item “GST on Directors’ Fees”, restricting the policy set down in PIB 164. The item advised that the proviso to section 6(3)(b) applies only to a sole trader, eg an accountant (being a registered person) who, in carrying on his or her taxable activity, is appointed a director of a company. The statement said that directors’ fees paid to a partner in a partnership or to a shareholder, director, or employee of another company are not therefore subject to GST. The reason given for this interpretation was that, in terms of the Companies Act 1955, a director could only be a natural person. Therefore, directors’ fees either paid to directors on behalf of their companies or partnerships, or paid directly to the company or partnership for directorship services carried out by their employees or partners, do not attract GST under this policy. Inland Revenue published an interpretation statement in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 4 (September 1996) on “Tax deductions from directors’ fees paid to GST-registered persons”. This interpretation statement is also relevant to the subject matter of this Ruling, even though it deals with tax deductions under the Income Tax Act 1994. The statement says, at page 3, that if an employee is acting as a director of a company on behalf of another company, the directors’ fees paid are for services rendered by the employer company. Regulation 4(2) of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (“the Regulations”) states that payments for work done or services rendered by a company are not withholding payments. Therefore, tax deductions are not required to be made from the payments. Similarly, if a company pays directors’ fees to a partnership account in return for the partner performing partnership services, the fees are business income of the partners and the Commissioner will not require tax deductions to be made under section NC 13 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Therefore, if it is the company or partnership that is providing the services of its employee or partner as a director, the question arises as to whether GST should be charged on these services as they would normally be supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity of the company or partnership. This Ruling replaces the policy items on “GST on Directors’ Fees” contained in PIBs 164 and 175. This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/09 (“the Ruling”). Background Section 6 defines the term “taxable activity” for the purposes of the Act. Under section 6(1), a person conducts a taxable activity when all of the following characteristics are present: •There is some form of activity. •The activity is carried on continuously or regularly. •The activity involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. Section 6(3) provides certain exclusions from the term “taxable activity”. Under section 6(3)(b), the activities of a salary and wage earner, or of a person in receipt of directors’ fees, are excluded from the term. Under the proviso to section 6(3)(b), if a person, in carrying on a taxable activity, accepts any office, any services supplied by that person in holding that office are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Therefore, if a GST-registered sole trader takes on a company directorship in carrying on a taxable activity, the proviso applies and GST is chargeable on the directors’ fees paid. Public Information Bulletin (PIB) 164 issued in August 1987 contained an item titled “GST on Directors’ Fees”. The item concerned the circumstances in which directors’ fees did and did not attract GST. The item listed indicators that could be used in identifying the correct GST treatment to be applied to directors’ fees. These indicators were: 1.Directors’ fees paid to directors personally, and retained by them. Not subject to GST—excluded from the meaning of taxable activity by section 6(3)(b). 2.Directors’ fees paid to directors personally, but applied by them to their partnership or business income, where the partnership or business is a registered person. Subject to GST—subject to the proviso to section 6(3)(b). 3.Directors’ fees paid directly to director’s partnership or company, where that partnership or company is a registered person. Subject to GST—a normal taxable supply. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 12 Legislation The definition of the term “person” is contained in section 2(1) of the Act and states: includes a company, an unincorporated body of persons, a public authority, and a local authority Section 2 also contains the definition of “registered person” being: ... a person who is registered or is liable to be registered under this Act. Section 6 states: (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term “taxable activity” means - (a)Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuni- ary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: (b)Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the activities of any public authority or any local authority. (2) Anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity shall be deemed to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, for the purposes of this Act the term “taxable activity” shall not include, in relation to any person, - (a)Being a natural person, any activity carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (aa)Not being a natural person, any activity which, if it were carried on by a natural person, would be carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (b)Any engagement, occupation, or employment under any contract of service or as a director of a company: Provided that where any person, in carrying on any taxable activity, accepts any office, any services supplied by that person as the holder of that office shall be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity; or ... (Emphasis added) Section 8(1), dealing with the imposition of goods and services tax, states: Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. Section 57, dealing with unincorporated bodies, states: (1) For the purposes of this section - “Body” means an unincorporated body of persons; and includes - (a)A partnership: (b)A joint venture: (c)The trustees of a trust: “Member” means a partner, a joint venturer, a trustee, or a member of any body: “Partnership” and “partner” have the same meanings as in the Partnership Act 1908. (2) Where a body that carries on any taxable activity is registered pursuant to this Act, - (a)The members of that body shall not themselves be registered or liable to be registered under this Act in relation to the carrying on of that taxable activity; and (b)Any supply of goods and services made in the course of carrying on that taxable activity shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be supplied by that body, and shall be deemed not to be made by any member of that body; and ... (Emphasis added) Section 151(3) of the Companies Act 1993 states: A person that is not a natural person cannot be a director of a company. Application of the Legislation Section 8(1) provides that GST is charged on the supply (but not an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. Therefore, one of the determining features in ascertaining whether there is a liability to account for GST, is the existence of a “taxable activity”. Another determining feature is whether the person is a “registered person”. Section 6(1) defines a “taxable activity” as an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly, and involves or is intended to involve the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. The section also includes within the term “taxable activity” the activities of any public or local authority. Under section 6(2), anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity is deemed to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Paragraphs (a), (aa), (b), (c), and (d) of section 6(3) exclude from the term “taxable activity” such activities as hobbies, employment under a contract of service and engagement as a director of a company, certain Government-type and local authority appointments, and the making of exempt supplies. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 13 The proviso to paragraph (b) states that if a person, in carrying on a taxable activity, accepts any office, services supplied by that person in holding that office are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Therefore, if a person is carrying on a taxable activity, and accepts an engagement as a company director in carrying on that taxable activity, the proviso will apply. If it is established that a taxable activity is in existence after applying section 6, the question of whether the person is liable to account for GST will depend on the application of the remaining criteria set down in section 8. One of these criteria is whether the person is a “registered person”, ie whether the person is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, which includes whether the taxable activity threshold amount in section 51 has been satisfied. Section 57(2)(b) provides that where a partnership carries on a taxable activity, any supply of goods and services made as part of carrying on that taxable activity is deemed to be supplied by the partnership and not by any of the partners. Section 151(3) of the Companies Act 1993 provides that only a natural person can be a director of a company. The following scenarios illustrate how section 6(3)(b) is applied to a person engaged as a director of a company to determine the existence of a taxable activity. It is important to note that the Ruling itself deals specifically with section 6(3)(b). If it is established that an activity does not fall within the exclusion from a “taxable activity” set down in that section, the remaining criteria under section 8 must be applied in order to determine the existence of a liability to account for GST. Note that it is the contractual relationship between the parties, founded on a genuine basis, that determines the GST treatment of the relevant transactions (Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325). A.Personal capacity A natural person is engaged as a director of a company in that person’s personal capacity and not as part of carrying on any taxable activity. The activity of this person falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) in that it involves a person who is engaged as a director of a company. The activity is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso does not apply, as the person has not accepted the engagement as part of carrying on a taxable activity. B.Carrying on a taxable activity A natural person is engaged as a director of a company as part of carrying on that person’s taxable activity. The activity of this person falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) in that it involves a person who is engaged as a director of a company. The activity is therefore prima facie excluded from the term “taxable activity”. However, as the person has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on a taxable activity, the proviso deems the services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. If the person is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, the person will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the directorship services. C.Person contracted as a company director A natural person is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company. The person is not undertaking the directorship as part of carrying on any taxable activity. The third party invoices the company for its services in providing it with a director. The engagement of the person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity. The provision by the third party of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the services of the person as a director of the company. D.Person contracted as a company director in carrying on a taxable activity A natural person, as part of carrying on a taxable activity, is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company. The third party invoices the company for providing the services of the director, who in turn invoices the third party for his or her services. The engagement of the person as a director of a company is prima facie excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). However, as the person has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on a taxable activity, the proviso to the section deems the directorship services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. The natural person’s liability for GST will therefore Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 14 depend on satisfying the remaining requirements of section 8. The provision by the third party of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) as the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the person’s directorship services. E.Employee engaged as director An employee of an employer is engaged as a director of a third party company as part of the person’s employment duties. The engagement of this person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as the person has not accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity— the person is merely carrying out employment duties. The provisions of section 6(3)(b) do not apply to the employer who is supplying the services of its employee as the employer is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the employer is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the services of the person as a director of the company. F.Employee required to pay over directors’ fees to employer Sometimes an employee is permitted to accept directorships of third party companies provided the employee accounts to the employer for the fees received. This might occur with family companies. In this type of scenario there would not be a contract between the employer and the third party company. In this situation, the engagement of the person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as the person has not accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity. The employer company, provided it is registered for GST or liable to be registered for GST, will be required to account for GST on the supply of services to the employee. These services could best be described as allowing the employee to undertake directorship duties in work time or permitting the employee to be a director. G.Partner in a partnership engaged as a director A partner in a partnership accepts an engagement as a director of a company as part of the partnership’s business. The engagement of this person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership in terms of section 57(2)(b). Therefore, the partner is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. Section 6(3)(b) does not apply in the case of the partnership as the partnership is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership supplies the services of one of its partners to the company as part of its taxable activity. The partnership will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the partner’s directorship services. Examples Example 1 Taxpayer A, who is not registered for GST, is a partner in a firm of chartered accountants. Company B engages taxpayer A as a director, and pays him fees for his services. Taxpayer A’s appointment as a director is not connected with his involvement in the partnership nor has he accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity. He retains the fees, having received them in his personal capacity. Taxpayer A is engaged as a director of a company, an activity that is excluded from the term “taxable activity” by section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply, as taxpayer A is not providing directorship services as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Taxpayer A is not required to account for GST on the fees received for directorship services. Example 2 Taxpayer B is a human resources consultant in business on her own. She is registered for GST. She accepts a company directorship as part of carrying on her taxable activity, and receives fees for her services. Taxpayer B’s engagement as a director is prima facie excluded from the term “taxable activity” in terms of section 6(3)(b). However, as she has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on her taxable activity, the proviso to the section deems the directorship services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of her taxable activity. She should therefore account for GST on the fees she is paid. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 15 Example 3 A GST-registered financial management company supplies the services of one of its specialist employees as a director of another company. Directors’ fees are paid to the company for the services provided. The engagement of the employee as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the employee has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Therefore, the employee is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. Section 6(3)(b) does not apply to the activity of the management company as that company is not engaged as a company director. The fees are paid in consideration of the management company providing the services of one of its employees to the other company. This is a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity of the management company and that company will be required to account for GST on the fees received for this supply. Example 4 A partner of a GST-registered legal partnership is elected onto the board of directors of a client company as a representative of the partnership. The partnership is providing legal advice to the company, which in turn pays fees into the partnership’s account. The engagement of the partner as a director of a company falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso to the section does not apply as, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership in terms of section 57(2)(b). Therefore, the partner is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. The provisions of section 6(3)(b) do not apply to the partnership as it is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees it receives from the company. Example 5 A GST-registered accountant in business on his own is contracted by a consulting firm to take up an engagement as a director of a company with the object of monitoring the company’s financial systems. The engagement of the accountant as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). However, as the person has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on his taxable activity, the proviso to the section deems the directorship services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of his taxable activity. The accountant will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees he receives in respect of these services. The provision by the consulting firm of the services of the accountant does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) as the firm is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the consulting firm is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, it will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the directorship services of the accountant. Example 6 Company A agrees to one of its employees taking up a directorship position with Company X on the proviso that the employee hands over the directors’ fees payable to the employee by Company X. There is no contract between Company A and Company X. The engagement of the employee as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the employee has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Therefore, the employee is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. If Company A is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, it is required to account for GST on the supply of services, ie permitting the employee to be a director of Company X. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 16 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 00/07 Government, Statutory Corporation, Bank and other securities). However the categories may be otherwise agreed between the parties. Each such transaction will constitute a SELECT Contract. 2.The Master Agreement requires that the Client enters into the Custody Agreement, which provides that Deutsche Bank AG is to be the custodian (the “Custodian”) of the Authorised Investments. This Agreement is discussed below. 3.References in this Ruling to “DBAG” are a reference to Deutsche Bank AG acting in its personal capacity pursuant to the Master Agreement, unless otherwise specified. References to the “Custodian” are a reference to Deutsche Bank AG acting as Custodian pursuant to the Custody Agreement. From an internal perspective and for internal reporting and accounting purposes, Deutsche Bank AG will undertake its duties and obligations that arise pursuant to the Master and Custody Agreements in a manner consistent with the separate capacities that those agreements give rise to. 4.The Authorised Investments for each SELECT Contract are initially acquired from DBAG. In order to purchase these initial Authorised Investments, the Client will pay to the Custodian the “Client Payment Amount”. This consists of the funds provided by the Client for the acquisition of the initial Authorised Investments which the Client will direct the Custodian to pay to DBAG. 5.Payment obligations under a SELECT Contract involve a “netting” approach. If the Client’s agreed contractual return is less than the amount actually derived from the Authorised Investments, the Client is required to pay DBAG the difference. Conversely, if the agreed contractual return is greater than the amount derived, DBAG is required to pay the difference to the Client. The formula for this is included in the Master Agreement and is to be calculated by DBAG. It requires calculating the “Amount Due” and subtracting the “DBAG Payment Amount” where: This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Deutsche Bank AG. Taxation Laws This Ruling applies in respect of the following Taxation Laws: •Sections HH 3(2), HK (1), BG 1 and the definitions of “beneficiary income” and “taxable distribution” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (the “Income Tax Act”). •Sections 3 and 14(a) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the “GST Act”). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the offering by Deutsche Bank AG, a company incorporated in Germany, of an investment product, called “SELECT”, to its clients. Under each SELECT Contract, Deutsche Bank AG acting as a custodian will accept funds from a client (the “Client”) which will be invested in securities, referred to as “Authorised Investments”. The Client will receive an agreed return subject to the terms governing the SELECT Contract. The Arrangement is governed by two agreements - the Secure Look-Through Enhanced Customised Transaction Master Agreement (the “Master Agreement”) and the Secure Look-Through Enhanced Customised Transaction Custody Agreement (the “Custody Agreement”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. The Master Agreement 1.The parties to the Master Agreement are the Client, Deutsche Bank AG (“DBAG”) (acting through its New Zealand branch), and Deutsche New Zealand Limited (the “Manager”). The Master Agreement provides that from time to time the parties may enter into transactions pursuant to which the Client may request the Manager to buy Authorised Investments as agent for the Client. These may be “Series 1 Authorised Investments” (generally DBAG, Government, Statutory Corporation and Bank securities) or “Series 2 Authorised Investments” (generally DBAG, Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 17 (i)The Amount Due is the total amount (including interest, principal and other amounts) due to the Client under the Authorised Investments held under the relevant SELECT Contract, notwithstanding that the amount actually received by the Custodian may be less than the total amount due; and (ii)The DBAG Payment Amount is the amount payable on the relevant Payment Date as specified in the relevant confirmation of the SELECT Contract. 6.The Manager has wide powers to deal with and act in respect of the Authorised Investments. To this end, the Client directs the Custodian to act on any instructions given by the Manager. Any profits or losses derived from dealings with the Authorised Investments by the Manager are for the account of DBAG. 7.DBAG and the Manager have only the duties in respect of the Authorised Investments that are expressly provided for in the Master Agreement. The main obligations of DBAG in respect of the SELECT Contracts are: (i)To deliver a confirmation of a SELECT Contract to the Client on the Client entering into that SELECT Contract; (ii)To provide the initial Authorised Investments, and to accept the Client Payment Amount from the Custodian as payment for these securities; (iii)To deliver to the Custodian all Authorised Investments purchased on behalf of the Client; (iv)To make payments to the Client when required, and to calculate such payments; (v)To ensure only “Authorised Investments” as defined in the Master Agreement are purchased by the Manager; (vi)To ensure that at the time of purchase the Authorised Investments are securities which have at least a Standard & Poor’s rating of BBB- or better; (vii)To pay default interest in relation to each amount due and payable by it to the Client or the Manager but unpaid at the due date for payment; (viii)To ensure that the Authorised Investments under each SELECT Contract have a face value of not less than the amount specified in the confirmation of the SELECT Contract; (ix)To act in good faith and have regard to the interests of the Client; (x)Where requested by the Client, to provide a report detailing the particulars of the Authorised Investments held on behalf of the Client; (xi)Where requested by the Client, to repurchase a SELECT Contract (the sale being arranged and effected by the Manager); (xii)To notify the Client if a “termination event” occurs; (xiii)Where a termination event only affects some of the Authorised Investments under a SELECT Contract, to amend the terms of that SELECT Contract as required; and (xiv)Not to deal with its rights or obligations under the Master Agreement without the written consent of the other party. 8.Where an “automatic termination event” occurs, there is deemed to be a sale of the affected Authorised Investments to DBAG on that date. The Custody Agreement 9.The Custody Agreement is entered into between the Client and Deutsche Bank AG (the “Custodian”) (acting through its New Zealand branch). The Agreement appoints the Custodian to hold each SELECT Portfolio as “bare trustee and custodian” for the benefit of the Client. Beneficial ownership of the SELECT Portfolios is retained by the Client. 10.The SELECT Portfolios comprise the Client Payment Amount, the securities purchased as Authorised Investments and held on behalf of the Client in respect of a SELECT Contract, and any money or interest received in respect of these securities. 11.The Custodian has only the duties, rights, powers and discretions in respect of the SELECT Portfolios as set out in the Custody Agreement. Namely: (a)the Custodian shall not deal with any part of any SELECT Portfolio except in accordance with the directions of the Client; (b)the Custodian shall act at all times in good faith towards and have regard to the interests of the Client; and (c)the Custodian shall provide the following services: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 18 (i)hold each SELECT Portfolio in safe custody; (ii)keep each SELECT Portfolio separate from each other SELECT Portfolio and not mix the portfolio with the assets of the Custodian; (iii)maintain records which enable the Authorised Investments allocated to a SELECT Contract to be identified; (iv)hold legal title to any Authorised Investments or money forming part of a SELECT Portfolio as bare trustee for the benefit of the Client; (v) pay the Client Payment Amount to DBAG in payment of the purchase price of the initial Authorised Investments acquired from DBAG (the Client irrevocably and unconditionally directs the Custodian to do this); (vi)account to the Client on each Payment Date relating to a SELECT Contract for any interest, principal or other amount actually received by the Custodian in respect of Authorised Investments under that SELECT Contract; (vii)account to the Client as and when required under the terms of the Custody Agreement for the net proceeds of sale of any Authorised Investments held by the Custodian under a SELECT Contract; (viii)deduct from any amount payable by the Custodian to the Client any amount owing by the Client to DBAG in respect of the SELECT Contract and pay it to DBAG (the Client irrevocably and unconditionally directs the Custodian to do this); (ix)make payments to DBAG when required (the Client irrevocably and unconditionally directs the Custodian to do this); (x)act on any instructions from the Manager in relation to the delivery of Authorised Investments to enable the Manager to exercise the power of acquisition, disposal or exchange, as if those instructions had been given to the Custodian by the Client directly (the Client irrevocably and unconditionally directs the Custodian to do this); (xi) if directed by the Client, transfer the whole of a SELECT Portfolio held by the Custodian under a SELECT Contract to an entity nominated by the Client; (xii)credit all money and other amounts received by the Custodian in respect of the Authorised Investments to the Custodian’s account with DBAG (the Client irrevocably and unconditionally directs the Custodian to do this); and (xiii)execute all documents and assurances and do all acts which are necessary, desirable or incidental to the exercise of its powers and obligations described in the Custody Agreement. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following assumptions: a)The Clients entering into the SELECT Contracts are sui juris. b)The Custodian may not buy, sell, or otherwise deal with the SELECT Portfolios, otherwise than at the express direction of the Client or pursuant to clause 3.2 of the Custody Agreement. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 19 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Gross income arising from or related to the Authorised Investments of a Client held by the Custodian under the Custody Agreement will be derived by that Client in terms of section BD 1 of the Income Tax Act, and will not be derived by the Custodian, as the arrangement whereby the Custodian holds legal title to the Authorised Investments on behalf of the Clients will constitute a bare trust. •For the purposes of sections HH 3(2) and HK 1 of the Income Tax Act, the Custodian will not derive an amount from the Authorised Investments that is “beneficiary income” or a “taxable distribution” (as those terms are defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act) for which a trustee is liable to tax as agent of the beneficiary as the arrangement whereby the Custodian holds legal title to the Authorised Investments on behalf of the Clients will constitute a bare trust. •Section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act does not apply to negate or vary the conclusions outlined above. •Supplies made by the Custodian as specified in the Custody Agreement and outlined in paragraph 11(c), with the exception of the payment by the Custodian to DBAG of any amounts owing by the Client in accordance with the Master Agreement (subparagraph (viii)), are exempt from goods and services tax under section 14(a) of the GST Act. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 13 July 2000 to 12 July 2003. This Ruling is signed by me on the 13th day of July 2000. John Mora Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 20 NEW LEGISLATION DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENT WITH RUSSIA PROGRESSING •Pensions paid by the government of either state can be taxed in both states (although in the case of the state of residence of the recipient, the taxing right is limited to 50% of the amount of the pension. All other pensions and annuities are to be taxed solely by the state of residence. •Certain forms of discriminatory tax treatment between non-residents by either tax authority are prohibited. Russians living or carrying on a business in New Zealand will enjoy similar benefits. The full text of the double tax agreement is available on the website of the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz The double tax agreement between New Zealand and the Russian Federation moved a step closer to realisation with the signing of the agreement by both countries in Wellington on 5 September 2000. The agreement is expected to help reduce the costs of New Zealanders doing business in Russia, by reducing tax impediments to cross-border trade and investment. The double tax agreement with Russia will not enter into force until each country has completed its domestic procedures for giving legal effect to the signed agreement. In New Zealand, this involves an Order in Council, although a more complex procedure applies in Russia. It is expected that the agreement will enter into force in time for the double tax agreement to apply from 1 January 2001 for New Zealand withholding tax, and from the 2001–2002 income year for all other New Zealand income tax. The main features of the agreement are: •New Zealanders will pay non-resident withholding tax of no more than 15% for dividends derived from Russia, 10% for interest, and 10% for royalties. •The profits of New Zealand businesses will generally be exempt in Russia if the business is of a temporary nature. •Mobile activities, such as consultancy, building and construction sites, installation and assembly projects, and natural resource exploration and exploitation, must be conducted in Russia for more than 12 months before Russia can tax the income. •Income from professional services can be taxed in Russia only if the person performing the services is present for more than 183 days or has a fixed base there. •New Zealand employees working in Russia will generally not be taxed by Russia unless they spend more than 183 days there. •Profits from insurance, coastal shipping, domestic air transport and real property (including agriculture and forestry) can be taxed in the country in which they are situated, even if the activity is of a temporary nature. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 21 INTERPRETATION STATEMENTS This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. ASSETS UNDER CONSTRUCTION – DEPRECIATION (iv)Intangible property other than depreciable intangible property: (v)Property which the taxpayer has elected to treat as low value property under section EG 16: (vi) Property the cost of which is allowed as a deduction under any of sections BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii), DJ 6, DJ 11, DL 6, DM 1, DO 3, DO 6, DO 7, DZ 1, DZ 3, EO 5, EZ 5, and EZ 6, or by virtue of an amortisation or other similar deduction allowed under any section of this Act such as sections DJ 9, DL 2, DO 4, DO 5, and EO 2, other than sections EG 1 to EG 15 and section EG 18: (vii)Property which will not, in respect of the taxpayer, decline in value as a result of any right of the taxpayer to receive compensation for any decline in value on disposition of that property: (viii)Property the cost of which was or is allowed as a deduction in any income year to any other taxpayer under any of sections DO 3, DZ 2, DZ 3 and DZ 4 of this Act (or any of sections 127, 127A and 128 of the Income Tax Act 1976 or sections 119, 119D and 119G of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954): (ix)Property that the taxpayer elects under section EG 16A to treat as not depreciable: Section EG 1(1) allows a deduction for depreciation: Subject to this Act, a taxpayer is allowed a deduction in an income year for an amount on account of depreciation for any depreciable property owned by that taxpayer at any time during that income year.

In determining whether or not an asset still under construction can be depreciated for tax purposes, several criteria must be satisfied. Firstly, section EG 1(1) requires that the property in question must be owned by the taxpayer and must constitute “depreciable property”, as that term is defined in section OB 1. Secondly, the property must be used or available for use for some purpose by the taxpayer (section EG 2(1)). These criteria will be considered in this statement. As well, the method for calculating the deduction allowed for depreciation under section EG 2(1) will be addressed. Legislation All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Section OB 1 defines the term “depreciable property” as: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,– “Depreciable property”, in relation to any taxpayer,– (a)Means any property of that taxpayer which might reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use by persons– (i) In deriving gross income;

and (ii) In any case where the straight-line method is being used, the cost of the property to the taxpayer (excluding any expenditure of the taxpayer allowed as a deduction under any provision of this Act other than sections EG 1 to EG 15 and EG 18); and cis the number of whole or part calendar months in the income year in which the property is owned by the taxpayer and used or available for use for any purpose by the taxpayer: (b)In the case of schedule depreciable property, an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a x b x c / 365 where– ais the annual depreciation rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable in that income year to the property and to the depreciation method used by the taxpayer in respect of the property; and bis– (i) In any case where the diminishing value method is being used, the adjusted tax value of the property at the end of the income year before any deduction for depreciation in that income year has been made; and (ii) In any case where the straight-line method is being used, the cost of the property to the taxpayer; and cis the number of whole or part days in the income year in which the property is owned by the taxpayer and is used or available for use for the purposes of deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving gross income: (c)The adjusted tax value of the property at the end of the income year immediately before the deduction of any amount on account of depreciation for that income year: (d)Where the property is a motor vehicle to which section DH 1(3) applies, an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: d x e where– dis the amount of the deduction calculated in accordance with paragraph (a) of this subsection in respect of the motor vehicle; and eis the proportion of business use to total use of the vehicle for the income year (expressed as a decimal) calculated in accordance with sections DH 2 to DH 4: (e)where– (i)The property is, at any time during the income year, not wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income; and (ii)Any use other than in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income is not subject to fringe benefit tax under this Act; and (iii) The property is not a motor vehicle to which section DH 1(3) applies,– an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: d x f / g where– dis the amount of the deduction calculated under paragraph (a) of this subsection in respect of the property; and fis the number of days or other appropriate units of measurement (whether relating to time, distance, or otherwise) in the income year (or in such lesser period as that property was owned by the taxpayer in that income year), being days or other appropri- ate units of measurement for which– (i) The property was physically used or operated to produce gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of producing gross income; or (ii)Fringe benefit tax was payable in respect of the use of the property; or (iii) The property was not physically used or operated for any purpose whatever but was available for the purpose set out in subparagraph (i); and gis the total number of days or other units of measurement (being the same units of time or other measurement as are used in item f) for which the depreciable property was used or available for use for any purpose in the income year (or in such lesser period as the property was owned by the taxpayer in that income year). ... 2(2A) In this section and in section EG 16, if at any time an asset owned by a taxpayer is temporarily under repair or under inspection, and if immediately before that time the asset was used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, the asset is to be regarded as available for use for either purpose during the period of repair or inspection. Application of the legislation Depreciable property Before any asset can be depreciated, section EG 1(1) requires it to constitute “depreciable property” owned by the taxpayer. The term “depreciable property” is defined in section OB 1. According to this definition, an asset under construction by a taxpayer becomes depreciable property of that taxpayer when it is in such Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 23 a state that it may reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Thus, before calculating the depreciation deduction allowable under section EG 2(1), three criteria must be met. Firstly, the asset under construction must constitute “property”. Secondly, it must be owned by the taxpayer. Thirdly, it must reasonably be expected under normal circumstances to decline in value while used or available for use in deriving gross income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. These three criteria will be considered in turn. Property Firstly, the assets under construction must constitute “property”. The term “property” is not defined in the Act for the purposes of subpart EG (except that it includes consents granted in or after the 1996–1997 income year under the Resource Management Act 1991) (definition of “property” in section OB 1). The ordinary meaning of the term, as defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary of Current English, 8 th ed., is as follows: 1 a something owned; a possession, esp. a house, land, etc. b Law the right to possession, use, etc. c possessions collec- tively, esp. real estate ... This gives a wide meaning to the term, with the two aspects of ownership or right to possession being similarly recognised in law, depending on the context in which the term is used. For example, Stroud’s Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases, 5 th ed., (London: Sweet & Maxwell Limited, 1986), at page 2,057, states: “Property” is the generic term for all that a person has dominion over. Its two leading divisions are (1) real, and (2) personal; ... Butterworths New Zealand Law Dictionary, 4 th ed., (Wellington: Butterworths of New Zealand Ltd, 1995) similarly states: property 1. A thing owned, that over which title is exer- cised, whether tangible or intangible, real or personal. 2. A title to or right of ownership in goods or other property. In order to determine the meaning of “property”, as that term is used in the definition of “depreciable property”, it is necessary to consider the context in which the term is used. As Nicholls LJ stated at page 953 of Kirby (Inspector of Taxes) v Thorn EMI plc \[1988\] 2 All ER 947: “Property” is not a term of art, but takes its meaning from its context and from its collocation in the document or Act of Parliament in which it is found and from the mischief with which that Act or document is intended to deal: see Lord Porter in Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd \[1940\] 3 All ER 549 at 574 ... Applying the ordinary meaning of “property” to the definition of “depreciable property” in section OB 1, the term is used in the phrase “property of that taxpayer”. In its ordinary meaning, then, this connotes an item that is owned by the taxpayer or which the taxpayer has the right to possess and use. In the light of the wording of section EG 1(1), however, depreciable property not owned by the taxpayer will not qualify for a depreciation deduction. Hence, in the context in which it is used in the definition of “depreciable property” and in section EG 1(1), an asset under construction will constitute “property” according to its ordinary meaning provided it is a possession of the taxpayer; something which the taxpayer owns and has the right to use as desired. The concept of “property” being a thing that the taxpayer owns also fits with the legal sense of the term. Owned by the taxpayer Secondly, as noted above when considering the term “property”, the property consisting of assets under construction must be owned by the taxpayer in order to qualify for a depreciation deduction under section EG 1(1). An interpretation statement on the issue of the Commissioner’s view of what constitutes being “owned or acquired” is being prepared for future publication. Declining in value Thirdly, the assets under construction must reasonably be expected to decline in value while used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Since a decline in value must reasonably be expected, the asset will generally have a limited useful life and an asset expected to retain its value or to appreciate in value over time will not meet this criterion. For example, an original work of art will not generally constitute depreciable property since it would not be expected, in normal circumstances, to decline in value while used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income (see the item on this issue in Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 10, No 9 (September 1998) at page 12). Additionally, it is considered that in order to meet this criterion the whole or some part of the asset under construction must be able to be used in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. That is, the whole or part of the asset, as the case may be, must be in such a state that a person, at the point in time that a depreciation deduction is sought, could use it in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Actual use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for this purpose is not necessary to meet this criterion, given that the Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 24 wording of the definition specifically includes property merely available for use. Nevertheless, whether the property is used, or merely available for use, in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, it is necessary for the property to be able to be used for this purpose. Example 1 – raw materials Z Limited wishes to build a piece of machinery to use in its manufacturing business. It purchased all the component material in December 1998, but did not complete the machine until June 1999. At no time before its completion was the machine able to be used in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. No depreciable property exists until June 1999 when the machine is completed since, before completion, it could not be used in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Thus, since no depreciable property existed until June 1999, depreciation deductions will not be allowed before this time. Depreciation calculation Having determined that an asset under construction constitutes depreciable property, the deduction allowed for depreciation is calculated under section EG 2(1). This section details various formulæ in limbs (a) to (e) with the deduction allowed being the smaller of the values calculated under these limbs. Unlike the definition of “depreciable property”, the formulæ in section EG 2(1) focus on the use or availability for use by the taxpayer. This is an important distinction. Whereas it is conceivable that any piece of equipment, say, could meet the definition of “depreciable property”, no depreciation will be allowed unless the taxpayer will use it or has it available for use. Thus, the better view of the wording of the formulæ in section EG 2(1) is that it favours the interpretation that a deduction for depreciation is only allowed when the “depreciable property” is in a state which the taxpayer uses it, or intends to use it for some purpose (ie it is available for such use). This is considered further when looking at incomplete assets. For non-schedule depreciable property, limb (a) of section EG 2(1) gives the maximum amount allowed to the taxpayer as a deduction. Limb (a) states that the depreciation deduction allowed to the taxpayer is equal to the annual depreciation rate for the asset being depreciated, multiplied by the cost or adjusted tax value of the depreciable property (depending on whether the straight-line or diminishing value method is used). The value so obtained is then multiplied by the proportion of the income year (in months) that the depreciable property was owned by the taxpayer and used or available for use for any purpose by the taxpayer. This limb (or limb (b) in the case of schedule depreciable property) will apply in the case of assets whose construction is complete and which are wholly used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. In this regard, under section EG 2(2A), temporary unavailability of depreciable property, while being repaired or inspected, is treated as a time when the property is being used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, provided that immediately before this time the depreciable property was so used or available for use. It follows that, given that the repair of an asset will often be delayed until appropriate personnel are available to repair it, the legislative intent of section EG 2(2A) is that the provision would also apply when a damaged asset is awaiting repair, provided that immediately before the time the asset was damaged, it was used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. This is because the asset would have been inspected after the damage occurred in order to ascertain the extent of the damage and the repair needed. However, in the context of section EG 2(2A), the word “repair” does not apply to reconstruction or the like. “Repair”, as a revenue concept versus a capital one, has been considered in the courts in the context of allowable deductions for income tax purposes. The better view of the use of the term “repair” in section EG 2(2A) is one that fits with the type of work, the cost of which would be an allowable deduction under section BD 2. Example 2 – temporary unavailability Y Limited has built itself a new $2 million factory, completing the construction in April 1999. The depreciation rate for the building is 1% per annum. The company did not shift its business into the new factory until July 1999, and in the meantime the factory stood empty. In June 1999, massive flooding caused damage to the empty factory, making it unusable until repairs were carried out at the end of that month. The company wishes to calculate the deduction allowed for depreciation for the income year ended 31 March 2000. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 25 Since the factory was available for use in deriving gross income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, immediately before the flood damage occurred, section EG 2(2A) deems the time that it was unavailable while awaiting repair and being repaired, as a time when the property was being used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Hence, after its completion, the factory was at all times during the income year, either used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Therefore, limb (a) of section EG 2(1) provides for a deduction for depreciation for the year ended 31 March 2000 of: 0.01 x 2,000,000 x 12 / 12 = $20,000 If the depreciable property is not wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, and any other use is not subject to fringe benefit tax, limb (e) will generally apply. The two exceptions are motor vehicles subject to section DH 1(3), which will be subject to limb (d), and schedule depreciable property where limb (b) provides the formula for apportionment. Limb (e) limits the deduction allowed for depreciation by apportioning the amount calculated under limb (a). The apportionment is calculated by determining the time, or other appropriate unit of measurement, in which: •the property is physically used in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income; or •fringe benefit tax is payable on its use; or •the property is not physically used for any purpose, but is available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, expressed as a fraction of the total time (or other appropriate unit of measurement) that the property is used or available for use for any purpose by the taxpayer. Regarding assets under construction, in two situations the asset will not be wholly used for deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income: •the asset is complete, but not wholly used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income; or •the asset is not yet complete, but nevertheless constitutes depreciable property, ie a part of the asset is capable of being used in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Asset complete but not wholly used or available for use If an asset is complete, but is not being wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, a straightforward application of the formula in limb (e) is required, with the unit of measurement used being dependent upon the type of asset in consideration. Example 3 – completed asset not wholly used for deriving gross income X, a sole trader, has built a $120,000 house for renting out, completing it on 21 June 1999. The depreciation rate for the house is 2% SL per annum. However, although the owner advertised the availability of the house from the time of its completion until the end of September 1999, he was unable to find a tenant. From 1 October 1999, the owner allowed a refugee family to live in it at no cost for a fixed period of seven months. On 30 April 2000, the refugee family shifted out and a rent-paying tenant shifted in. The owner wishes to calculate the depreciation deduction allowed for the income year ended 31 March 2000. As the house was used or available for use from its completion on 21 June 1999, the amount calculated under limb (a) of section EG 2(1), is: 0.02 x 120,000 x 10 / 12 = $2,000 While the house was occupied by the refugee family at no cost, it was not used nor available for use by X in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Therefore, an apportionment is required under limb (e) of section EG 2(1). The apportionment will be calculated according to the number of days that the house was available for use in deriving gross income (22 June 1999 to 30 September 1999, inclusive) expressed as a ratio of the number of days in the income year that it was used or available for use for any purpose (22 June 1999 to 31 March 2000, inclusive), giving a deduction of: 2,000 x 101 / 284 = $711.27 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 26 Asset incomplete but a part is capable of use An issue arises where an asset’s construction is not yet complete, but a part is capable of being used by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. In this situation, as emphasised at the beginning of this discussion on the calculation of depreciation, the use or availability for use of the completed part, which will determine the depreciation deduction allowed, must be that of the taxpayer in question. Because a part of a yet-to-be-completed asset is capable of some use, or could be used by some other person in deriving gross income, does not mean that any deduction is allowed under section EG 2. Bearing this in mind, in this situation the application of limb (e) is also appropriate, since the incomplete asset cannot be wholly used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income (sublimb (i)). However, it is acknowledged that the specific wording of the formula in the limb creates some difficulties in applying it to such a situation. This can be seen from item “f” of the formula, which envisages that the depreciable property will be wholly used by the taxpayer but for only some of the time, or for only some of the distance travelled, etc. In the case of an incomplete asset, but where a part is capable of being used by the taxpayer, it is only that part which will be used—the whole cannot be used because it has yet to be completed. However, since the incomplete asset constitutes property owned by the taxpayer that had a cost, and is being used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, it is considered that in such a situation a court would interpret the wording of the formula broadly in order to allow a depreciation deduction. Therefore, in order to apply the formula to the case of an asset under construction, where a part is used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, it is necessary to apportion the depreciation deduction allowed under limb (a) by comparing the completed part to the whole asset to be constructed. While the wording of the formula is not ideal to effect this comparison, it is considered that a court would adopt an apportionment reflecting the cost of that part of the asset that is capable of being used by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for this purpose (and is not used for another purpose), expressed as a ratio of the cost to date of the asset being constructed. Such an approach is consistent with the statutory interpretation principles outlined by Lord Donovan in Mangin v CIR \[1971\] NZLR 591 at page 594: Thirdly, the object of the construction of a statute being to ascertain the will of the Legislature it may be presumed that neither injustice nor absurdity was intended. If therefore a literal interpretation would produce such a result, and the language admits of an interpretation which would avoid it, then such an interpretation may be adopted. In this regard, the legislative intent of section EG 2(1) was to apportion the deduction for depreciation allowed under limb (a) when depreciable property was not wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Except for specific types of property (eg schedule depreciable property and motor vehicles), no other limb of section EG 2(1) allows for such an apportionment except for limb (e). Therefore, it is considered that limb (e) was intended by legislature to deal with all other situations where the depreciable property was not wholly used or available for use by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. An apportionment by way of a cost comparison gives a fair result that a court would be likely to adopt. It is acknowledged that this approach requires the costs between the complete and incomplete parts to be apportioned. In some instances it will be possible to directly attribute certain expenditure to the complete or incomplete parts, as the case may be. For example, wallpapering and carpeting the completed ground floor of a building is directly attributable to that part, whereas a lift servicing the upper floors is directly attributable to those floors and not attributable to a completed ground floor. In other situations, it is necessary to apportion costs between the complete and incomplete portions. For example, since the foundations of a five-storey building equally support all floors, the cost of the foundations could be apportioned equally across the five floors. Whether certain expenditure should be apportioned equally or not, however, will depend on the particular facts. For example, where the painting costs of the exterior of a four-storey building need to be apportioned, and the ground floor is twice the height of each of the other floors, an equal apportionment would not be appropriate since twice as much paint and painting time would be needed for the ground floor. In these circumstances, an appropriate apportionment of the expenditure on paint and painting would be 2 / 5 for the ground floor and 3 / 5 for the remainder. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 27 Example 4 – incomplete asset partly available for use W Limited is building a 10-storey office block to be depreciated at 1% per annum. In July 1999, the bottom floor was completed and available for leasing out as retail space. The space was duly leased in September 1999. The remaining floors were not completed until May 2000, with no part able to be used before that time in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. The company wishes to calculate the depreciation deduction allowed for the income year ended 31 March 2000. At 31 March 2000, a total of $5 million has been spent on the building. Of this total, $650,000 has been spent fitting out the bottom floor. A further $500,000 has been incurred on installing the lift. All other expenditure is considered to be attributable to each floor equally. Following completion of the bottom floor (July 1999), the Commissioner considers that the better interpretation of the law is that the entire office block constitutes depreciable property since it was property owned by the company, which was able to be used by the taxpayer in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, and which would reasonably be expected in normal circumstances to decline in value while so used or available for use. Hence, subject to section EG 2(1), a deduction for depreciation will be allowed. The amount calculated under limb (a) of section EG 2(1) for the income year ended 31 March 2000 is: 0.01 x 5,000,000 x 9 / 12 = $37,500 Under limb (e) of section EG 2(1), this amount is apportioned according to the cost of the bottom floor as a proportion of the total cost to date for the building. The cost of the bottom floor is as follows: Fitting out the floor650,000 Lift (considered to be attributable to the upper floors only) – All other costs ( 1 / 10 x (5,000,000 – 650,000 – 500,000)) 385,000 $1,035,000 Applying the formula in limb (e) of section EG 2(1) gives a deduction of: 37,500 x 1,035,000 / 5,000,000 = $7,762.50 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 28 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 29 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We’ve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported.

These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. WHETHER TAXPAYER WAS INVOLVED IN A TAX AVOIDANCE ARRANGEMENT Case:BNZ Investments Ltd v CIR Decision date:10 July 2000 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Tax avoidance Facts BNZ Investments Limited (“BNZI”) entered into four transactions in 1989. Each of them involved subscription in $100 million worth of redeemable preference shares (“RPS”) in special purpose companies. These shares had a fixed, predetermined dividend payable and were to be redeemed for value at the end of the transaction. But because dividends were tax-exempt between companies at that time, BNZI paid no tax on them. The special-purpose companies used the proceeds from the share subscription to invest (through a series of transactions and other special purpose companies) in interest-bearing deposits overseas. By a series of “downstream” transactions, the interest flows were transferred across the border back to the New Zealand special purpose companies without having been taxed, thereby enabling these companies to pay the stipulated dividend to BNZI. So BNZI received a substantial benefit in the form of greater tax-free dividends. In 1995 Inland Revenue assessed the dividend receipts to BNZI under the general anti-avoidance section (then section 99 Income Tax Act 1976). The taxpayer challenged the correctness of that assessment, and proceedings were filed in the Wellington High Court in 1997. The issues were: 1.What was the relevant arrangement? 2.If the relevant arrangement included BNZI: 2.1Was there no avoidance because a company in the structure resident in New Zealand raised a tax liability? 2.2Whether each structure had more than an incidental purpose or effect of avoidance? 3.If BNZI was not party to a tax avoidance arrangement, whether a tax avoidance arrangement existed from which it obtained a tax advantage, which could be taxed? 4.If BNZI obtained a tax advantage from a tax avoidance arrangement, what was the size of the tax advantage? 5.Whether interest is chargeable on any tax properly assessed? Decision McGechan J held on the first issue that there was no arrangement in terms of section 99(1) which included BNZI. To be a party to an arrangement one must have conscious (albeit, perhaps, only tacit) involvement in it. To suspect, or to have grounds for suspicion, or even to know, do not of themselves predicate involvement in a “contract, agreement, plan or understanding”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 30 On the second issue, had it been necessary to decide, in respect of two of the four transactions, a downstream entity in each was liable to tax under the accruals rules, so there could have been no tax avoidance. Seemingly, these two transactions were not tax avoidance transactions for additional reasons, independent of the conclusion that a downstream entity was taxable. The reasons for this involve a distinguishing of this situation from the leading tax avoidance judgment Challenge Corporation Limited v CIR \[1986\] 2 NZLR 513. McGechan J found that the individual steps in the arrangement had tax consequences under the Act and carried individually and collectively the necessary alterations to financial position. Money was paid out and the entities carried risks as to returns and repayment. As he put it, “\[t\]here were risks. In contrast to the Challenge Group, \[the downstream entities\] did ‘risk’ and did ‘spend’ although (unless one takes in payments under the tax indemnities as a result of the Commissioner’s subsequent actions) \[they\] did not ‘lose’. \[The downstream entities\] carried real indemnity risks.” In respect of the other two transactions, they were tax avoidance transactions. But, as stated above, BNZI was not a party to them, so this finding was irrelevant. On the third issue, McGechan J considered that, as he had found that BNZI was not a party, the issue did not arise. On the fourth issue, had it been an issue, the Commissioner’s reconstruction was excessive. On the last issue, if it had been relevant, use-of-money interest was chargeable. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 12, No 9 (September 2000) 31 CORRECT METHOD OF APPEALING CHALLENGE-BASED DECISIONS OF TRA Case:CIR v Lesley Dick and Bruce Grierson Decision date:3 August 2000 Act:Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 (TRA Act) Summary The CIR was successful in his interlocutory application to file a Notice of Appeal. Facts This was an appeal from Case T50 and Case U7. The Commissioner commenced his appeal in the High Court using a Case on Appeal. This was standard for appeal objection-based decisions of the TRA under section 26 TRA Act. However, there was no clear procedure for appealing challenge-based decisions of the TRA under section 26A of the TRA Act. Further it was not clear whether Part IX or Part X of the High Court Rules applied to the Commissioner’s appeal (there being contradictory statements from different judges in the cases). In the absence of a clear procedure the Commissioner prepared a case on appeal. The taxpayer trustees sought to strike out the appeal on the basis that the wrong procedure had been used and that it was frivolous and vexatious. Decision Glazebrook J found the Commissioner’s case on appeal was the inappropriate way to proceed for challenges. She considered that the procedure at section 26 of the TRA Act could not be used for section 26A of the TRA Act. She held that there was a clear procedure set out in Part X of the High Court Rules for appeals under any enactment. This procedure requires a Notice of Appeal to be filed in the appropriate registry of the High Court and the service of the Notice on the Registrar or appropriate officer of the tribunal by which the decision was made—see Rule 703. However, Glazebrook J allowed the Commissioner time to file such a Notice of Appeal out of time relying on Rule 705(1) of the High Court Rules and the High Court’s inherent jurisdiction. She dismissed as baseless the taxpayers’ attempt to strike out the appeal considering that the Notice was “an absolute right of appeal under section 26A and no leave to appeal is required. As such a Court should be very reluctant to strike out an appeal”.

Because we are keen to produce items that accurately and fairly reflect taxation legislation, and are useful in practical situations, your input into the process—as perhaps a user of that legislation—is highly valued. The following draft items are available for review/comment this month, having a deadline of 28 February 2001.

This Standard Practice Statement extends operational practice relating to consent for the use of non-standard balance dates to recognise special taxpayer/administrator situations. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 1 (January 2001) 4 LEASE SURRENDER PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY A LANDLORD – INCOME TAX TREATMENT The business of leasing property need not be the sole activity or the principal activity of the person. However, the activity must be sufficient, of itself, to amount to a business. This Ruling applies only in respect of landlords in the business of leasing. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •A lease surrender payment received by a landlord in the business of leasing property is gross income as an amount derived from any business. •A lease surrender payment received by a landlord in the business of leasing property may not be gross income as an amount derived from any business if the surrender of the lease is of such significance to the business that it constitutes the loss of a structural asset and the payment is thereby a capital amount. This will be a question of fact and degree to be determined in the particular circumstances of each case. •A lease surrender payment is not gross income under section CE 1(1)(e). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received by such a landlord between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18th day of December 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz Note (not part of ruling): The issue dealt with in this Ruling was covered by Public Rulings BR Pub 97/1 and 97/1A, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 1 (January 1997). The Ruling has been amended to allow for an exception where the surrender of the lease constitutes the surrender of a significant structural asset of the landlord’s business and thus the surrender payment received is a capital amount. In addition, the Ruling clarifies that it only applies to landlords in the business of leasing. The period of application of the Ruling is from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2005. BR Pub 97/1 applied from 1 March 1997 to 30 September 1997 and BR Pub 97/1A from 1 March 1997 to 31 March 2000. PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 00/12 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 3 and CE 1(1)(e). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord from a tenant when the landlord, who is in the business of leasing property, agrees to accept the early termination of the lease. For the purposes of this Ruling, and for the avoidance of doubt, the term “business of leasing” has the same meaning as the term “business of renting”, and means the business of letting property for a rent. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 1 (January 2001) 5 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 00/12 I think perhaps I do no more than reach his conclusion using other words when I say that in my opinion in the words “from the business” of the company something more is meant than merely “as a result of the fact that the company was carrying on this business”. I think that from the business must mean from the current operations of the business. The distinction between capital accretions and revenue operations runs all through the law of income tax. ... and remembering that “Income Tax is always a tax on Income” I conclude without difficulty that the words “from any business” in an Income Tax Act must mean “from the current operations of any business” and no more. They are not, in my opinion, apt to include accretions to the capital assets of the taxpayer which, although they may result from the fact of this carrying on business, yet do not arise from the actual current operations of that business.” His Honour went on to consider the decision of the majority of the High Court of Australia in Dickenson v FCT (1958) 98 CLR 460, and then concluded (at page 1,019): But income tax being “always a tax on income”, the crucial question in New Zealand must therefore in result be the same as that in Australia. Is the receipt income or capital? If it is gains or profits from a business, then the question reduces itself to whether these were derived from the current operations of the business, and therefore income, or whether no more can be contended, as regards their connection with the business, than that without the existence of the business they would not have accrued. If no more than this last can be proved, the gains cannot be assessable income, and simply because they are not derived from the current operations of the business. Thus, if a receipt is an amount from a business, it is necessary only to consider whether or not that amount was derived from the current operations of the business in order to determine whether it is within the words “from any business” in section CD 3, i.e. a revenue amount rather than a capital amount. Richardson J summarised it succinctly when delivering the Court of Appeal judgment in AA Finance Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,383 at 11,391 as follows: Whether gains produced in a business are revenue or capital depends on the nature of the business and the relationship of the transactions producing the gain to the conduct of the business. ... A transaction may be part of the ordinary business of the taxpayer or, short of that, an ordinary incident of the business activity of the taxpayer although not its main activity. A gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on the business is thus stamped with an income character. This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/12 (“the Ruling”). Background The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Rulings BR Pub 97/1 and 97/1A (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 1 (January 1997)). The Ruling has been amended to allow for an exception where the surrender of the lease constitutes the surrender of a significant structural asset of the landlord’s business and thus the surrender payment received is a capital amount. The Ruling sets out the tax treatment of lease surrender payments received by a landlord who is in the business of leasing. The Ruling does not apply if the landlord is not in the business of leasing. However, it is to be noted that the fact that a landlord is not in the business of leasing, and is therefore not covered by the Ruling, does not automatically mean that any lease surrender payment received will not be gross income of that landlord. Legislation Under section CD 3, the gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. Section CE 1(1)(e) includes within a person’s gross income: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. Application of the Legislation From any business Under section CD 3, the gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. In the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v City Motor Service Limited; CIR v Napier Motors Limited \[1969\] NZLR 1,010, Turner J considered what was meant by the words “from any business” in a predecessor provision. His Honour stated (at pages 1,017–1,018): Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 1 (January 2001) 6 Sometimes the amount will not arise from the ordinary course of carrying on a business. The classic statement covering such situations is that of the Lord Justice Clerk in Californian Copper Syndicate Ltd (Limited and Reduced) v Harris (Surveyor of Taxes) (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165–166: It is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of assessment of Income Tax, that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realise it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit in the sense of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842 assessable to Income Tax. But it is equally well established that enhanced values obtained from realisation or conversion of securities may be so assessable, where what is done is not merely a realisation or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business. ... ... What is the line which separates the two classes of cases may be difficult to define, and each case must be considered according to its facts; the question to be determined being – Is the sum of gain that has been made a mere enhancement of value by realising a security, or is it a gain made in an operation of business carrying out a scheme for profit- making? The Californian Copper decision related to profits or gains made outside the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business. The New Zealand Court of Appeal confirmed this in its decision in Wattie & Anor v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,297, when rejecting the argument that the High Court of Australia decision in FCT v The Myer Emporium Ltd (1987) 87 ATC 4,363 had extended the categories of profit or gain that are treated as revenue amounts. The Court of Appeal considered the following oft-quoted extract from Myer: Although it is well settled that a profit or gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on a business constitutes income, it does not follow that a profit or gain made in a transaction entered into otherwise than in the ordinary course of carrying on the taxpayer’s business is not income. Because a business is carried on with a view to a profit, a gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on the business is invested with the profit-making purpose, thereby stamping the profit with the character of income. But a gain made otherwise than in the ordinary course of carrying on the business which nevertheless arises from a transaction entered into by the taxpayer with the intention or purpose of making a profit or gain may well constitute income. Whether it does depends very much on the circumstances of the case. Generally speaking, however, it may be said that if the circumstances are such as to give rise to the inference that the taxpayer’s intention or purpose in entering into the transaction was to make a profit or gain, the profit or gain will be income, notwithstanding that the transaction was extraordinary judged by reference to the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business. Nor does the fact that a profit or gain is made as the result of an isolated venture or a “one-off” transaction preclude it from being properly characterized as income ... . The authorities establish that a profit or gain so made will constitute income if the property generating the profit or gain was acquired in a business operation or commercial transaction for the purpose of profit-making by the means giving rise to the profit. The Court of Appeal in Wattie then continued: Immediately afterwards the Court referred to the decision in Californian Copper Syndicate Ltd v Harris (Surveyor of Taxes), (1904) 5 TC 159 as making the point. But that is simply the classic example of the well recognised assessability of a profit derived from an adventure in the nature of trade or, as it is put in a passage then quoted from Californian Copper, “a gain made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit making”. At p211 the High Court observed that the important proposition to be derived from Californian Copper Syndicate: “... is that a receipt may constitute income, if it arises from an isolated business operation or commercial transaction entered into otherwise than in the ordinary course of the carrying on of the taxpayer’s business, so long as the taxpayer entered into the transaction with the intention or purpose of making a relevant profit or gain from the transaction.” That seems to be a description of an adventure in the nature of trade, a description well able to be applied to what occurred in Myer itself. A gain from an adventure deliberately entered into with a view to the profit, though perhaps unprecedented for the taxpayer, will constitute income. It is a profit- making scheme. The profit is income in accordance with ordinary concepts. Although the decision in Wattie was appealed to the Privy Council ((1998) 18 NZTC 1,991), counsel accepted the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of Myer as contemplating a profit arising from what is commonly referred to as an adventure in the nature of trade, of the kind illustrated by the decision in Californian Copper. In circumstances where profits or gains are made outside the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business, it is necessary to consider whether such a profit or gain is of a revenue or capital nature. If the gain is made by way of the mere realisation of a capital asset, it will be a capital amount. However, if the gain is made by way of what has become known as “an adventure in the nature of trade”, the gain will be a revenue amount. In summary, therefore, the following statements can be made: •An amount arising in the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business will automatically be treated as having a profit-making purpose and will thus be a revenue amount. •Similarly, an amount arising as an ordinary incident of a taxpayer’s business activity will be a revenue amount. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 1 (January 2001) 7 •An amount arising outside the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business will be a revenue amount if it arises from a business operation or commercial transaction with a profit-making purpose, e.g. an adventure in the nature of trade. •An amount arising outside the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business will be a capital amount if it arises from the mere realisation of a capital asset, or if the amount is received in circumstances in which it is not possible to find a measurable profit or gain. The critical question in the present case, therefore, is whether the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord in the business of leasing is a receipt arising in the ordinary course of the landlord’s business or as an ordinary incident of that business activity. Ordinary incident of the business activity of leasing? In the Commissioner’s opinion, the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord is an ordinary incident of the business activity of leasing. The only exception to this is if the surrender payment is received in respect of a lease which is of such significance to the business that it constitutes a structural asset. This will be a question of fact in the particular circumstances of each case. No New Zealand authorities on the taxability of a lease surrender payment received by a landlord exist, and there are very few overseas authorities on this issue. The New Zealand Court of Appeal did consider a lease surrender payment in CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Limited (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233. However, this decision concerned the deductibility for a lessee of a lease surrender payment paid to a lessor. While the decision is considered to be good authority in relation to the deductibility of a lease surrender payment for a lessee, the comments made by the Court in that context cannot automatically be applied to the question of the assessability of such a payment to a lessor. The character of a payment for assessability and deductibility purposes has to be tested in the hands of the particular taxpayer. In the United Kingdom case of Greyhound Racing Association (Liverpool) Ltd v Cooper (1936) 20 TC 373, a lease surrender payment received by a lessor from a lessee was held to be assessable. However, the lessor in that case was not in the business of leasing and the decision was therefore based on different grounds to those discussed in this Ruling. On the facts of that case the Court concluded that the payment was a revenue payment, because it was nothing more than a lump sum payment in place of future rents. In the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision in Case U99 (1987) 87 ATC 602, the Tribunal concluded that a lease surrender payment received by a lessor was a capital amount and not assessable to the lessor. In view of the other authorities discussed in this Ruling, this case is not considered good authority in New Zealand. However, the significant point in relation to the Ruling is that once again the lessor was not in the business of leasing, and the case is therefore of little relevance in the present situation. A Canadian decision that does have greater relevance is the decision in Monart Corporation v Minister of National Revenue \[1967\] CTC 263. The taxpayer in that case owned a large office building. One of its tenants, occupying one-tenth of the leased floor area of the building, gave notice that it was going to vacate and the taxpayer accepted $75,000 to cancel the lease for the remaining six years of its term. The Court concluded that the sum of $75,000 paid to the taxpayer was in lieu of future rent and was also in the nature of profit derived from a property or business of the taxpayer. It was therefore assessable to the taxpayer. Although Canadian and New Zealand law differs on the characterisation of a lease asset, for present purposes it is relevant to note that Dumoulin J in Monart Corporation stated that the taxpayer corporation’s, “raison d’être, and sole pursuit, consist in the business of renting office accommodation”. His Honour then went on to expressly accept the submission of counsel for the respondent that (at page 271): ... the amount received by the Appellant was paid to it for damages suffered or to be suffered as the result of the premature termination of the lease, and that the termination can be considered as a normal incident in the activities of a landlord renting properties. Some guidance on the question of whether a lease surrender payment is a capital or revenue receipt may also be gained from considering cases concerning compensation for termination of agency contracts. An analogy can be drawn between receiving a lease surrender payment (compensation for terminating a lease) and receiving compensation for termination of an agency contract. In Kelsall Parsons & Co. v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1938) 21 TC 608, the taxpayers carried on business as commission agents for the sale in Scotland of the products of various manufacturers, and entered agency agreements for that purpose. One particular agency was cancelled and the taxpayers were paid £1,500 in compensation. The taxpayers claimed it was a capital amount, whereas the Commissioners claimed it was a revenue amount. The Court upheld the Commissioners’ view. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 1 (January 2001) 8 The Lord President, Lord Normand, stated (at pages 619–620): The sum which the Appellants received was, as the Commis- sioners have found, paid as compensation for the cancellation of the agency contract. That was a contract incidental to the normal course of the Appellants’ business. Their business, indeed, was to obtain as many contracts of this kind as they could, and their profits were gained by rendering services in fulfilment of such contracts. ... It was a normal incident of a business such as that of the Appellants that the contracts might be modified, altered or discharged from time to time, and it was quite normal that the business carried on by the Appellants should be adjustable to variations in the number and importance of the agencies held by them, and to modifications of the agency agreements, including modifications of their duration, which might be made from time to time. ... In parting with the benefit of the contract, moreover, the Appellants were not parting with something which could be described as an enduring asset of the business. The contract would have been terminated in any event as at the 30th September, 1935. In Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Fleming & Co (Machinery) Ltd (1951) 33 TC 57, the taxpayer company carried on the business of agents and merchants for the sale of machinery and explosives; the agency work greatly predominating. In 1948 one of its agencies was cancelled and the company received a sum in compensation. The Court of Session (First Division) held that the sum was a revenue receipt. The Lord President, Lord Cooper, noted (at page 61) that the issue belonged to a type exemplified by a number of earlier cases in which, broadly speaking, the line had been drawn between: ... (a) the cancellation of a contract which affects the profit- making structure of the recipient of compensation and involves the loss by him of an enduring trading asset; and (b) the cancellation of a contract which does not affect the recipient’s trading structure nor deprive him of any enduring trading asset, but leaves him free to devote his energies and organisation released by the cancellation of the contract to replacing the contract which has been lost by other like contracts. Lord Russell explained this distinction further (at page 63): When the rights and advantages surrendered on cancellation are such as to destroy or materially to cripple the whole structure of the recipient’s profit-making apparatus, involv- ing the serious dislocation of the normal commercial organisation, and resulting perhaps in the cutting down of the staff previously required, the recipient of the compensation may properly affirm that the compensation represents the price paid for the loss or sterilisation of a capital asset and is therefore a capital and not a revenue receipt. ... On the other hand when the benefit surrendered on cancellation does not represent the loss of an enduring asset in circumstances such as those above mentioned – where for example the structure of the recipient’s business is so fashioned as to absorb the shock as one of the normal incidents to be looked for and where it appears that the compensation received is no more than a surrogatum for the future profits surrendered – the compensation received is in use to be treated as a revenue receipt and not a capital receipt. It was held that the company’s main business consisted of acquiring agencies, and the diminution or increase in the number of agencies (whether prior to the due date of expiration or not) could be regarded as a normal incident of its business. The structure of the company’s business was not affected. The sum received had to be regarded as compensation for loss of profits and not for loss of a profit earning asset. In Wiseburgh v Domville (Inspector of Taxes) \[1956\] 1 All ER 754 (CA), the taxpayer was a manufacturers’ agent. One agency was determined by the principals without the required notice, and the taxpayer suffered a serious reduction in his earnings. The taxpayer brought an action for damages for breach of the contract and for commission due up to the breach. The action was settled and the taxpayer received £4,000, expressed to be damages for the breach of agreement and costs; the claim for commission having been abandoned. Lord Evershed MR noted that at the time the agency was terminated the taxpayer held only two agencies, although he had held a varying number of agencies during his time as an agent. It was also noted that, “the effect of the loss of this contract, quoad the taxpayer’s agency business, was very substantially to depreciate his earnings”. Nevertheless, his Lordship stated (at pages 758–759): Here, the taxpayer has been carrying on a business which for thirteen years has shown variations in the actual agreements which it has comprehended. The business has suffered something perhaps of a disaster by reason of this quarrel with a valuable customer. But, beyond that, it seems to me it is not right to say that the taxpayer had his undertaking as a sales agent partially destroyed or taken away. ... Harman J., said (\[1955\] 3 All ER at p.551): “The taxpayer was a manufacturers’ agent. He had other agencies from time to time and carried on business as an agent, and one of the incidents of such businesses is that one agency may be stopped and another begun. The fact that an agency was a key agency, and was therefore important to him and represented half of his income, seems to me to be irrelevant.” With the possible exception of substituting “inconclusive” for “irrelevant”, I agree entirely with that statement; and I agree with what the judge said later (ibid.): “... it was a normal incident in this kind of business that an agency should come to an end, and it seems to me that the compensation paid is quite clearly income.” Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 1 (January 2001) 9 The case of Van den Berghs Ltd v Clark (Inspector of Taxes) \[1935\] All ER 874 concerned payments made under agreements entered between competitor companies (both margarine manufacturers) for the sharing of profits and losses and the regulation of their activities. Following a dispute under the agreements, the taxpayer received a payment of £450,000 as “damages” and in consideration of the termination of the agreements. The House of Lords held that the payment was a capital receipt. Lord MacMillan discussed the case of Atherton v The British Insulated & Helsby Cables Ltd \[1926\] AC 213 and then proceeded to consider the facts before him. He considered that it was important to bear in mind that the taxpayer’s trade was to manufacture and deal in margarine. The payment received was in consideration for the taxpayer giving up its rights under the agreements for the following 13 years. Lord MacMillan said (at page 888) that these agreements: ... were not ordinary commercial contracts made in the course of carrying on their trade; they were not contracts for the disposal of their products or for the engagement of agents or other employees necessary for the conduct of their business; nor were they merely agreements as to how their trading profits, when earned, should be distributed as between the contracting parties. On the contrary, the cancelled agreements related to the whole structure of the appellants’ profit-making apparatus. They regulated the appellants’ activities, defined what they might and what they might not do, and affected the whole conduct of their business. I have difficulty in seeing how money laid out to secure, or money received for the cancellation of, so fundamental an organisa- tion of a trader’s activities can be regarded as an income disbursement or an income receipt. ... In the present case, however, it is not the largeness of the sum that is important but the nature of the asset that was surrendered. In my opinion that asset, the congeries of rights which the appel- lants enjoyed under the agreements and which, for a price they surrendered, was a capital asset. In Barr, Crombie & Co Ltd v CIR (1945) 26 TC 406, from the formation of a shipping company in 1924, the appellant company managed its ships under certain agreements, the latest of which provided that the appellant company should continue to act as managers for the shipping company for 15 years from 1 January 1936. A clause in the contract provided that if the second company went into liquidation or ceased to trade, then the remuneration owing to the appellant from that day until the date on which it was due to expire would become immediately payable to the appellant. In 1942 this occurred and the appellant received the amount due. The Lord President (Normand) found that the appellant’s business had consisted almost entirely of the agency. For the previous 16 years it had contributed about 84% of the appellant’s income. Upon liquidation of the other company, it lost almost its entire business. Despite the fact that the sum payable was calculated by reference to what the appellant would have received had the company not gone into liquidation, the Lord President found that the sum received was a capital amount. He quoted Lord Buckmaster in the case of Glenboig Union Fireclay Co Ltd v CIR (1922) 12 TC 427 at page 464 where he said: ... although annual payments in the nature of profits may be used as the measure by which to calculate the sum which is to be paid, the resultant sum is not thereby made itself an annual payment or a profit. His Lordship distinguished the case of Kelsall Parsons & Co (above). He regarded the payment before him as being “once and for all”, i.e. the price of the surrender of its only important capital asset. In contrast, in Kelsall, the payment was in return for the loss of a single agency contract out of about a dozen, and the fact that the payment in that case did not represent the whole capital asset of the company was shown by the fact that the next year its profits were no less than they had been before. Another contrasting feature was that in that case there was a single payment for the surrender of profits over one year, as opposed to a payment for the surrender of an agreement while there was still a substantial period to run. Lord President Normand considered the case analogous to Van den Berghs in that the structure of the company was radically affected and its whole character as a business decisively altered. He said: ... where you have a payment for the loss of the contract upon which the whole trade of the Company has been built, where the expected profits of the contract are used to measure the loss of them for a period of future years, and where in consequence of the loss the Company’s structure and character are greatly affected, the payment seems to me to be beyond doubt a capital payment. The leading case in New Zealand, regarding the characterisation of a payment received for cancellation of a contract, is the Court of Appeal judgment of CIR v Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Australasia) Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,101. That case involved the receipt by the taxpayer of $2.25m as consideration for the variation and partial surrender of its rights under a long-term supply contract. The issue was how to characterise the receipt in the hands of the recipient. The Court of Appeal stated that the crucial consideration in the case was whether, on the facts, the 1972 supply and marketing contract was to be characterised as providing an advantage for the enduring benefit of Borthwick’s trade and as forming part of the structure of Borthwick’s marketing operations. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 1 (January 2001) 10 The Court of Appeal rejected the Commissioner’s argument that in deciding this issue Justice Gallen had placed too much emphasis on the duration of the marketing rights and too little on its limited impact on the taxpayer’s business as a whole. In applying what it described as being the leading case in which a contract was held to be a structural asset, Van den Berghs Ltd v Clark \[1935\] AC 431, the Court of Appeal stated that “whether a supply and agency contract is structural or revenue turns on the nature and significance of the contract in the operations of the business” (at page 9,105). The Court confirmed that duration, arguably over business share, is significant. Applying the observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v C of T \[1966\] AC 224, the longer the duration, the greater the indication that a structural solution is being sought. The Court, deciding the sum was capital, found on the facts that: •The marketing agreement assured the taxpayer of a long-term source of supply of produce for its marketing business. •The supply of produce replaced the previously held capital asset, i.e. the freezing works, and in that way the agreement was then the framework for making profits from the South Island. •Globally the agreement was of major significance to the taxpayer’s business, i.e. 40% increase in share of NZ lamb kill. •The size of the payment indicated the value and importance of the agreement to the business. An analogy can be drawn between the receipt of compensation for the termination of a contract, and the receipt of a lease surrender payment on the termination of a lease. In general, it is a normal incident of the business of leasing that leases might be modified, altered, or surrendered from time to time and it is quite normal that such a business should be able to take into account such modifications, alterations, or surrenders. In addition, in most cases, in accepting the surrender of a lease, a landlord is not parting with an enduring asset of the business because, as in the case of an agency contract, the lease would have been terminated at some point in the future in any event. The termination of a lease will not generally affect the profit-making structure of a landlord’s business, neither will it involve the loss of an enduring trading asset. In most cases the structure of a landlord’s business is such that it is fashioned to absorb the shock of the termination of a lease as one of the normal incidents of the business. The landlord is left free to devote energy and organisation to replacing the lost lease with a new lease. However, in certain circumstances the surrender of a lease may constitute the loss of an enduring asset of the business and the receipt of a lease surrender payment by the landlord may be a capital amount. This will be a question of fact in any particular case. The cases discussed above indicate that the following principles will apply: •The nature and significance of the lease to the landlord’s business will be crucial. •In determining the significance of a lease, the length of the lease and the size of the payment will be relevant. •If the lease constitutes the whole structure of the profit-making apparatus, the receipt may be on capital account. •If the landlord has several leases as part of its business structure and the receipt relates to only one of them, the general rule is that the receipt will not relate to the capital structure. However, this general rule may not apply if the one lease out of several constitutes a significant part of the business. •The method of calculation of the sum payable is not determinative. It is to be noted, in this regard, that if the facts of a situation suggest that a taxpayer has structured its, or its group’s, affairs in a particular way for the purpose or effect of converting a revenue receipt into a capital receipt, the Commissioner may consider the application of the anti-avoidance provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. Conclusion The receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord in the business of leasing is a normal incident of that business. Such a receipt will therefore constitute gross income within section CD 3 as an amount derived from any business. The only exception to this is where the surrender payment is received in respect of a lease that is of such significance to the landlord’s business that it constitutes a structural asset. This will be a question of fact in the particular circumstances of each case. Although the Ruling deals only with the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord in the business of leasing, it should be noted that the fact that a lease surrender payment is received by a landlord who is not in the business of leasing will not automatically exclude that payment from the landlord’s gross income. It will still be necessary to consider whether the payment is to be included as a revenue amount on some other basis, such as on the basis that the amount arose from an adventure in the nature of trade. Equally, the receipt could be a normal incident of some other business activity of the recipient and thus a revenue receipt. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 1 (January 2001) 11 Example 1 Landlord A owns a number of commercial properties, and is in the business of leasing them. She leases one building to Tenant. Landlord A and Tenant execute a lease for 15 years at a rental of $50,000 per annum: the rental being reviewable every five years. The lease provides for one right of renewal for a further 15-year period. Five years into the lease Tenant’s business outgrows Landlord A’s building. Tenant moves the business to another property. Tenant offers to pay Landlord A $200,000 if she will accept a surrender of the lease by Tenant and the cancellation of all Tenant’s obligations under the lease. Landlord A agrees, the lease is cancelled, and Tenant pays Landlord A the $200,000. Under section CD 3, the amount is gross income of Landlord A. Example 2 Landlord Z is a company and is the landlord of a commercial property that was purpose built for a particular tenant. The management of the leasing arrangements takes considerable time and effort and is carried out solely by Landlord Z, which has no other business activities. The lease was for 50 years and has 30 years still to run. The building is now in an unfashionable area and the tenant has to move to survive. There is no possibility of securing a further tenant. The tenant negotiates a lease surrender payment with Landlord Z. Landlord Z is in the business of leasing and is therefore subject to the Ruling. However, the surrender payment is in respect of a significant asset of the Landlord’s business and affects the profit- making structure of the business. The business is not fashioned to absorb the shock of the termination of the lease as a normal incident and neither can a new lease be found. The surrender payment received by Landlord Z will be a capital amount. Section CE 1(1)(e) Section CE 1(1)(e) potentially applies to a lease surrender payment. That section includes within the landowner’s gross income, “premiums or other revenues” derived by a land owner “from any lease”. The words “premiums or other revenues” are potentially wide enough to include a lease surrender payment. However, in the Commissioner’s view, the words “from any lease” imply that the premiums or other revenues arise from a lease that will continue in existence after the payment is made. The words do not cover a situation where the lease is terminated on payment of the surrender payment. Accordingly, section CE 1(1)(e) does not apply. Support for this view is contained in obiter dicta of Richardson J in CIR v McKenzies NZ Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233 at 5,235, where His Honour said that premiums paid or received on the surrender of a lease were not dealt with in a predecessor section to section CE 1(1)(e). When a landlord’s activity amounts to a business The leading case on the test and criteria for whether a business exists is Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682. In Grieve, Richardson J noted there were two factors in deciding if there was a business: first, whether the taxpayer had an intention to make a profit; second, the nature of the activities carried on. He went on to set out the following factors relevant to the inquiry as to whether a taxpayer is in business: •The nature of the taxpayer’s activities. •The period over which the taxpayer engages in the activity. •The scope of the taxpayer’s operations. •The volume of transactions undertaken. •The commitment of time, money, and effort by the taxpayer. •The pattern of activity. •The financial results achieved by the activity. Ultimately, whether a landlord is in business is a question of fact. In seeking to determine whether a landlord is in business, the Commissioner uses the criteria identified above from the Grieve decision. More recently the question of whether a business existed or not arose in Slater v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,453. The High Court examined, discussed, and approved Grieve and the tests proposed in that case. A taxpayer who is in doubt as to whether or not a leasing activity amounts to a business should contact a tax adviser or Inland Revenue. Case law on whether a landlord’s leasing activity amounts to a business A number of cases consider whether the leasing of property for rents amounts to a business. In L D Nathan Group Properties Ltd v CIR (1980) 4 NZTC 61,602, the taxpayer was the property owning subsidiary of the group. Davison CJ said that the deriving of rents by a company such as the taxpayer was income from a business. This confirms the approach in Smith v Anderson (1880) 15 Ch D 258, CIT v Hanover Agencies Limited \[1967\] 1 All ER 954 (PC), and American Leaf Blending Co Sdn Bhd v Director- General of Inland Revenue \[1978\] 3 All ER 1185 (PC) that companies involved in leasing will readily be held to be in the business of property leasing. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 1 (January 2001) 12 However, this classification is not limited to company taxpayers. For example, in Case F111 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,094 the taxpayer owned two houses and a block of five flats. She collected the rents, interviewed tenants and did some of the maintenance and repair work. The TRA was of the view that the taxpayer was in business as a landlord. From these cases, it would appear that leasing a number of buildings is likely to mean the taxpayer is in the business of property leasing. Leasing only one building can also mean the taxpayer is in the business of property leasing, if the requirements of the building mean the landlord is actively and regularly involved with the property (e.g. negotiating new leases, maintenance, renovations, etc.). It is also possible that leasing a single building will not mean the landlord is in the business of property leasing (e.g. when the landlord does not need to have much involvement with the day to day running of the property, or when new lessees, maintenance, or renovation work are rare). It is interesting to note that the cases suggest that the business threshold is lower when the landlord is a company than when the landlord is an individual or individuals. Two Australian cases discussed below found the renting of property did not amount to a business. To the extent that these cases are inconsistent with the cases discussed above they should be ignored, as the above authorities, being Privy Council and New Zealand High Court and TRA cases, are more persuasive authorities in a New Zealand court. In Case 24 (1944) 11 TBRD 85, the taxpayer owned three properties returning rental income of over £10,000. The taxpayer employed a manager who collected and banked rents, attended to repairs and supervised them, and controlled the caretaker and cleaners. However, the taxpayer personally carried out the management of his rent-producing properties and directed policy, attending to the financial arrangements and making decisions regarding repairs. He employed an accountant to prepare accounts. The Board of Review (in a 2–1 decision) found that the taxpayer did not have a business of renting property. In light of subsequent case law, particularly Case F111, this decision is unlikely to be persuasive authority in New Zealand. In Kennedy Holdings & Property Management Pty Ltd v FCT 92 ATC 4,918, the taxpayer co-owned a building that it rented out. It paid its lessee a sum of money to surrender the lease and sought to deduct the sum. The deduction was denied by the Commissioner, and the Federal Court (NSW) upheld the Commissioner’s assessment. The Court found the taxpayer was not carrying on a business. At page 4,921 Hill J said: It cannot be said on the evidence of the present case that the applicant is, for purposes relevant to s.51(1), carrying on a business. The applicant and its co-owner own one property which they lease out and from which they derive rental income. The freehold held in co-ownership is, in such circumstances, the income producing entity, structure or organisation for the earning of the rental income of the co- owners. The freehold is the profit-making structure. Again, there must be some doubt as to the persuasiveness of this case in New Zealand. However, it may be seen as an example of a company owning one building and not needing to undertake much effort in its management, and therefore not being in the business of renting property. Example 3 Landlord B is retired and owns two properties: a family home, and another house rented to an architect for use as an office. The rent is direct credited to Landlord B’s bank account. Landlord B has no day to day involvement with the tenant or the building, and only very rarely needs to arrange for repairs and maintenance to be carried out. The tenant has tenanted the building for five years, and has a further five-year lease over the building. In terms of the Grieve tests, the scope of Landlord B’s operations, the volume of transactions undertaken, the commitment of time, money, and effort by the taxpayer, the pattern of the activity, and so on, all suggest that her renting does not amount to a business. Example 4 Landlord C is in full-time employment, but also owns six houses that he rents out to tenants. Prior to renting out a house, Landlord C totally renovates it. Thereafter, Landlord C carries out any repairs that may be required. He undertakes advertising for new tenants, collection of rents, and associated duties. Landlord C is in the business of renting on the strength of both Case F111 and the Grieve test. Unlike Landlord B above, the nature of Landlord C’s activities, the scope of the operations, the volume of transactions undertaken, and the commitment of time, money, and effort all suggest a business exists.

Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 4 BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 00/09 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Barkworth Olive Groves Pty Limited (“BOGL”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections EP 1, BD 2(1)(b)(i), BD 2(2)(e), EG 1, and the section OB 1 definition of “depreciable property”. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the potential application (if any) of sections EF 1 and BG 1 or Determination E10. This Ruling considers expense deductibility in relation to section BD 2(1)(b)(i) (incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income). Accordingly it has not been necessary for the purposes of this Ruling to consider or rule on whether investors are carrying on a business for the purposes of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the purchase of a minimum of 250 “C” class shares in BOGL, and the growing of olives on certain land situated in Australia in respect of which the shares provide the right to grow olives, and the appointment of Barkworth Olive Management Limited (“BOML”) to manage the growing, processing and marketing of those olives. This Ruling only applies to investors who appoint BOML to manage their Farms. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Arrangement is governed by the terms of the “Barkworth Olive Groves Project No. 3” prospectus dated 11 March 1999 (“the prospectus”). Key aspects of the prospectus are as follows: (i)Investors (also referred to as “members” or “growers”) purchase a minimum parcel of 250 “C” class shares of $1 each in a land owning company (BOGL): additional shares may be applied for in parcels of 250. (ii)Holders of “C” class shares have the following rights: • A member shall have the absolute right to occupy one ‘Farm’ (or section of olive grove) in respect of each 250 “C” Class shareholding held by that member, subject to the payment of all moneys due to BOGL. The farm shall be an identified area of land as nearly as practicable in area to 0.08 hectares and suitable for the planting of 20 olive trees at spacings of approximately 5 metres by 8 metres. The member’s Farm or Farms will be separately identified on a master plan maintained under the supervision of the directors of BOGL. • A member shall have an absolute right to process up to 1.5 tonnes of olives per annum in respect of each 250 “C” Class shareholding, subject to the payment of Factory Access Fees. The time allotted for each member’s processing operations will be advised at least two weeks prior to commencement of the harvest period. The member may exchange his or her allotted time with any other member or members with the approval of BOGL: such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 5 The time allotted per 250 “C” Class shareholding will be as near as practicable to one half-hour and will be with respect to a machine or machines capable of processing in excess of 3 tonnes per hour. • A member shall have the right to own and operate a business, as defined by the Constitution of BOGL, for the commercial cultivation and harvesting of olives on the member’s Farm and the sale of produce therefrom. • A member shall also have the right to own and operate a business as defined in the Constitution of BOGL, for the commercial processing and marketing of processed olive products which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, olive oil and pickled table olives. • A member shall have the right to use the agricultural infrastructure which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, roads around the property, access to irrigation mains and storage areas. This will be subject to the reasonable regulations imposed by BOGL’s directors. • A member shall have the right to use the processing infrastructure which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, loading and unloading equipment, storage areas, grading and sampling equipment. This will be subject to the reasonable regulations imposed by BOGL’s directors. • A member shall have the right to appoint BOML to manage his or her interests in accordance with the Management Agreement. Alternatively, growers have the right to manage the business personally or to appoint an employee, contractor, or agent to manage the business on their behalf. • A member shall have the right to assign, transfer, or otherwise deal with the abovementioned special rights to any person, persons, or corporation with the approval of the directors of BOGL: such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. (iii)The rights attaching to “C” Class shares expire on 1 July 2019 and, in accordance with the Constitution of BOGL, become ordinary shares. At that time BOGL will assume responsibility for, and the benefits of, the olive trees and from then on the member’s benefits will be derived from the member’s interest in BOGL by virtue of shares held. (iv) A member or his or her assignee is obliged to ensure the efficient running of the business. If an employee, contractor, or agent is engaged to fulfil this function, BOGL must be satisfied in regard to the competence of that person or corporation and give its written approval. Relationship between BOGL and members (v) The members’ interests are separate from the operation of the business of BOGL. (vi) BOGL will derive income from annual Farm Administration Fees received from members. The year one Administration Fee in respect of the 1999 – 2000 year will be $88 for each parcel of 250 “C” Class shares allotted to the member. (vii) In year two the Administration Fee will be $75 payable in advance. (viii)Thereafter, until and including the year 2019, the annual Administration Fee shall be 10% of the gross income generated from the sale of olives attributable to the member’s Farm. (ix)BOGL will also derive income from the payment by the member of Factory Access Fees for each 250 “C” Class shareholding as follows: • Year 1 - $225 • Year 2 - $225 • Year 3 and thereafter – 15% of the gross income generated from the sale of processed olive products attributable to the member’s processing allocation. 90% of all income derived by BOGL for Factory Access Fees will be paid to the Factory Owner and the remaining 10% will be retained by BOGL to cover administration costs. BOGL may also derive income from the commercial use of that residue of BOGL land not being used for olive growing and from any direct interest in olive processing which BOGL may acquire. 2.The members may appoint BOML as the manager of the Farms. The Management Agreement is entered into between BOML and BOGL (as the agent of the members). 3.The Manager’s duties in respect of the first 13 months (as provided in clause 4.1 of the Management Agreement) are as follows: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 6 (i)BOML will carry out the duties required to supply olive trees, plant olive trees on the grower’s Farm, bring the trees to an initial harvest, process olives (whether those olives are sourced from the Farm or elsewhere), and market olives and processed olive product. Without limiting the generality of this clause BOML must: • Supply at least 20 olive trees to the grower selected from high yield stock in healthy condition. • Carry out irrigation works to benefit the grower’s Farm. • Carry out drainage work and work to help prevent soil erosion on the grower’s Farm. • Prepare the Farm so that it will be suitable for the planting and growing of at least 20 olive trees. • Tend the olive trees. • Tend the trees and Farm in a proper and skilful manner. • Comply with BOGL’s constitution in so far as it relates to the use of the Farm and grower’s processing allocation (except for the payment of Administration Fees and Factory Licence Fees). • At BOML’s discretion, procure raw olives, olive products or both from sources other than the Farms for processing. • Determine the products into which those olives will be processed and the proportions of the various products. • Carry out the processing of some or all of those olives or olive products pursuant to and during the processing time allowed under the grower’s processing allocation. • Package, market and sell the processed olives attributable to the grower using reasonable endeavours to obtain the maximum price available. • If BOML markets and sells the processed olives attributable to the grower’s processing allocation, account to the grower for the proceeds of sale. • Eradicate as far as reasonably possible any pests and competitive weeds which may affect the growth or yield of trees. • Repair damage to roads, tracks, or fences on the Farms or on neighbouring land resulting from the actions of BOML or its contractors. • Embark on such operations as may be required to prevent or combat land degradation on the Farm or land. 4.The ongoing duties of the Manager (as provided in clause 4.3 of the Management Agreement) are as follows: (i)BOML must continue to maintain the Farm and source, process, and market olives and olive products following the completion of the duties outlined in clause 4.1. (ii)BOML’s duties must be carried out according to sound agricultural, environmental, and proper workplace practices as well as in accordance with industry practices applicable to growing olive trees and processing and marketing olives or olive products. Without limiting the generality of this clause, BOML must: • Eradicate as far as reasonably possible any pests or competitive weeds which may affect growth or yield of the trees. • Comply with BOGL’s constitution in so far as it relates to the use of the grower’s Farm and the grower’s processing allocation (except for the payment of Administration Fees and, if applicable, Factory Licence Fees). • Repair damage to roads, tracks, or fences on the grower’s Farm or on neighbouring land resulting from the actions of BOML or its contractors. • Embark on such operations as may be required to prevent or combat land degradation on the grower’s Farm or land surrounding the grower’s Farm. • Subject to the grower’s right to harvest its own trees under clause 6.2, harvest the trees on the grower’s Farm at or around the time estimated by BOML to maximise the produce from all the Farms established at or around the same time as the grower’s Farm. • Procure raw olives or olive products whether from the Farm or from other sources other than the Farms for processing. • Determine the products into which those olives or olive products will be processed and the proportions of the various products. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 7 • During the processing time allowed under the grower’s processing allocation, carry out the processing of some or all of the olives attributable to the grower’s Farm following harvest and olives procured from sources other than the Farms, in a proper and workmanlike manner having regard to proper workplace practices as well as in accordance with acceptable industry practices applicable to processing olives. • Subject to the grower’s rights to take and market olives and processed olive products under clauses 6.3 and 6.4, package, market, and sell the olives attributable to the grower’s Farm and the processed olives attributable to the grower’s processing allocation using reasonable endeavours to obtain the maximum price available. • If BOML markets and sells the olives attributable to the grower’s Farm and the processed olives attributable to the grower’s processing allocation, account to the grower for the proceeds of sale. 5.Subject to complying with the conditions set out in clause 6 of the Management Agreement, growers may elect to: (i)Carry out their own maintenance work; (ii)Have their trees harvested separately; (iii)Harvest their own trees; and (iv) Market their own olives. 6.The Management Agreement (at clause 7.1) makes the following provision for remuneration in the first year: (i)In consideration of BOML carrying out its duties (as set out in clause 4.1 of the Management Agreement), BOML is entitled to be paid: • $20 deposit for the supply of 20 olive trees to the grower (payable on application). • $70 for the balance of the cost of supplying 20 olive trees to the grower (payable within three months of application). • $1,025 for irrigation works (payable within three months of application). Irrigation works consist of the supply and installation (above ground) of trickle tapes and sprinkler heads (together the “irrigation equipment”) on growers’ land. The irrigation equipment is bought by BOML as agent for the grower. • $1,293 for procuring, processing, packaging and marketing olives sourced externally. (The fee is payable by twelve equal monthly instalments in arrears on the first day of each calendar month. If the fee is paid in full within three months of application, then it will be reduced to $1,175.) • $3,776 for the balance of the management duties. (The fee is payable by twelve equal monthly instalments in arrears on the first day of each calendar month. If the fee is paid in full within three months of application, it will be reduced to $3,433.) (ii)BOML is also entitled to be paid $550 for granting the grower a licence to use the “Barkworth” name in carrying on the grower’s business. The grower must pay this fee by twelve equal monthly instalments in arrears on the first day of each calendar month during the first twelve months of the Management Agreement. However, the fee is $500 if the grower pays these amounts in full within three months of application. (iii) In addition, if BOML procures and markets processed olive products on behalf of the grower, then BOML is entitled to be paid 85% of the amount by which the gross proceeds from the sale of the processed olive products exceed the prospectus projections. From this fee BOML must pay all costs associated with procuring and marketing processed olive products. 7.The Management Agreement (at clause 7.2) makes the following provision for remuneration in the second year: (i)In consideration of BOML carrying out its duties from the beginning of the 14th month to the end of the 24th month, BOML is entitled to be paid: • $1,293 for procuring, processing, packaging, and marketing olives sourced externally.

Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 8 (ii)BOML is also entitled to be paid $500 in year two for granting the grower a licence to use the “Barkworth” name in carrying on the grower’s business. The fee is payable from the gross income generated from the sale proceeds generated under the Management Agreement. The fee for the licence to use the “Barkworth” name is capped at the amount of gross income generated from the sale proceeds generated under the Management Agreement. (iii) In addition, if BOML procures and markets processed olive products on behalf of the grower, then BOML is entitled to be paid 85% of the amount by which the gross proceeds from the sale of the processed olive products exceed the prospectus projections. From this fee, BOML must pay all costs associated with procuring and marketing processed olive products. 8.The Management Agreement makes the following provision for remuneration in the third year: (i)In consideration of BOML carrying out its duties for the third year of the Management Agreement, BOML is entitled to be paid 70% of the gross income generated from the sale of processed olives attributable to the grower’s processing allocation. (ii)Payment of the above fees includes a fee to use the “Barkworth” name in carrying on the business of the grower. The amount of that fee is the amount paid under year two increased by the same proportion as the increase in the Consumer Price Index over the one-year period from year two to year three. If there is insufficient income earned from the sale of processed olives to pay this amount, the fee is capped at the income earned. (iii) In addition, if BOML procures and markets processed olive products on behalf of the grower, then BOML is entitled to be paid 85% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the processed olive products. From this fee BOML must pay all costs associated with procuring and marketing processed olive products. 9.The Management Agreement makes the following provision for remuneration in the fourth and following years: (i)In consideration of BOML carrying out its duties under clause 4.3 for the fourth year and all subsequent years, BOML is entitled to be paid fees calculated according to the following table: Year No. % of Gross Income % of Gross Income Of Olivesof Processed Olives 490%70% 590%70% 660%60% 750%70% 8 to 2040%70% (ii)In the above table, “Gross Income of Olives” means the gross income generated from the sale of olives attributable to the grower’s Farm, and “Gross Income of Processed Olives” means the gross income generated from the sale of processed olives attributable to the grower’s processing allocation. (iii)The fees payable are calculated in respect of the olives attributable to the grower’s Farm which are produced during the year corresponding with the percentage of gross income of olives. (iv) If the grower has made an election to have his or her trees harvested separately or to harvest the trees themselves such that the gross income of olives is not readily calculable by BOML, the fees payable in consideration of BOML carrying out its management duties under clause 4.3 of the Management Agreement are as per the fees in the following table plus or minus an adjustment.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 12 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 00/14 •ANZ Banking Group (New Zealand) Limited (“ANZNZ”) which is wholly owned by ANZ Holdings and is incorporated in New Zealand. 2.For the purposes of this Arrangement three new entities will be established in New Zealand: •A wholly owned subsidiary of ANZNZ which is as yet unnamed but referred to in this Ruling as ANZ Sub II which will be incorporated in New Zealand. •A wholly owned subsidiary of ANZNZ which is as yet unnamed but referred to in this Ruling as ANZ Sub I which will be incorporated in New Zealand. •A trust in which ANZ Sub I will hold all of the ordinary units as yet unnamed but referred to in this Ruling as SPV Trust, which will be established in New Zealand. The SPV Trust will be a New Zealand resident for tax purposes. 3.The above entities are being set up for regulatory, corporate governance (particularly, prudential reporting), and marketing reasons. In relation to the prudential reporting purposes, it is a priority that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (“APRA”) classifies the capital raised in New Zealand as Tier One capital. For this to be achieved it is necessary for the funds to be traced from the issue of the capital in New Zealand through to ANZBG in Australia solely through non-operating entities. To achieve this and the requisite degree of flexibility required to manage any possible future legal, fiscal, regulatory, and accounting changes in any of the three jurisdictions over the next 30 years without altering SPV Trust, it was thought prudent to use two separate companies for the transactions (i.e. ANZ Sub I and ANZ Sub II). Other considerations in setting up the above entities are: •To achieve transparency for capital raising from both the bank’s and the New Zealand Investors’ perspectives; •From the Investors’ perspective, it was considered preferable that the entity in which they are investing has a simple and predetermined cashflow; and This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by: •Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited; •ANZ Banking Group (New Zealand) Limited; •ANZ Sub I; •SPV Trust. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2, BG 1, CD 4, CF 2, DJ 13, EH 22, EH 26, EH 33, EH 47, EH 48, GC 22, GC 23, LB 2(7), ME 1, and OB 1 (“share”, “shareholder”, “tax avoidance arrangement” and “unit trust”). This Ruling also applies in respect of sections 2 (“dutiable gift”, “disposition of property”, and “gift”), 61, 63, 66, and 67 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the raising of capital by the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group of companies (the “ANZ Group”) through the issue of units to Investors by SPV Trust and the subsequent lending of the funds received from Investors by SPV Trust to ANZ Sub I, by ANZ Sub I to ANZ Sub II, and by ANZ Sub II to the New York branch of ANZBG (“ANZBG NY”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out below. 1.The ANZ Group has its parent company (Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (“ANZBG”)) in Australia. ANZBG has the following subsidiaries: •ANZ Funds Pty Ltd (“ANZ Funds”) which is wholly owned by ANZBG and is incorporated in Australia. •ANZ Holdings (New Zealand) Limited (“ANZ Holdings”) which is wholly owned by ANZ Funds and is incorporated in New Zealand. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 13 •From the Investors’ and the bank’s perspectives, it was considered preferable that ANZ entities, rather than the issuing entity, are parties to the swap and loan as this allows greater flexibility to operate and react to commercial changes in relation to the swap and the loan. 4.The ANZ Group wants to raise capital in New Zealand for the following reasons: •Increase the percentage of New Zealand shareholders. •Increase the level of retail investors. •Strengthen the link between customers and shareholders. •Establish a deeper capital base for future needs. •Increase ANZ’s profile in the New Zealand market. •Raise Tier 1 capital. 5. The following transactions will be carried out for that purpose. Issue of SPV Trust units and forward sale arrangement 6.A special purpose trust (“SPV Trust”) will be established in New Zealand pursuant to a Deed of Trust (the “Trust Deed”) between ANZ Investment Services (New Zealand) Limited as manager and The Trustees Executors and Agency Company of New Zealand Limited (the “Trustee”), trading as Tower Trust as trustee. The Trustee is a professional corporate trustee, which is independent of the ANZ Group. 7.The purpose of SPV Trust will be to raise capital in New Zealand for the ANZ Group through the issue of units and to invest in variable rate debentures issued by ANZ Sub I. The total value of units to be issued to Investors by SPV Trust will be determined by demand. The units will be listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange. The issue price of each unit will be determined in accordance with the following method which will be specified in the prospectus. Section 3.10 of the prospectus will state the following: 3.10Pricing The total cost per Unit to investors is made up of the Application Price and the Final Payment, together being the Total Price. The Total Price payable will be a fixed price, being the lower of: •the simple average of the three days’ volume weighted average ASX traded price of ANZ ordinary shares, from \[date\] to \[date\], converted to New Zealand dollars at the NZ$/A$ exchange rate on each day; and •the volume weighted average ASX traded price of ANZ ordinary shares, on \[date - closing date of the offer\] converted to New Zealand dollars at the NZ$/A$ exchange rate on that day. The daily volume weighted average price of ANZ ordinary shares, for any one day means the average prices at which ANZ ordinary shares (excluding the effect of’ any special crossings as defined in the listing rules of the ASX) were sold on the ASX on that day, which is calculated by dividing the total amount for which ANZ ordinary shares were sold on the ASX that day by the number of ANZ ordinary shares sold on the ASX that day. The applicable NZ$/A$ exchange rate is the average of the buy and the sell rates taken at two times each day (when both the NZSE and the ASX are open, for business). ANZ will calculate the average of the buy and sell rates from quotes obtained by ANZ from a minimum of five selected banks for the exchange of New Zealand and Australian dollars for value spot, after eliminating the highest and lowest quotes. Should the rates so calculated not be (in the opinion of the Chairman of ANZ) representative of a fair average NZ$/A$ exchange rate (for value spot),for the day, then an alternative point of reference may be determined by the Chairman of ANZ. If, in the opinion of the Chairman, there has been abnormal market trading or other similar circum- stances resulting in distortions in the price of ANZ ordinary shares during the pricing period for ANZ Tracking Units, then the Chairman may elect to adjust the ANZ ordinary share price to be used as the reference for the pricing of ANZ Tracking Units. The Chairman shall consult with the Joint Lead Managers prior to determining first, that such circumstances exist and, secondly, what the appropriate ANZ ordinary share reference price should be. Also, in determining both these matters, the Chairman shall have regard to: •the movement in the ANZ ordinary share price during the pricing period; •the movement in the Australian Banking and Finance Accumulation Index (published by, or on behalf of, the ASX during the pricing period); •the extent to which any new information that has been received by the market has impacted on the price of ANZ ordinary shares and/or other major banking stocks; and • such other matters as the Chairman considers relevant. If the Chairman elects to adjust the reference price of ANZ ordinary shares, the reasons for the adjustment shall be advised to the NZSE for public announcement. The Chairman’s determination shall be final. 8.One ordinary unit (with voting rights) will be held by ANZ Sub I. This unit will have the same issue price as the units issued to Investors. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 14 9.Units will be issued to Investors on a partly paid basis. The first instalment is expected to be around 60% of the unit offer price and will be payable on issue. The second instalment will be the unit offer price less the first instalment payment and will be payable at a predetermined date, probably nine to twelve months after the first instalment date. All Investors will pay the same price for each unit allocated to them in the offer. In relation to the instalment payment arrangement for the units, clause 1.8 of the forward sale and purchase agreement between the Investors and ANZBG will state the following: 1.8Lowest price for purchase of Units For the purposes of determining the consideration in section EH 48 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (New Zealand), the Unitholders agree that the Total Price is the “lowest price” for the Units on the basis of payment in full at the time at which the first rights in the Units are to be transferred. The agreement of the Unitholders in this clause 1.8 is not affected by: (a) any change to the Exchange Factor at any time; or (b) any change to the total number of outstanding Units at any time; or (c) any other matter. 10.The units will have limited voting rights. Broadly, these rights are limited to extraordinary resolutions relating to the alteration of rights attached to their units (paragraph 10 of Schedule 2 to the Trust Deed). 11.Distributions (dividends for tax purposes) will be paid on the units to coincide with the dividends paid by ANZBG on its ordinary shares. The amount of distribution on each unit will match, in New Zealand dollars, the cash dividend paid in Australian dollars by ANZBG on an ordinary share. Full distributions will be payable to Investors even while the units are only partly paid. 12.If ANZBG does not pay any dividends on its ordinary shares, then no distribution will be paid on the units. To the extent that imputation credits are available, they will be attached to the distributions paid to Investors. However, the attachment of imputation credits is not guaranteed, nor will the cash distribution be grossed up if it is not fully imputed. ANZBG is liable to income tax in Australia by reason of domicile, residence, place of incorporation, or place of management. 13.ANZ expects to elect to use the foreign investor tax credit (“FITC”) regime in relation to the units in the SPV Trust. This is specifically contemplated by paragraph 8.2 of Schedule 2 of the Trust Deed. Accordingly, SPV Trust will be a section LE 3 holding company and ANZ Sub I will pay supplementary “dividends” to SPV Trust (to the extent of its non-resident unitholders) which will be passed on to the non-resident unitholders. As with imputation credits, supplementary dividends under the FITC regime will not be guaranteed nor will the dividend be grossed up if a full supplementary dividend is not paid. 14.Where certain Adjustment Events (broadly, these are defined as a conversion of ANZBG shares into larger or smaller units, bonus issues, rights issues, or other events that affect all the holders of ANZ shares pro rata) happen in relation to the ANZBG ordinary shares, SPV Trust will attempt to mirror the events in the units so that the direct (i.e. one for one) relationship between an SPV Trust unit and an ANZBG share is maintained. Paragraph 5 Schedule 2 of the Trust Deed provides for additional units to issued to replicate the ANZBG shares. It states: 5.1Adjustment Event Without limiting clauses 4.1 and 4.2, the Manager may issue Tracking Units upon, or as a consequence of, an Adjustment Event where the issue is made in order to effect an Equivalent Unit Entitlement. 5.2Manager may not reject or refuse The Manager may not reject an application for Tracking Units or refuse to issue Tracking Units where the application or issue is made as a result of or in connection with an Equivalent Unit Entitlement. 15.Equivalent Unit Entitlement is defined in the forward sale and purchase agreement (described below) as: Equivalent Unit Entitlement means, in relation to an Adjustment Event, an alteration to the entitlement of the Unit Holders to Units such that, following the making or the declaring of that alteration, the Unit Holders as a class are or would be in an equivalent position to that that they would have been in if they had exchanged their Units for ANZ Shares immediately prior to the Record Date for that Adjustment Event; for the purpose of this definition: (a) whether the Manager has declared an Equivalent Unit Entitlement may be specified by ANZ Determination; and (b) the N.Z.$ value of the relevant adjustment or entitlement payable or receivable by the holders of ANZ Shares in connection with the Adjustment Event is to be determined by reference to the Exchange Rate on the Adjustment Declaration Date; 16.Therefore, where an Adjustment Event, such as a conversion of ANZBG shares into larger or smaller units, bonus issues, and rights issues, occurs then the Manager may issue additional units to ensure that the units match the ANZBG shares. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 15 17.However, in some situations an event in relation to the ANZBG shares may not be able to be replicated in the issue of further units. If this occurs, the number of ANZBG shares received under the forward sale and purchase agreement will be altered. The way in which this will be effected is through the alteration of the exchange factor. Under normal circumstances the exchange factor is one. This means that the Investors receive one share for one unit. However, where an Adjustment Event occurs and the number of units held by the Investors does not change to reflect this, then the exchange factor changes to take account of this. This exchange factor takes into account the relevant Adjustment Event so that the number of shares that an Investor receives will be adjusted. Adjustments to the exchange factor are provided for in clause 4.2 of the forward sale and purchase agreement. Forward Sale and Purchase Agreement 18.The units are not redeemable while they are held by a person outside of the ANZ Group. However, they may be effectively exchanged for ANZBG shares in certain circumstances. At the time the units are issued, the Trustee of SPV Trust, as agent for the Investors, will enter into a forward sale and purchase agreement with ANZBG. 19.Under the forward sale and purchase agreement the Investors will agree to sell and ANZBG will agree to buy the units for an agreed amount (being the issue price of the units ). In addition, Investors will agree to purchase and ANZBG will agree to issue ANZBG shares for the same amount. These amounts will be offset against each other. 20.Clause 2 of this agreement provides for the sale and purchase of units and ANZ shares. It states: 2.Sale and purchase of Units and ANZ Shares 2.1Sale of Units The Agent agrees to sell to ANZ, and ANZ agrees to purchase from the Agent, the Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The purchase price for the Units shall be the Units Purchase Price, which ANZ shall pay to the Agent on the Issue Date. 2.2Issue of ANZ Shares ANZ agrees to issue to the Agent, and the Agent agrees to purchase from ANZ, ANZ Shares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The purchase price for those ANZ Shares shall be the ANZ Shares Purchase Price, which the Agent shall pay to ANZ on the Issue Date. 2.3Set-off of purchase prices The Units Purchase Price and the ANZ Shares Purchase Price shall be set off against each other so that no amount is actually paid by either party on the Issue Date. 2.4Lowest Price For the purposes of determining the consideration in section EH 48 of the Income Tax Act 1994, the parties agree that the Units Purchase Price and the ANZ Shares Purchase Price are the “lowest price” for the Units and the relevant ANZ Shares, respectively, on the basis of payment in full at the time at which the first rights in the Units or those ANZ Shares, as the case may be, is to be transferred. The agreement of the parties in this clause 2.4 is not affected by: (a) any change to the Exchange Factor at any time; or (b) any change to the total number of outstanding Units at any time; or (c) any other matter. 21.The forward sale and purchase agreement will be entered into on or about the date that the units are issued. On that date ANZBG will pay for the units and the Investors will pay for the shares. The price paid for the shares and units will be the same and will be the issue price of the units. This is because economically the Investors are acquiring a synthetic interest comparable to shares in ANZBG from the outset at a price equal to the value of ANZBG’s shares on the date the units are issued. It is also expected that the market value of the units and the ANZBG shares will be materially the same on the exchange date. 22.The Units Purchase Price and the ANZ Shares Purchase Price will be the same as the issue price of the units as determined under section 3.10 of the prospectus (referred to above). 23.Even though the term used above is “exchange”, clause 1.4 states: 1.4Use of term “exchange” The term “exchange” is used throughout this Agree- ment solely for the sake of simplicity. Despite the use of this term, the intention of the parties is that the legal nature of the arrangements effected by this Agreement constitutes two separate transactions for forward transfer - one being the sale of the Units for the Units Purchase Price and the other being the issue of ANZ Shares for the ANZ Shares Purchase Price. Also, in this Agreement “exchange” includes the alternative arrangements contemplated in Clause 3.4. 24.Delivery of the units and issue of the ANZBG shares pursuant to the forward sale and purchase agreement will be deferred, with delivery of the units triggering the immediate issue of shares. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 16 25.Clause 3.2 of the forward sale and purchase agreement provides for the situations in which the effective exchange will occur. Generally, exchange can occur in one of the following circumstances: •Between the date of issue of the units and the 30 th anniversary of that date, on the occurrence of certain Extraordinary Events or on the occurrence of a Change in Circumstance. •After the third anniversary of the date of issue, ANZBG can elect to effectively exchange at any time. •After the first anniversary of the date of issue, Investors can elect to effectively exchange at any time. •On the happening of a Mandatory Exchange Event. 26.Extraordinary Events are essentially situations where: •The Manager of the SPV Trust does not make a distribution to the Investors following the payment of a dividend on the ANZBG shares; •ANZ Sub I fails to attach imputation credits to the fullest extent available on the section FC 1 debentures issued to the SPV Trust; •The SPV Trust fails to attach imputation credits to the fullest extent available to the Investors; •An Adjustment Event occurs and the Manager does not take account of these; •The SPV Trust is insolvent; •The ANZ Board recommends that a takeover offer for ANZ be accepted; •The ANZ Board recommends that a merger proposal for ANZ be accepted; •A person has a substantial holding of more than fifty percent of all ANZBG shares; •SPV Trust does not list on the NZSE within 30 days from the issue date; •The SPV Trust is no longer listed on the NZSE or the quotation of units is suspended for more than 15 consecutive business days. 27.To summarise, a Change in Circumstance occurs if: •There is either: (a) a introduction of, or a change (including the announcement of a change) in a law, treaty, directive or policy of an agency of state or other regulatory or monetary authority or in its interpretation; or (b) one or more rulings made by the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department in relation to those arrangements being withdrawn or not applicable (in whole or in part); which has a materially adverse effect on the rights of ANZ, any subsidiary of ANZ, or the Investors or on the benefits or credits available to ANZ shareholders in relation to or in the context of the arrangements surrounding the offer of units or the investment of subscription proceeds; •One person (other than ANZ or a subsidiary of ANZ) has a “relevant interest” (as defined in section 5 and 6 of the Securities Amendment Act 1988) of at least 50 percent of all the units in the SPV Trust; •The SPV Trust does not list within 30 days from the date the units are first issued; •The SPV Trust’s listing on the NZSE is cancelled or the quotation of the units is suspended for more than 15 consecutive business days; •ANZNZ ceases to be a subsidiary of ANZ other than under certain situations. 28.Essentially, Mandatory Exchange Events are: •The thirtieth anniversary of the date the units are issued; •Where certain regulations by the APRA or the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (“RBNZ”) are not complied with; •Where APRA issues a written directive to ANZBG under section 11CA of the Banking Act 1959 (Australia) for ANZBG to increase its capital or appoints a statutory manager to ANZBG pursuant to section 13A(1) of the Banking Act 1959 (Australia); •Where an application or order is made, or resolution passed, for the winding up of ANZBG; •Where ANZBG’s retained earnings are negative, the manager of the trust ceases to be ANZ Investment Services or another subsidiary of ANZ, or ANZNZ is made subject to statutory management in New Zealand. 29.Where the delivery occurs on the happening of a Extraordinary Event, Change in Circumstance, or a Mandatory Exchange Event, or at the election of ANZBG between year three and the end of year 30, Investors will receive their full potential entitlement to ANZBG shares (effectively one per unit). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 17 30.Where Investors elect to effectively exchange between years one and 30, they will receive between 100% and 95% of that entitlement. The number of shares that each Investor receives is determined by the definition of the “exchangeable number” in the forward sale and purchase agreement. That definition states: Exchangeable Number means, on a Relevant Exchange Date in relation to a Relevant Unitholder, the number, rounded down to the nearest whole number, determined in accordance with the following formula: EN =U x EF x Y x P U P ANZ where: EN =the Exchangeable Number; U =the Relevant Units held by that Relevant Unitholder on that Relevant Exchange Date; EF =the Exchange Factor on that Relevant Exchange Date; Y =where the relevant Exchange Event is that set out in clause 3.2(b)(i), 0.98 and, in any other case, 1.0; P U =(a) where the relevant Exchange Event is that set out in clause 3.2(b)(i), the average, for the 10 business days immediately following the date of ANZ’s receipt of the relevant Unitholder Notice of Exchange, of the A$ equivalent of the volume weighted average sale price (rounded to the nearest four decimal places) per Unit on the NZSE for each business day during that period (converted into A$ at the Exchange Rate on that business day); and (b) in any other case, 1.0; and P ANZ =(a) where the relevant Exchange Event is that set out in clause 3.2(b)(i), the average, for the 10 business days immediately following the date of ANZ’s receipt of the relevant Unitholder Notice of Exchange, of the volume weighted average sale price (in A$) (rounded to the nearest four decimal places) per ANZ Share on the ASX for each business day during that period; and (b) in any other case, 1.0, provided that: (a) P U cannot be less than 0.97 or greater than P ANZ 1.02: and (b) Y x P U must be rounded to the nearest two P ANZ decimal places; 31.Should such an exchange occur prior to the payment of the second instalment on the units, the ANZBG shares delivered pursuant to the forward sale and purchase agreement will be partly paid to correspond with the amount paid up on the units. 32.Once the units have effectively been exchanged for ANZBG shares, the units continue to exist but will be held by a member of the ANZ group. Such a holder of the “exchanged units” may request the redemption of the units for an amount equal to their subscription price, adjusted where the redemption occurs prior to payment of the second instalment. However, the holder of the exchanged units has no right to require the redemption of these units. Loan to ANZ Sub I 33.SPV Trust will enter into a variable rate debenture agreement with ANZ Sub I whereby the SPV Trust will lend the funds invested by Investors to ANZ Sub I by way of a number of debentures which will be perpetual. The debentures will be issued in two series to coincide with the instalment payments made by Investors. The first series of debentures will be issued on the first instalment date and will be for a total amount equal to the amount raised in the first instalment (expected to be approximately 60% of the total issue size) plus the ordinary unit (that SPV Trust will issue to ANZ Sub I) subscription amount. The second series of debentures will be issued on the date of the second instalment expected to be nine to twelve months later and will equate to approximately 40% of the total proceeds obtained from the unit issue. 34.Interest on the debenture will be paid to coincide (in respect of dates and amounts) with the dividends paid by ANZBG on its ordinary shares. Until the second series of debentures is issued, the rate of interest on the first series will be payable as if the full number of debentures had been subscribed for. It is expected that ANZ Sub I will declare and pay dividends to ANZNZ on its ordinary shares. The amount of the dividends per share paid on ANZ Sub I’s ordinary shares is expected to be the New Zealand dollar equivalent of the amount of dividends per share paid by ANZBG on its ordinary shares. The timing of the payments by ANZ Sub I will be triggered by the payment of dividends by ANZBG on its ordinary shares. At the same time as ANZBG pays dividends on its ordinary shares, ANZ Sub II will pay amounts under the swap and the loan to ANZ Sub I. When ANZ Sub I receives these amounts it will pay dividends on the ordinary shares to ANZNZ and interest on the section FC 1 debentures to SPV Trust. The rate of interest paid on the section FC 1 debentures to SPV Trust will be calculated under a formula based on the amount of the dividend per share paid on ANZ Sub I’s ordinary shares to ANZNZ. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 18 35.Because the debentures will fall under section FC 1 of the Act, the interest payments will be deemed to be dividends and, together with dividends paid on ANZ Sub I’s ordinary shares, will have imputation credits attached to the extent that the credits are available. In addition, ANZ Sub I will elect to use the FITC regime in relation to SPV Trust. SPV Trust will be a section LE 3 holding company and ANZ Sub I will pay supplementary dividends to SPV Trust to the extent of SPV Trust’s non-resident Investors. However, imputation credits are not guaranteed to SPV Trust nor is there provision for the interest to be grossed up to the extent that imputation credits are not available. If no dividend is declared on ANZ Sub I’s ordinary shares, no interest will be paid on the loan from SPV Trust. Loan to ANZ Sub II 36.ANZ Sub I will enter into a loan agreement with ANZ Sub II whereby ANZ Sub I will lend the funds borrowed from SPV Trust to ANZ Sub II in the form of a loan. The loan will be made to ANZ Sub II in two tranches matching the funds raised by each series of the section FC 1 debentures (and ultimately reflecting the instalment payments made by Investors). 37.The loan will be perpetual. Interest will be payable semi-annually. The interest rate will be the six-month bank bill rate plus a margin to reflect the subordinated nature of the debt. The margin will be set in accordance with prevailing market rates. Loan to ANZBG NY 38.ANZ Sub II will enter into a variable rate debenture agreement with ANZBG NY (the New York branch of ANZBG) whereby ANZ Sub II will lend the money borrowed from ANZ Sub I to ANZBG NY by way of a number of section FC 1 debentures issued under a single agreement. The debentures will be issued in two series to coincide with the amount advanced under the loan from ANZ Sub I (and ultimately reflecting the instalment payments made by Investors). 39.The debentures will be denominated in New Zealand dollars. Interest will be payable to coincide with the dividend payable by ANZBG on its ordinary shares. The amount will be determined by a formula which will be based on the New Zealand dollar equivalent of the ANZBG cash dividend grossed up for withholding tax (if any). 40.ANZBG has conducted a branch in New York since the late 1970s. The operation includes an International Banking Facility, offers a wide range of wholesale banking services, and has a significant balance sheet of its own. ANZBG NY has total borrowings from third parties of approximately US$3-4 billion. The funds which ANZBG NY borrows from ANZ Sub II will be used in full to repay some of this third party debt to parties other than ANZ entities and/or acquire new income producing assets. 41.Despite the debentures being issued in two series, interest will be payable on the full amount from the beginning of the Arrangement, even though only the first series will have been issued during the first nine to twelve months. Swap 42.ANZ Sub I and ANZ Sub II will also enter into a dividend for interest swap. Under the swap agreement, ANZ Sub I will be obligated to pay ANZ Sub II an amount equal to the interest it receives from ANZ Sub II under the loan. In return, ANZ Sub II will be obligated to pay ANZ Sub I an amount equal to a multiple of the net cash dividend received on the ANZBG section FC 1 debentures. The multiple is a function of the New Zealand corporate tax rate and, based on the current tax rate of 33 %, will be 1.4925. The multiple is required to cover the tax payable by ANZ Sub I on the swap payment received. Therefore, if the tax rate changes, the multiple by which the dividend element of the swap payment is calculated will also change. Termination of the swap will be linked to termination of either the loan between ANZ Sub I and ANZ Sub II or the ANZBG NY section FC 1 debentures. 43.The payment that ANZ Sub I makes to ANZ Sub II under the swap will be made at the time ANZ Sub II makes the interest payment to ANZ Sub I under the loan. The payment that ANZ Sub II makes to ANZ Sub I under the swap will be made at the time ANZBG NY pays a dividend to ANZ Sub II on its section FC 1 debentures. Subvention payments 44.To the extent that ANZ Sub II is in a tax loss position due to the above arrangements, its loss will be reduced to nil by a combination of subvention payments received from ANZNZ (or other New Zealand group company) and offset elections. The subvention payments will be used by ANZ Sub II to satisfy part of its swap payment obligations to ANZ Sub I. It is contemplated that ANZ Sub II will be in a loss situation because it receives interest on the Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 19 section FC 1 debentures which it multiplies by 1.4925 and pays out to ANZ Sub I under the swap agreement. ANZ Sub II also has an obligation to pay interest on the loan that it has received from ANZ Sub I. However, this obligation is offset against the obligation that ANZ Sub I has under the swap agreement. The obligation being the payment of interest by ANZ Sub I to ANZ Sub II. Additional forward sale agreements 45.Pursuant to the forward sale agreement between ANZBG and the SPV Trust Investors, ANZBG will acquire the units in SPV Trust. 46. The intention is that these units will be held ultimately by ANZNZ so that the capital raised by New Zealand remains in New Zealand. This will be achieved via the following contemporaneous forward sale agreements: •ANZBG will enter into a forward sale agreement with ANZ Funds pursuant to which ANZ Funds will purchase units in SPV Trust from ANZBG for an amount equal to the issue price of the units. In addition, ANZBG will purchase preference shares to be issued by ANZ Funds for an amount equal to the price paid by ANZ Funds for the units. On the date of the agreement, the total value of all of the shares to be issued (and the amount that ANZBG pays for them) will be the same as the total value of all of the units to be acquired by ANZ Funds. No additional consideration will be paid to either party for entering into the forward sale agreement. Delivery of the units and issue of the shares will be similarly deferred as under the forward sale agreement between Investors and ANZBG. •ANZ Funds will enter into a forward sale agreement with ANZ Holdings pursuant to which ANZ Holdings will purchase units in SPV Trust from ANZ Funds for an amount equal to the issue price of the units. In addition, ANZ Funds will purchase preference shares to be issued by ANZ Holdings for an amount equal to the price paid by ANZ Holdings for the units. On the date of the agreement, the total value of all of the shares to be issued (and the amount that ANZ Funds pays for them) will be the same as the total value of all of the units. No additional consideration will be paid to either party for entering into the forward sale agreement. Delivery of the units and issue of the shares will be similarly deferred as under the forward sale agreement between ANZBG and ANZ Funds. •ANZ Holdings will enter into a forward sale agreement with ANZNZ pursuant to which ANZNZ will purchase the units in SPV Trust from ANZ Holdings, for an amount equal to the issue price of the units. In addition, ANZ Holdings will purchase ordinary shares to be issued by ANZNZ for an amount equal to the price paid by ANZNZ for the units. On the date of the agreement the total value of all of the shares to be issued (and the amount that ANZ Holdings pays for them) will be the same as the total value of all of the units. No additional consideration will be paid to either party for entering into the forward sale agreement. Delivery of the units and issue of shares will be similarly deferred as under the forward sale agreement between ANZ Funds and ANZ Holdings. 47.All forward sale agreements will be entered into on or about the date that the units are issued. Delivery under the various forward sale agreements will occur simultaneously and will be triggered by the delivery to ANZBG of SPV Trust units by Investors. At the end of year 30 48.On the 30 th anniversary of the date of issue of the units in SPV Trust to Investors, all units which have not been exchanged for ANZBG shares will be mandatorily exchanged under the forward sale agreement. Exchanges will also take place under the additional forward sale agreements between the ANZ companies in order for ANZNZ to hold the units. 49.The two section FC 1 debentures and the loan between ANZ Sub I and ANZ Sub II are perpetual and there is no present intention, arrangement, agreement, or understanding between the parties to make repayment of the instruments at a certain date or within or beyond a certain timeframe. Accounting treatment 50.SPV Trust will be consolidated with ANZNZ and the units in SPV Trust will be treated as equity in ANZNZ’s accounts. It is also anticipated that the capital will be Tier 1 capital for the ANZ Group and APRA has been approached to confirm this status. Exclusions 51.This Ruling does not consider or rule on any potential application of the interest allocation rules in subpart FH of the Act to the Arrangement. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 20 52.This Ruling does not consider or rule on any potential taxation implications of the alternative arrangements referred to in clause 3.4 of the forward sale and purchase agreement between the Investors and ANZBG. Assumption made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following assumption: i)The Trust Deed setting up the SPV Trust, the loan agreement between ANZ Sub I and SPV Trust, the loan agreement between ANZ Sub I and ANZ Sub II, the loan agreement between ANZBG NY and ANZ Sub II, and the swap agreement between ANZ Sub I and ANZ Sub II will not be materially different to the drafts provided to the Inland Revenue dated 18 May 2000. The forward sale and purchase agreement between ANZ Holdings and ANZNZ will not be materially different to the draft provided to the Inland Revenue dated 6 April 2000.

Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)All “dividends” (as defined in section CF 2) paid by ANZ Sub I and SPV Trust will be imputed at the same “imputation ratio” (as defined in section OB 1). b)The ANZBG shares will not be registered in a branch register in New Zealand under a law in force in another part of the Commonwealth. c)The value of the units at the date of entering into the forward sale and purchase agreement will not be materially different to the actual contracted price paid for the units by ANZBG. d)The events that give rise to the alternative arrangements under clause 3.4 of the forward sale and purchase agreement between the Investors and ANZBG will not arise as a result of actions or inactions arranged or agreed between ANZBG and any of the unitholders. ANZBG will use its best endeavours to ensure that it is lawfully able to issue ANZBG shares to the unitholders under the forward sale and purchase agreement. e)In relation to setting the price of the units (as described in clause 3.1 of the prospectus), where the Chairman of the ANZ exercises a discretion either where: (i)the rate determined using the formula in the prospectus is not a fair average NZ$/A$ exchange rate; or (ii)there is an abnormal market trading or other similar circumstance resulting in distortions in the price of ANZBG ordinary shares during the pricing period; the resulting unit price will be a fair arm’s length price. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicants and the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption and condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicants and the Arrangement as follows: •SPV Trust is a “unit trust” as defined in section OB 1. •Units in SPV Trust are “shares” for the purposes of the Act. •Investors in SPV Trust are “shareholders” for the purposes of the Act. •SPV Trust can maintain an imputation credit account under section ME 1(1). •The forward sale agreement between ANZBG and each Investor (through the Trustee of SPV Trust as agent) is a “financial arrangement” as defined in section EH 22. •The following amounts are the only amounts of consideration paid, to be paid, and payable to the Investors for the purposes of sections EH 33 and EH 47: -The amount payable for SPV Trust units by ANZBG to the Investors on the day that the forward sale agreement is entered into. -The ANZBG shares. Under section EH 48 the value of the shares, and therefore the consideration provided to the Investors, is the total issue price of the Investor’s parcel of units. •The following amounts are the only amounts of consideration paid, to be paid, and payable by the Investors for the purposes of sections EH 33 and EH 47: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 21 -The amount payable for the ANZBG shares by the Investors to ANZBG on the day that the forward sale agreement is entered into. -The units in SPV Trust. Under section EH 48 the value of the units, and therefore the consideration provided by the Investors, is the total issue price of the Investor’s parcel of units. •Where the number of shares received under the forward sale agreement increases prior to the transfer date due to an event in relation to the ANZBG ordinary shares not being replicated in the units, the consideration received by the Investors does not change. •In relation to the forward sale agreement between the Investors and ANZBG, there is no amount to allocate as income or expenditure to the Investors under section EH 33 and the base price adjustment calculation for the Investors under section EH 47 is nil. •In relation to the instalment payment arrangement for the units between SPV Trust and the Investors, there is no amount to allocate as income or expenditure to the Investors or to SPV Trust under section EH 33 and the base price adjustment calculation for both the Investors and SPV Trust is nil. •Where Investors acquire the units for the purpose of sale or other disposal the amount received for the units under the forward sale agreement will be gross income to the Investors under section CD 4 and a deduction will be allowable for the cost of the shares under sections BD 2 and DJ 13. The gross income is derived and the deduction allowed at the time the forward sale agreement is entered into under section EF 2. Under sections EH 26 and EH 48(3)(a), the amount received for the units will be the total issue price of the Investors parcel of units. Therefore, there will be no net income or expenditure to the Investors on the disposal of the units under the forward sale agreement. •Where Investors acquire the ANZBG ordinary shares for the purpose of sale or disposal and the amounts received for the shares are gross income under section CD 4, a deduction is allowed to Investors under sections BD 2 and DJ 13 for the cost of the shares in the year of disposal under section EF 2. •The Investors will not become “shareholders” (as defined in section OB 1) in ANZBG by virtue of them entering into the forward sale agreement, until such time as the ANZBG shares are transferred to them under that agreement. •The forward sale and purchase agreement and the transfer of shares under the agreement will not give rise to a dividend under sections CF 2 and OB 1. •Neither section GC 22 nor section GC 23 will apply to any payment of dividends or attachment of imputation credits under the Arrangement. •Provided that the SPV Trust and ANZ Sub I are able to attach and do attach sufficient imputation credits to dividends, and that amount of credits is the only amount of credit of tax claimed by the relevant shareholder (being in the case of dividends paid by ANZ Sub I, ANZNZ and the SPV Trust; and in the case of dividends paid by the SPV Trust, ANZ Sub I and the Investors) then, of itself, the Arrangement will not result in the application of section LB 2(7). •The sale and the purchase of the shares in terms of the contract entered into on behalf of the unit holders on the issue date will not give rise to a dutiable gift for the purposes of gift duty. •The sale and the purchase of the units in terms of the contract entered into on behalf of the unit holders on the issue date will not give rise to a dutiable gift for the purposes of gift duty. •Section BG 1 does not apply to vary or negate the application of the Taxation Laws referred to above. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 19 December 2000 to 19 December 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 19th day of December 2000.

Full interest write-off for part-time and/or part-year students Part-time and/or part-year students will qualify for a full interest write-off if they meet all of the following criteria: •they completed their course, or withdrew from the course without receiving a refund of any part of their tuition fees •the course was approved under section 258 of the Education Act 1989 •their net income 1 was $24,596 or less •they have supplied Inland Revenue with the appropriate confirmation of their income •they have supplied Inland Revenue with any information it needs to confirm their study status •they are resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes. Sections 2, 35, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 39, 40, 41, 50, 55, 59, 61, 62 and 87 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Sections 33A, 81 and 85D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Third Schedule of the Privacy Act 1993 Introduction New legislation gives effect to the Government’s decision not to charge interest on student loans for full-time, full-year students and low-income part-time and/or part-year students while they are studying. This will be achieved by way of an interest write-off by Inland Revenue after the end of each income year in which a borrower qualifies. The legislation also introduces a new base interest write-off, for those borrowers who do not qualify for the full interest write-off, which ensures that at least 50% of the compulsory repayment obligation is credited first to the CPI component of the interest charged, with any balance being credited to the loan principal. This will accelerate repayment of principal and therefore reduce the length of time that it will take borrowers to repay their loan. To qualify for either of these provisions, the borrower must be resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes. Background One of the Government’s stated objectives is to make tertiary education more affordable. The new legislation addresses the issues of debt escalation as a result of interest compounding on loans while borrowers are studying and the burden of long repayment periods faced by some borrowers. Key features Full-time, full-year students and part-time and/or part- year students whose net income (before tax) is $24,596 or less will receive a full interest write-off. The existing base interest write-off provisions have been amended and a number of consequential changes arising from the two amendments have been made. 1 This is net income as it is defined for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994 and therefore means a before tax amount. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 31 The interest that may be written off is any interest charged on or after 1 January 2000 on a loan taken out from that date, and on or after 1 April 2000 on any prior years’ borrowings. Amended base interest write-off provisions Those borrowers who do not qualify for a full interest write-off may qualify for the new base interest write- off. 2 To qualify for this borrowers must: •have supplied Inland Revenue with the appropriate confirmation of their income, and •be resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes. For those borrowers who qualify for the new base interest write-off, the repayment obligation will be divided into two. The first 50% will be credited to the base interest charged. If the base interest exceeds this, the difference will be written off. If the base interest is less than this, the excess will be applied in reducing the loan principal. The other 50% will be credited first to the CPI component of the interest charged and anything remaining will be credited to the loan principal. The following examples demonstrate the operation of the new base interest write-off. For simplicity these examples assume that no payments were made during the year. Had payments been made, the interest charged would be less. In each case the opening loan balance is $10,000, and the base interest and CPI components are $610 and $90 respectively. Repayment obligation $80 Opening loan balance 1 April 2000$10,000 Base interest write-off Base interest charged610 Less 50% of repayment obligation 40 Written off 570 CPI interest 90 Less 50% of repayment obligation 40 Capitalised interest 50 Closing loan balance 31 March 2001$10,050 Repayment obligation $1,000 Opening loan balance 1 April 2000$10,000 Base interest write-off Base interest charged610 Less 50% of repayment obligation 500 Written off 110 CPI interest 90 Less 50% of repayment obligation 500 Reduction in principal (410) Closing loan balance 31 March 2001 $9,590 Repayment obligation $1,600 Opening loan balance 1 April 2000$10,000 Base interest write-off Base interest charged610 Less 50% of repayment obligation 800 Written off Nil Reduction in principal (190) CPI interest 90 Less 50% of repayment obligation 800 Further reduction in principal (710) Closing loan balance 31 March 2001 $9,100 Consequential changes A number of consequential changes have been made as a result of the full interest write-off to be allowed to full-time, full-year students and to part-time and/or part-year students. The principal change is amendments to both the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow for the exchange of information between tertiary institutions, the Ministry of Education and Inland Revenue to allow a borrower’s study status to be determined. 2 Those borrowers who are resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes, and who do not qualify for a full interest write- off, will continue to receive a full base interest write-off if their income is less than the repayment threshold. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 32 Other consequential changes to the Student Loan Scheme Act are amendments that allow: •the interest write-off threshold to be amended by an Order in Council •when a borrower leaves or returns to New Zealand, or has a change in balance date resulting in a return for a period other than 12 months, the interest write-off threshold to be pro-rated according to the appropriate number of days •the Department of Work and Income to transfer information to Inland Revenue when borrowers have fully repaid their loans to enable Inland Revenue to calculate any interest write-off. The interest overpaid will be refunded unless there is a debt owing to Inland Revenue. The Tax Administration Act 1994 has also been amended to require part-time and/or part-year borrowers to file a tax return or respond to an income statement so that their income may be verified before a full interest write-off is allowed. Transitional borrowers Most loans begin and terminate within the same calendar year. However, it is possible for loans to span two calendar years, and there are a small number of borrowers who had loans that began in 1999 and terminated in 2000. The loans for these borrowers will be treated as prior year borrowing, and only interest charged on or after 1 April 2000 may be written off under the new rules for a full interest write-off. Overseas borrowers Two groups of overseas students may borrow from the student loan scheme. They are students who meet the normal eligibility criteria and: •are undertaking short periods of study as part of their approved course in New Zealand, or •are participating in recognised overseas exchange programmes for which student allowances are payable. Provided these students meet the other criteria (including that they are resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes), they will be entitled to a full interest write-off. The Ministry of Education will determine the study status for these borrowers and advise Inland Revenue of it in the usual manner. The provisions for borrowers studying overseas who are non-resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes are unchanged. These borrowers will continue to be entitled to a write-off of the base interest charged during the period of their study 3 if, in the Commissioner’s view, they would suffer serious hardship if payment of the non-resident repayment obligation (which includes the full amount of interest charged on the loan balance) was required and they: •had not had a loan transferred to Inland Revenue for collection in the income year under consideration, and •were engaged in full-time study outside New Zealand, and •would suffer hardship if required to pay the base interest charged for the period of their study. Application date The legislation came into force on 15 December 2000, being the day after that on which it received the Royal assent. The full interest write-off applies to interest charged on or after: •1 January 2000 on money advanced under a loan contract entered into on or after that date, and •1 April 2000 in respect of any prior years’ borrowings. The new base interest write-off provisions apply from the 2000–2001 income year. 3 Depending on the borrower’s circumstances, this may be a partial write-off only.

The savings arise because, from the 2000–2001 income year, only 50% of the repayment obligation will be credited to the base interest charged and any excess will be written off. The other 50% will be credited first to the interest adjustment interest (this is equivalent to the CPI and until now has been capitalised as at 31 March each year) charged for the year and second to the loan principal. This means that your loan balance will reduce faster. The savings vary according to the size of the loan balance (which determines the amount of base interest charged) and the borrower’s income (which determines the amount of the repayment obligation). The maximum amount saved is 50% of the compulsory repayment obligation. For simplicity, the above figures assume that no payments were made during the year. Because the maximum amount that can be saved is 50% of the repayment obligation, payments (which would reduce the interest charge) may not reduce the above savings. The savings for any particular borrower can only be determined on the basis of his or her income and loan balance. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 36 LIVESTOCK VALUES – 2001 NATIONAL STANDARD COSTS FOR SPECIFIED LIVESTOCK The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has released a determination, reproduced below, setting the national standard costs for specified livestock for the 2000/2001 income year. These costs are used by livestock owners to value livestock on hand at the end of the income year where they have adopted the national standard cost (NSC) scheme to value any class of livestock. The NSC scheme reflects the national average costs of production of various types and classes of livestock. Farmers using the scheme apply national standard costs to stock bred on the farm during the year and to immature animals on hand at the beginning of the year. Livestock they buy are valued at their purchase price. The average of these costs is used to find the closing value of livestock on hand. NATIONAL STANDARD COSTS FOR SPECIFIED LIVESTOCK DETERMINATION 2001 This determination may be cited as “The National Standard Costs for Specified Livestock Determination, 2001”. This determination is made in terms of section EL 3A of the Income Tax Act 1994. It shall apply to any specified livestock on hand at the end of the 2000/2001 income year, where the taxpayer has elected to value that livestock under the national standard cost scheme for that income year. For the purposes of section EL 3A of the Income Tax Act 1994, the national standard costs for specified livestock for the 2000/2001 income year are as set out in the following table.

We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. QUALIFYING FOREIGN PRIVATE ANNUITY EXEMPTION FROM THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUND REGIME Section CG 15(2)(g), Income Tax Act 1994 – what constitutes an interest in a Foreign Investment Fund A taxpayer has asked for clarification of the operation of the qualifying foreign private annuity (“QFPA”) exemption in section CG 15(2)(g). In particular, she has asked at what point the test for a QFPA is to be applied. This query was raised in the context of Example 2 of Part 2, and Example 9 of Part 5, of the Appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 5 (September 1996) which contains a description of the QFPA rules. Section CG 15(2)(g) states: An interest held by a person in a foreign entity at any time during an income year shall not be treated as an interest in a foreign investment fund – ... (g)If, subject to subsections (3) and (4), at the time, the interest is a qualifying foreign private annuity. (Emphasis added) Section OB 1 defines the qualifying foreign private annuity in part as follows: “Qualifying foreign private annuity” means an entitlement of a natural person to benefit from a pension or annuity provided by a foreign entity while the person is resident in New Zealand, if— (a)The consideration for the entitlement to the pension or annuity is provided to the foreign entity— (i)At a time when the person is not resident in New Zealand; or (ii)At a time when the person is resident in New Zealand falling before the first day of the 4th income year succeeding the income year in which the person last becomes a resident of New Zealand; or (iii)From the accumulated balance or proceeds of an interest of the person in a superannuation fund and that interest is commuted or transferred in anticipation of, or following, the person ceasing to be a resident of New Zealand; and ... . To be a QFPA within the definition of that term in section OB 1, a pension or annuity must meet certain criteria. One requirement is that the consideration for the QFPA must be provided “at a time when the person is resident in New Zealand falling before the first day of the 4th income year succeeding the income year in which the person last becomes a resident of New Zealand”. The exemption in section CG 15(2)(g) uses the words “at the time”, indicating that it is the QFPA status at a particular time that is important. The taxpayer has asked if, when a breach occurs, this means that: •the annuity was never a QFPA at any time, or •it fails to be a QFPA only from the time of the breach. Example 2 in the above mentioned Tax Information Bulletin implies that if taxpayers breach the above criterion they will be said never to have met the QFPA definition, and will therefore have been subject to the foreign investment fund (“FIF”) regime from the point when they last became resident in New Zealand. The test is whether the consideration is paid before the first day of the 4th income year after the taxpayer becomes resident in New Zealand. There are two possible interpretations of the Act as to the consequences of this requirement. One is to say that if the time limit is breached, the taxpayer has failed to meet the definition from the beginning of the grace period, i.e. from the point when the person last became resident. In that case a breach would mean that the FIF interest was never a QFPA. The alternative interpretation is to say that the definition may be met up until the beginning of the income year in which the time limit requirement is breached. This would mean that the FIF interest ceases to be a QFPA when this particular criterion is not met. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 39 The legislation is ambiguous as to when the test is to be applied. In CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd \[1994\] 3 NZLR 43 the Court of Appeal said that words in legislation must be given their ordinary meaning, but that if the meaning is unclear it is permissible to consider the purpose of the legislation, having regard to the total context of the words used while still being constrained by the actual words used in the section, in order to arrive at the meaning intended by the legislature. This ensures that an anomalous interpretation is not favoured when two or more interpretations are available. The Court also said that one should approach the question of statutory interpretation on the premise that the legislature will not have intended absurdity or injustice. Therefore, it is worth considering the scheme and purpose behind the QFPA definition and section CG 15(2)(g) to see which of the two possible interpretations is to be preferred. The QFPA exemption (relating to returning residents) may be compared with the “new resident exemption” in section CG 15(2)(f). It is arguable that the two exemptions were intended by the legislature to parallel each other, and that accordingly the same result should be reached under both types of exemption. The new resident exemption does not require that consideration be provided within any particular time period. New residents with interests in foreign pension plans simply have 3 years before they must return FIF income. The QFPA exemption was introduced some time after the new resident exemption. It is not clear why the QFPA exemption imposes the time limit on consideration paid to foreign annuities while the new resident exemption does not. However, it is strongly arguable that Parliament did not intend returning residents to be treated more harshly than new residents. Also, interpreting the exemption so that taxpayers who breach fall outside the exemption from when they last became resident, would have practical consequences as taxpayers breaching the 4-year limit would have to amend their returns for the previous 4 years in order to comply with the FIF regime. In addition to these compliance costs, potentially harsh interest and penalties may be imposed on taxpayers that breach the time limit but have not previously returned their FIF income. It is considered that the correct interpretation of this exemption is that taxpayers who breach the consideration requirement are deemed to hold a FIF interest from the first day of the 4th income year from when they last became resident. In other words, a FIF interest ceases to be a QFPA from the beginning of the income year in which the time limit requirement is breached. This means that in Example 2 in Part 2 of the Appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 5 (September 1996) (pages 4-5) the taxpayer’s interest in her foreign superannuation scheme would cease to be a QFPA from 1 April 2001 (the fourth income year), as Mrs P (the taxpayer in that example) continues to make contributions after this date. The definition of a QFPA would be met for the period from 11 July 1997 (the date that she returned to New Zealand) until 31 March 2001. It should be noted that although a QFPA is not taxable under the FIF regime, distributions may still be taxable under other provisions of the Act. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 40 TOURISM SERVICE PROVIDERS’ PAYMENTS MADE TO TOUR GUIDES OR DRIVERS – THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY OF THOSE PARTIES AND THE TOUR OPERATOR EMPLOYING THE GUIDE OR DRIVER “Source deduction payment” is defined in section OB 2(1) as: ... a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument, a payment made to a specified office holder in respect of the activities of a specified office, or a withhold- ing payment. \[Emphasis added.\] The tour operators have no PAYE liability in respect of these payments under sections BE 1(1) and NC 2(1). Firstly, given the assumption above that no relationship exists between the payer and the tour operator, the payments are not from the tour operators. Secondly, the payments are not made in respect of or in relation to employment. Case law shows that the employment must give rise to the payment, rather than simply being the context or setting for it. Although the payee would not receive the payment but for being an employee, the “but for” test is not the test applied by the courts. The payee does not receive the payment in respect of, or in relation to his or her job, as the payment is premised on the payee doing something more than his or her job entails, namely choosing where to go on the basis of the payment. Accordingly, the tour operator has no tax obligations in respect of the payments. The payer’s position If the payments are made to New Zealand residents no obligation to deduct PAYE arises for the payer unless the payee is an employee of the tourism service provider. It has been assumed for the purposes of this item that no such employment relationship exists. Therefore, the payments are not “in respect of or in relation to employment” and no PAYE need be deducted. Where the payments are made to non-residents there is an obligation on the payer, subject to the payee having a certificate of exemption, to make withholding deductions as the payments are within Schedule E (contract payments made to a non-resident contractor) of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979. In relation to deductibility to the payer, while the matter will depend on the circumstances of the case, assuming the making of the payments to the payees can be substantiated, the Commissioner’s practice is that these payments will generally be deductible. Income Tax Act 1994 and Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 We have been asked about the tax implications of payments made by tourism service providers (those selling services or goods to tourists) to those employed in the tourism industry, such as coach drivers and tour escorts, to encourage the taking of passengers or clients to those particular tourism service providers. The payments are colloquially known as “commissions”. This item considers the application of the Income Tax Act 1994 to each of the following parties: •The tour operator—the business principal (e.g. a company or partnership) providing the service of tours. The tour operator is generally the employer of the tour guide or coach driver who receives the payments. References to the tour operator in this item are references to this entity. •The tourism service provider—the entity making the payments. The person in the business of providing goods or services to tourists, e.g. tourist attractions or activities, motels and tearooms. In this item the tourism service provider is referred to as the payer. •The tour guides, tour escorts, or coach drivers—mostly individuals employed by the tour operators – referred to as the payee in this item. It is the payee who receives payment from the tourism service provider. Occasionally, a business entity, rather than an individual, may contract with the tour operator to provide tour escort or driving services. This item assumes that no employment relationship exists between the payer and the payee. It is further assumed that no arrangement exists between the tour operator and the payer, e.g. a tour operator instructs the payee to favour a particular tourism service provider who will provide payments. Application of the legislation The tour operator’s position Sections BE 1(1) and NC 2(1) require PAYE to be deducted where an employee receives a source deduction payment from an employer. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 41 The payee’s position The payments are not assessable as monetary remuneration under section CH 3 as, for the reasons stated above, they are not “in respect of or in relation to” employment. However, the payee remains assessable under section CD 5 as the payments are income according to ordinary concepts. This is because the receipts in question have the hallmarks of income (refer Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176). In terms of the payment’s quality in the hands of the recipient, it is clearly a payment received for doing something. Even if paid in advance, the payments are premised on the payee eventually bringing in clients. Thus they are payments made in respect of services. The payments are made for services rather than being gifts, because they are made in the context of business dealings. In some instances, instead of a cash sum, the payee may receive goods or services. In those circumstances, the convertibility principle (Tennant v Smith \[1892\] AC 150 (HL), Dawson v CIR \[1978\] ATC 6,012) will operate to include as income benefits received that can be converted into money. However, not all benefits will be income as income does not include what is saved from going out. So, for example, clothing or passes to an attraction would be income as they could be sold by the recipient; but a free meal received by a coach driver every time he or she brought in tourists would not be. Some payees will be assessable as New Zealand tax residents as they will satisfy the tests for residency in sections OE 1 and OE 2. However, subject to any relevant Double Taxation Agreement, non-residents remain assessable as the income is deemed to be derived in New Zealand by section OE 4(l)(q)—income derived from contracts made or wholly or partly performed in New Zealand, or section OE 4(1)(u)— income derived directly or indirectly from any other source in New Zealand. As noted above, there may be an obligation on the payer to deduct withholding deductions when the payments are to non-residents. A payee may be a business entity that, as part of its business, contracts services to the tour operator. In this event, the payments will be gross income under section CD 3 as amounts derived from a business, or under section CD 5 for the reasons stated earlier. Conclusion The tour operator has no tax obligations in respect of the payments as the payments are not from the tour operators, nor received in respect of or in relation to the employment of the payee. Where the payments are made to New Zealand tax residents, the payer has no tax obligations. Where the payments are made to non-residents, the payer has, subject to the payee having a certificate of exemption, an obligation to deduct withholding deductions. A payee is liable, subject to the provisions of any relevant Double Taxation Agreement, to pay tax on the payments regardless of the outcome of the residence tests in sections OE 1 and OE 2, as the income is deemed to be derived in New Zealand under section OE 4(1)(q) or section OE 4(1)(u). If the payee receives the payment in the course of the payee’s business, the payment is gross income under section CD 3. In other situations, the payments will be gross income under section CD 5. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 42 LEGAL DECISIONS – CASE NOTES This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We’ve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. WHETHER ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISIONS OF THE ACCRUALS RULES APPLY TO GIFTS MADE TO TRUSTS BY THE RESPONDENT Case:CIR v Auckland Harbour Board Decision date:24 January 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Summary This was the Commissioner’s appeal from part of the Court of Appeal judgment at (1999) 19 NZTC 15,433. The taxpayer had discontinued its appeal against that part of the Court of Appeal judgment that found for the Commissioner. Consequently, the result in the Court of Appeal judgment remains unaltered. Facts The case concerns the application of the base price adjustment and anti-avoidance provisions of the accrual rules in relation to gifts made on 22 and 23 December 1988 by the Auckland Harbour Board (“AHB”) to two trusts of financial arrangements which were subsequently vested in the Auckland Regional Council. The Commisioner accepted that, in the absence of the invocation of an anti-avoidance provision, the transfer to the trusts falls within section 64F and allows the AHB to make a base price adjustment on a 100% loss. He argued however, that section 64J applies and under that section he had regard to the connection between the parties and to other relevant circumstances, and determined that the parties were dealing with each other in relation to the transfer in a manner that had the effect of defeating the intent and application of sections 64B to 64M of the Act (the accruals rules). Decision Their Lordships found that the transfer for nil consideration did not defeat the intent and application of the accruals rules. Section 64J(1) contemplates that the circumstances that justify its application will be specific to a particular transaction, arising out of the relationship between the parties and other relevant circumstances. Its use is similar to section 99, in that it is aimed at transactions that, in commercial terms, fall within the charge for tax but have been, intentionally or otherwise, structured in such a way that on a purely juristic analysis they do not. In the present case they held that there was no such tension. A transfer of financial arrangements for no consideration attracts a deduction, and their Lordships did not find any principle that would be infringed by taking the terms of section 64F at face value. Other sections appear to contemplate that a transfer for no consideration will nevertheless be covered by and affected by the accruals rules. Observation on “Fiscal Nullity” cases and anti-avoidance provisions The Privy Council observed of general anti-avoidance provisions that: “Some of the work such provisions used to do has nowadays been taken over by the more realistic approach to the construction of taxing acts exemplified by WT Ramsay Ltd v Inland Revenue Commissioners \[1982\] AC 300, although their Lordships should not be taken as casting doubt on the usefulness of such tax avoidance provisions as a long stop for the Revenue.” Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 2 (February 2001) 43 WHETHER PROFIT ON SALE OF PROPERTIES ASSESSABLE INCOME In regards to the remaining four properties, as these properties had been bought earlier, His Honour accepted that up to a particular point in time, probably till October 1992, the disputant may have been purchasing properties for residential letting purposes with conversion to a commercial leasing a desired prospect at some indefinite time in the future. On that basis His Honour considered that the profits from the sale of those four properties are not assessable to the disputant unless caught by section 67(4)(d). Section 67(4)(d) assesses profits from the sale of land held for less than ten years where at least 20% of the profit is due to zoning or similar change, or the likelihood of it. If 20% of the profit arises in that manner, then the whole of the profit is taxable. His Honour considered the conflicting evidence of two expert valuers and found that it was not correct to regard at least 20% of the profits on sale of those four properties as being due to the likelihood of zoning changes. His Honour considered that such profits flowed from the importance of the properties to the plans and strategies of the other company and that, even though those plans and strategies must have involved the likelihood of the other company obtaining appropriate zoning changes to develop the mall, it is too imprecise and indirect a matter when looked at in respect of the application of section 67(4)(d) to the disputant. Case:TRA Number 030/99. Decision Number 23/2001 Decision date:1 December 2000 Act:Income Tax Act 1994 Keywords:Property sales, capital v revenue Summary Judge Barber found partially for the CIR and partially for the disputant Facts The disputant was formed pursuant to a Deed of Trust dated 25 September 1990. Since its inception, the disputant had purchased a number of residential properties and some had been on-sold. This case specifically concerns nine of those properties that were purchased on various dates but that were all sold together on one date, 5 April 1993. The disputant’s interest in three additional properties was assigned on the same date. All twelve properties were purchased by another company as part of its development of a mall. In March 1999 the Commissioner assessed the profits derived from the sale of nine of those properties as the disputant’s assessable income. Decision In regards to five of the properties, Judge Barber, found that the disputant had bought them for speculation and knew that it was almost certain to be able to sell them at a very good profit to another company in the reasonably near future. With regard to the evidence overall, His Honour found that the Disputant’s intention with regard to those properties was that of resale and that they were acquired as part of a land dealing business. His Honour also found that those particular properties were part of a scheme or undertaking entered into for the purpose of making a profit and that the scheme or undertaking commenced at least from the time that the disputant learnt that another company was to purchase the mall. The disputant knew that the owner of the mall would need to acquire those properties, or that they could be sold to a competitor and so it bought them with the intention of resale.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 01/01 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Russell Investment Management Limited (“RIML”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CG 1, CG 4, CG 6, CG 7, CG 13, CG 15, CF 3, and the definitions of “accounting period”, “non taxable bonus issue” and “income interest of 10% or greater” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the investment by New Zealand resident investors in the Russell International Bond Fund - $A Hedged (“RIBF”), an Australian resident unit trust. The RIBF is a Fund established under the umbrella trust deed of the Russell Multi- Manager Unit Trust (“RMMUT”), dated 21 November 1997. The operation of the RIBF and the RMMUT governed by the New Zealand Amended Russell Multi-Manager Unit Trust Constitution, in the form provided to Rulings with a covering letter dated 20 November 2000 and lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 1 December 2000. The prospectus in respect of the RIBF and other Funds established under the RMMUT was lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on 25 September 1999. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The manager and trustee of the RIBF has been changed to the responsible entity as a result of a change to Australian legislation. The responsible entity is RIML, an Australian resident company. The centre of management and control of the RIBF is in Australia. 2.RIML, in its capacity as responsible entity of RIBF, will at all times during the accounting periods covered by this Ruling be liable to income tax in Australia by reason of domicile, residence, place of incorporation or place of management in Australia. 3.The RIBF commenced on 1 December 1997 and terminates on 30 November 2077. 4.The investment objective of the RIBF, as set out in the prospectus, is to provide investors with exposure to a portfolio of international fixed income securities. 5.The prospectus provides for two classes of units, Class A and Class B. The prospectus provides that: •unitholders in Class A units may elect to have their income entitlements in respect of a Fund reinvested in Class A units in that Fund. •the income entitlements of Class B units of a Fund will be automatically reinvested in additional Class B units in that Fund. •the policy of compulsory reinvestment of income entitlements in respect of Class B units may be varied by the responsible entity at its discretion. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 3 (March 2001) 5 6.The prospectus provides that each unit in a Fund entitles an investor to an equal interest in that Fund, but does not confer any interest in any particular asset of a Fund or the right to interfere with the management of a Fund. Specifically investors do not have: •any entitlement to or any entitlement to acquire any shares in a foreign company held by the RIBF; •any entitlement to or any entitlement to acquire a right to vote in respect of a foreign company in which the RIBF holds shares; •any entitlement to or any entitlement to acquire a right to receive, or to have dealt with on their behalf, any income of any company in which the RIBF holds shares; •any entitlement to or any entitlement to acquire a right to receive, or have dealt with on their behalf, any assets of any company in which the RIBF holds shares. 7.All transactions between the investors and the RIBF will occur at market value. 8.The New Zealand Amended Russell Multi- Manager Unit Trust Constitution contains the following relevant clauses: Clause 4.1: The beneficial interest in each Fund will be divided into Units. Subject to the terms of issue that attach to any Unit or class of Units, every Unit confers an equal interest in the relevant Fund but not an interest in any particular part of that Fund. Clause 7.1: A Unit Holder is entitled to a beneficial interest in the relevant Trust Fund but may not: (a) interfere with the exercise of the Responsible Entity’s powers; or (b) exercise any rights in respect of any investment or require the transfer of any property. Clause 15.1: (a) The Distributable Income of a Fund for a Distribu- tion Period will be determined by the Responsible Entity having regard to: (i) the Accounting Income of that Fund; (ii) the Tax Income of that Fund; (iii)any amount held in a reserve or previously provided for; and (iv)the portion of the Tax Income of that Fund attributable to franking or foreign tax credits or similar deemed assessable amounts. ... Clause 15.4: The Distributable Income of a Fund for a Distribution Period must be distributed by the Responsible Entity to the relevant Unit Holders no later than the applicable Distribution Date. Clause 15.5: Subject to clause 15.6 and the terms of issue of any Units, the Distributable Income of a Fund for each Distribution Period, to the extent to which it has not been dealt with under clause 11.11, after payment of, or providing for, all taxes will be distributed to registered Unit Holders in that Fund at the close of business on the last day of the Distribution Period, in proportion to the number of Units of which they are registered holders at such date. Clause 15.6: (a) Under the terms of issue of any Units, the Responsible Entity may invite or require Unit Holders in a Fund to reinvest any or all of the amount which they would otherwise receive as a distribution under Clause 15.5 by way of application for additional Units in that Fund or another Fund. The terms of any such invitation or requirement will be determined by the Responsible Entity. Any invitation or requirement may be withdrawn or varied by the Responsible Entity. (b) Units so applied for will be deemed to have been issued on such date and time as the Responsible Entity determines following the Distribution Period in respect of which the Distributable Income has accrued or such other date determined by the Responsible Entity. Units will be issued at a price determined in accordance with Clause 4.2. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)For New Zealand tax purposes the RIBF is a unit trust as defined in section OB 1. b)Tresponsible entity of the RIBF will calculate its income liable to income tax without applying any features of the taxation law of Australia specified in Part B of Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994. c)Where the terms of issue of the units require the investor to apply for additional units in the RIBF rather than cash distributions of the RIBF’s distributable income, the trustee of the RIBF will not elect pursuant to section CF 8 that the issue of additional units will be a taxable bonus issue. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 3 (March 2001) 6 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •If the RIBF is a Controlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) as defined in section CG 4: •A New Zealand resident investor will not be required to return attributed foreign income or loss from the RIBF pursuant to section CG 1 by virtue of section CG 13(1); and •Subject to section CG 6(1)(a), an investor with an “income interest of 10% or greater” (as defined in section OB 1) for any “accounting period” (as defined in section OB 1) in the RIBF will be required to return Foreign Investment Fund (“FIF”) income or loss of the RIBF pursuant to section CG 1, attributed to the investor pursuant to section CG 7(5). •A New Zealand resident investor that does not have an “income interest of 10% or greater” (as defined in section OB 1) in the RIBF is not required to return FIF income or loss pursuant to section CG 7(5). If the RIBF is a CFC as defined in section CG 4 (the first tier CFC) and the RIBF has “qualified control interests” (as defined in section CG 4(6)) in another foreign company (the underlying foreign company) and as a consequence the underlying foreign company is a CFC as defined in section CG 4: •Subject to section CG 6(1)(a) and section CG 13, where an investor in the RIBF has an “income interest of 10% or greater” (as defined in section OB 1) for any “accounting period” (as defined in section OB 1) in the underlying CFC, the investor will be required to return attributed foreign income or loss of the underlying CFC pursuant to section CG 1; and •Subject to section CG 6(1)(a), where an investor in the RIBF has an “income interest of 10% or greater” (as defined in section OB 1) for any “accounting period” (as defined in section OB 1) in the underlying CFC, the investor will be required to return FIF income or loss of the underlying CFC pursuant to section CG 1, attributed to the investor pursuant to section CG 7(5). •Where an investor in the RIBF does not have an “income interest of 10% or greater” (as defined in section OB 1) in the underlying CFC, FIF income or loss of the underlying CFC will not be attributed to the investor pursuant to section CG 7(5) and the investor will not be required to return FIF income or loss of the underlying CFC pursuant to section CG 1. If the underlying foreign company is a CFC and has “qualified control interests” (as defined in section CG 4(6)) in another foreign company, and as a consequence the other foreign company is a CFC as defined in section CG 4, and so on down the chain of CFCs, the above three rulings shall also apply on the basis that any other foreign company is the underlying foreign company. •If the RIBF is not a CFC or the RIBF is a CFC and the investor does not have an “income interest of 10% or greater” (as defined in section OB 1) in the RIBF for any “accounting period” (as defined in section OB 1), a New Zealand resident investor’s interest in the RIBF will not constitute an investment in a FIF by virtue of the exemption contained in section CG 15(2)(b). •Where the terms of issue of the units require the investor to apply for additional units in the RIBF rather than cash distributions of the RIBF’s distributable income, the issue of additional units will constitute a non-taxable bonus issue to the investor and accordingly will be excluded from the definition of a dividend pursuant to section CF 3(1)(a). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 11 January 2001 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11th day of January 2001.

Clause 15.6: (a) Under the terms of issue of any Units, the Responsible Entity may invite or require Unit Holders in a Fund to reinvest any or all of the amount which they would otherwise receive as a distribution under Clause 15.5 by way of applica- tion for additional Units in that Fund or another Fund. The terms of any such invitation or requirement will be determined by the Responsible Entity. Any invitation or requirement may be withdrawn or varied by the Responsible Entity. (b) Units so applied for will be deemed to have been issued on such date and time as the Responsible Entity determines following the Distribution Period in respect of which the Distributable Income has accrued or such other date determined by the Responsible Entity. Units will be issued at a price determined in accordance with Clause 4.2. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)For New Zealand tax purposes the RWBF is a unit trust as defined in section OB 1. b)The responsible entity of the RWBF will calculate its income liable to income tax without applying any features of the taxation law of Australia specified in Part B of Schedule 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994. c)Where the terms of issue of the units require the investor to apply for additional units in the RWBF rather than cash distributions of the RWBF’s distributable income, the trustee of the RWBF will not elect pursuant to section CF 8 that the issue of additional units will be a taxable bonus issue. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •If the RWBF is a Controlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) as defined in section CG 4: •A New Zealand resident investor will not be required to return attributed foreign income or loss from the RWBF pursuant to section CG 1 by virtue of section CG 13(1); and •Subject to section CG 6(1)(a), an investor with an “income interest of 10% or greater” (as defined in section OB 1) for any “accounting period” (as defined in section OB 1) in the RWBF will be required to return Foreign Investment Fund (“FIF”) income or loss of the RWBF pursuant to section CG 1, attributed to the investor pursuant to section CG 7(5). •A New Zealand resident investor that does not have an “income interest of 10% or greater” (as defined in section OB 1) in the RWBF is not required to return FIF income or loss pursuant to section CG 7(5). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 3 (March 2001) 12 •If the RWBF is a CFC as defined in section CG 4 (the first tier CFC) and the RWBF has “qualified control interests” (as defined in section CG 4(6)) in another foreign company (the underlying foreign company) and as a consequence the underlying foreign company is a CFC as defined in section CG 4: •Subject to section CG 6(1)(a) and section CG 13, where an investor in the RWBF has an “income interest of 10% or greater” (as defined in section OB 1) for any “accounting period” (as defined in section OB 1) in the underlying CFC, the investor will be required to return attributed foreign income or loss of the underlying CFC pursuant to section CG 1; and •Subject to section CG 6(1)(a), where an investor in the RWBF has an “income interest of 10% or greater” (as defined in section OB 1) for any “accounting period” (as defined in section OB 1) in the underlying CFC, the investor will be required to return FIF income or loss of the underlying CFC pursuant to section CG 1, attributed to the investor pursuant to section CG 7(5). •Where an investor in the RWBF does not have an “income interest of 10% or greater” (as defined in section OB 1) in the underlying CFC, FIF income or loss of the underlying CFC will not be attributed to the investor pursuant to section CG 7(5) and the investor will not be required to return FIF income or loss of the underlying CFC pursuant to section CG 1. If the underlying foreign company is a CFC and has “qualified control interests” (as defined in section CG 4(6)) in another foreign company, and as a consequence the other foreign company is a CFC as defined in section CG 4, and so on down the chain of CFCs, the above three rulings shall also apply on the basis that any other foreign company is the underlying foreign company. •If the RWBF is not a CFC or the RWBF is a CFC and the investor does not have an “income interest of 10% or greater” (as defined in section OB 1) in the RWBF for any “accounting period” (as defined in section OB 1), a New Zealand resident investor’s interest in the RWBF will not constitute an investment in a FIF by virtue of the exemption contained in section CG 15(2)(b). •Where the terms of issue of the units require the investor to apply for additional units in the RWBF rather than cash distributions of the RWBF’s distributable income, the issue of additional units will constitute a non-taxable bonus issue to the investor and accordingly will be excluded from the definition of a dividend pursuant to section CF 3(1)(a). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 11 January 2001 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11th day of January 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 3 (March 2001) 13 PRODUCT RULING - BR PRD 01/04 3.The RWSF commenced on 15 June 1998 and terminates on 14 June 2078. 4.The investment objective of the RWSF, as set out in the prospectus and the investment statement, is to provide long term returns by investing in a highly diversified portfolio of international, Australian and New Zealand equities. 5.The prospectus provides for two classes of units, Class A and Class B. The prospectus provides that: ·unitholders in Class A units may elect to have their income entitlements in respect of a Fund reinvested in Class A units in that Fund. ·the income entitlements of Class B units of a Fund will be automatically reinvested in additional Class B units in that Fund. ·the policy of compulsory reinvestment of income entitlements in respect of Class B units may be varied by the responsible entity at its discretion. 6.The investment statement only provides for investment in class B units. The investment statement states that distributions from class B units are compulsorily reinvested towards the purchase of further units, and cannot be received in cash unless the responsible entity exercises its discretion to alter the terms of issue to allow distributions. 7.The prospectus provides that each unit in a Fund entitles an investor to an equal interest in that Fund, but does not confer any interest in any particular asset of a Fund or the right to interfere with the management of a Fund. Specifically investors do not have: •any entitlement to or any entitlement to acquire any shares in a foreign company held by the RWSF; •any entitlement to or any entitlement to acquire a right to vote in respect of a foreign company in which the RWSF holds shares; •any entitlement to or any entitlement to acquire a right to receive, or to have dealt with on their behalf, any income of any company in which the RWSF holds shares; •any entitlement to or any entitlement to acquire a right to receive, or have dealt with on their behalf, any assets of any company in which the RWSF holds shares.

PARTNERSHIP INCOME – ACC RESIDUAL CLAIMS LEVY – CLASSIFICATION BY PARTNERS Legislation The Accident Insurance Act 1998 defines “Earnings as a self-employed person” – 20. “Earnings as a self-employed person” - (1) “Earnings as a self-employed person”, in relation to any person and any income year, - (a)Means A minus B, A being the amount described in subsection (2) and B being the amount described in subsection (3); and (b)Does not include any earnings as an employee or earnings as a shareholder-employee. (2) A is the amount of gross income (if any)- (a)That the person derives in the income year for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994; and (b)That is dependent on the person’s personal exertions. (3)B is all amounts allowable as deductions to the person for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994 because of the income derived in subsection (2). The Accident Insurance (Residual Claims Levy) Regulations 2000 provides – 3Interpretation ... (2)In these regulations, activity- (a)means a business, industry, profession, trade, or undertaking of an employer ,a self-employed person, or a private domestic worker; and (b)includes ancillary or subservient functions relating to the activity, such as administration, management, marketing and distribution, technical support, maintenance, and product development; and (c)in the case of a self-employed person, refers to the nature of his or her work rather than the context of business in which he or she is working. ... 6 Classification of employees, self-employed persons, and private domestic workers engaged in 2 or more activities (1) An employee, a self-employed person, or a private domestic worker who is engaged in 2 or more activities must be classified in the classification unit for whichever of those activities attracts the highest levy rate under these regulations. (2)If a particular activity accounts for 5% or less of the person’s earnings for the year, then that activity need not be considered when determining the correct classification unit under this subclause. ... Introduction This item deals with the way in which partners in a partnership are classified for ACC purposes. It replaces the item in TIB Vol 7, No 3 (September 1995). With effect from 1 April 2001, partners are able to classify themselves for residual claims levy purposes on their share of partnership income according to the activity personally performed for the partnership. Previously, each partner was required to use the classification that reflected the business activity of the partnership regardless of the duties personally performed. Where a partner is engaged in two or more business activities the existing rule still applies. The residual claims levy is calculated on all earnings derived from personal exertion at the rate for the business activity with the highest levy rate. A business activity accounting for 5% or less of the total self-employed earnings can be ignored in determining the appropriate classification. Partners paid a regular wage or salary have earner premium deducted at source as a component part of the PAYE deductions. In terms of its employer responsibilities, the partnership is required to pay the residual claims levy on these earnings using the classification that reflects the business activity of the partnership. Background The residual claims levy is payable by: •Employers on earnings paid to their employees; and •Self-employed people on their earnings as a self-employed person. A person deriving a share of partnership profits is a self-employed person and calculates this levy in their IR 3 tax return. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 3 (March 2001) 17 Application of legislation The change in the law recognises that although the business activity is operated as a partnership, the partners are individuals and are recognised as single self-employed entities for both income tax and ACC purposes. With inter-spousal partnerships in particular, each partner often brings different skills or contributes in a different way for the collective benefit of the partnership’s business. Notwithstanding that collective contribution, it is now recognised as appropriate to classify each partner according to the nature of the work personally performed rather than according to the business activity of the partnership. This policy change first applies to the residual claims levy calculated in 2001 IR 3 tax returns. Where a partner derives a share of earnings from two or more partnerships, or personally derives other self- employed income, the residual claims levy must be calculated on all shares of partnership earnings and other self-employed income using the relevant highest rated classification. The exception is that if a particular activity accounts for 5% or less of the person’s self- employed earnings, then that activity can be ignored for the purposes of determining the appropriate classification. It should be noted that the policy change does not affect the way a partnership must classify earnings that are approved salary or wages paid to a partner. In terms of its employer responsibilities, the partnership is required to pay the residual claims levy on those earnings using the classification that reflects the business activity of the partnership. Example 1 Pierre and Susanna are partners in the Plumage TV Aerial Installation Partnership. Pierre does all the installation work and Susanna does all the bookwork and other administrative tasks. In his 2001 IR 3 tax return, Pierre must classify himself for residual claims levy purposes using the most appropriate description—Household Equipment Repair Services – Electrical and Electronic (Television antennae installing) 52610 at the rate of 38 cents. Susanna on the other hand, can classify herself in her tax return according to the work she actually performs for the partnership. The most accurate description is Business Administrative Services 78540 at the rate of 24 cents. Susanna also derives a salary from the Plumage TV Aerial Installation Partnership. As the employer entity, the Partnership must pay the residual claims levy in the 2001 IR68A return using the classification that reflects its business, that is Household Equipment Repair Services – Electrical and Electronic 52610. Example 2 Susanna also has an interest in a contract grape- growing venture Over the Hill Vineyards Partnership, in which she actively participates in all of the vineyards operations. The classification unit description is Grape Growing 01140 at a rate of 39 cents. Therefore, she must pay her residual claims levy at the higher rate of 39 cents on her shares of income from both partnerships. Example 3 If Susanna’s share of income from the vineyard is 5% or less of her total partnership earnings, then the residual claims levy is calculated using the lower 24 cents rate. Sleeping partners A sleeping partner is a partner who has capital in a partnership and shares in its profits without taking any part in its management or day to day running. A sleeping partner is not liable for the residual claims levy on their share of partnership income. The share of partnership income of a sleeping partner is excluded from the definition of “Earnings as a self- employed person” as it is not dependent on the person’s personal exertions.

The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. UNSUCCESSFUL APPEAL AGAINST COMMISSIONER’S ASSESSMENTS Case:IR and PM Hyslop v CIR Decision date:1 March 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Summary This was an appeal against the judgment of Chambers J reported as CIR v Hyslop (2000) 19 NZTC 15,560. That case in turn was a successful appeal by the CIR against the judgment of Barber DCJ reported as Case T49 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,335. Facts The issue was whether the husband and wife objectors (the husband being a pharmacist and the wife also a shareholder/director of their pharmacy company) successfully split some income among their children as a result of their attempt, in about September 1982, to gift capital to their children. That case itself was in many ways a rerun of Case M7 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,046 (Judge Bathgate) except that M7 dealt with the objector’s 1982 to 1984 financial years (inclusive), while Case T49 deals with the years 1985 to 1989 inclusive. However, the Authority in T49 found that it did not need to decide the substantive issues as it found in favour of the Objectors on the threshold submission that the Commissioner had failed to give adequate grounds for the assessments, thereby rendering those assessments invalid. The Commissioner appealed. Chambers J found that the Authority had no basis on which to entertain this issue of validity, because invalidity of the assessments was not raised as a ground of objection. Section 36 of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 (now section 18 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994) was clear—invalidity is a distinct ground of objection. While that finding was sufficient to enable the case to be decided in the Commissioner’s favour, the Authority also erred in finding that a failure by the Commissioner to give sufficient reasons for an assessment invalidates that assessment. Sections 26 and 29(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (sections 114 and 111 TAA 1994) make it clear that an assessment is quite different from the notice of assessment, and any failure or deficiency in the notice has no effect on the validity of the assessment. It is the consideration that has gone into an assessment by the Commissioner that determines validity, not the physical form (if any) upon which notice is given to the taxpayer. Finally the Authority erred in finding that the Commissioner had given insufficient information as to the grounds of assessment in this case. In the facts of this case a reasonable objective reader of Case M7 would be able to deduce some reasonably clear legal principles and the Commissioner’s application of those principles was well demonstrated in the working papers sent with the notices. The Commissioner did “nail his colours to the mast for the Hyslops to see”. The taxpayers appealed further. Decision The Court of Appeal found that the issue of whether the invalidity of the assessments was raised as a ground of objection and the consequences therefrom, was not raised in the Case Stated Appeal. Consequently Chambers J should not have considered and decided this issue. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 3 (March 2001) 19 The Court of Appeal also held that, assuming that the Commissioner had failed to give the taxpayer sufficient reasons for an assessment, that would not invalidate that assessment. The assessment remains valid despite deficient or no notice. Contrary Australian decisions were distinguished as being based on a materially different statutory scheme. However, failure to give sufficient reasons would give the taxpayers the opportunity to seek, and the Commissioner an obligation to provide, further particulars. In any event, in the circumstances of this case, the Commissioner had given sufficient information as to the grounds of the assessments to the taxpayers. Whether the assessments were in any event invalid because the Commissioner’s delegate had not adequately turned his mind to making a proper assessment was not part of the Authority’s decision, and so could not be raised by the taxpayers on appeal by way of case stated. Whether that ground can be pursued in the TRA will be a matter for the TRA. During the expansion period of the late 1980s to the mid-1990s Milburn investigated 48 different sites for aggregates, mostly in the North Island. These were generally existing quarries, mainly small. In most cases little effort was expended on investigation. Three other sites, Bombay Hills south of Auckland (“Bombay”), Alpha Creek near Westport (“Alpha Creek”), and Fraser Shingle’s expenditure on an aggregate prospect on the Ngaruroro River in Hawkes Bay were at issue in this case. It was common ground that the expenditure on all three sites was for the purpose of obtaining the necessary consents or licenses. Bombay Investigation of the site as a potential hard rock (basalt) quarry to provide roading and concrete aggregates for the Auckland market began in August 1986. Planning consent and water rights were eventually granted by consent in May 1993. Alpha Creek The site was investigated in 1989 as a replacement for Milburn’s lime quarry on Cape Foulwind. Approval to apply for a mining licence was given by Milburn’s board in November 1989. Fraser Shingle In June 1988 Fraser Shingle was advised that the gravel extraction from the Ngaruroro River, from which Fraser Shingle obtained its aggregate, may in the future be restricted. This resulted in Fraser Shingle WHETHER THE TAXPAYERS’ EXPENDITURE IN RELATION TO SPECIFIC QUARRIES WAS CAPITAL Case:Milburn New Zealand Ltd and Fraser Shingle Ltd v CIR Decision date:1 March 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Capital, Cost of minerals Summary Wild J held that the expenditure was capital in nature. Facts Milburn New Zealand Ltd (“Milburn”) is a long- established company, which makes and sells cement, concrete and lime and quarries aggregates for its concrete business. Milburn’s operations, which began in 1888, were until the late 1980s predominantly in the South Island. As demand for its products expanded in the North Island with its comparatively much larger population, Milburn expanded its business throughout the North Island. During the 1970s and early 1980s it established or expanded cement distribution facilities in most of the larger centres in the North Island. In the late 1970s Milburn set about increasing its cement sales by developing a fully (or vertically) integrated business in cement, readymixed concrete and building aggregates. Milburn’s aim was to broaden the range of its business activities to “mine, mix and sell”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 3 (March 2001) 20 investigating other sources of aggregate. Between approximately May 1989 to October 1991 investigation into an alternative site, followed by a planning application and hearing, took place. The planning application for the alternative site was unsuccessful. Decision The expenditure was clearly capital, based on: (a)The nature of the business of Milburn and Fraser Shingle. (b)The importance of Bombay and Alpha Creek to Milburn’s business and the Ngaruroro gravels to Fraser Shingle’s business. (c)The amount of the expenditure. (d)Its sustained nature, that is the length of time over which the expenditure was incurred. (e)The nature of the expenditure: all on the obtaining of consents necessary before production could begin. (f)The combination (c) to (e) when contrasted with the amount, duration and nature of the expenditure on Milburn’s 48 other prospects. These six factors in combination indicated that the taxpayers, having investigated and evaluated the three sites, had made business decisions to expend money in developing the sites for commercial production. The first step, or one of the first steps, to that end was to apply for the necessary consents. The expenditure was a necessary part of the development of the three sites into quarries for the production of aggregate (or in the case of Alpha Creek, lime) for the use in the taxpayers’ cement or concrete businesses. The categorisation of the expenditure dependent upon the outcome has been firmly rejected in New Zealand. The deductibility of the outlay cannot be made to depend upon the success or failure of what the outlay was intended to achieve. His Honour, Wild J, noted that some Canadian cases take a different approach, but L D Nathan and Waste Management make it clear that they do not represent New Zealand law binding upon him. Having found the expenditure was clearly capital it was strictly unnecessary to consider the BP tests, but his Honour did so in the event his view that the expenditure is capital is held to be wrong. The character of the advantage sought The expenditure was substantially to obtain the consents and licences necessary to develop the three sites into quarries for aggregate and lime for the taxpayers’ cement and concrete businesses. The consents and licences were preferably viewed as inseparable from the quarries to which they related but even if they were viewed separately as assets in their own right, they are enduring and not recurrent in nature. Whether the expenditure was from fixed or circulating capital This test is considered not useful and disregarded. Whether the payments were once and for all and intended to create an enduring asset Whether viewed as an integral part of the quarries to which they related (the preferred view), or as assets in their own right, the consents and licences were enduring rather than transient in nature. How should expenditure be treated on ordinary accounting principles It was accepted that this test has more relevance in England than it does in New Zealand because, irrespective of financial accounting principles, in New Zealand section 104 prescribes what deductions are permissible for taxation purposes and, notwithstanding section 104, section 106 prohibits deductions of capital expenditure. The frequent need for a reconciliation between a company’s financial accounts and its accounting for taxation purposes demonstrates that accounting principles and tax law sometimes diverge. Faced with two differing expert views his honour was not prepared to hold that either approach was wrong or the only correct one, though he did have a slight preference for the taxpayers’ view. The correct accounting treatment was not determinative of the correct treatment for tax purposes. When two almost diametrically opposed accounting treatments are legitimately available, accounting principles cease to be a useful guide to tax treatment. Whether the expenditure is directed towards the structure through which the taxpayer earns its profit or towards the day-to-day carrying on of its business Expenditure on one of the steps toward developing quarries or aggregate resources for commercial production is capital, in that it is expended on assets which will produce income within the taxpayers’ businesses. Deduction under section 74 (2)(b) The issue between the parties is whether section 74(2)(b) is to be applied to the taxpayers’ aggregate winning operations generally—allowing deduction of all costs associated with them—or only when and where costs can be matched with profits from identifiable “extractions”. The first general, or “cross-the-board”, basis was contended for by the taxpayers, the latter “site or quarry specific” approach by the Commissioner. The Commissioner’s approach was accepted. Section 74(2)(b) allows the deduction of capital costs of “land based” assets but only by way of reduction from the income earned from them. A deduction for the capital cost in relation to each quarry is allowed only in the years in which income is produced from the extraction of minerals from that quarry. The expenditure must be amortised over the life of the relevant asset. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 3 (March 2001) 21 AMENDED ASSESSMENTS ISSUED UNDER SECTION 113 TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 IN RESPECT OF 1994 INCOME YEAR INVALID As a consequence the Disputants claimed that, in issuing the amended assessments, the Commissioner purported to exercise a power contained in section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 which does not authorise him to issue assessments in respect of income years commencing prior to 1 April 1995. The Disputants claimed that the amended assessments were therefore a nullity. Decision Despite the assessing officer’s evidence that, at the time of making the assessment, she had not considered whether she was making it under section 23 of the Income Tax Act 1976 or section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Authority was satisfied that “the officer at all times intended to rely upon the 1994 Act, considered she was right to do so and remains of that view down to the present time.” The Commissioner had turned his mind to the wrong statutory provision and, therefore, not obeyed the statutory requirement for the exercise of his legal authority to make an assessment. The Authority held that the Tax Administration Act 1994 has no retrospective effect in relation to these assessments and, therefore, they were not lawful assessments and the Disputants must succeed. The Commissioner had submitted that, even if the assessments had been purportedly made under the 1994 Act: By virtue of section 114 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and section 26 of the Income Tax Act 1976, any failure to comply with any of the provisions of those Acts did not affect the validity of the assessments. The transitional provisions and savings in the Tax Administration Act 1994 operate to make the reference to the letters complained of, a reference to the 1976 Act. Section 227(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a reference in any document to a provision of that Act (here, section 113) shall be construed as including, in relation to the purposes to which the corresponding provision in the repealed enactment (section 23 of the Income Tax Act 1976) has or had effect, a reference to that corresponding provision. Case:TRA Number 010/00, 011/00 and 012/00. Decision Number 002/2001 Decision date:9 March 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords:Validity of assessment Summary The Commissioner was unsuccessful. Facts There were three Disputants in this case. Two of these, A Company Limited and B Company Limited, were loss attributing qualifying companies (“LAQCs”) and the remaining Disputant, C Company Limited, was a shareholder in B Company Limited. The LAQCs claimed losses and, as a consequence, the shareholders claimed proportions of those losses. The claimed losses were disallowed by the Commissioner under section 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976 because the claimed expenses had not been incurred. On 29 March 2000 the Commissioner issued amended assessments against A Company Limited and B Company Limited (the LAQCs), in respect of the 1994 income year, and against C Company Limited, in respect of the 1995 income year. The officer who made the assessments on the Commissioner’s behalf had the delegated authority to make assessments under the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Tax Administration Act 1994, as well as other Revenue Acts. At the time of making the amended assessments, her evidence was that she did not consider whether she was making them under section 23 of the Income Tax Act 1976 or section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which are identical provisions. The Notices of Amended Assessment were sent with covering letters. The covering letters, which were not prepared or signed by the assessing officer, stated that “it is now necessary to make an amended assessment under section 113 Tax Administration Act, 1994”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 3 (March 2001) 22 These submissions were not addressed in the decision beyond the statements that the Interpretation Act 1999 does not validate the exercise of a power contained in legislation not in force at the time of the events to which the power relates. “To the contrary” said the Authority, “section 7 provides ‘an enactment does not have retrospective effect.’ ... Nothing in sections 2, 109A or 227(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 derogates from this simple requirement.” In relation to the C Company Limited section 89C issue, the Authority accepted the Commissioner’s submission that by virtue of subsection (k) the provisions of section 89C (which requires that a NOPA be issued before an assessment) do not apply. Subsection (k) states an exception where the assessment corrects a tax position taken by the taxpayer as a consequence of an incorrect tax position taken by another taxpayer to whom a correct assessment is issued also. This conclusion did not affect the outcome of the case in relation to this Disputant. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 3 (March 2001) 23 AMOUNTS REMITTED TO BE GROSS INCOME Section CE 4(1) Income Tax Act 1994 states: (1) Subject to section EZ 9(2), where the amount of any expenditure or loss incurred by a taxpayer has been allowed as a deduction for any income year, and subsequently the liability of the taxpayer in respect of that amount is remitted or cancelled in whole or in part, the amount so remitted or cancelled shall be deemed to be gross income for that income year. The Commissioner is of the view that the words “that income year” refer to the income year in which the deduction was taken. This view is supported by section CE 4(3) which removes the time bar for amending an assessment when applying section CE 4. This corrects the item in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 9 (November 1996), which states that the amount remitted is gross income in the year in which it is remitted or cancelled.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz GST – WHEN THE SUPPLY OF LEASEHOLD LAND IS AN EXEMPT SUPPLY PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 01/01 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law This ruling applies in respect of section 14(1)(ca) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Arrangement to which this ruling applies This ruling applies to the supply of leasehold land, in exchange for rent, by a registered person. This ruling applies to what are generally referred to as ground leases, where the lease or rental payable under the terms of the lease relate solely to the use of land. The ruling does not apply to any leases of land together with improvements associated with that land. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The taxation law applies to the arrangement in the following manner. In respect of the supply of leasehold land by way of rental: •Where the leasehold land that is the subject of the supply is only used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, the supply is exempt from GST; •Where the leasehold land that is the subject of the supply is not used, to any degree, for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, the supply is not exempt from GST; •Where the leasehold land that is the subject of the supply is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land and for another use, the supply is exempt from GST to the extent that the leasehold land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, irrespective of whether the predominant use of the land is for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land; •Where the leasehold land that is the subject of the supply is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land and for another use, the apportionment of the value of the supply between the exempt and non-exempt uses must be made on the basis of allocating that proportion of the supply that is fairly attributable to the exempt supply. •Where a lease is entered into for leasehold land, and that land is to be used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, the supply of that leasehold land pursuant to the lease (or the relevant portion of the lease) is not exempt until the dwelling has been erected. The words “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” in section 14(1)(ca) refer to any payment made for: •The creation of a leasehold interest in that land, other than a payment of rent; or •The sale of the leasehold interest in the land. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 5 The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to a supply of leasehold land by way of rental when the time of supply occurs between 1 July 1999 and 31 January 2006. This ruling is signed by me on the 30 th day of March 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) In the Commissioner’s view, section 14(1)(ca) applies to the supply of leasehold land by way of rental when it is supplied separately from any buildings or other improvements to that land. This form of lease is commonly known as a “ground lease”. Under a ground lease the rental is generally based on the unimproved value of the land. In such cases the head lessor owns the land, and the head lessee usually owns the buildings and any other improvements to the land. Section 14(1)(ca) was inserted into the Act \[originally as section 14(ca)\] by section 12(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1986. That amendment was effective from 3 December 1985, being the date of enactment of the principal Act and prior to the commencement of GST. The amendment was enacted to correct a deficiency in the principal Act. In the absence of the amendment, residential lessees of leasehold land would have had to pay GST on their ground lease rental payments. This was seen as inequitable when compared with the position of residential owners of freehold properties, who generally do not pay GST on the acquisition of a private home, and lessees of residential accommodation. The supply of residential rental accommodation is GST exempt under section 14(1)(c). Section 14(1)(ca) was therefore intended to provide an extension to the section 14(1)(c) exemption. There has been some uncertainty regarding the scope and effect of the section 14(1)(ca) exemption. In particular, uncertainty may arise when there is a supply of leasehold land used for both commercial and residential purposes. Doubt has also arisen regarding the meaning of the words “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” in section 14(1)(ca). Hence, public binding ruling 96/7 was issued by the Commissioner to clarify the position. This public binding ruling is not intended to change the Commissioner’s view of section 14(1)(ca) as expressed in that ruling. Rather, any changes are intended to clarify the Commissioner’s view. COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 01/01 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/01 (“the ruling”). The ruling is a reissue of public binding ruling BR Pub 96/7, issued on 25 March 1996. The Commissioner’s view, as expressed in this ruling, is not intended to differ from BR Pub 96/7. Any changes between this ruling and the previous ruling are only intended to assist the reader’s understanding. A note as to legislative history This ruling and commentary refers to section 14(1)(ca) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. That section was originally enacted (pursuant to section 12(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1986 and with effect from 3 December 1985, the date of enactment of the principal Act) as section 14(ca). The Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 amended section 14 and made it section 14(1) (with the subsidiary changes that section 14(ca) became section 14(1)(ca), section 14(c) became section 14(1)(c), etc). This was necessary due to the enactment of the new sections 14(2) and 14(3). In this commentary, sections 14(ca) and sections 14(1)(ca) will consistently be referred to as section 14(1)(ca). Therefore, where necessary references to section 14(1)(ca) should be read as a reference to section 14(ca). Similarly, section 14(1)(c) of the Act should be read as, where appropriate, section 14(c). Background Section 14(1)(ca) exempts from GST the supply of leasehold land by way of rental, to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land. The section expressly excludes from the exemption any grant or sale of the lease of the land. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 6 Legislation Section 14(1) exempts certain supplies from GST. Section 14(1)(ca) exempts: The supply of leasehold land by way of rental (not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land) to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land: Section 14(1)(c) also exempts: The supply of accommodation in any dwelling by way of - (i)Hire; or (ii) A service occupancy agreement; or (iii)A licence to occupy: Section 2 defines “dwelling” as meaning: ... any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof, used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual, together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it; but does not include a commercial dwelling: Section 10(18) states: Where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. Application of the legislation Section 14(1)(ca) exempts “the supply of leasehold land by way of rental ... to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land”. The Commissioner’s view is that this means that to the extent that leasehold land is used, by the lessee, “for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land” the supply of that land is exempt. The term “principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling” refers to the use to which the dwelling, erected on the leasehold land, or a portion of the leasehold land, is being put. It does not refer to the use to which the leasehold land is being put as a whole. Therefore, it is not necessary for the principal purpose to which the leasehold land is being put to be accommodation in a dwelling. It is sufficient if part of the leasehold land is being used for “the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land”. Therefore, in applying section 14(1)(ca) to any ground lease, the use or uses to which the leasehold land is being put must be considered. Such consideration will allow the extent to which the supply of the leasehold land is exempt to be determined. When all the land and any buildings erected on that land are used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling, the full rental in respect of the ground lease is exempt from GST. When all the land and any buildings erected on that land are used for commercial or other non- dwelling purposes, the ground lease is subject to GST. When leasehold land and any building erected on that land are used in part for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling and in part for commercial or other non-exempt purposes, the ground lease is only exempt to the extent that the use to which the leasehold land is being put relates to the provision of accommodation in a dwelling. This requires apportioning the ground lease rental and imposing GST only on that part of the rental that relates to the non-exempt purpose(s). Alternative interpretation It is also arguable that section 14(1)(ca) only exempts the supply of leasehold land when all the land is used for the principal purpose, i.e., more than 50%, of accommodation in a dwelling. The exemption then only applies to the extent that the land is so used. For example, the ground lease rental of land on which a building is situated that is used as to 75% for accommodation and 25% for offices, is exempt from GST as to 75%. However, the ground lease rental of land on which a building is situated that is used as to 25% for accommodation and 75% for offices, is not exempt from GST. While this is an arguable interpretation, the Commissioner considers that it is unduly narrow and restrictive, and that the interpretation that has been adopted (and expressed in the Ruling) better effects the purpose of the section. The Commissioner’s view is that the primary focus of the provision is on that portion of the land that is used for accommodation purposes, rather than, as the alternative interpretation proposes, the predominant use of the land as a whole. To limit the exemption to only those instances where accommodation in a dwelling is the primary, or predominant, use to which the land being put would be to effectively ignore the apportionment requirement. It is considered that the better view is that the purpose of the section is to exempt from GST that element of total use that relates to the principal purpose of accommodation and that this purpose is best effected by a broad interpretation. Apportionment Section 14(1)(ca) is silent as to the correct way to apportion the lease payments in respect of the supply of the leasehold land between the exempt and non-exempt uses. The section only states that the supply is exempt “to the extent” that the use to which the land is being put is the exempt use. Section 10(18) of the Act also deals with the apportionment of consideration between exempt and taxable supplies. However, that section similarly does not specify the basis for determining the apportionment—rather it simply deems the taxable supply to be for that part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 7 It is the Commissioner’s view that it is not possible to specify a method of apportionment that must be applied in all instances. The appropriate method must be determined on a case by case basis, taking into account the provisions of the lease and bearing in mind that section 14(1)(ca) requires the apportionment to be undertaken taking into account the uses to which the land is being put. The following examples are intended to be indicative only of the approach that may be taken to apportionment: •a six-storey building is erected on leasehold land. Calculated on the basis of the floor area used, 60% was used for offices, 20% for a restaurant and the remaining 20% for residential apartments. The residential apartments are used for the principal purpose of private accommodation in a dwelling. Pursuant to section 14(1)(ca), 20% of the ground lease rental is exempt from GST. •an area of rural leasehold land is used, on an area basis, as to 90% for grazing and 10% for a house and its curtilage. That house is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling. Pursuant to section 14(1)(ca), 10% of the ground lease rental is exempt from GST. In some cases, the ground lease rental may be expressly calculated with reference to the different uses to which the land is to be put. For example: •a person leases ten hectares of rural land. A term of the lease is that one hectare can be used to erect a dwelling, but the remaining nine hectares must be left as pasture. The lease further provides that the pasture is to be leased at the rate of $10 per hectare per week, while the remaining land is leased at $50 per week. While the total rent payable under the lease is $140 per week, $50 will be GST exempt. A grant or sale of the lease of that land The words “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” create an exception to the exemption under the main body of section 14(1)(ca). The words in section 14(1)(ca) “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” refer to any payment made for: •The creation of a leasehold interest in that land, other than a payment of rent; or •The sale of the leasehold interest in the land. Any grant or sale by the head lessor (owner of the land) of a ground lease of that land, where the ground lease is exempt from GST to the extent that it is used for the principal purpose of supplying accommodation in a dwelling, is not exempt from GST. Whether GST is payable on the sale or grant depends on whether the sale or grant is made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the head lessor. Examples The following examples do not form part of the ruling. Example 1 A, a GST registered person, owns a vacant piece of land. She leases that land to S who constructs a building that is used to carry on her business as a drycleaner. The building occupies the entire piece of land, leaving only a narrow alley providing access to the rear entrance. No part of the land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling and therefore no part of the supply from A to S is exempt. Example 2 S constructs an apartment above her drycleaning business and rents it to E. The floor area of the apartment is exactly the same as that of the drycleaners, so 50% of the ground rent charged by A to S is GST exempt. Example 3 S sold her drycleaning business and the building, including the apartment, to E. E negotiated a new ground lease with A. 50% of the ground rent was exempt as it related to the apartment. In addition to the ground lease rental payments, in order to facilitate the negotiation of the new lease E agreed to make a one off payment to A of $5,000. None of that payment is exempt from GST as it relates to the grant of the lease and is excluded from the exemption. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 8 “TRANSITIONAL CAPITAL AMOUNT” – DEFINITION Public Ruling – BR Pub 01/02 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 01/02 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/02 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR 98/1 (TIB Vol 10, No 2 (February 1998) at page 4 under the heading “Definition of “transitional capital amount”). This Ruling covers the period from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2006. Background The Companies Act 1993 enacted major reforms in the company law area. One of the most significant was the removal of the concept of “paid-up capital”. Consequently the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 was enacted to accommodate the changes to company law. In particular, the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 introduced, with application from 1 July 1994, a definition of “available subscribed capital” for tax purposes. The Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 also repealed section 4A(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 4A(1)(h) allowed the Commissioner to exclude from dividends such amount distributed to a shareholder of the company, as the Commissioner considered just and reasonable where: •The company had reduced the amount of the paid-up capital of the shareholder by writing off with High Court approval, losses incurred by the company; and •The company was subsequently wound up; and •Upon the winding up of the company, an amount (whether in money or money’s worth) was distributed to the shareholder in excess of the amount paid up on the shares of the shareholder. The effect of the repeal of section 4A(1)(h), is that there is no reduction of the “available subscribed capital” of a company when the company has, prior to 1 July 1994, written off losses against paid-up capital. Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public rulings BR Pub 96/6 which was published in TIB Vol 7, No 12 (April 1996) and BR 98/1 published in TIB Vol 10, No 2 (February 1998). BR Pub 98/1 applies up until 31 March 2001. This new ruling takes into account minor wording changes made to the legislation since BR Pub 98/1 was issued and its period of application is from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2006. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies to the definition of factor “j” in the formula within the definition of “transitional capital amount” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to companies that liquidate on or after 1 July 1994 and distribute to shareholders the same class of capital that the company has, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against its losses. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The “total amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in factor “j” of the formula within the definition of “transitional capital amount” includes all paid-up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to liquidations (as defined in section OB 1), and to distributions from such liquidations, during the period 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 14th day of March 2001. Martin Smith General Manager, Adjudication & Rulings Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 9 To calculate the available subscribed capital for companies existing prior to 1 July 1994, the “transitional capital amount” must be determined. The terms “available subscribed capital” and “transitional capital amount” are discussed in more detail in TIB Vol 6, No 6 (December 1994) – Company Law Reform. The definition of “transitional capital amount” was amended in 1998 by adding a new paragraph (b)— which does not affect this ruling—and, at the same time, the wording was changed to bring it into line with the current legislative style. In particular the former wording of “aggregate amount of capital” was changed to read “total amount of capital”. The Commissioner considers that this wording change does not affect the interpretation of the definition or the calculation of item “j”. Legislation Section OB 1 states: “ Transitional capital amount”, of a share in a company means - (a)Unless paragraph (b) applies, the amount calculated using the formula: j + k x m l where jis the total amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 for shares of the same class as the share (whenever issued and including the share), not being \[Emphasis added\] - (i)An amount paid up by a bonus issue made after 31 March 1982 and before 1 October 1988, except if - (A) The date of the acquisition, redemption, other cancellation, or liquidation falls more than 10 years after the date of the bonus issue; or (B) The amount was paid up by way of applica- tion of an amount of qualifying share premium; or (C) The relevant time is the time of liquidation of the company; or (ii)An amount paid up by a bonus issue (other than a taxable bonus issue) made on or after 1 October 1988, except if the amount was paid up by way of application of an amount of qualifying share premium; and kis the total of qualifying share premium paid to the company before 1 July 1994 for shares of that class (whenever issued and including the share), not being an amount that is later (but before 1 July 1994) applied to pay up capital on shares in the company; and lis the number of shares of that class (including the share) ever issued before the close of 30 June 1994; and mis the number of shares of that class (including the share) on issue at the close of 30 June 1994: (b)In the case of a company that is a group investment fund to which either section CZ 4A or CZ 4B applies, the value of the superannuation fund interest at the close of business on 31 March 1999. (Emphasis added). Application of legislation The “total amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in factor “j” of the definition of “transitional capital amount” includes all paid-up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company. This allows a company to restore the written-off capital upon liquidation, without the distribution being treated as a dividend to the shareholders. Example 1990M Ltd issues 1,000 fully paid-up shares at $1 each. 1992Pursuant to High Court approval, M Ltd writes off $500 (50 cents per share) of paid-up capital from its accumulated losses. 1994Paid-up capital at 30 June 1994 is $500. 1995Shareholders decide to liquidate M Ltd. There have been no movements in the capital of M Ltd since the capital reduction in 1992. After the sale of assets the distribution per share will be 75c. Because M Ltd existed before 1 July 1994, its “available subscribed capital” is determined by calculating its “transitional capital amount”. To calculate M’s transitional capital amount, the following formula is used: j + k x m l where- jis paid-up capital at the close of 30 June 1994$500 add back capital reduction $ 500 total capital paid up before 1 July 1994$1,000 as defined in the Ruling k qualifying share premium assume is 0 lnumber of shares ever issued before 1 July 1994 1,000 m shares on issue at 1 July 1994 1,000 $1,000 + 0 x 1,000 = $1,000 transitional capital amount 1,000 The available subscribed capital per share cancelled equals $1,000/1,000 = $1 per share. The $0.75 per share distributed is not treated as a dividend as it does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share.

Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company, or an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF), at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). Under section 61(2), the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption which applies for the income year ended 31 March 2001. This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR12”, and the full text appears at the end of this item. Scope of exemption The scope of the 2001 disclosure exemption is the same as the 2000 exemption. Interests held by residents Disclosure is required by residents for these interests: •an interest held in a FIF •an “income interest of 10% or greater” held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies in respect of all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. An “income interest of 10% or greater” is defined in section OB 1 of the ITA. For the purposes of determining exemption from disclosure it includes these interests: 1.an income interest held directly in a foreign company 2.an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company 3.an income interest held by an associated person (which is not a controlled foreign company) as defined by section OD 8 (3) of the ITA. Example If a husband and wife each hold an income interest of 5% in a Cayman Islands company, the interests would not be exempt from disclosure because the husband and wife are associated persons under section OD 8(3)(d). Under the associated persons test they are each deemed to hold the other’s interests, so they each hold an “income interest of 10% or greater” which must be disclosed. They are not required to account for attributed foreign income or loss under the controlled foreign company rules. However, they would have to account for FIF income or loss under the FIF rules. In this example the husband and wife must disclose their interests as interests in a foreign company and as interests in a FIF. However, only the FIF interests should be disclosed on an IR 4H series form (see “Overlap of interests” on page 12). Foreign company interests A resident who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the company’s country of residence. The 2001 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence, and any interest in a foreign company that is an “income interest of 10% or greater” must be disclosed. Disclosure is to be made on an “Interest in a foreign company disclosure schedule” (IR 4G) form. The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company for these reasons: •Attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFC’s country of residence. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 12 •To identify tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign company that is resident in a Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction (Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States of America). •The requirement for a CFC that is resident in a country not listed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1993. Foreign investment fund interests An interest in a foreign entity must be disclosed if it constitutes an “interest in a foreign investment fund” specified within section CG 15(1) of the ITA. These types of interest must be disclosed: •rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (for example, a unit trust) •an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme •an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy •an interest in an entity specified in Schedule 4, Part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press). However, any interest that does not fall within the above types, or that is specifically excluded as an interest in a FIF under section CG 15(2), does not have to be disclosed. The following are listed in section CG 15(2) as exclusions from what constitutes an interest in a FIF: •an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a CFC (separate disclosure is required of this as an interest in a foreign company) •an interest in a foreign company that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specified in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA (Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United Kingdom and the United States of America) •an interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme •a qualifying foreign private annuity, unless an election has been made to remain within the FIF regime, by the due date for filing the person’s 2001 tax return (See Inland Revenue’s booklet Overseas Private Pensions (IR 257) for more information.) •interests in foreign entities held by a natural person other than in that person’s capacity as a trustee, if the aggregate cost or expenditure incurred in acquiring the interests remains under $50,000 at all times during the income year •an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain, or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme acquired by a natural person before he or she became a New Zealand resident for the first time, for a period of up to four years. A resident who holds an interest in a FIF at any time during the 2001 income year must disclose the interest and calculate FIF income or loss on the form “Interest in foreign investment fund disclosure schedule” (IR 4H series). The FIF rules allow a person four options to calculate FIF income or loss (accounting profits method, branch equivalent method, comparative value method and deemed rate of return method), so the Commissioner has prescribed four forms under the IR 4H series to disclose and calculate FIF income or loss from an interest in a FIF using one of the methods. The respective IR 4H series form to use, for whichever FIF income calculation method you choose to apply, is as follows: •IR 4H-AP for the accounting profits method •IR 4H-BE for the branch equivalent method •IR 4H-CV for the comparative value method •IR 4H-DR for the deemed rate of return method. Overlap of interests A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company that is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an interest held in a FIF. However, to meet the disclosure obligations only one disclosure return (either the IR 4G form or the appropriate IR 4H series form) is required for each interest a person holds in a foreign entity. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 13 Here are the general rules for determining which disclosure return to file: 1.Use the appropriate IR 4H series form to disclose all FIF interests, and in particular: •an interest in a foreign company that is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country and is not a CFC (regardless of the level of interest held) •an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC that is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme, regardless of the country or territory in which the entity was resident. 2.Use the IR 4G or IR 4GS form to disclose an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on the appropriate IR 4H series form. Disclosure is not required on either the IR 4G or IR 4H forms for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) that is also not a FIF interest. An example is an interest that is covered by the Schedule 3, Part A exclusion from the FIF rules. Interests held by non-residents The 2001 disclosure exemption removes the need for interests held by non-residents in foreign companies and FIFs to be disclosed. This would apply, for example, to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs. The purpose of the international tax rules is to make sure that New Zealand residents are taxed on their share of the income of any overseas interests they hold. However, under the international tax rules non-residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under the CFC regime (section CG 6(1) of the ITA 1994). In addition, under section CG 16(4) of the ITA 1994 a non-resident is not to be treated as deriving or incurring any FIF income or loss. The disclosure of non-residents holdings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules. Summary The 2001 international tax disclosure exemption removes the requirement of a resident to disclose an interest held in a foreign company (if the interest is not also an interest in a FIF) that does not constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater” (that is, it is less than 10%). The disclosure exemption is not affected by the foreign company’s country of residence. Further, an interest in a FIF must be disclosed. The 2001 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs. Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR12”. 1. Reference This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 2001. This exemption does not apply to interests in foreign companies which are interests in foreign investment funds, unless that interest is held by a non-resident of New Zealand. 2. Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 3. Exemption (i) Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company (not being an interest in a foreign investment fund), in the income year ending 31 March 2001, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, unless the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater”, as defined by section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 14 (ii)Any non-resident person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund in the income year ending 31 March 2001, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply: •No attributed foreign income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company by virtue of section CG 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and/or •No foreign investment fund income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign investment fund by virtue of section CG 16(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994. This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This exemption is signed on the 6th day of April 2001. Patrick Goggin Acting National Manager, Corporates Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 15 FOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNTS – CONVERSION TO NZ CURRENCY Example 1 A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 30 September 2000. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 October 1999 to 30 September 2000 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD). HKD 200,000 ÷ 3.6918 = NZ$54,174.12 A similar calculation would be needed for a FIF using the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods. Example 2 A taxpayer with a 31 March balance date purchases shares in a Philippines company (which is a FIF) for 350,000 pesos on 7 September 2000. Using the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods, the cost is converted as follows: PHP 350,000 ÷ 20.0595 = NZ$17,448.09 Alternatively, the exchange rate can be calculated by averaging the exchange rates “x” which apply to each complete month in the foreign company’s accounting period. Example 3 A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 2000 and has a balance date of 30 September 2000. During this period, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singapore dollars was derived. (i) Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May–September 1999: (0.8292 + 0.8154 + 0.7997 + 0.7729 + 0.7282) ÷ 5 = 0.7891 (ii) Conversion to New Zealand currency: SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.7891 = NZ$633,633.25 The tables in this item list exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 2001. The conversion rates for the first six months of each income year are published in the TIB following the end of the September quarter, and the rates for the full 12 months rates at the end of each income year. To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign currency amount by the exchange rate shown. Table A Use this table to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •branch equivalent income or loss under the CFC or FIF rules under section CG 11(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits, comparative value (except if Table B applies) or deemed rate of return methods under section CG 16(11) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Key X Y X is the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the next day on which they were quoted. Y is the average of the mid-month exchange rates for that month and the previous 11 months. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 16 Table B Table B lists the end of month exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for the 12 month period ending 31 March 2001. Use this table for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •items “a” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the income year) and “c” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the previous income year) of the comparative value formula •foreign tax credits paid on the last day of any month calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Example 4 A New Zealand resident with a balance date of 30 September 2000 held an interest in an FIF resident in Thailand. The market value of the FIF interest at 30 September 2000 (item “a” of the comparative value formula) was 500,000 Thailand baht (THB). THB 500,000 ÷ 17.4087 = NZ$28,721.27 Note: If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in these tables, contact one of New Zealand’s major trading banks. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

(April 2001) 20 STANDARD PRACTICE STATEMENTS These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. NON-STANDARD BALANCE DATES FOR MANAGED FUNDS AND “AS AGENT” RETURNS Standard Practice Statement IR-SPS GNL-120 Introduction This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) extends operational practice relating to consent for the use of non-standard balance dates to recognise special taxpayer/administrator situations. The SPS provides indicative examples of situations where Inland Revenue may consent to applications by taxpayers to adopt non-standard balance dates for managed funds (unit trusts, group investment funds and superannuation funds) and agents for non- resident insurers (in respect of “as agent” returns). Application This SPS applies from 1 May 2001. This SPS applies only to applications by: •managed funds to adopt a non-standard balance date in common with the manager or trustee if Inland Revenue recognises a parent–subsidiary like relationship between parties, and •entities deemed to be agents of non-resident insurers to file “as agent” returns in terms of section CN 4(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Summary Inland Revenue’s current practice in relation to providing consent for the use of non-standard balance dates is set out in Tax Information Bulletins Vol 3, No 9 and Vol 5, No 11. This SPS extends the existing parent–subsidiary criteria to include analogous situations that exist between managed funds and the entities that are responsible for their administration. Consent may be given for managed funds and agents for non-resident insurers to adopt a balance date other than 31 March if: •Inland Revenue recognises that a parent–subsidiary like relationship exists between the parties, eg the relationship between the managed fund and its trustee or manager. This is demonstrated by the manager/ trustee preparing accounts, promoting the entity, making strategic investment decisions and providing other administration services to the trust. •An employer superannuation fund is established for the benefit of the employees and there is a close relationship between the employer and the superannuation fund. •The agent of a non-resident insurer is required to file “as agent” returns on behalf of the non-resident. The purpose of the SPS is to reduce compliance costs of taxpayers. Background Under current practice taxpayers may adopt a balance date other than 31 March (a “non-standard balance date”) only if: •the nature of their business makes a 31 March balance date inappropriate, or •a subsidiary wishes to align its balance date with its parent company, or •an estate wishes to adopt the deceased’s date of death, or •a shareholder–employee wants the same balance date as the company. Managed funds and agents for non-resident insurers do not qualify for a non-standard balance date under the existing practice statement. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 21 Legislation Section 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 reads: 38. RETURNS TO ANNUAL BALANCE DATE— (1) Instead of furnishing a return in accordance with section 33 for any year ending with 31 March, a taxpayer (other than a taxpayer to whom \[section 33A (1) or (5)\] applies) may, with the consent of the Commissioner, elect to furnish a return for the year ending with the date of the annual balance of the person’s accounts, and in any such case the taxable income for that year shall for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994 be deemed to be the taxable income for the year ending with the 31 March nearest to that date. (2) For the purposes of this section and section 39, 30 September in any year shall be deemed to be nearer to the last preceding 31 March than to the next succeeding 31 March. (3) Any election made by a taxpayer for the purposes of this section shall continue in force unless and until it is altered by the taxpayer with the prior approval in writing of the Commissioner. Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 defines group investment fund, superannuation fund, superannuation scheme and unit trust as follows: “Group investment fund” means a Group Investment Fund established under the Trustee Companies Act 1967 or the Public Trust Office Act 1957: “Superannuation fund” means any superannuation scheme, which is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989: “Superannuation scheme” means – (a)Any trust or unit trust established by its trust deed principally for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to beneficiaries who are natural persons; or (b)Any company (not being a unit trust) that - (i)Is not resident in New Zealand; and (ii)Has been established principally for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to members or relatives of members who are natural persons; or (c)Any arrangement constituted under an Act of Parliament of New Zealand, other than the Social Security Act 1964, principally for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons; or any similar arrangement constituted under the legislation of any country, territory, state, or local authority outside New Zealand;- and where the superannuation scheme is a trust, any reference in this Act to a superannuation scheme includes a reference to the trustees of that scheme: “Unit trust” means any scheme or arrangement, whether made before or after the commencement of this Act, that is made for the purpose or has the effect of providing facilities for the participation, as beneficiaries under a trust, by subscribers, purchasers, or contributors, in income and gains (whether in the nature of capital or income) arising from the money, investments, and other property that are for the time being subject to the trust; but does not include–– (a)a trust for the benefit of debenture holders; or (b)The Common Fund of the Public Trustee or any Group Investment Fund established by the Public Trustee; or (c)The Common Fund of the Maori Trustee; or (d)Any Group Investment Fund established under the Trustees Companies Act 1967; or (e)Any friendly society registered under the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982; or (f)Any superannuation fund; or (g)Any employee share purchase scheme; or (h)Any other trust of any specified kind that is declared by the Governor-General, by Order in Council, not to be a unit trust for the purposes of HE 1: \[the definition of trust\]. Definition of terms “As agent” is a person deemed to be an agent of a non-resident insurer in accordance with section CN 4(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994. “Non-standard balance date” means a balance date other than 31 March. Standard Practice Inland Revenue will consider consent to applications for non-standard balance dates from the following entities: •The trustee of a unit trust that wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager. •The trustee of a group investment fund that wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager. •The trustee of a superannuation fund that wishes to align its balance date with that of its trustee or, where the fund is administered by an employer for the benefit of its employees, the balance date of the employer. •A resident required to file an “as agent” return that wishes to align the balance date of that return with the taxpayer’s own non-standard balance date. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 22 Indicative examples of Recognised Relationships 1.A unit trust wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager A unit trust may align its balance date to that of its manager. The manager is the entity with responsibility for the management of the unit trust and is appointed in the trust deed. 2. A group investment fund wishes to align its balance date with that of its manager A group investment fund is administered and overseen by a manager. The fund may have a separate trustee, although there is no requirement that the trustee and manager be separate entities. Consent will only be granted to align the fund’s balance date with that of the manager. As with unit trusts, the concession applies when the manager has retained the responsibility for day to day administration of the trust and for preparing the trust’s accounts. When these functions have been contracted out to a third party, it is not appropriate to adopt the manager’s balance date. 3. Superannuation funds •An employer superannuation fund wishes to align its balance date with that of the employer A scheme established for the benefit of employees of an employer may apply to adopt the balance date of that employer. •Any other superannuation fund (eg a wholesale or retail fund) wishes to align its balance date with that of its trustee The trust deed under which a superannuation fund is established will appoint a trustee to supervise the fund. Consent will be given for a fund to align its balance date with that of the trustee. 4. A taxpayer who is agent of a non-resident insurer wishes to align the balance date of its “as agent” return to its own non-standard balance date A taxpayer who insures with a non-resident insurer is required to return part of the premiums paid as income in a return known as an “as agent” return (section CN 4(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994). This income is returned by the taxpayer “as agent” for the non- resident insurer. Taxpayers with an approved non-standard balance date for their own returns will be granted consent to align the balance dates of their “as agent” returns to this date. Summary In recognition of the equivalent of a parent–subsidiary relationship, Inland Revenue will consent to applications to adopt the following non-standard balance dates – EntityApproved non-standard balance date Unit trustBalance date of unit trust manager Group Investment FundBalance date of group investment fund manager Employer SuperannuationBalance date of employer Fund Other Superannuation Fund Balance date of trustee “As agent” returnBalance date of entity preparing “as agent” return Applications Applications for consent to non-standard balance dates are to be in writing and should provide the following information: •Full name of the entity seeking the non- standard balance date. •Name of tax agent. •Full details of the reason why consent should be given to the use of a non-standard balance date. •Details of the nature of the relationship between the entity applying for a change in balance date and the entity to which the balance date is being aligned. •Any other reasons to demonstrate why a proposed non-standard balance date is considered appropriate. Indicative examples where consent will not be given for a non-standard balance date The anniversary date of the commencement of the business is not a valid reason for a non-standard balance date. Inland Revenue will not consent to the use of a non-standard balance date if it is for the reasons of tax deferral or tax avoidance, or to take undue advantage of a tax incentive or concession. Consent will not be given where the election is made to spread the balance dates of a number of funds in order to smooth the workflow of the manager or the trustee of those funds. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 23 In cases where administrative functions have been contracted out to a third party (for example, a specialist administration manager) Inland Revenue will not provide consent to adopt the manager’s balance date. All requests for consent to non-standard balance date elections for unit trusts, group investment funds, superannuation funds and taxpayers required to file “as agent” returns should be sent to: Managed Funds Industry Desk Insurance Sector Corporates Segment, Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON The adoption of a non-standard balance date will continue until the date is changed by a further election. The process for change of non-standard balance dates is the same as above. This Standard Practice Statement was signed by me on April 2001. Margaret Cotton National Manager Technical Standards Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 24 ARRANGEMENTS FOR PAYMENT OF TAX DEBT Standard Practice Statement RDC 6.1 When considering an application, section 177 requires Inland Revenue to ensure that the relief granted will maximise net present value for tax debts, or will lead to the collection of highest net revenue over time for student loan repayment obligation debts. There is no legislative time limit for an arrangement. However, arrangements will generally be over the shortest period of time in order to maximise the net present value of any recovery. Penalties and interest will continue to accrue during the term of an arrangement. However, if a taxpayer adheres to the conditions of an arrangement, the penalties will be cancelled from the date the arrangement was entered into. Interest cannot be cancelled and will remain payable. When Inland Revenue accepts an arrangement, Inland Revenue will issue written confirmation of the arrangement that will set out the taxpayer’s obligations and Inland Revenue’s obligations. Legislation All legislative references are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) unless otherwise stated. Section 177 provides: 1 7 7Discretion to grant relief in cases of financial hardship (1)A taxpayer, or a person on a taxpayer’s behalf, may apply for relief if the taxpayer— (a) Is, or is likely to become, liable for payment of tax; and (b) Is at the time of applying, in financial difficulties. (2)An application for relief by way of remission must be in writing. (3)If subsection (1) applies, the Commissioner may, if the Commissioner considers it necessary or desirable to do so to maximise the net present value, calculated on the date of the application, of recovery or likely recovery from the taxpayer of the tax, or part of the tax, grant relief to the taxpayer by— (a) Remitting all or part of the tax; or (b) Entering into an arrangement with the taxpayer for the payment of all or part of the tax in one or more payments; or (c) Applying both paragraphs (a) and (b). (4)The Commissioner may, if the Commissioner thinks fit, issue an amended assessment to give effect to any action taken under subsection (3). Introduction This Standard Practice Statement states the Commissioner’s practice on providing relief by way of an arrangement when taxpayers are in debt with Inland Revenue. It does not relate to arrangements for payment of child support arrears. The legislation that allows the Commissioner to enter into arrangements for payment of tax debt was amended on 10 October 2000 to: •dispense with the requirement that applications for arrangements be made in writing •extend the relief provisions to include all taxes and duties (limited exceptions apply) •remove the requirement to obtain approval from the Minister of Finance where the amount of relief sought exceeds $50,000. This Standard Practice Statement refers in part to Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 14 (June 1995), taxpayers in financial difficulties. The TIB should be read as if updated for the legislation changes described above. Application This Standard Practice Statement replaces Standard Practice Statement RDC 6 originally published in Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 3 (March 2000). This amended Standard Practice Statement applies to applications for relief by way of arrangement made on or after 1 April 2001. Summary Section 177 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 specifically allows for relief by way of arrangement for taxpayers who are, or are likely to become liable for payment of tax. An arrangement can be for one lump sum payment or 2 or more payments (instalment arrangement). Applications for relief by way of arrangement may be made orally or in writing. The taxpayer must be in financial difficulties at the time of application. The Commissioner will require relevant financial information to be provided in support of the application. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 25 (5)The Commissioner may cancel all or part of the relief granted under this section if— (a) The Commissioner has reason to believe that the information provided by the taxpayer to enable the Commissioner to apply this section is misleading in any respect such that the Commis- sioner considers that it was inappropriate for all or part of the relief to have been granted; or (b) The Commissioner receives further information relating to the taxpayer’s affairs, as they were on the date on which relief was granted, such that the Commissioner considers that it was inappropriate for all or part of the relief to have been granted. (6)If subsection (5) applies, the taxpayer is liable for the payment of the tax as if relief had never been granted. (7)A Commissioner’s decision to grant or cancel relief may not be objected to or challenged Other relevant legislation is contained in: •section 3 TAA—definition of “tax” •section 6A TAA—the care and management of taxes •section 156 TAA—the mode of recovery of unpaid tax •section 183B TAA—cancellation of late payment penalties under instalment arrangement. Standard Practice Application for relief by way of arrangement need not be in writing Inland Revenue is able to enter into arrangements for payment of tax debt over the telephone or following written application. In doing so, it must be established that the taxpayer is in financial difficulties and that the proposed arrangement maximises net present value. In all cases it will be necessary to obtain financial information, either over the telephone or in writing, to enable these decisions to be made. In some cases, it will be necessary for Inland Revenue to obtain written financial information to verify or further support the information already supplied by the taxpayer. A taxpayer may start making voluntary payments immediately, before an arrangement has been agreed to (refer to IR 262 Let us help you pay your bill ...). However, any cancellation of penalties only applies from the date the arrangement is agreed to (refer to “Entering into an arrangement” on page 26). Amount that is, or is likely to become, liable for payment A taxpayer may make application for an arrangement for any amount that is in arrears, or any amount that will become due for payment. In practical terms, a taxpayer making payments towards a tax debt before that amount is due, does not need to enter into an arrangement unless the amount owing will not be paid prior to the due date (refer to IR 262 Let us help you pay your bill ...). If a taxpayer determines that an amount will be outstanding after the due date, then that taxpayer should apply to Inland Revenue prior to the due date for a pre-emptive arrangement to receive the full benefits of the cancellation provisions (refer to “Cancellation of penalties” on page 27 for more information). Definition of “tax” Section 177 of the Tax Administration Act allows for relief in cases of financial hardship if the taxpayer is, or is likely to become liable for payment of tax. Tax is defined in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act but does not include: •financial support as defined in the Child Support Act 1991 •a student loan repayment obligation. “Tax” also includes use-of-money interest and civil penalties (late payment, late filing, shortfall and non- electronic filing penalties). Financial difficulties at the time of application Section 177 provides for relief for taxpayers who are in financial difficulties at the time of application. Inland Revenue considers “financial difficulties” arise when a taxpayer’s financial position is such that debts cannot be paid on time, and either: •there is a real prospect that creditors will be able to have the taxpayer put into liquidation, or adjudicated bankrupt, or •the taxpayer’s debts are a substantial limitation in carrying out normal income producing activities. For further discussion on “financial difficulties” refer to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 14 (June 1995). In order for Inland Revenue to determine if a taxpayer is in financial difficulty, Inland Revenue will request details of the taxpayer’s financial position, which would normally include details of income and expenditure, assets and liabilities. It may be necessary for Inland Revenue to obtain this information in writing. On reviewing the information provided, and depending on the amount of debt and/or the length of time of the proposed arrangement, Inland Revenue may request a more detailed breakdown or further information. For example, asset valuations, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, lists of debtors and creditors. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 26 If a taxpayer has the ability to realise assets (eg the ability to refinance, sell property, or surrender insurance policies) to pay the debt, then an arrangement may not be appropriate. However, the size of the debt and the length of time of the proposed arrangement will be taken into account by Inland Revenue when considering an application for an arrangement. In addition, Inland Revenue will recognise a spouse’s “protected interest” in a matrimonial home or any rights protected by the Joint Family Homes Act 1964. Where the debt is only a few hundred dollars and will be paid within a short period of time, Inland Revenue would not expect property, such as a house to be sold before accepting an instalment arrangement. Net present value When considering an application for an arrangement Inland Revenue will consider the net present value of the proposed payments. The net present value calculation recognises the time value of money—interest, as well as the probability of payment—risk. The proposed payments are discounted for the time value of money and for the likelihood of receiving the money. Inland Revenue needs to determine the amount, date, and probability of each payment and apply an appropriate discount rate. The discount rate is calculated from published government stock rates. Inland Revenue uses a calculation that involves: •the amount of payment, multiplied by •the probability of payment (for risk), divided by •the discount factor appropriate to the term (for interest). In order to ensure the net present value of a recovery is maximised, the proposal then needs to be compared to the net present value of other viable options. To achieve this Inland Revenue will compare the net present value of an arrangement against the net present value of other actions, ie deferred collection or legal proceedings. Where a proposed arrangement is for an amount less than $10,000 and for less than 12 months duration the Commissioner considers net present value to be maximised when the following conditions are met: •the proposed arrangement would lead to a monetary return to Inland Revenue •write-off or remission would produce less return than the proposed arrangement •legal proceedings would produce less return than the proposed arrangement over the same duration •Inland Revenue would incur costs by taking legal proceedings. Where the debt is greater than $10,000 or the proposed arrangement is for longer than 12 months, then a net present value calculation will be required if there are other viable options. A detailed explanation (and examples) of the net present value calculation can be found in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 14 (June 1995) which sets out Inland Revenue’s practice for hardship relief applications. Other considerations When considering a request for an arrangement, Inland Revenue will also take into account the following factors: •whether the proposal is realistic •the taxpayer’s compliance history •the likelihood of future compliance •whether the taxpayer previously had and adhered to an arrangement •whether the taxpayer has filed all required returns •protection of the integrity of the tax system (if a taxpayer is continuing in business, or has a continuing income stream which is not subject to source deductions, then future compliance must also be considered). Entering into an arrangement Date arrangement is entered into The date the arrangement is “entered into” is taken into account when cancelling penalties. Inland Revenue considers two possible dates that can be used are: •the date the application is received (telephone call or letter), or •the date that additional information is received in support of the application. If an application is incomplete Inland Revenue will require any additional information to be received by a set date. Therefore a date will need to be agreed to by Inland Revenue and the taxpayer, otherwise for practical purposes, the arrangement will start on the date that the complete information is received. Length of arrangement There is no legislative time limit for an arrangement. However, the Commissioner considers it necessary and desirable, in order to maximise the net present value of any recovery, that arrangements are over a shorter period of time, rather than a longer period of time. This is because the longer the period of time the greater the risk of non-payment and the greater the loss for time value of money. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 27 One or more payments Relief by way of an arrangement can be by one lump sum payment or payment by instalments. Instalments need not be at regular time intervals or of regular amounts however this may be preferable for ease of payment. Cancellation of relief Section 177 (5) provides for relief to be cancelled if: •information provided by the taxpayer is misleading •Inland Revenue receives further information relating to the taxpayers affairs, as they were on the date on which relief was granted, and •the Commissioner considers it was inappropriate in light of the information received to have granted relief. By way of examples: •if a taxpayer advises they were paying rent but in fact they were paying a mortgage on their own home, and had equity in that home, it may not have been appropriate for the Commissioner to have granted relief •where a taxpayer has a vested right to income or assets of a trust, and this was not disclosed to the Commissioner. No right of objection or challenge There is no statutory right to challenge or object to any decision of the Commissioner to grant or cancel relief under section 177(3) or 177(5). However if a taxpayer does not agree with the Commissioner’s decision not to grant relief, the taxpayer has other review options open to them, eg a request for review can be initially made to the Inland Revenue officer involved or their reporting officer, or to the Office of the Ombudsmen. Judicial review may also be an available option. Arrangements for student loan repayment obligations The definition of tax in section 3 TAA specifically excludes student loan repayment obligations. Therefore Inland Revenue cannot enter into arrangements with taxpayers for repayment of student loan repayment obligations under section 177 TAA. Inland Revenue considers that when the general recovery provisions, as provided for in section 156 TAA are exercised in conjunction with the Commissioner’s discretion under section 6A, the Commissioner is allowed to enter into arrangements for student loan debt, if in the circumstances, there is a reasonable basis for believing that such steps will result in the collection of the highest net revenue over time, having regard to the factors listed in section 6A(3). To ensure consistency, it is appropriate to have substantially the same criteria and processes for all arrangements. Therefore the criteria the Commissioner will use for arrangements for outstanding student loan repayment obligations are: •any application for relief by way of arrangement may be made orally or in writing •an application for relief must be for an amount that is, or is likely to become, liable for payment •the taxpayer must be in financial difficulties at the time of application •an arrangement must result in the collection of highest net revenue over time •an arrangement can be for one lump sum payment or two or more instalments. Collection of highest net revenue over time The “collection of highest net revenue over time” is not defined in the Tax Acts and has yet to be absolutely defined by the Courts. However, it would appear to be more than just collecting “as much as possible in as short a time as possible”. Consideration also needs to be given to the continuing collection of revenue over a longer period of time. For example, a taxpayer may be able to repay a student loan debt by instalment over nine months by continuing in business, and by continuing in business will be able to pay future taxes on time. However, in a similar example, a taxpayer may be able to repay a student loan debt by instalment over nine months by continuing in business, but the future prospects of that business show that the taxpayer will not be able to meet future taxes on time. This creates the risk of future debt arising. In this instance, some other form of action (such as issuing legal proceedings) may result in the collection of highest net revenue over time. When considering the collection of highest net revenue Inland Revenue will take into account the factors listed under “Other Considerations”. All arrangements Cancellation of penalties If an arrangement has been complied with, section 183B TAA allows the Commissioner to: •reduce the first late payment penalty by 60% if the arrangement was agreed to before the due date, and •cancel any late payment penalties incurred on the debt during the term of the arrangement. Cancellation applies where a debt has been paid by way of one or more payments under an arrangement with the Commissioner. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 28 As cancellation of penalties only applies if a taxpayer has complied with the taxpayer’s obligations under the arrangement, the penalties are cancelled at the end of the arrangement. Penalties will continue to be shown on Statements of account until the end of the arrangement. Interest will continue to accrue and be payable on the debt, throughout the term of the arrangement, as provided by legislation. Pursuant to section 6A TAA Inland Revenue will also cancel penalties applicable to arrangements for payment of student loan repayment obligations. Conditions Any arrangement entered into with Inland Revenue will be subject to certain conditions including: •all current taxes must be paid, and returns filed, by the due date •termination of the arrangement if the terms are not adhered to without prior agreement •interest will be charged and payable up to the date of payment in full (taxpayers should contact Inland Revenue for the final instalment amount) •any credits that arise in the taxpayer’s account will be offset against the amount owed •late payment penalties incurred during the course of an instalment arrangement will be cancelled, providing all payments are made on time. Adhering to the arrangement If a taxpayer cannot meet one of the payments by the agreed date, they should contact Inland Revenue to advise the reason that the payment will not be made on time. Any late payment is a breach of the arrangement and Inland Revenue may cancel the arrangement, depending on the reason for the late payment and the number of payments missed. Reviewing arrangements Where arrangements are over a long period of time, eg over 12 months, Inland Revenue considers it appropriate to review the arrangement and the taxpayer’s circumstances. Such a review will consider whether the arrangement is still appropriate to the taxpayer’s financial circumstances and may therefore require updated financial information from the taxpayer. Making the payments Inland Revenue prefers that taxpayers pay their instalment arrangement on a regular basis by automatic payment from their bank account. Another option is to make payments to any WestpacTrust branch with cash or by cheque, or to send cheques to Inland Revenue by the agreed dates. Confirmation Inland Revenue will issue confirmation of an arrangement in writing. This will include the terms and conditions and the commencement date of the arrangement. If the taxpayer disagrees with any of the terms and conditions they should contact the Inland Revenue officer who issued the confirmation immediately.

We’ve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. TAX AVOIDANCE SCHEME – UNSUCCESSFUL APPEAL AGAINST COMMISSIONER’S ASSESSMENTS Case:O’Neil v CIR Decision date:11 April 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Summary The taxpayers’ appeal from the Court of Appeal decision reported at \[1999\] 1 NZLR 275 was dismissed. Facts The four appellants were participants in the JG Russell template tax avoidance scheme. They had challenged the correctness of the assessments and their validity through a series of proceedings in the Taxation Review Authority, High Court and Court of Appeal (reported as Case R25 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,120, Miller & O’Neil v CIR 18 NZTC 13,001, (1997) 18 NZTC 13, 127 and (1997) 18 NZTC 13, 219 in the High Court and in the Court of Appeal as \[1999\] 1 NZLR 275). They consistently failed, and appealed against the judicial review aspects of the Court of Appeal judgment. As a result, however, the correctness of the assessments was also challenged collaterally. The scheme worked by converting the profits of the trading companies into capital receipts to the shareholders. The first step was for the shareholders to agree to sell their shares to a company controlled by Mr Russell, the price being left outstanding and secured by a mortgage over the shares. This transaction was not intended to be a sale in any commercial sense. The vendors declared themselves trustees of the shares for Mr Russell’s company but remained on the register and remained directors, continuing to run the company as before. They also had an option to repurchase the shares when the scheme had run its course. The sale had two purposes, both of which were entirely tax-related. The first was to make the appellants’ company part of a group of companies controlled by Mr Russell, some of which had tax losses. This would enable Mr Russell to take advantage of the group relief provisions in section 191. The second was to create a debt to the shareholders which could be satisfied out of the profits of their company. The next step was for the trading company to agree to pay its net profits, half-yearly, to the purchaser company controlled by Mr Russell. This was an administration charge. It was income in the hands of the purchaser company, but group relief under section 191 was relied upon to avoid tax. In reality the administration charge was partly a conduit for the money which was to be returned to the shareholders and partly a fee payable to Mr Russell for the use of the scheme. The proportion was calculated by reference to the amount of tax saved. In addition, the company paid a consultancy fee representing 5% of the administration charge to another Russell company. The third stage was for the Russell company to pay the shareholders their part of the administration charge. This was designated an instalment of the purchase price. The amount of the purchase price was calculated, not by reference to the value of the company but to enable the scheme to mop up a given number of years of expected net profit. When that had been accomplished, the appellants could exercise their option to repurchase the company and carry on as if nothing had happened. Alternatively (as happened in the case of the O’Neils) Mr Russell’s company could agree to buy a release of the option for a sum which would create a sufficient new capital debt to enable the scheme to start up again. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 30 Decision Section 99 The Russell scheme is a plain case of tax avoidance. The distinction between tax mitigation and tax avoidance is unhelpful: it describes the conclusion rather than providing a signpost to it. It is unwise to use the “impropriety” test endorsed by Baragwanath J in the High Court proceedings. This suggests a moral judgement which is inappropriate. It is better to concentrate on the nature of the concepts by reference to which tax has been imposed. In many cases the legislation will use terms such as income, loss and gain, which refer to commercially real concepts, not constrained by precise legal analysis. A composite transaction which may appear not to create any tax liability if it is analysed with “due regard to the juristic autonomy of each of its parts”, can be viewed in commercial terms as a unitary arrangement. This is a prime example of the kind of arrangement which section 99 was intended to counteract: section 99 enables the transaction to be taxed consistently with its commercial reality. On the other hand, the adoption of a course of action which avoids tax should not fall within section 99 if the legislation, upon its true construction, was intended to give the taxpayer the choice of avoiding it in that way. The limits of judicial review Apart from what was, in substance, an allegation of bad faith in the Commissioner’s motive for making the assessments, all the other points taken in the judicial review proceedings and on appeal were directed to showing that the assessments were erroneous in law or based upon an incorrect appreciation of the facts. These are matters which it was open to the appellants to raise in the statutory objection and, on further appeal, to the courts. In view of the course which the proceedings had taken, their Lordships dealt with all of the points. But they must not be taken as accepting that relief by way of judicial review would have been appropriate. It will only be in exceptional cases that judicial review should be granted where the challenges can be addressed in the statutory objection procedure. Such exceptional circumstances may arise most typically where there is abuse of power, but they have also been held to arise where the error of law claimed is fatal to the exercise of statutory power and where it would be wasteful to require recourse to the objection procedure. Reopening under the time bar The taxpayers’ argument was that they had included various sums paid by way of remuneration by the trading companies, and that the Commissioner’s reconstruction had treated the money they received under the scheme as if it were remuneration, so that money was income of a nature and from a source which had been disclosed. This argument, their Lordships held, is based upon a misapprehension about the effect of a reconstruction. The Commissioner’s duty is to make an assessment with regard to what, in his opinion, was likely to have happened if there had been no scheme. But that does not mean that he is actually rewriting history. The reconstruction is purely hypothetical and provides a yardstick for the assessment. Although the income is deemed to have been derived by the person assessed (see section 99(4)), the nature and source of the income remains what it is was, namely the company’s net profits routed to the shareholders through Mr Russell’s company. None of this was disclosed. Therefore the Commissioner was entitled to reopen. The effect of non-compliance with the section 99 Policy Statement The Commissioner’s delegate had in fact complied with the Policy Statement set out in TIB Vol 1, No 8 (February 1990). In any event this statement was not intended to lay down conditions at all. It simply reassures the public that the Commissioner and his officers will think very carefully about whether section 99 applies to any particular case. But his statutory duty is to reassess the taxpayer in any case in which section 99 applies and this duty cannot be made subject to internal conditions. Irrationality An allegation that the assessments were clearly wrong on their face, so must be irrational and therefore void, was met with the response that “Their Lordships consider that this submission can only be called preposterous”. Abuse of power The Commissioner had started his Russell strategy by assessing the trading companies for avoided tax. This was known, after the event, as “Track A”. It transpired that these companies, by the time of assessment and collection at least, were often empty shells. The Commissioner changed his strategy to assessing the shareholders. This was known as “Track B”. The allegation was that the Commissioner, in assessing the taxpayers with funds, was motivated solely by the fact that those taxpayers could pay the resultant assessments, irrespective of whether they were truly liable. Their Lordships considered whether this was this the case, and if so, did that invalidate the assessments. Their Lordships held that the first point was decided against the taxpayers as a matter of fact, in that while these taxpayers’ ability to pay was clearly a reason, it was not the sole reason. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001) 31 On the second point, they held that there was no reason why an arrangement should not confer tax advantages upon more than one person and this one plainly did. There was no reason why the Commissioner should not adjust the assessable income of each or any of these persons, provided his assessments were consistent with each other. He was entitled to assess any party who had obtained a tax advantage. Inconsistent assessments While “Track A” and “Track B” reassessments were mutually inconsistent by virtue of section 99(4), their Lordships considered that an assessment which wrongly includes income deemed, by virtue of section 99(4), to be the income of someone else is not void, any more than an assessment which is wrong on some other ground. It is merely open to objection under section 30. It follows that the Commissioner or Taxation Review Authority may remedy the position by amending the inconsistent assessment at any time before the objection proceedings have run their course. It is only when the assessments are no longer open to amendment that an objection on grounds of inconsistency will be incapable of remedy. Tentative assessments The change from Track A to Track B did not mean that the Track B assessments were tentative or provisional in terms of the decision in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Canterbury Frozen Meat Co Ltd \[1994\] 2 NZLR 681, which was far removed from the present case. As the Commissioner had defended his Track B assessments through thick and thin in the various lower courts, in all of which they have been held to be valid, the Privy Council concluded that “It would be a misuse of language to describe them as tentative”.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz RENT DEEMED TO BE PAYABLE – DEDUCTIBILITY PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 01/03 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2 and GD 10. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement to which this ruling applies is a “lease” of property (whether real property or personal property), at less than an “adequate rent,” where the property is used by the lessee in the derivation of gross income or exempt income. This ruling applies when the property is owned by any person, any 2 or more persons, or partnership and is leased: •to a “relative” of any of those persons or of any member of the partnership; or •to a “related company”; or •by a company to any person. For the purposes of this Ruling the terms “lease”, “adequate rent”, and “related company” have the meanings attributed to them by section GD 10(4), and “relative” has the meaning attributed to it by section OB 1. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: •Rent deemed under section GD 10 to be payable by the lessee to the lessor is expenditure incurred by the lessee for the purposes of section BD 2(1)(b). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to leases entered into within the period 1 February 2001 to 31 January 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 10 th day of April 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 4 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 01/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/03 (“the ruling”). The ruling is a reissue of public binding ruling BR Pub 97/13, issued on 12 December 1997. The Commissioner’s view, as expressed in this ruling, is not intended to differ from BR Pub 97/13. Any changes between this ruling and the previous ruling are only intended to assist the reader’s understanding. Background Section GD 10 applies to leases, between a lessor and certain specified classes of lessee, where the rent payable under the lease is “less than an adequate rent”. Section GD 10 allows the Commissioner to notionally increase the amount of rent payable by the lessee to the lessor to an amount equal to an “adequate rent” and the section deems the rent thus payable to be gross income of the lessor. Section GD 10 is directed against tax avoidance. It controls the shifting of income between family members to take advantage of different marginal tax rates, but is not limited to familial transactions. Progressive tax scales give advantages to the family unit to spread income, resulting in a reduction in the overall amount of tax paid by that unit, or the rate of tax applying to an income stream. Section GD 10 operates to limit this opportunity when related parties lease income-producing property. The effect of deeming income to be derived, based on a rent that should have been paid rather than what was paid, unwinds any advantage. Section GD 10 applies where property (both personal and real) owned by any person, by any 2 or more persons (whether jointly or in common) or by any partnership is leased: •to a relative of any of those persons; •to a relative of any member of the partnership; •to a related company; •by a company to any person; and the rent is either less than an adequate rent for the property or the lease makes no provision for the payment of rent. Where those circumstances apply, section GD 10 allows the Commissioner to determine an amount of “adequate rent”, being in broad terms an amount of rent considered by the Commissioner to be adequate for the property being leased. This ruling does not consider the basis of such a determination or what is meant by either adequate or inadequate rent. The amount of adequate rent so determined is, pursuant to section GD 10, deemed to be payable by the lessee to the lessor and is deemed to be gross income of the lessor. This ruling considers the position of the lessee and, specifically, whether the adequate rent that is deemed payable by the lessee to the lessor is an allowable deduction of the lessee for the purposes of section BD 2. The ruling concludes that rent deemed to be payable is an expenditure or loss incurred by the lessee under section BD 2(1)(b). It is therefore an allowable deduction if the exclusions in section BD 2(2) do not apply (such as, the exclusion of expenditure to the extent that it is of a private or capital nature, incurred in deriving exempt income, etc). Legislation Section BD 2(1) states: An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer (a)... (b)to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i) incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (ii)necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, ... . Section GD 10 states: (1)Where any property owned by any person or by 2 or more persons (whether jointly or in common) or by any partnership is leased to a relative of any of those persons or of any member of the partnership or to a related company or by a company to any person and the rent is less than an adequate rent for that property or the lease makes no provision for the payment of rent, - (a) There shall be deemed to be payable under the lease a rent that is equal to an adequate rent for the property, and that rent shall be deemed to be payable by the lessee to the lessor on the days provided in the lease for payment of the rent, or, if no rent is payable under the lease, on such days as the Commissioner determines, and shall be deemed to be gross income derived by the lessor on the days on which the rent is deemed to be payable under this paragraph; and (b) The rent deemed to be payable under paragraph (a) shall be deemed to accrue from day to day during the period in respect of which it is payable, and shall be apportioned accordingly. (2)This section shall apply with respect to any leased property only if and to the extent that it is used by the lessee in the derivation of gross income or exempt income. (3)This section shall apply whether the lease was granted before or after the commencement of the income year. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 5 (4) In this section- “Adequate rent”, in relation to any property, means the amount of rent that the Commissioner determines to be adequate for that property during the period in respect of which the determination is made: “Lease” means a tenancy of any duration, whether in writing or otherwise; and includes a sublease; and also includes a bailment; and “lessor” and “lessee” have corresponding meanings: “Related company” means a company that is under the control of the lessor or any relative or relatives of the lessor or any one or more of them, or, where there are several lessors or the lessor is a partnership, under the control of any of the lessors or partners or any relative or relatives of any of the lessors or partners: “Rent” includes any premium or other consideration for the lease. Section OB 1 defines “relative” as: “Relative” – (a)...in relation to any person, means any other person connected with the first-mentioned person by blood relationship, marriage, or adoption; and includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit; and for the purposes of this paragraph – (i) Persons are connected by blood relationship if within the fourth degree of relationship: (ii)Persons are connected by marriage if one is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other: (iii) Persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as the child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relation- ship to the other.... Application of the legislation How section GD 10 operates When does the section apply? Section GD 10 operates, in limited circumstances, following a determination by the Commissioner. In order for section GD 10 to apply, the following requirements must be satisfied: •There must be the leasing of property; •The owner of the property must be: •A person (as defined in the Act, and includes a company); or •Any 2 or more persons (whether jointly or in common); or •A partnership. •The lessee must be: •a relative of an owner (where the owner is a natural person); or •a relative of any member of the partnership that owns the property; or •a related company of the owner; or •where the lessor is a company, any person. •Where either the stipulated rent is less than adequate or the lease is silent on the payment of rent; and •The lessee uses the property in the derivation of gross income or exempt income. What leased property is covered? “Property” is not defined for the purposes of section GD 10, but in the Commissioner’s view it includes both real property (land and buildings) and personal property (property other than land and buildings). This is the usual legal meaning of “property”, but the definition of “lease” in section GD 10 also supports this interpretation. “Lease” is defined in section GD 10(4) as a tenancy of any duration, including a sublease, and a bailment. A lease and a tenancy usually only relate to land, i.e. real property. However, a bailment only ever refers to personal property. Therefore, it is clear that section GD 10 is intended to apply to, and the word “property” is meant to refer to, both real and personal property. Who is a relative? “Relative” is defined in section OB 1. A relative is a person connected by “blood relationship”, marriage, or adoption. “Blood relationship” means a relationship within the fourth degree, which is ascertained by counting the relationship steps between the two people. For example, A and B are first cousins, so they are within the fourth degree of relationship, as follows: A – A’s parent (1) – Grandparent (2) – B’s parent (3) – B (4) Any person who marries another person within the fourth degree of relationship automatically assumes the same relationship. For example, B’s spouse is within the fourth degree of relationship to A. Similarly, both A and B’s spouses are within the fourth degree of relationship to each other. Children adopted by a person within the third degree of relationship are also relatives. The deeming effect of section GD 10 If the section applies to a transaction, section GD 10(1)(a) explicitly deems: •An adequate rent to be payable under the lease; •That adequate rent to be payable by the lessee to the lessor on the days provided in the lease for rent payment, or, where no rent is payable under the lease, on such days as the Commissioner determines; and •Rent to be gross income of the lessor derived on the days on which it is deemed to be payable. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 6 “Deemed” means adding to the normal meaning of words If the Commissioner determines an adequate rent, the amount of rent payable by the lessee to the lessor is increased by the deeming effect of section GD 10 to reflect the Commissioner’s determination. In a Canadian decision, R v Vermette \[1978\] 2 SCR 838 at page 845, the Court gave a useful description of the legal effect of a deeming provision. It said: A deeming provision is a statutory fiction; as a rule it implicitly admits that a thing is not what it is deemed to be but decrees that for some particular purpose it shall be taken as if it were that thing although it is not or there is doubt as to whether it is. A deeming provision artificially imports into a word or expression an additional meaning which they would not otherwise convey beside the normal meaning which they retain where they are used; it plays a function of enlargement analogous to the word “includes” in certain definitions; however, “includes” would be logically inappro- priate and would sound unreal because of the fictional aspect of the provision. In this case, section GD 10 deems an amount of adequate rent to be payable, even though in terms of the contract between the lessor and the lessee it is not. The section then further deems the fictional rent to be payable on specified days and finally deems the rent to be gross income of the lessor. The section applies to a lessee Although the section deems the rent determined by the Commissioner to be gross income of the lessor, it does not expressly state that the deemed rent is deductible by the lessee. The absence of a specified mirror treatment for the lessee could arguably support an interpretation of the section based on the proposition that it does not apply to a lessee. However, in the Commissioner’s view this is not a correct interpretation because: 1.An adequate rent is deemed by the section to be payable under the lease. The section further deems the rent to be payable by the lessee to the lessor. 2.The application of the section is dependent on the lessee’s use of the leased property for the derivation of gross income or exempt income. 3.Subsection (2) is directly concerned with the use of leased property by the lessee. 4.Section GD 10 was originally introduced as section 17 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1951. Introductory Notes supplied to the Minister on introduction of the Bill said: This clause is designed to cover the position where a taxpayer owning an income producing property, enters into a lease under which a relative becomes entitled to the full rent or income from the property, and is required to pay to the lessor only a nominal or peppercorn rental. ...The provisions of the clause will not be applied to bona fide leases of property, even though the lessee is a relative, and will be operated by the Commissioner only where it is evident that the lease has the effect of transferring income from the taxpayer to a relative. This demonstrates that the purpose of the provision was to prevent income splitting and the consequential reduction of tax paid. Allowing a deduction to the lessee would not negate this purpose. These provisions support the conclusion that section GD 10 is intended to apply to both parties to a transaction. Deeming not limited to section GD 10 The application of the deeming provisions contained in section GD 10 is not limited by the inclusion of any qualification. Elsewhere in the Act, where the effect of a provision is intended to be restricted, such sections contain a qualification such as, “For the purposes of this section...”. The absence of such a qualification indicates that the deeming provisions are intended to have effect over the rest of the Act. In other words, having deemed an amount of adequate rent to be payable by the lessee to the lessor, that rent is payable for the wider purposes of the Act. It is not restricted to only applying to section GD 10. Section BD 2: “incurred” requires a legal obligation to pay An amount is an allowable deduction under section BD 2 only if it is “incurred” by the taxpayer. For the deemed adequate rent to be an allowable deduction, it must have been “incurred” by the lessee. The term “incurred” has been held to mean that the taxpayer has either paid the expenditure or loss, or is otherwise definitively committed to pay it: (see CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351). A taxpayer is said to be definitively committed when a legal obligation to make a payment in the future can be said to have accrued. Section GD 10 does not specifically deem the adequate rent to have been incurred by the lessee. Rather, the section deems the rent to be payable. In Re Howell’s Application \[1972\] Ch. 509, the phrase “payable by way of rent” was interpreted as meaning “... rent the tenant is under an enforceable obligation to pay...”. New Zealand courts have taken the same view. In AM Bisley & Co Ltd v C of IR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,082 at page 5,096, Henry J said: ...that the expenditure is not payable until some future date does not of itself destroy its nature as an existing obligation. Therefore, where an amount is said to be “payable”, it means that the payer has an enforceable obligation to pay the amount, even where that obligation does not crystallise until some future date. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 7 Under section GD 10(1)(a), adequate rent is deemed to be payable on the days provided in the lease for payment, or on such days as the Commissioner determines. This means that the Act operates as if there was an obligation to pay the rent. The Commissioner’s view is that by deeming the amount to be payable, that has the same effect as deeming that a legal obligation has been created and therefore as far as section BD 2(1)(b) is concerned an expenditure has been incurred. The obligation in Bisley was an existing legal obligation to make expenditure that became payable on a future date. Thus, there are two types of expenditure that qualify as “incurred”: existing legal obligations payable now, and those that will become payable in the future. For expenditure either to be payable or to become payable, there must be an existing obligation to pay either now or later. Rent deemed to be payable falls within the first category, and is clearly “incurred”. The nexus between expenditure and income is not affected by deeming If the leased property is used in the derivation of gross income, any rental paid by the lessee, including a less than adequate rent, is deductible (unless specifically excluded by section BD 2(2)). The required statutory nexus establishing deductibility is therefore present between the expenditure and the income. A determination by the Commissioner does not alter the quality of that expenditure, but merely alters the amount of the expenditure. Conclusion Rent deemed to be payable under section GD 10 is expenditure incurred by the lessee under section BD 2(1)(b). Examples Example 1 A leases a flat to her daughter B for $10 per week. B then rents it to tenants for $400 per week. A has other income of $50,000 and is on a marginal tax rate of 33c in the dollar. B has no other income and pays 19.5c in the dollar. As B’s tax bracket is lower than A’s, there is less tax being paid overall than if A rented the flat to the tenants directly. The Commissioner may determine that an adequate rent is higher than $10 per week. Section GD 10 will apply to deem the determined rent to be the rent payable by B to A. The adequate rent is deemed to be gross income derived by A. The rent deemed payable is expenditure incurred by B, as there is deemed to be a legal obligation to pay. Example 2 C Ltd, a company, leases a property to X, a charitable body, at an inadequate rental. X uses the property in the derivation of exempt income. A “person” includes a company and an unincorporated body of persons (section OB 1) and therefore X. Section GD 10(1) applies to a lease of property “by a company to any person” at an inadequate rent. Under subsection (2), the section applies to the extent that the property is used by the lessee in the derivation of gross income or exempt income. An adequate rent determined by the Commissioner is therefore deemed payable. Although a deduction is allowed under section BD 2(1), this is denied by section BD 2(2)(b) as the expenditure is incurred in the derivation of exempt income. In this case, C derives gross income in the amount of the adequate rent, but X is unable to claim a matching deduction. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 8 ASSESSABILITY OF PAYMENTS UNDER THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS ACT FOR HUMILIATION, LOSS OF DIGNITY, AND INJURY TO FEELINGS PUBLIC RULING – BR Pub 01/04 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Payments that are genuinely and entirely for compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 are not “monetary remuneration” in terms of the definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Consequently, such payments do not form part of the gross income of the employee under section CH 3. •Such compensation payments are not gross income under ordinary concepts under section CD 5. •There is consequently no liability under section NC 2 for employers or former employers to deduct PAYE from these payments. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received between 1 October 2000 and 30 September 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18th day of April 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Note (not part of ruling): This ruling replaces Public Rulings BR Pub 97/3 and 97/3A published in TIB Vol 9, No 3 (March 1997). This new ruling is essentially the same as the previous rulings. The main changes take into account the new employment legislation, update relevant case references, and the ruling clarifies the Commissioner’s approach to out of court settlements where he has some doubt about the amount attributed to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. The ruling applies from 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2005. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 5, CH 3, NC 2, and the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is: •The making of a payment to an employee or former employee for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000; or •The making of a payment to an employee or former employee pursuant to an out of court settlement genuinely based on the employee’s rights to compensation under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000. This Ruling does not, however, apply to such payments that are in reality for lost wages or other income, but which are merely characterised by the parties as being for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings (irrespective of whether such an agreement is signed by a mediator under the Employment Relations Act). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 9 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 01/04 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/04 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Rulings BR Pub 97/3 and 97/3A published in TIB Vol 9, No 3 (March 1997) at page 7. The Ruling applies for the period from 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2005. Background The Employment Relations Act 2000 provides for a number of remedies when an employee has a personal grievance against a current or former employer. This includes compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the employee. The Employment Relations Act also establishes specialist institutions with exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the rights of parties litigating on employment contracts: the Employment Relations Authority and the Employment Court. The Employment Relations Service of the Department of Labour has jurisdiction to provide mediation services. Section 103(1) of the Employment Relations Act defines “personal grievance” as: For the purposes of this Act, personal grievance means any grievance that an employee may have against the employee’s employer or former employer because of a claim— (a)that the employee has been unjustifiably dismissed; or (b)that the employee’s employment, or 1 or more conditions of the employee’s employment (including any condition that survives termination of the employment), is or are or was (during employment that has since been terminated) affected to the employee’s disadvantage by some unjustifiable action by the employer; or (c)that the employee has been discriminated against in the employee’s employment; or (d)that the employee has been sexually harassed in the employee’s employment; or (e)that the employee has been racially harassed in the employee’s employment; or (f)that the employee has been subject to duress in the employee’s employment in relation to membership or non-membership of a union or employees organisa- tion. Section 123 of the Employment Relations Act provides a number of remedies available to the Authority or Court when the Authority or Court determines that an employee has a “personal grievance” including: ... (b)the reimbursement to the employee of a sum equal to the whole or any part of the wages or other money lost by the employee as a result of the grievance: (c)the payment to the employee of compensation by the employee’s employer, including compensation for - (i) humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the employee; and (ii)loss of any benefit, whether or not of a monetary kind, which the employee might reasonably have been expected to obtain if the personal grievance had not arisen: The Ruling considers whether such payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the employee are “monetary remuneration”. Paragraph (a) of the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section OB 1 states: “Monetary remuneration” ...means any salary, wage, allowance, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer;... Section CH 3 states that “all monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income”. Section CD 5 also states that “the gross income of a person includes any amount that is included in gross income under ordinary concepts”. Application of the Legislation If payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings, under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 are “monetary remuneration”, they would be included under section CH 3 as gross income. They would be included in the calculation of “net income” under section BC 6 and would consequently form part of “taxable income” as calculated under section BC 7. Section OB 1 defines “monetary remuneration” to include any “other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer...”. Payments under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act are a benefit in money. The issue is, therefore, whether these payments are made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of” the recipient. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 10 The meaning of “in respect of or in relation to” The phrase “in respect of or in relation to” is capable of having a very wide meaning. For example, in Shell New Zealand Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, the Court of Appeal was dealing with certain lump sum payments made by Shell to employees who transferred at the request of Shell. The Court discussed the definition of “monetary remuneration”. The case concerned the part of the definition of “monetary remuneration” which says: ... emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer. McKay J, delivering the judgment of the Court, said at page 11,306 that: The words “in respect of or in relation to” are words of the widest import. Although McKay J acknowledged that the payments in Shell were not made under the contract of employment in that case, this did not mean that the employees received the payment outside the employment relationship. The learned Judge had earlier referred to the fact that the payments were not expressly provided under the employees’ written employment contracts but were made pursuant to Shell’s employment policy as a matter of discretion. They were still made “because he or she is an employee”. Other cases have also stressed the width of the words “in respect of or in relation to”. In the Queens Bench case of Paterson v Chadwick \[1974\] 2 All ER 772, Boreham J considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in relation to discovery, and adopted the comments of Mann CJ in the Australian case Trustees, Executors & Agency Co Ltd v Reilly \[1941\] VLR 110, where the learned Chief Justice said: The words “in respect of” are difficult of definition but they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation in between the two subject-matters to which the words refer. Similarly, in Nowegijick v The Queen \[1983\] CTC 20 at page 25, the Supreme Court of Canada described the phrase “in respect of” as “probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject-matters”. Context may affect the meaning However, many cases have demonstrated that the meaning to be given to the phrase “in respect of or in relation to” may vary according to the context in which it appears. In State Government Insurance Office v Rees (1979) 144 CLR 549, the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in determining whether the debt due to the Government Insurance Office fell within section 292(1)(c) of the Companies Act 1961-1975 (Q.) as “amounts ... due in respect of workers’ compensation under any law relating to workers’ compensation accrued before the relevant date”. The Court held that amounts which could be recovered by the Government Insurance Office from an uninsured company pursuant to section 8(5) of the Workers’ Compensation Act 1916-1974(Q.) for money paid to workers employed by the uninsured company were not amounts due “in respect of” workers’ compensation under the Companies Act. At page 561 Mason J observed that: ... as with other words and expressions, the meaning to be ascribed to “in respect of” depends very much on the context in which it is found. Stephen J also discussed the meaning of the phrase “in respect of”, noting at pages 553-554 that it was capable of describing relationships over a very wide range of proximity, and went on to say: Were the phrase devoid of significant context, it could, I think, be taken to be descriptive of the relationship between the present indebtedness owed to the State Government Insurance Office and the subject matter of workers’ compen- sation. However a context does exist which is in my view sufficient to confine the operation of s 292(1)(c) to bounds too narrow to be of service to the appellant. In TRA Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190, certain payments were made to a New Zealand distributor by its overseas parent in relation to repairs which had to be made to cars sold to the New Zealand subsidiary and then sold to dealers. The issue was whether the payments were zero-rated. The definition of “consideration” in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was relevant. Part of the definition of “consideration” states: ...any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services ... The TRA stated at page 6,200 that: A sub-issue is whether the reimbursing payment from the overseas manufacturer (MC) was made “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” the repair work in the sense required by the definition of “consideration” in s 2 of the Act. ... Although the definition of consideration creates a very wide potential link between a payment and a particular supply it is, in any case, a matter of degree, commonsense, and commercial reality whether a payment is direct enough to have the necessary nexus with a service, i.e, whether the link is strong enough. The High Court’s decision on the appeal of Case R34 is CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819. McGechan J said: ...it is necessary there be a genuine connection. The legislature is not to be taken as taxing on an unrealistic or tenuous connection basis. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 11 Not all payments to employees are “monetary remuneration” While it is true that an employee would not receive a payment under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act if he or she were not an employee, it would seem clear that this type of “but for” approach to “in respect of or in relation to” is not universally applied in the context of employment, and that not all payments to employees which have a connection with their work are within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. In Fraser v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,356, at page 12,363, Doogue J in the High Court said: There is no dispute that the words “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer” are words of the widest possible scope: see Shell New Zealand Ltd v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 at p 11,306, and Smith v FC of T 87 ATC 4883; (1987) 164 CLR 513; (1987) 19 ATR 274. Mr Harley does, however, submit, correctly, that it does not follow that all payments made are necessarily income and refers, for example, to reimbursement payments. In Shell, McKay J highlighted the fact that the payments in that case were both: •made to the recipients because they were employees, and •paid to compensate for the loss incurred by the employee in having to relocate in order to take up a new position with the employer. Many cases have concluded that, in appropriate circumstances, amounts received were not income, or assessable, even though paid by an employer to an employee. In FC of T v Rowe (1995) ATC 4,691, for example, the taxpayer was employed as an engineer for the Livingston Shire Council. As a result of a number of complaints against him he was suspended. An inquiry was commenced, and he incurred legal costs as a result of engaging counsel to defend himself against dismissal during the course of the inquiry. The taxpayer was cleared of any charges of misconduct but was dismissed a year later. The taxpayer claimed his legal costs as a deduction. Although the Council refused to reimburse the taxpayer for his legal costs, the Queensland government subsequently made an ex gratia payment to him. The Full Federal Court considered, amongst other things, whether the ex gratia payment constituted assessable income. By majority, the Court concluded that the payment was not assessable under section 25(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as income in accordance with ordinary concepts, nor was it assessable under section 26(e) of that Act as being compensation “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to” any employment. Accordingly, Burchett and Drummond JJ (with Beaumont J dissenting) held that the payment was not assessable. Burchett J held that the payment was not a reward for the taxpayer’s services but was a recognition for the wrong done to him. The payments were not remuneration but a reparation, and they were not sufficiently related to the performance of income- earning activities. On the same reasoning, it was too remote from the employment to be caught by section 26(e). Further, the payment was not assessable under section 26(e) because the employer/employee relationship between the Council and the taxpayer was merely part of the background facts against which the ex gratia payment was made. On appeal, the majority of the Full High Court confirmed the Federal Court’s decision: FC of T v Rowe (1997) ATC 4,317. Other cases, relating to wartime service, have also shown that payments made to present or former employees for reasons unconnected with their service as an employee will not necessarily be assessable income on a “but for” basis. In Louisson v Commissioner of Taxes \[1943\] NZLR 1, at page 9 Myers CJ and Northcroft J said of payments made by an employer to a former employee who had enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in World War II: In our opinion, such payments were personal gifts to each of the employees coming within the description in the resolu- tion - gifts made simply as an acknowledgment of personal appreciation of the sacrifice made in the service of the Country by persons whose employment with the company has ceased and who are under no engagement to return to that employment. Similarly, in the Australian case of FCT v Dixon (1954) 5 AITR 443, the taxpayer received payments from his prior employer topping up his military pay. It would appear from the judgment that the Australian Commissioner argued that even a slight relationship to employment was sufficient to satisfy the test in section 26(e) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 \[which made assessable certain sums granted to the taxpayer “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment...”.\]. This argument was rejected by Dixon CJ and Williams J, who stated at page 446 that: We are not prepared to give effect to this view of the operation of s.26(e) ...There can, of course, be no doubt that the sum of £104 represented an allowance, gratuity or benefit allowed or given to the taxpayer by Macdonald, Hamilton and Company. Our difficulty is in agreeing with the view that it was allowed or given to him in respect of, or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of, or services rendered by him ...We are not prepared to give s.26(e) a construction which makes it unnecessary that the allowance, gratuity, compensation, benefit, bonus or premium shall in any sense be a recompense or consequence of the continued or contemporaneous existence of the relation of employer and employee or a reward for services rendered given either during the employment or at or in consequence of its termination. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 12 In the same case, at page 450, McTiernan J stated that: The words of paragraph (e) are wide, but, I think, not wide enough to prevent an employer from giving money or money’s worth to an employee continuing in his service or leaving it, without incurring liability to tax in respect of the gift. The relationship of employer and employee is a matter of contract. The contractual relations are not so total and all embracing that there cannot be personal or social relations between employer and employee. A payment arising from those relations may have no connexion with the donee’s employment. These principles have also been applied by the courts in cases involving contracts for services. In Scott v FCT (1969) 10 AITR 367, Windeyer J in the High Court of Australia, considered the meaning of the words “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of or services rendered by him” in section 26(e) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936–1961. The case concerned a solicitor who received a gift of £10,000 from a grateful client. Windeyer J stated at page 374 that the meaning of the words of the legislation “must be sought in the nature of the topic concerning which they are used”. Windeyer J at page 376 referred to a passage from the judgment of Kitto J in Squatting Investment Co Ltd v FCT (1953) 5 AITR 496, at 524, where Kitto J (speaking of certain English cases) said: The distinction these decisions have drawn between taxable and non-taxable gifts is the distinction between, on the one hand, gifts made in relation to some activity or occupation of the donee of an income-producing character ... and, on the other hand, gifts referable to the attitude of the donor personally to the donee personally. Adopting this as a general principle, his Honour held that the £10,000 was not given or received as remuneration for services rendered and it did not form part of the taxpayer’s assessable income. A recent case discusses the words “in respect of the employment” in the Australian FBT legislation: J & G Knowles & Associates Pty Ltd v FC of T (2000) ATC 4,151. The case concerned interest-free loans to directors of a corporate trustee. Units in the trust fund were held by discretionary family trusts established by the directors. The lower courts were satisfied by a causal relationship, or a discernible and rational link between the loans and each director’s employment. However, the Full Federal Court said that there had to be more than just any causal relationship between the benefit and the employment: the link had to be sufficient or material. The nature and context of the payments Looking at the nature and context of payments contemplated by section 123(c)(i), it is strongly arguable that they do not intrinsically result from the employee and employer relationship. It is true that if the employee were not an employee then there would be no entitlement to receive the payment, but payments under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings are not compensation for services rendered or for actions that occur in the normal course of the employment relationship. They are based on the existence of a personal grievance. Provisions for such compensation can be seen as being included in the Employment Relations Act because the sometimes unequal power of the parties to the employment contract means that such personal grievances may be likely to occur in that setting. It is noteworthy that the Human Rights Act 1993 also includes provisions for dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment of employees, even though that is not “employment legislation” at all. It is also possible to analyse a breach of the terms of the employment contract giving rise to the personal grievance (and the subsequent compensation) as literally being outside the employment contract because of the breach of the terms of the contract. Payments of compensation under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act differ markedly from the situation in Shell v CIR. In that case at page 11,306, McKay J said: It is true ...that the payment is not made under the contract of employment....It is nevertheless paid to an employee only because he or she is an employee, and is paid to compensate for the loss incurred in having to change the employee’s place of residence in order to take up a new position in the company. (Emphasis added) Thus, in the Shell case, the employees received the payments as employees, and in order to compensate for the loss sustained as a result of the employment- related relocation. In the ordinary course, the Commissioner considers genuine payments under section 123(c)(i) to be too remote from the employment relationship to be within the definition of monetary remuneration. The Commissioner considers that the employment relationship in such instances is merely part of the background facts against which the compensation payments are made. The payments are not made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. At first glance, it may be thought that this approach conflicts with the outcome in Case L78 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,451, where Barber DJ held that an ex gratia payment, to compensate for the employer’s failure to give adequate notice of redundancy, was assessable as “monetary remuneration”. However, the result in that case turned substantially on the objector’s evidence as to the receipt being in the nature of “extra wages”. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 13 Barber DJ stated at page 1,455 that: The objector himself related the $7,009.52 to extra holiday pay and sick leave. ... At the end of his cross-examination he said that it was “really a bonus” and he regarded $7,009.52 as “extra wages”. The character of the payment must be of a revenue nature. It is not a payment in the nature of capital. I consider that it is clearly within the definition of monetary remuneration in sec 2. There is also the later TRA decision in Case L92 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,530, where Barber DJ again considered the definition of “monetary remuneration”. This case also concerned an employee who was made redundant and an employer who did not comply with the requirement to give adequate notice. Barber DJ held that the payment came within the definition of “monetary remuneration” and was assessable income. However, the Authority did not consider any cases (other than his own previous decision in Case L78) on the correct characterisation of receipts for tax purposes, but rather concentrated upon the need to interpret “monetary remuneration” in a “wide manner” and the fact that the amount was received as compensation for loss of employment. Such compensation is specifically referred to in the definition of monetary remuneration. Recognising that it was possible for some receipts of a capital nature to be assessable income under a specific provision, Barber DJ at page 1,537 stated: In this case, the words in sec 2 “compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” must surely cover not only a revenue type of payment such as a payment for lost wages, but also any other form of compensation for loss of employ- ment. It may also be relevant to observe that both of these TRA decisions concerned settlements under the Industrial Relations Act 1973. This earlier legislation made no specific and separate provision for compensation payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. It is also thought that payments of the type under consideration in this Ruling are to be distinguished from those considered in American cases such as the Commissioner v Schleier 95-USTC 50,309. In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that certain punitive damages were assessable to the recipient employee. However, apart from the differing statutory context in the United States Internal Revenue Code, these damages were punitive because they related to a deliberate breach of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and that Act does not provide for a separate recovery of compensatory damages for pain and suffering or emotional distress. The New Zealand Court of Appeal in Air New Zealand Ltd v Johnston \[1992\] 1 NZLR 159 seemingly rejected the view that humiliation type payments to employees are punitive in nature rather than compensatory. In that case Cooke J held at page 168 that “the emphasis evidently placed by the Labour Court on the punitive aspect does justify, in my opinion, a radical interference with their award.” The award of $135,000 was replaced with one of $25,000, made up of $15,000 for future economic loss and $10,000 for injury to feelings. Income under ordinary concepts Compensation payments genuinely made under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 are not “gross income under ordinary concepts” under section CD 5. Unlike the statutory definition of “monetary remuneration”, section CD 5 can only apply when the payments received are “income” according to ordinary concepts. Although the legislation does not define “gross income under ordinary concepts”, a great number of decided cases has variously identified the concept by reference to such characteristics as periodicity, recurrence, and regularity, or by its resulting from business activities, the deliberate seeking of profit, or the performance of services. Nor do capital receipts form part of “gross income” unless there is a specific legislative provision to the contrary. It is clear that payments under section 123(c)(i) will not generally be made periodically or regularly, or generally recur. Nor as we have seen above, are they compensation for services. And by analogy with common law damages, they are of a capital nature. This point is acknowledged by Barber DJ in Case L92, where he stated at page 1,536 that: I appreciate only too well that it is possible to interpret the evidence as showing that the $7,179.30 was formulated as a payment in the nature of common law damages for human hurt and breach and unfairness... I appreciate that the latter concepts are akin more to payments of capital than to wage revenue. Out of court settlements Sometimes, an employee and an employer negotiate a settlement out of court. The settlement agreement may state that the payment is for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. In return for the employee surrendering his or her rights under the Employment Relations Act, the employer will agree to pay a sum of money. There should be no difference in the tax treatment of the payments dependent on whether or not the parties use the Employment Relations Authority or Employment Court. A payment can be for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the employee whether the Authority or Court are involved or not. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 14 Shams The Ruling will not apply to payments which are akin to sham payments. A sham is a transaction set up to conceal the true intention of the parties and is inherently ineffective. The nature of a sham was discussed by Diplock LJ in Snook v London and West Riding Investment Ltd \[1967\] 1 All ER 518 at 528 where he stated: I apprehend that, if it has any meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the “sham”, which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. Richardson J, in the New Zealand case of Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, stated that the “essential genuineness of the transaction is challenged” in a sham situation. It is noteworthy that in the Taxation Review Authority decision Case S 96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603, Judge Barber stated at page 7,606: Of course, seemingly excessive allocations to compensation for feelings injury should be reopened by the IRD. If the parties to an agreement agree to characterise or describe payments as being for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings when they are in reality for lost wages, this transaction would be a sham which would be open to challenge by the Commissioner. Where the Commissioner has some doubt about the amount attributed to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings, he may ask the parties to an agreement what steps they took to evaluate objectively what would be a reasonable amount to attribute to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. This would be so regardless of whether the payment was made as a result of an out of court settlement and whether or not the agreement is signed by a mediator under the Employment Relations Act. Further, as provided by section 18 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 and section 136(16) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the onus of proof in a hearing regarding the assessability of any such payment would be on the taxpayer. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 15 NEW LEGISLATION TAX IMPLICATIONS OF THE PROPERTY (RELATIONSHIPS) AMENDMENT ACT 2001 other relationship property. However, if there are extraordinary circumstances that make equal sharing of the relationship property “repugnant to justice”, or the relationship is of short duration, each partner’s share is to be determined in accordance with his or her contribution to the partnership relationship. People who enter into de facto relationships choose not to marry, and may wish to enter into contracting out agreements to preserve their autonomy in property terms. The Amendment Act recognises contracting out agreements entered into by de facto couples from 1 August 2001. The intention is to ensure that such agreements will have effect as soon as the rest of the Act comes into effect on 1 February 2002. Tax implications The gift duty exemption in section 75A of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 has been extended to de facto couples. The definition of “matrimonial agreement” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1976 has been amended to include: •an agreement made under Part 6 of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976: or •an order of the Court made under section 25 of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976. This has the effect of extending references to “matrimonial agreement” to include agreements and court orders applying to de facto couples. Section CL 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides an exception to the imposition of income tax on withdrawals from superannuation funds if the withdrawal is necessary to settle the division of matrimonial property. This section has also been extended to withdrawals for the purpose of property settlements following the end of a de facto relationship. Application date The extension of the gift duty exemption to de facto couples applies from 1 August 2001, the date from which agreements can be made by those couples. Other changes apply from 1 February 2002, the date the Property (Relationships) Amendment Act 2001 comes into force. Summary As a result of the enactment of the Property (Relationships) Amendment Act 2001 on 3 April 2001, the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 has been extended to de facto relationships (including same sex couples) and renamed the Property (Relationships) Act 1976. Provisions in the Revenue Acts dealing with matrimonial transfers, including a gift duty exemption in section 75A of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968, have also been extended to de facto relationships. Background Public Information Bulletin 126, published in April 1984, explains the income tax treatment of matrimonial transfers. The principal effect of specific tax provisions is that such transfers of income producing property will, as far as possible, not create a liability for income tax at the time the transfer is made. The Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 also contains a gift duty exemption for matrimonial transfers. The exemption provides that no gift will arise when a distribution of matrimonial property: •is made by and in accordance with a matrimonial agreement, and •does not result in a person to whom the disposition is made having legal and equitable interest in more than half of the matrimonial property of the couple. These provisions applied only to married couples. There was no legislative provision for the division of property when a de facto relationship ended. On the breakdown of such relationships, the partner with legal title of the property retained it unless the other partner could establish a beneficial interest in it. To establish an interest, the non-owning partner had to rely on general law, particularly trust law. Property (Relationships) Amendment Act 2001 The Property (Relationships) Amendment Act 2001 establishes one rule for the division of relationship property which will apply to both married couples and de facto couples. On the division of relationship property, each of the partners will be entitled to share equally in the family home, the family chattels, and any Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 16 NO TAX ON EX GRATIA PAYMENTS TO JAPANESE EX-PRISONERS OF WAR AND CIVILIAN INTERNEES The Government announced on 24 April 2001 that it would make ex gratia payments to Japanese ex- prisoners of war and civilian internees. These payments are not in the nature of income, so they will not be subject to income tax. The payments are in recognition of unique and extreme hardship endured in Japanese prison camps. The UK Government recently announced it would make similar payments. The nature of a payment is a significant factor in determining its tax status. Case law (Reid v CIR \[1985\] 7 NZTC 5,176) confirms that when examining the quality of a receipt in the hands of the recipient consideration must be given to the relationship between the person making the payment and the recipient and the purpose behind the payment. None of these considerations suggests that the payments are in the nature of income. Accordingly, the payments are not subject to income tax. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 17 CHANGES TO INCOME TAX ACT 1994 TAX ON STAKE MONEY WON ON OVERSEAS RACES Section CB 9 Introduction Stake money won by horses or greyhounds competing in overseas races is exempt from income tax. Background Stake money is the prize money paid to the owner of a horse or greyhound that wins a race. Stake money paid in respect of a race held in New Zealand has been exempt from income tax since 1965. Stake money won in an overseas race was taxable, however, if the owner participated in the race as part of a business, expenses incurred in racing, whether in New Zealand or overseas, were generally not deductible. Overseas racing was not considered when the tax exemption for stake money won domestically was introduced in 1965. This was probably because sending horses overseas to race at this time was not as common as it is today. A key tax principle is that business activities are subject to income tax whereas hobbies are not. Racing can be undertaken either to increase the value of bloodstock (breeding-related racing) or for the personal entertainment of the owner (non-breeding related racing). As, on average, an owner can expect that the expenses incurred in racing exceed the stake money won, the Government considered that non- breeding related racing, undertaken domestically or internationally, is more like a hobby than a business activity, so should not be subject to income tax. Although breeding-related racing may be closely associated with a breeding business, to limit avoidance opportunities and tax-driven behaviour, it was considered that stake money won in breeding related racing, whether undertaken domestically or internationally, should also not be subject to income tax. Key features Section CB 9(ca) treats as exempt income stake money won by a horse or greyhound in an overseas race. Application date The amendment has been backdated to apply from the 1995–1996 income year. TAXATION (BENEFICIARY INCOME OF MINORS, SERVICES-RELATED PAYMENTS AND REMEDIAL MATTERS) ACT 2001 01/4 The Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-related Payments and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced into Parliament on 16 October 2000. Legislation resulting from the bill’s passage through Parliament was enacted on 27 March 2001. The main features of the bill as introduced were measures to tax certain trust distributions to minors at 33% and to make restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments taxable. Legislation added to the bill at the select committee stage of its passage included remedial amendments to the multi-rate fringe benefit tax rules enacted last year. The Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Services-related Payments and Remedial Matters) Act 2001 amends the following: the Income Tax Act 1994, the Income Tax Act 1976, the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, and the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 18 SERVICES-RELATED PAYMENTS: RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS AND EXIT INDUCEMENTS This created a risk to the personal services income tax base, which was increased by the possibility that the payments were deductible in some cases to the payer. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (1998) reviewed the treatment of restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments and recommended that the Government consider legislation to make them taxable. In June 2000, the Government released an issues paper containing proposals to address the revenue risk posed by these services-related payments by making them taxable. Key features The main amendments are the restrictive covenant charging provision (new sections CHA 1 and GC 14F of the Income Tax Act 1994), the exit inducement charging provision (new section CHA 2), deductibility matters (new sections DJ 20, DJ 21 and EO 6) and the PAYE rules (section OB 1). Under the amendments relating to restrictive covenants (sections CHA 1 and GC 14F): •If a person gives an undertaking that restricts, or is intended to restrict, the person’s ability to perform services as an employee, office holder or independent contractor, any amount derived by that person or any other person in respect of the undertaking is taxable to that person. •A restrictive covenant payment received on the sale of a business is excluded from the restrictive covenant charging provision. (This exclusion applies only if a number of conditions are satisfied.) •A specific anti-avoidance provision is intended to ensure that the charging provision cannot be circumvented by an arrangement such as an employee making a restrictive covenant agreement with a wholly-owned company, the shares in which the employee subsequently sells to his or her employer. The charging provision for exit inducements (section CHA 2) taxes any amount derived by a person for a loss of a vocation, position or status, or for leaving a position. Introduction Amendments have been made to the Income Tax Act 1994 to tax certain services-related payments, namely “restrictive covenant” and “exit inducement” payments. A “restrictive covenant” payment is the consideration given for a restriction on a person’s ability to perform services. An “exit inducement” payment is the consideration given by a prospective employer or contractor to a person for giving up a particular status or position. These payments posed a risk to the personal services income tax base because they were previously non- taxable to the recipient and could be paid in substitution for taxable personal services income 1 (including salary or wages), and they may have been deductible in some cases to the payer. In addition to the amendments making restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments taxable, there are a number of associated amendments. These include excluding restrictive covenant payments connected with the sale of a business from the charging provision, excluding expenditure on restrictive covenants and exit inducements from the capital prohibition rule, and including restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments made to employees within the PAYE rules. Background The New Zealand tax system generally maintains a capital-revenue boundary: capital receipts are generally not taxed, whereas revenue receipts are taxed. This boundary became problematic in the context of certain services-related payments, in particular, restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments. The New Zealand courts had held that payments for restrictive covenants 2 and exit inducements 3 were non- taxable capital receipts. Payments that would generally be taxable in the same manner as wages and salary were therefore capable of being characterised as these non-taxable capital payments. 1 In this article “personal services income” means payments made under both contracts of service (employment contracts) and contracts for services. It also includes payments made to office holders. References in this article to “services” or “personal services” generally include employment, and being an independent contractor and office holder. Also, examples of employment situations generally include independent contracting and office holding. 2 Henwood v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1995) 17 NZTC 12,271, Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Fraser (1996) 17 NZTC 12,607. 3 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Fraser, Case U8 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,068. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 19 Under the deductibility amendments (sections DJ 20, DJ 21 and EO 6): •Express relief from the exclusion for capital expenditure is provided for persons who incur expenditure on making restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments. This facilitates their being able to deduct such payments, thereby maintaining consistency with the treatment of expenditure on salary and wages and other payments for services. •Restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments are non-deductible to the extent that the payments relate to work of a capital nature undertaken by the recipient employee, office holder or independent contractor. (Ordinary remuneration is similarly non-deductible in such a situation.) Employee recipients of restrictive covenant payments who have been taxed on them are allowed a deduction to the extent that they have to refund the payment because they do not comply with the covenant for its full term. Restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments made to employees are included within the PAYE rules (section OB 1). The ordinary tax accounting principles and provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 apply to determine the time at which services-related payments are included in gross income or allowed as a deduction. Application date The new charging provisions apply to amounts derived on and after 27 March 2001. This includes such amounts derived in respect of arrangements made before 27 March 2001. The deductibility amendments generally apply to expenditure incurred on and after 27 March 2001. These amendments also apply to expenditure incurred on restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments before this date if those payments are gross income to another person under either section CHA 1 or section CHA 2. Restrictive covenant payments Restrictive covenant charging provision New section CHA 1(1) provides that if a person gives an undertaking that restricts, or is intended to restrict, the person’s ability to perform services as an employee, office holder or independent contractor, any amount derived by that person or any other person in respect of the undertaking is taxable to that person. This charging provision is quite broad in that the contract to provide services and the restrictive covenant undertaking can be with different persons. It should cover any combination of payment and agreement between multiple entities by focusing on the restrictive covenant payment itself. This would include, for example, an arrangement such as that in the Fraser case, in which four entities were involved in the transaction. The charging provision applies to any undertaking (not just a contract), whether or not the undertaking is legally valid. The reference to “amount” in section CHA 1 uses the definition of “amount” in section OB 1, which includes any amount in money’s worth. The charging provision is, therefore, sufficiently broad to cover in-kind consideration, not just monetary payments. Sale of business exclusion from restrictive covenant charging provision Section CHA 1(2) contains a specific exclusion for restrictive covenant payments made in connection with the sale of a business. This exclusion has been made because the main focus of the amendment is to tax restrictive covenant payments that can be substituted for taxable income from services. Restrictive covenant payments received on the sale of a business are part of a larger capital receipt (the purchase price of a business) and are less likely to be substituted for taxable income from services. The exclusion for restrictive covenant payments made on the sale of a business applies only if four conditions are satisfied. These conditions are designed to ensure that the exclusion cannot be used to undermine the reform to tax restrictive covenant payments that can be substituted for income from services. These conditions are that: 1.The restrictive covenant amount is derived as a result of the sale of a business by the person who gives the undertaking or an associated person (section CHA 1(2)(a)). 2.The restrictive covenant amount is consideration for an undertaking by a person not to provide goods or services in competition with the goods or services provided by the purchaser of the business (section CHA 1(2)(b)). 3.The person who gives the restrictive covenant undertaking must not provide any services to the purchaser after the sale of the business, other than services that are incidental to the sale and are temporary in nature (section CHA 1(2)(c)). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 20 4.The vendor and purchaser of the business agree in writing that the transaction is a sale of a business (section CHA 1(2)(d)). The sale of a business includes the sale of part of a business, if that part is capable of separate operation (section CHA 1(3)(a)). The sale of a business also includes the sale of all of the shares in a company, if the company, or another company directly or indirectly wholly owned by the company, carries on a business (section CHA 1(3)(b)). If the sale of a business is by way of share sale, then the purchaser in conditions 2 and 3 includes the company that carries on the business (section CHA 1(4)). The following examples show how the sale of business exclusion can apply to different forms of business sales. Example 1: Asset sale The vendor sells their business by way of asset sale to a purchaser. The vendor also gives a restrictive covenant undertaking to the purchaser and receives a payment in consideration. (It is this straightforward sale of business situation that the main legislation is based on; modifications are made to these main rules to cater for other forms of business sales.) Example 2: Company sells assets A company sells its business by way of asset sale to a purchaser. The owner of the company gives a restrictive covenant undertaking to the purchaser and receives a payment in consideration. In terms of condition 1, an associated person (the company) of the person who gives the restrictive covenant undertaking (the owner of the company) is selling the business to the purchaser. In terms of condition 4, it is the vendor company that would need to agree with the purchaser in writing that the transaction is a sale of a business. The same treatment would apply if a number of wholly-owned companies were interposed between the ultimate owner (who gives the restrictive covenant undertaking) and the vendor company which sells the assets of the business. The main difference between example 2 and example 1 is that in example 2 the vendor of the business (the company) and the provider of the restrictive covenant (the owner) are different persons, whereas in example 1 they are the same person. Example 3: Owner sells company A vendor-shareholder sells the shares in a company which carries on a business to a purchasing shareholder. The vendor-shareholder gives a restrictive covenant undertaking to the purchasing shareholder and receives a payment in consideration. In terms of condition 2, the vendor-shareholder must agree not to provide goods and services in competition with those provided by the company. In terms of condition 3, the vendor-shareholder must not provide services to the company after its sale, other than services that are incidental to the sale and are temporary in nature. In terms of condition 4, it is the vendor-shareholder that would need to agree in writing with the purchasing shareholder that the transaction is a sale of a business. Example 4: Owner sells holding company A vendor-shareholder sells to a purchasing shareholder a holding company which owns a subsidiary which carries on a business. The vendor-shareholder gives a restrictive covenant undertaking to the purchasing shareholder and receives a payment in consideration. The same treatment would apply if there was a chain of wholly-owned companies interposed between the holding company whose shares are being sold by the vendor-shareholder and the subsidiary carrying on the relevant business. In terms of condition 2, the vendor-shareholder must agree not to provide goods or services in competition with those provided by the subsidiary company which carries on the business. In terms of condition 3, the vendor-shareholder must not provide services to the subsidiary after the sale of the holding company, other than services that are incidental to the sale and are temporary in nature. Example 5: Holding company sells subsidiary A holding company sells a subsidiary which carries on a business to a purchasing shareholder. The owner of the holding company gives a restrictive covenant undertaking to the purchasing shareholder and receives a payment in consideration. In terms of condition 1, the sale is conducted by an associated person (i.e. the holding company) of the person giving the restrictive covenant undertaking (the holding company owner). In terms of condition 4, it is the holding company that is required to agree in writing with the purchasing shareholder that the transaction is a sale of a business. The same treatment applies in relation to conditions 2 and 3 as in example 4. The main difference between example 5 and examples 3 and 4 is that in example 5 the vendor (the holding company) of the subsidiary and the provider of the restrictive covenant (the owner of the holding company) are different persons, whereas in examples 3 and 4 they are the same person. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 21 Incidental and temporary services exception in third condition The third condition that must be satisfied for the sale of business exclusion to apply is that the person who gives the restrictive undertaking must not provide any services to the purchaser after the sale of the business, other than services that are “incidental to the sale and are temporary in nature”. Inland Revenue considers that the exception in this condition applying to services that are incidental to the sale and are temporary in nature can include “earn-out” clauses in sale and purchase agreements, and other similar types of exit arrangements, whereby the vendor works in the business for a period of time to facilitate the transfer of the business to the new owners. An example could be the sale of an interest in a professional firm by a retiring partner who works out his or her term by working a decreasing number of hours for 12 months as clients are systematically handed over to a new partner. The reference to “incidental” in the exception relates to the transfer of the business to the new owners and does not restrict the quantum of services that can be provided during the transfer period. Therefore, substantial assistance can be provided by the vendor to the purchaser under the exception so long as it is provided in the context of facilitating the transfer of the business to the new owners. The length of the period during which services can be provided by the vendor, while still being regarded as “temporary in nature”, would be governed by the prevailing commercial circumstances surrounding a particular sale. In the example above involving the retiring partner in a professional firm, the 12-month period would qualify as being temporary in nature provided it was the standard practice in that profession for earn-out clauses to be of that period. The fact that the sale price for the business might be affected by the profit earned during the transition period and the vendor being a principal participant during the transition period should not be relevant to the issue of whether the incidental and temporary exception applies. In conclusion, Inland Revenue considers that the main factor to be taken into account in determining the application of the incidental and temporary exception in the third condition is whether the arrangement involving the vendor providing services after the sale can be regarded as facilitating the transfer of the business to the new owners. If the services can be so regarded then the exception should apply. Restrictive covenant anti-avoidance provision New section GC 14F is a specific anti-avoidance provision which is designed to buttress the restrictive covenant charging provision in section CHA 1. Under this specific anti-avoidance provision, if an arrangement has been entered into which has an effect of avoiding the application of section CHA 1, the Commissioner may treat an amount under the arrangement as an amount to which section CHA 1 applies. The Commissioner may also treat any person affected by the arrangement as the person liable under section CHA 1. This anti-avoidance provision is designed to address, in particular, the situation of an employee making a restrictive covenant agreement with a wholly-owned company, the shares in which the employee subsequently sells to his or her employer. This arrangement transforms a payment for a restrictive covenant into a payment for shares and the payment received by the employee from the sale of the shares may not be taxed under the other provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section GC 14F would ensure that an amount derived under such an arrangement is taxable under section CHA 1. The enactment of section GC 14F does not preclude the application of the general anti-avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994. Exit inducement payments New section CHA 2 is the specific charging provision for exit inducements. The provision taxes any amount derived by a person for a loss of a vocation, position or status, or for leaving a position. The charging provision focuses on payments for vacating a position. This is consistent with the nature of an exit inducement payment as compensation for giving something up in the course of starting a new position. It is not necessary for the provision to apply to inducements to take up a position because these are generally taxable as monetary remuneration to an employee or as business income to an independent contractor. Section CHA 2 applies to an exit inducement payment made to compensate the payee for leaving a position of employment. The provision is also broad enough to cover the situation where the position being vacated is not an employment one— for example, a position as an independent contractor or an office such as a board membership. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 22 The exit inducement cases of Vaughan-Neil 4 and Pritchard v Arundale 5 involved a barrister and a partner in a firm of chartered accountants respectively, both being positions where the payee was not an employee. The Fraser and Case U8 cases involved taxpayers leaving positions of employment. Section CHA 2 covers a situation like that in the Fraser case, where the emphasis in the judgments was that the taxpayer was being compensated for the loss of his career as a television presenter, as well as the traditional type of exit inducement case which involves a loss of status. 6 The provision also encompasses a situation like that in Case U8, which represents an extension to previous exit inducement cases. That situation did not involve a distinct change of career or loss of social status, but only a change of employment or position within the same industry. It is necessary, therefore, for the charging provision to include compensation for a simple loss of a particular contract of services or contract for services. The charging provision also includes an amount derived as consideration for simply leaving a position as it may be argued that in some cases there is no loss as such. The ordering of the words “vocation”, “position” and “status” in the charging provision helps to indicate its services-related nature and thus its scope. The reference to “amount” in section CHA 2 uses the definition of “amount” in section OB 1, which includes any amount in money’s worth. The charging provision is, therefore, sufficiently broad to cover in-kind consideration, not just monetary payments. The exit inducement charging provision does not apply to injury to feelings payments relating to employment disputes made under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 or section 88(l)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993. Deductibility of services-related payments New section DJ 20(1) ensures that restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments that are gross income of another person are deductible to the payer in the same circumstances as salary and wages and other payments for services. This deductibility provision, in conjunction with the charging provisions for restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments, provides for symmetry in the tax treatment of these payments. Section DJ 20(1) follows the model of providing express relief from the exclusion for capital expenditure, which is used in other places in the income tax legislation, such as section DJ 13. This means that, in order to be deductible, a payment will still need to have the connection with gross income required by the general deductibility rule in section BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii). Section DJ 20(1) does not constitute a code in relation to whether expenditure on restrictive covenants and exit inducements is expenditure of a capital nature. In particular, the general deductibility rules in section BD 2 are not excluded and still operate normally. New section DJ 20(2) ensures that the deductibility treatment of restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments is not concessionary in comparison with salary and wages. Salary and wages are non- deductible capital expenditure to the extent they relate to work of a capital nature undertaken by recipient employees, as in Christchurch Press Company Ltd. 7 If outright relief from the exclusion for capital expenditure were provided for restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments, these payments could never be characterised as capital expenditure, even when the work was of a capital nature. Employers could, therefore, prefer to make these payments instead of salary and wage payments if capital works were involved. To prevent such different treatment, section DJ 20(2) provides that the relief from the exclusion for capital expenditure does not apply to the extent that: •services are performed for the payer by the employee, office holder or independent contractor who derives the restrictive covenant or exit inducement amount, and •any expenditure would have been incurred in respect of those services but for the payment of the restrictive covenant or exit inducement amount, and •that expenditure would have been of a capital nature. The focus of section DJ 20(2) is not on the particular services whose performance is restricted under the restrictive covenant. Instead, the focus is on restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments being substituted for income from services in cases where expenditure on those services would have been of a capital nature because, for example, the services relate to capital works. The provision is anti-avoidance in nature. 4 Vaughan-Neil v Inland Revenue Commissioners (1979) STC 644. 5 Pritchard v Arundale (1971) 47 TC 680. 6 For example, Jarrold v Boustead (1964) 41 TC 701, Pritchard v Arundale and Vaughan-Neil v Inland Revenue Commissioners. In these cases, a consequence of the taxpayers changing their occupations was a loss of valued social status. 7 Christchurch Press Company Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 23 New section DJ 21 allows a deduction to employees who have been taxed on a restrictive covenant payment if they have to refund part or all of that payment because they do not comply with the terms of the restrictive covenant. The deduction allowed under section DJ 21 is limited to the lesser of the amount that is refunded and the amount that was taxed to the employee under the restrictive covenant charging provision. Also, no deduction is allowed for any payment in respect of punitive or exemplary damages, interest or the legal costs or other expenses of the person who paid the restrictive covenant amount to the employee claiming the deduction. The time for determining whether a person is an employee for the purpose of section DJ 21 is when the restrictive covenant payment is derived. Section DJ 21 overrides section BD 2(2)(c), which prohibits a deduction for expenditure incurred in deriving income from employment. New section EO 6 provides that the deduction under new section DJ 21 is allowed in the income year that the refund is paid (it is intended that this section will be renumbered as section EO 7). PAYE amendments The definition of “extra emolument” in section OB 1 has been amended to ensure that restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments made to employees are subject to withholding at source under the PAYE rules. This includes payments made to previous, current or prospective employees. Because of the inclusion of these payments in the definition of “extra emolument”, along with their consequent inclusion in the definition of “income from employment”, an employee recipient of a restrictive covenant or exit inducement payment is not allowed a deduction, except under section DJ 21, for any related expenditure (sections BD 2(2)(c) and DE 1). Timing of income and expenditure The ordinary tax accounting principles and provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 apply to determine the time at which services-related payments are included in gross income or allowed as a deduction. The particular tax accounting principles that apply to determine when a restrictive covenant or exit inducement payment is included in a recipient’s gross income depend on the type of taxpayer involved. In the case of cash method taxpayers, derivation of income is based on the actual receipt of income. 8 So if a payment for a restrictive covenant with a three- year term is paid to an employee as a lump sum in year one, the entire amount is derived, and therefore taxed, in that year of receipt. In the case of most taxpayers carrying on a business, the accrual or earnings method applies to determine when an amount is derived. This method is based on the right to receive income (an entitlement to bill) rather than actual receipt. 9 An up-front restrictive covenant payment received by an independent contractor could be spread over the term of the covenant. However, an exit inducement payment would be taxed completely in the year of receipt if the contractor is entitled to the whole payment at the start of the new contract. The ordinary statutory rules apply to determine the timing of deductibility of these services-related payments. In particular, section EF 1 effectively requires a deduction for expenditure to be spread over the term to which the expenditure relates. 10 For example, in respect of an up-front $30,000 payment made under a restrictive covenant agreement with a three-year term, the allowable deduction for each of the three years would be $10,000. In the case of exit inducement payments, payment is likely to be deducted in full in the year of payment. That is because section EF 1, which requires expenditure to be spread over the contract term, would not be applicable. 11 There is usually no enduring aspect to an exit inducement beyond the requirement that the payee start a service relationship. 9 Arthur Murray v Commissioner of Taxes (1965) 114 CIR 314. 10 Section BD 4 of the core provisions governs the timing of allowable deductions. Section BD 4(2) provides that if an allowable deduction is subject to a timing regime, the deduction must be allocated to an income year in accordance with that regime. “Timing regime” is defined in section OB 1 to include a regime for allocating allowable deductions to an income year other than the income year to which the allowable deduction would have been allocated in the absence of the regime. Thus, in the absence of a timing regime, a payment under a restrictive covenant agreement with a three-year term would be incurred in year one when the agreement is entered into and, therefore, would have been deductible in that year. However, the timing regime in section EF 1, relating to “accrual expenditure”, would require the expenditure on the restrictive covenant to be spread over its three-year term. “Accrual expenditure” is defined very broadly in section OB 1 to mean any expenditure that is allowed as a deduction other than expenditure covered by other specific timing regimes, such as the trading stock or accrual rules. Section EF 1(5)(d), applying to choses in action, would be used to determine the unexpired portion of any amount of accrual expenditure relating to restrictive covenants that would need to be added back into the recipient’s income, by reference to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the restrictive covenant is enforceable. This mechanism achieves the spread of income. 11 Once the payment is made there is generally no unexpired portion to be added back to income in future years in terms of section EF 1. 8 Bowcock v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1981) 5 NZTC 61,062. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 24 AMENDMENTS TO THE FRINGE BENEFIT TAX MULTI-RATE RULES the income year once the company’s profits for the year have been calculated. This can be up to 12 months after the end of the income year. Such amounts are taxable to the shareholder- employee in the same income year as the expenditure is deductible to the company. The same issue arises for amounts distributed in accordance with the attribution rule by a company or a trust in that such amounts will be calculated up to 12 months after the end of the income year. This amount will be taxed in the “employee’s” hands in the income year the income was derived by the interposed entity. Under the optional multi-rate FBT rules, employers will be required to determine an employee’s cash remuneration (including the remuneration of a shareholder-employee) for the year in which the fringe benefits were provided within two months of the end of the year (thus, by 31 May). This is to enable the employer to undertake the square-up calculation for attributed benefits. Information about an employee’s cash remuneration for the year is unlikely to be available within this timeframe if he or she has received “non-deduction salary and wages” or had an amount distributed under the attribution rule. •The need for an extension of the rule that allows subsidised transport benefits to be treated as non-attributed benefits to apply to all employers who provide such benefits. The provision as originally enacted was limited to employers who were not a close company. •The need to ensure that only interest and dividends from a major shareholder-employee’s employer or a related employer are required to be included in the cash remuneration. •The need to ensure that low-interest loans provided by life insurers to policyholders are not treated as attributed benefits. •The need to maintain consistency between the general FBT rules and the multi-rate FBT rules in how an associate of an employee is treated for FBT purposes. •The need to clarify that employers, in calculating the tax payable on the employee’s cash remuneration, take into account the full low-income rebate irrespective of the employee’s tax residency. Sections GC 15, ND 3, ND 4, ND 5, ND5A, ND 7 and ND 7A Introduction The fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules in subpart ND of the Income Tax Act 1994 have been amended by: •Introducing rules to deal with the situation of a shareholder-employee’s cash remuneration not being known for the year when the multi-rate calculation return is due. (This rule also applies to employees who receive income under the attribution rule.) •Including income distributed under the attribution rule in the definition of “remuneration” for the purposes of the multi- rate FBT rules. •Introducing an alternative, simplified method for calculating the FBT payable under the multi- rate rules. A number of remedial amendments have also been made. Background The multi-rate FBT rules were enacted as part of the Taxation (FBT, SSCWT and Remedial Matters) Act 2000. These rules generally allow employers to elect to pay FBT on benefits received by a particular employee (attributed benefits) at an FBT rate based on the remuneration paid (including the taxable value of those benefits) to that employee. These new rules apply for fringe benefits provided on or after 1 April 2000 and in the case of employers who file on an income year basis, the 2000–2001 income year. A number of remedial problems with these rules were identified after the Finance and Expenditure Committee reported the Taxation (FBT, SSCWT and Remedial Matters) Bill back to Parliament. These were: •The need for amounts distributed under the attribution rule (attributed income) as provided for in the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 to be included in the definition of “remuneration” for the purposes of the multi-rate FBT rules. •The need for rules for the calculation of a salary and wage paid to a shareholder-employee that is not subject to PAYE (“non-deduction salary and wages”) and attributed income to an “employee”. “Non-deduction salary and wages” are calculated and paid after the end of Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 25 •The need to ensure that the threshold for fringe benefits to which section CH 1(h) (benefits of any other kind) applies is $2,000 or more in total and not $2,000 or more per type of benefit. A submission received by the Finance and Expenditure Committee in relation to the Taxation (Beneficiary Income of Minors, Service-related payments and Remedial Matters) Bill suggested that an alternative method of calculating FBT under the multi-rate rules should be provided for whereby the FBT should be calculated as follows: •attributed benefits would be subject to a flat FBT rate of 63.93%, and •non-attributed benefits (pooled benefits) would either be subject to FBT at the rate of 49% or 64%, depending on whether a major shareholder-employee or associate was a recipient of the non-attributed benefits. Key features Attributed income The definition of “remuneration” in section ND 7(4) has been amended by including any amount of income distributed in accordance with the attribution rule (section GC 14 D). The amendment means that any attributed income will need to be included in the cash remuneration of an employee if the attributed income is attributed from that employee’s employer or a related employer. Multi-rate calculation for shareholder- employees and employees receiving attributed income A new section ND 5A has been introduced to deal with the problem of when an employer, a close company, does not have the details of the cash remuneration that will be paid to a shareholder- employee because the “non-deduction salary and wages” could not be determined at the time of the multi-rate calculation. This is the salary, wages or gross income to which section OB 2(2) applies. These provisions also apply in the case of an employee receiving attributed income from his or her employer, when it is a company or a trust. If cash remuneration information details are available to the employer at the time the employer furnishes an FBT return incorporating the multi-rate calculation, the employer must calculate their FBT liability on that basis, in the usual manner. In the year in which the fringe benefits are granted or provided, the employer has the choice of either paying FBT on the taxable value of the attributed benefits at the rate of 49% or at the rate of 63.93%. If the employer chooses to pay FBT at 49%, the employer is required to undertake a square-up calculation in the following year when the cash remuneration details are known. Alternatively, the employer can choose to make a final FBT payment at 63.93% and avoid the lagged square-up. Employers who choose to pay FBT at the rate of 49% are required, in the year following that in which the fringe benefits were provided or granted to such employees, to undertake as part of the multi-rate calculation for that subsequent year, a square-up as if those benefits had been provided in that year and the cash remuneration has been paid in that year. In other words, the multi-rate calculation using the cash remuneration of such employees is lagged one year. An example of how these rules work is set out at the end of this item. A new section ND 7A provides for the purposes of the multi-rate calculation in section ND 5 that the cash remuneration of such employees is treated as being the cash remuneration in the year following the year in which the amount was derived or attributed. In undertaking this multi-rate calculation for such employees, a new subsection ND 5(5) allows the employer to deduct from this calculation, the FBT payable at the rate of 49% on the value of attributed benefits. This deduction is made in the year in which the lagged multi-rate calculation is made, reflecting the FBT that has already been paid. Alternative multi-rate calculation Section ND 5 has been amended by inserting a new subsection (5) to provide an additional method of calculating an employer’s FBT liability under the multi- rate calculation. Under this method, an employer who is required to undertake the multi-rate calculation can elect to pay FBT at the rate of 63.93% on the taxable value of the attributed fringe benefits. This avoids the need to calculate the FBT payable for each employee on the basis of their cash remuneration and value of attributed benefits under the multi-rate calculation. For non-attributed benefits (pooled benefits), FBT will still be payable at either 49% or 64% depending on whether a major shareholder-employee is a recipient of the pooled benefits. Subsidised transport Section ND 4 allows an employer to elect to treat subsidised transport benefits with a taxable value of $1,000 or more as non-attributed benefits, provided all employees have the same or similar entitlement to that benefit. The section has been amended so that this option is available to all employers, including close companies, which were previously excluded. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 26 Major shareholder-employee’s cash remuneration Section ND 7(2), which deals with the cash remuneration of a major shareholder-employee, has been amended to clarify when interest and dividends should be included. It is only the interest and dividends paid by the employer concerned that are required to be included. Furthermore, interest and dividends of a related employer are required to be included only if that related employer pays remuneration such as salary or wages to the major shareholder-employee. Low-interest loans provided by life insurers to policyholders Section ND 3 has been amended by inserting a subsection (1A) to ensure that low-interest loans provided by a life insurer to policyholders or associates of policyholders are a low-interest loan that is not required to be attributed. Such low-interest loans are treated as non-attributed benefits. Associated persons rules Section GC 15 has been amended by adding a new subsection (4), which provides, for the purposes of the multi-rate calculation, that subsection (3) of that section does not apply. This means that, in all cases, fringe benefits received by an associate of an employee are deemed to have been received by the employee, and therefore the employee’s cash remuneration is used to calculate the FBT payable on such benefits. Section GC 15(3) deemed the associated persons to be an employee in his or her own right. Calculation of tax payable on cash remuneration Section ND 5(2) has been amended to ensure that in calculating the tax payable on a major shareholder- employee’s cash remuneration, as part of the multi-rate calculation, the low-income rebate is calculated as if the employee were resident in New Zealand for the full income year. This prevents the employer from having to determine whether an employee is entitled to the full low income rebate for the year based on the employee’s tax residency. A similar amendment should have been made to section ND 5(1) but was overlooked. Officials propose to report to the Government seeking that a similar amendment be included in the next available tax bill, to ensure that this requirement applies for the purposes of section ND 5(1). It is proposed that this amendment apply from the start of the FBT multi-rate rules. Category (h) benefits Section ND 3 has been amended to ensure that the threshold for fringe benefits to which section CI 1(h) (fringe benefits of any other kind) applies is $2,000 or more in total and not $2,000 or more per type of benefit. This means if the total value of all category (h) benefits provided or granted to an employee is $2,000 or more, those benefits will be treated as attributed benefits. Application date The amendments relating to the multi-rate calculation for shareholder-employees and employees receiving attributed income apply to fringe benefits provided or granted by an employer on or after 1 April 2000 for an employer who pays FBT on a quarterly or annual basis. This coincides with the start date of the multi- rate FBT rules. All the other amendments apply to fringe benefits provided or granted by an employer on or after 1 April 2000 for an employer who pays FBT on a quarterly or annual basis, and for an employer who pays FBT on an income year basis from the start of the 2000–2001 income year. This coincides with the start date of the multi-rate FBT rules. The amendment relating to the alternative method for calculating FBT payable under the multi-rate rules applies to fringe benefits provided or granted by employers on or after 1 April 2001 for those who pay FBT on a quarterly or annual basis. This amendment applies to employers who pay FBT on an income year basis from the start of the 2001–2002 income year. Example of the multi-rate calculation for shareholder- employees and employees receiving attributed income A shareholder-employee is provided with a motor vehicle for private use. The annual taxable value of that benefit is $10,000. The employer has other employees who are provided fringe benefits and files on a quarterly basis. To keep the example simple, it deals only with the shareholder-employee. In the 2000–2001 year, the employer pays FBT on that benefit as follows: QuarterTaxable valueFBT rateFBT payable Quarter 1$2,50064%$1,600 Quarter 2$2,50064%$1,600 Quarter 3$2,50049%$1,225 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 27 At the time of filing the company’s FBT return for the final quarter for the 2000–2001 year, the cash remuneration payable to the shareholder-employee has not been determined as the company’s financial accounts have not been finalised. The employer chooses to pay FBT at the rate of 49% and undertake the lagged square-up the following year. The multi-rate calculation for the value of this attributed benefit in the year in which the benefit is granted or provided is: Taxable value of attributedFBT tax rateFBT payableless FBT payableFBT payable benefitin Quarters 1–3 $10,00049%$4,900$4,425$475 Cash remuneration of the shareholder-employee for the 2000–2001 year$55,000.00 Value of attributed benefits provided to the shareholder-employee for the 2000–2001 year$10,000.00 FBT payable using the multi-rate calculation$5,900.50 Less FBT payable on that attributed benefit in 2000–2001 year$4,900.00 (49% of the taxable value of the attributed benefits) FBT payable as part of the multi-rate calculation due 31 May 2002$1,000.50 This amount of $475 is included in the FBT return for the final quarter (the return for all employees) and is payable by 31 May 2001. As the employer chose to undertake the lagged square-up the following calculation is required to be made in final quarterly return for the 2001–2002 year. The employer will require the following information to undertake this calculation – the value of the attributed benefits provided to the shareholder-employee in the 2000–2001 year and the amount of cash remuneration paid for that year: This amount of $1,000.50 is included in the FBT return for the final quarter of the 2001–2002 year and is due on 31 May 2002. No use-of-money interest applies in respect of this deferral. If the employer chose to pay FBT at the rate of 63.93% on the value of the attributed benefits in the year in which the benefits were granted or provided, the employer would have paid FBT of $6,393 compared with $5,900.50 using the lagged square-up process. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 28 TAXING BENEFICIARY INCOME OF MINORS AT 33% – THE “MINOR BENEFICIARY RULE” A “minor” is defined as a New Zealand resident who is under the age of 16 years on the balance date of the trust. In a related change, for the purposes of sub-part HH of the Income Tax Act 1994, multiple settlements made on the same terms may be treated by the trustee as one trust. Exceptions The minor beneficiary rule does not apply if: •the minor is in receipt of a child disability allowance under the Social Security Act 1964, or •the beneficiary income is derived directly from a group investment fund or from the Maori trustee or a Maori authority, or •the beneficiary income distributed to each minor from the trust is $1,000 or less in an income year. Application of the minor beneficiary rule and further exceptions for specific settlements The minor beneficiary rule applies to all beneficiary income distributed to a minor from a trust unless excepted above or unless all of the settlements on that trust were made: •by a person who is neither a relative or legal guardian of the minor nor a person associated with a relative or legal guardian, or •by a relative, legal guardian or associated person as an agent of the minor if that settlor has received the property from someone other than a relative, guardian or associated person, or •by a relative, legal guardian or associated person if that settlor is required by a court order to pay damages or compensation to the minor, or •by a relative, legal guardian or associated person against whom a protection order has been made under section 14 of the Domestic Violence Act 1995. This exception only applies if the minor is a protected person in relation to the protection order and the settlement on the trust is made before the protection order is made or during the time the protection order is in force, or Sections HH 1A, HH 3A, HH 3B, HH 3C, HH 3D, HH 3E, HH 3F, LB 1, LB 1A, OB 1 and OD 7 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Introduction The minor beneficiary rule is intended to limit the ability of some families to pay considerably less tax than other families on similar incomes by meeting expenses of the children through the use of a trust. It ensures that certain distributions of beneficiary income to a child under the age of 16 years will be taxed at the trustee rate of 33%. Background In the 2000 Budget, the Government announced that it would introduce legislation to require distributions of beneficiary income to minors to be taxed at a rate of 33%, to prevent families with a trust from being able to gain a tax advantage over families without a trust. By arranging for a trust to derive income and distributing that income to children, families were able to meet expenses of the children from income taxed at the marginal tax rates of the children, instead of meeting those expenses from their own after-tax income. An issues paper outlining the proposal in more detail and seeking public submissions was issued in June 2000. Following consideration of submissions and extensive consultation with the private sector, a number of changes were incorporated in the legislation that was introduced in October. In particular, the definition of a “minor” was changed from under the age of 18 to under the age of 16, and rather than applying the 39% tax rate when the total income (including beneficiary income) of the minor exceeded $60,000, as proposed in the issues paper, minor beneficiary income would be taxed at a final tax rate of 33%. Following submissions on the Bill, the Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended a number of changes to the legislation. In particular, the committee recommended that the minimum beneficiary income threshold be raised from $200 to $1,000, and that the rule apply to all income from mixed trusts unless the settlements that are covered by the rule are of a relatively small value. Key features Distributions of beneficiary income to which the minor beneficiary rule applies will be treated as trustee income for tax rate, tax payment and tax return purposes. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 29 •under the terms of a will, codicil or intestacy if the minor is alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death, or the minor has a brother or sister, half-brother or half-sister who is alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death. The definition of “settlement” is limited, for the purposes of this rule, so that: •A loan for less than market value will constitute a settlement only if the loan is in existence on or after 1 April 2002. •Financial assistance to a trust in the form of a guarantee for less than market value will not constitute a settlement unless and until the guarantee has been called upon. •The provision of services which are incidental to the operation of the trust, such as bookkeeping or accounting services, or those provided in being a trustee will not constitute a settlement. The definition of “settlement” has also been clarified in relation to low-interest loans. A loan will be provided for less than market value if the interest rate on the amount borrowed is, at any time during the income year, less than the interest rate set out in the Income Tax (FBT, Interest on Loans) Regulations on 31 March of the previous income year. Mixed trusts If a trust includes both settlements which do fit within any of the exceptions above and settlements which do not fit within any of the exceptions (“tainted settlements”) it is referred to as a “mixed” trust. The minor beneficiary rule will apply to all beneficiary income distributed to the minor by a mixed trust unless all tainted settlements on the trust were either: •dispositions of property the total value of which, at the date of settlement, does not exceed $5,000, or •the provision of financial assistance to the trust in the form of loans for less than market value and the underlying value of the loans themselves does not exceed $1,000 in total at any time during the income year. However, if a relative, guardian or their associate has provided services to the mixed trust, all minor beneficiary income from that trust is subject to the minor beneficiary rule, and this mixed trust relief rule does not apply. In this context, services do not include the provision of services which are incidental to the operation of the trust, such as bookkeeping or accounting services, or those provided in being a trustee. Application date The minor beneficiary rule applies to beneficiary income derived in relation to the 2001–2002 and subsequent income years. Income earned by the trustee of a trust in an income year becomes beneficiary income if it vests absolutely in the beneficiary in that income year or is paid or applied to the beneficiary within six months of the income year. Beneficiary income is derived in the same income year as it was earned by the trust. For example, a trust with a 31 March balance date can pay or apply income of the 2000–2001 income year up to 30 September 2001, for that trust’s income to be treated as beneficiary income. If this occurs, the beneficiary is taxed in the 2000–2001 income year and not in the 2001–2002 income year, though this is the year in which the beneficiary actually receives the income. Therefore the minor beneficiary rule will not apply to this income. Detailed analysis Multiple settlements may be treated as one trust for tax purposes – section HH 1A In law, each settlement is the creation of a separate trust. However, in practice two or more settlements which are covered by the same trust deed with the same trustees are often managed as one trust with one tax return filed. This disparity between the law and practice has been highlighted by the minor beneficiary rule, with its focus on the nature of different settlements. Consequently, the new section HH 1A specifically allows for this practice by providing that for the purposes of sub-part HH of the Income Tax Act 1994, the trustees may choose to treat multiple settlements made on the same terms as one trust. Operational Provisions – section HH 3A Beneficiary income of a minor taxed as if it was trustee income Section HH 3A(1)(a) provides that if a minor derives beneficiary income from a trust the trustee must pay income tax on that beneficiary income as if it were trustee income. Consequently, as with all other trustee income, minor beneficiary income will be: •taxed at the trustee rate of 33% •included in the trustee’s provisional tax calculations along with other trustee income, and Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 30 •subject to the usual rules, use of money interest will be payable by the trustee on any underpayment and will be payable by the Commissioner on any overpayment of provisional tax. There are no special transitional rules for provisional tax payments in the 2001–2002 income year. Beneficiary income of a minor not gross income of the minor Section HH 3A(1)(b) provides that the beneficiary income subject to the minor beneficiary rule is not gross income of the minor. This ensures that the minor is not required to include the income in his or her return. Accounting treatment Section HH 3A(2) is intended to clarify that although the income is taxed as beneficiary income, for the purposes of debiting and crediting a beneficiary’s account within a trust, a trustee may continue to treat income tax paid by the trustee as paid on behalf of the beneficiary. Exemption for beneficiary income of $1,000 or less – section HH 3B Section HH 3B provides that if the amount of beneficiary income derived by a minor from the trust in an income year is $1,000 or less, the minor beneficiary rule does not apply to that income. If income is over $1,000 all of the beneficiary income will be subject to the rule. Application of the minor beneficiary rule – sections HH 3C and HH 3D Sources of beneficiary income – section HH 3C Section HH 3C ensures that the minor beneficiary rule applies to all beneficiary income of a minor from a trust unless all of the settlements on that trust fit within any of the exceptions specified in paragraphs (a)–(e). These exceptions are for settlements which were made: (a)By a person who is neither a relative or legal guardian of the minor nor a person associated with the relative or legal guardian; or This exception limits the application of the minor beneficiary rule to those trusts on which a settlement has been made by a relative or legal guardian of the minor or their associate. This ensures that the rule only applies in those situations where families can potentially gain a tax advantage. (b)By a relative, legal guardian or associated person as an agent of the minor if that settlor has received the property from someone other than a relative, guardian or associated person; or This exception would apply for example, if ACC compensation is paid on behalf of a disabled child to the child’s caregiver, who places that money on trust for the trust. (c)By a relative, legal guardian or associated person if that settlor is required by a court order to pay damages or compensation to the minor; or (d)By a relative, legal guardian or associated person against whom a protection order has been made under section 14 of the Domestic Violence Act 1995. This exception applies only if the minor is a protected person in relation to the protection order and the settlement on the trust is made before the protection order is made or during the time the protection order is in force; If the protection order is subsequently lifted, those settlements remain subject to the exception. However, any subsequent settlements made after a protection order has been removed will not be subject to the exception. If a settlement is made on the trust jointly by two persons, for example by both parents, and a protection order is in force against only one of the settlors, the exception will also apply. (e)According to a will, codicil, intestacy or a court variation thereof, if: -the minor is alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death; or -the minor has a brother or sister, half- brother or half-sister who is alive within 12 months of the date of the settlor’s death. Beneficiary income derived from a testamentary trust will not be subject to the minor beneficiary rule if the minor, or their brother or sister (or half-brother or half-sister) is alive within 12 months of the settlor’s death. As discussed below, the definition of “settlement” has been limited for the purposes of this section and section HH 3D. Mixed Trusts – section HH 3D If all settlements on a trust fit within any of the exceptions in section HH 3C, the minor beneficiary rule does not apply. On the other hand, if none of the settlements fit within any of the exceptions, the minor beneficiary rule clearly does apply. However, limited special rules are provided to deal with trusts when settlements which do fit within the exceptions are managed as one trust along with settlements which do not fit within any of the exceptions (“tainted settlements”). This is referred to as a mixed trust. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 31 All income distributed to a minor from a mixed trust will be subject to the minor beneficiary rule, unless the tainted settlements are of a relatively small value. Section HH 3D(1) provides that if a trust includes both tainted settlements and settlements which do fit within one of the exceptions above, the minor beneficiary rule will apply to all beneficiary income distributed by the mixed trust to the minor unless paragraphs (a)–(c) are satisfied: (a)All tainted settlements on the trust are settlements of the type referred to in paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of settlor or paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of settlor. The definition of “settlement” in section OB 1 is defined by reference to the definition of “settlor”. Paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of settlor provides that a person will be a settlor if they make dispositions of property to the trust for less than market value. Paragraph (b)(ii) provides that a person will be a settlor if they make any property available to a trust for less than market value, including the provision of financial assistance whether by way of a loan, guarantee, the provision of security or otherwise. (b)The total value of the dispositions of property does not exceed $5,000 at the end of the trust’s income year. Section HH 3D(2) provides that the value of these settlements is their value at the date of their settlement. This avoids valuation difficulties arising if a tainted settled asset has later become mingled with an untainted asset, or if the value of the asset fluctuates from year to year. (c)The underlying value of the loans themselves does not exceed $1,000 in total at any time during the income year. This ensures that the provision of a small, short-term loan will not by itself result in the minor beneficiary rule applying to all income from the mixed trust. Small, short-term loans can arise, for example, when a relative purchases a small item for use in the activities carried on by the trust and is not reimbursed by the trust until some time later. The $1,000 limit applies to the value of the loan itself, not to the value of the low-interest element of the loan. Consequently, this will not give rise to complex valuation issues. If a relative, guardian or their associate has provided services to a trust, however, section HH 3D(3) provides that the mixed trust rules in section HH 3D(1) will not apply to offer relief from the application of the minor beneficiary rule. This means that the minor beneficiary rule will apply to all income from that mixed trust, unless the amount of beneficiary income is less than $1,000 in an income year. This applies whether the services are paid for or not, but only if the services are significant. Section HH 3D(4) provides that, for the purposes of section HH 3D(3), “services” do not include those that are incidental to the operation of the trust, such as bookkeeping or accounting services or which are provided in being a trustee. Exceptions from the minor beneficiary rule – section HH 3E The minor beneficiary rule does not apply if: (a)the minor is in receipt of a child disability allowance under the Social Security Act 1964, or (b)the beneficiary income is from the Maori trustee or a Maori authority or is derived directly from a group investment fund. This ensures that distributions of beneficiary income directly from a group investment fund to a minor will not be subject to the rule, but the rule will still apply if a family trust invests in a group investment fund and the income earned by the trust from the fund is subsequently distributed to a minor beneficiary. The taxation of beneficiary income distributed from the Maori trustee or a Maori authority to a minor is excluded from the minor beneficiary rule pending completion of the Government review of the taxation of Maori authorities. The Definitions – sections HH 3F, OB 1 and OD 7 Definition of “guardian” Section HH 3F(1) provides that, for the purposes of sections HH 3C and HH 3D, “guardian” has the corresponding meaning to the definition of “guardianship” in section 3 of the Guardianship Act 1968. Broadly, section 3 defines guardianship as the custody of a child and the right of control over the upbringing of a child. Under a number of pieces of legislation, however, the chief executive of a government department or the court itself, for example, may be appointed guardian. It is not intended that the rule should apply to such guardians. Therefore a person or body will not be a guardian for the purposes of this rule when: •the court (which has declared a child to be in need of care and protection) has appointed the chief executive, an iwi social service, a cultural social service, or the director of a child and family support service to be a guardian of that child under section 110(1)(a)–(d) of the Children, Young Persons, and their Families Act 1989 •the court has been appointed guardian of the child under section 10B of the Guardianship Act 1968 Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 32 •the Public Trustee has been appointed guardian of an infant by an order of the court under section 53 of the Public Trust Office Act 1957, and •a chief executive has been appointed guardian of the child under section 7(4) of the Adoption Act 1955. Definition of a “minor” Section HH 3F(2) defines a “minor” as a natural person who is a New Zealand resident, and who is under the age of 16 on the balance date of the trust making the distribution of beneficiary income. If the minor was under the age of 16 throughout the trust’s income year, the rule will apply to all income derived in that year. If the minor turned 16 in that income year, the rule will not apply to any income derived in that income year. Definition of a “relative” “Relative” is defined in section HH 3F(3), for the purposes of the minor beneficiary rule, as two persons connected by blood relationship, marriage or adoption. This includes the trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit. Persons are connected by blood relationship if within the fourth degree of relationship. Persons are connected by marriage if: •one person is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship, adoption or guardianship to the other, or •one person is in a relationship in the nature of marriage to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship, adoption or guardianship to the other. Thus, a person who makes a settlement on a trust will be a relative if they are either married to or in a relationship in the nature of marriage with, a person who is connected to the minor by blood relationship, adoption or guardianship. A settlor will also be a relative if they have either adopted the minor as their child, or the minor is the adopted child of a person who is a relative of the settlor within three degrees of relationship. Persons are connected by guardianship if one is a guardian of the other. The definition of “settlor” A number of amendments have been made to the definition of settlor in section OB 1 specifically for the purposes of this rule. These amendments particularly relate to the term “settlement”, used in sections HH 3C and HH 3D. The definition now defines when a loan is provided for less than market value. It is for less than market value if the interest rate on the amount borrowed is at any time during the income year less than the interest rate set out in the Income Tax (FBT, Interest on Loans) Regulations on 31 March of the previous income year. The provision of financial assistance to a trust in the form of a loan for less than market value will only constitute a settlement for the purposes of the minor beneficiary rule if the loan is in existence on or after 1 April 2002. This avoids trustees having to place a value on loans that may have been provided many years ago. Trusts are provided with a period of one year following the application date of the rule to restructure the trust to ensure that no loans are provided to the trust for less than market value; Financial assistance to a trust in the form of a guarantee for less than market value will not constitute a settlement to which this rule applies until the guarantee has been called upon. Once the guarantee has been called upon, it becomes a settlement on the trust in the form of a disposition of property. The provision of services which are incidental to the operation of the trust, such as bookkeeping or accounting services or those provided in being a trustee, will not constitute a settlement for this rule. Imputation credits – section LB 1 and LB 1A Section LB 1(1)(ab) ensures that when a distribution of beneficiary income to a minor is in the form of a dividend, the imputation credits which attach to the dividend continue to be calculated under section LB 1(3), as if the minor beneficiary rule did not apply. Section LB 1A ensures that the trustee, who is taxed on this beneficiary income, is allocated the imputation credits, not the beneficiary. Children’s bank accounts Whether a bank account will constitute a trust, and therefore come within the scope of the minor beneficiary rule, is dependent on the particular arrangement which exists. The common law of trusts contains a number of well-established, essential elements that must be met in order for a trust to exist, including the division of legal and beneficial ownership of the trust property between the trustee and the beneficiary. For this division of legal and beneficial ownership to exist in respect of a bank account, as a minimum requirement the account would have to be in the name of a parent. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 33 Arrangements involving bank accounts may fall into the following general categories: 1)A parent opens a bank account in the parent’s own name, using funds that are the property of the child; the parent has signing authority over that account; and the parent either deposits additional funds from time to time and/or withdraws amounts periodically for the benefit of the child. This arrangement would constitute a “trust” on the basis that there is a separation of legal and beneficial ownership, with the parent holding legal title, and the child holding the beneficial interest. 2)An account is opened or operated in the name of the child, but the parent possesses signing authority either alone or together with the child. No express trust exists in this situation as both legal and beneficial ownership of the proceeds of the account are exclusively held by the child. 3)An account is opened or operated in the child’s name, only the child has signing authority and the child makes withdrawals from the account. Again, there is no separation of legal and beneficial ownership of the property. In the majority of situations involving a bank account, it is unlikely that there will be any such division of ownership. Rather, the income will be earned directly by the child, in which case the minor beneficiary rule will not apply. The number of bank accounts to which the rule is likely to apply is further limited by the fact that the minimum level of income threshold in section HH 3B ensures that the rule will apply only if the amount of income from a child’s bank account in an income year is more than $1,000 in an income year. Examples of the application of the minor beneficiary rule Example 1 Two settlements on the trust: –a settlement by the grandmother of the child under the terms of the grandmother’s will. The minor is alive at the time of grandmother’s death. Therefore the settlement fits within the exception in paragraph (e) of section HH 3C. –a settlement by the godparent of the child, who is not a relative or guardian of the child nor an associate of a relative or guardian. The exception in paragraph (a) applies. All settlements on the trust fit within the exceptions. Section HH 3C is therefore satisfied, and consequently the minor beneficiary rule does not apply to any beneficiary income distributed by the trustees to the minor. Example 2 Two settlements on the trust: –a settlement of $5,000 by the parent of minor, thus it is a tainted settlement. –parent also provides a low-interest loan of $800 to the trust, which is still in existence after 1 April 2002. The interest forgone on this loan is a settlement within paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of “settlor”. None of the exceptions apply, so it is a tainted settlement. None of the settlements on the trust fit within the exceptions, so this is not a mixed trust, and section HH 3D will not apply. The effect of section HH 3C, therefore, is that the minor beneficiary rule applies to all income distributed from this trust. Example 3 Three settlements on the trust: –a settlement by the grandmother of the child under the terms of the grandmother’s will. The minor is alive at the time of the grandmother’s death. Therefore the settlement fits within exception in paragraph (e) of section HH 3C. –two settlements of money made by the parents of the minor, of $5,000 each settlement. These settlements do not fit within any of the exceptions in section HH 3C. One of the settlements fits within the exceptions in section HH 3C and the other two settlements do not (“tainted settlements”). This is a mixed trust. Therefore, the minor beneficiary rule applies unless paragraph (a)–(c) of section HH 3D(1) are satisfied. The two tainted settlements each satisfy paragraph (a) of section HH 3D(1) as they are settlements of the type in paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of settlor, being dispositions of property. However, paragraph (b) of section HH 3D(1) is not satisfied because the total value of these settlements at their date of settlement is $10,000. Consequently, section HH 3D(1) is not satisfied, and the minor beneficiary rule applies to all income distributed to a minor from this trust. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 34 Example 4 Two settlements on the trust: –an initial settlement of $100 by the parent of the child. None of the exceptions apply (“tainted settlement”). –a settlement is also made on the trust by the grandmother of the child under the terms of her will. The minor is alive at the time of the grandmother’s death. Therefore the settlement fits within exception in paragraph (e) of section HH 3C. The parent is also a full-time employee of the trust and is paid a market value salary. Because it is for market value, this provision of services is not a settlement. Because there are two settlements on the trust, one of which is a tainted settlement, the other within an exception, this is a mixed trust. Therefore the minor beneficiary rule applies to all income from this trust unless the requirements of section HH 3D are met. Paragraphs (a)–(c) of section HH 3D(1) are satisfied because the only tainted settlement is a disposition of property, and its value at the date of settlement is less than $5,000. However, the effect of section HH 3D(3) is that HH 3D does not apply because services (other than incidental services) have been provided to the trust by a relative. As a result, the minor beneficiary rule applies to all beneficiary income of a minor from that trust. Example 5 Three settlements on the trust: –a parent has provided two low-interest loans to the trust which have a value of $2,000 and $5,000 respectively. These loans are both in existence on 1 April 2002 and the interest forgone on these loans constitutes a settlement. These settlement do not fit within any of the exceptions, so they are both tainted. –settlement by the grandmother of the child under the terms of the grandmother’s will. The minor is alive at the time of the grandmother’s death. Therefore the settlement fits within the exception in paragraph (e) of section HH 3C. The parent has previously provided another low- interest loan of $1,000 to the trust. This loan is no longer in existence on 1 April 2002, so there is no settlement in terms of section OB 1 for the purposes of the minor beneficiary rule. This is a mixed trust. The minor beneficiary rule applies to all income from this trust unless the requirements of section HH 3D are met. Paragraph (a) of section HH 3D(1) is met because all tainted dispositions are the provision of financial assistance by way of loan for less than market value. Paragraph (b) is met because there are no dispositions of property. Paragraph (c), however, is not met. The underlying value of the low-interest loans provided by a relative to the trust is in total greater than $5,000. Consequently, section HH 3D(1) is not satisfied, and the minor beneficiary rule applies to all income distributed to a minor from this trust. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 35 DISTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE TREATY OF WAITANGI FISHERIES COMMISSION – SECTION 19 Introduction The amendment treats the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission as being “in the course of termination” for tax purposes when the Commission allocates the fisheries settlement assets to iwi. The purpose of this amendment is to remove the potential for these distributions to be subject to double taxation under the Maori authority rules. Background The role of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission is to administer the fisheries assets that were returned to iwi by the Crown, and to arrange for their eventual allocation to iwi. The Commission is treated as a Maori authority for tax purposes. The potential for double taxation of Maori authority income under Maori authority rules is a known problem. Double taxation arises because any income that a Maori authority retains for more than four years is subject to tax at the rate of 25%, and when that income is ultimately distributed it would almost always be subject to tax again in the hands of the recipient. The problem of double taxation was inevitable for the Commission because it has been prevented from distributing the fisheries assets until an agreed allocation model for determining how they should be distributed among iwi has been finalised. Under the current Maori authority rules, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can determine to the extent that distributions made “in the course of termination of a Maori authority” are sourced from income that has previously been taxed to the Commission. Such distributions are not treated as taxable distributions under the Maori authority rules. This discretion ensures that Maori authority income is not subject to double taxation when a Maori authority is “in the course of termination”. Treating the Commission as being in the course of termination (in line with this provision) would ensure that distributions that have been previously taxed would not be distributions under the Maori authority rules. Key features New section HH IA is added to treat the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission as being “in the course of termination”, on or after the date on which the Commission allocates the settlement assets to iwi, for the purposes of section HI 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The effect of this provision is to ensure that distributions made from tax-paid income will not be a distribution under the Maori authority rules. Application date The amendment applies to the 2001–2002 and subsequent income years. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 36 DEFINITION OF “QUALIFYING PERSON” FOR FAMILY ASSISTANCE Sections KD 3(1), KD 3B, and OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994; sections 374A and 374E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The amendments will ensure that families who were once in New Zealand for a 12-month period and are currently resident overseas cannot claim family assistance whilst non-resident. Background The current family assistance legislation provides that a qualifying person, amongst other criteria, is a person who has either been both resident and present in New Zealand for a continuous period of 12 months at any time, or is the principal caregiver of a dependent child who is both resident and present in New Zealand. This has potentially enabled families who were once resident in New Zealand for a 12-month period and who are permanently resident overseas to claim full family assistance whilst overseas. Key features The definition of “qualifying person” in sections OB 1 and KD 3 are amended and a new section KD 3B is inserted to require that the family be tax-resident here at the time they claim the credits. This means that a family must be resident in New Zealand for tax purposes and therefore it will not preclude armed service personnel who are overseas or those on voluntary service abroad or overseas business from claiming the family assistance credits if they are resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. Similar amendments are made to sections 374A and 374E(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Application date To ensure overseas families cannot retrospectively seek a refund, the amendment has been backdated to apply from the 1992–1993 income year, being the earliest date for which a family can seek a refund. However, a savings provision will ensure that this amendment will not affect claims made on or before 16 October 2000 (date of introduction of the Bill). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 37 INTERNATIONAL TAX – REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Key features •New sections LB 1(4A) and 4B of the Income Tax Act 1994 ensure that imputation credits are correctly allocated between resident and non-resident partners by recognising the effect of supplementary dividends paid under the foreign investor tax credit rules. •Sections NG 9(1) and OB 1 have been amended to ensure that the 15% rate of NRWT applies to fully conduit tax relief credited non-cash dividends. New section NG 9(1A) confirms that the NRWT required to be paid on the dividend is treated as part of the dividend when determining the extent to which a dividend is fully conduit tax relief credited and for credit allocation purposes. •Section OE 8(1) has been amended to treat conduit tax relief holding companies as non-resident companies for section OE 7(1)(b) purposes. Application date The correction to section OE 8(1) applies retrospectively from 1 October 1997, the date of the inception of the conduit rules. The other amendments apply from the date of Royal assent, 27 March 2001. Sections LB 1(4A) to (4B), NG 9(1), OB 1, and OE 8(1) Introduction Clarifying amendments have been made to the international tax rules to correctly allocate imputation credits between resident and non-resident partners when shares are owned by a partnership, as well as ensure that the correct rate of non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) is deducted from conduit tax relief credited non-cash dividends. Additionally the amendments ensure conduit tax relief arises when a non-resident holds an interest in a New Zealand company through a wholly owned chain of holding companies. Background The following aspects of the international tax rules had been identified when the law was not consistent with its underlying policy intent. •The formula in section LB 1(4) allocates imputation credits between partners when shares are owned by a partnership. The formula, however, only allocated credits correctly if all the partners were either resident or non-resident. This was because the formula did not adequately deal with the effect of supplementary dividends paid under the foreign investor tax credit rules when there was a mixture of resident and non-resident partners. •Dividends with full conduit tax relief credits are subject to NRWT at a rate of 15%. However, the rules in section NG 9 for determining the amount of NRWT to be deducted in respect of non-cash dividends did not previously reflect this rate. •The conduit tax relief rules relieve a company from New Zealand tax on certain foreign income to the extent that it is derived on behalf of non-resident shareholders. When the rules were introduced, New Zealand holding companies wholly owned by a non-resident were allowed to be treated as non-resident shareholders, to allow the companies they invest in to receive conduit tax relief. It was intended that relief would also be allowed when a non-resident holds an interest in a company through a wholly owned chain of companies. Previous legislation did not, however, achieve this effect. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 38 REQUIREMENT ON COMPANIES TO ADOPT MINIMUM 33% WITHHOLDING TAX RATE •A new section NF 2C provides that those with an entitlement to receive interest as at 31 March 2001 have until 31 May 2001 to notify their company status. Interest payers have one month after the date on which the notice is received to apply that notice. However, provision is made for the interest payer to apply a 33% or 39% withholding rate any time from receipt of the notice. This provision is intended to provide a transitional period during which interest payers can process notifications. •The new section NF 2D provides that a company entitled to receive interest payments may elect the 33% and 39% withholding rates. A non-declaration rate of 39% applies to those companies that have not provided a tax file number. The election rules mirror those applying currently, although the 19.5% RWT rate option is excluded. •Companies that are trustees are not required to notify their company status and may continue to use the 19.5% rate. This reflects the obligation on trustees to have regard to the tax position of the trust’s beneficiaries. Application date This measure applies from 1 April 2001. Sections NF 2B, NF 2C, and NF 2D Introduction Companies will no longer be able to elect the 19.5% resident withholding tax (RWT) rate. The change will remove the timing advantage gained by companies that choose this rate, rather than a 33% withholding rate matching the corporate tax rate, before making good the discrepancy by way of provisional or terminal tax. It does not apply to companies that are trustees. Background The Income Tax Act 1994 allows a person receiving an interest payment to elect, in the manner prescribed by the interest payer, to make that payment subject to withholding tax at 19.5%, 33% or 39%. The 2000 Budget included an announcement that the Government would legislate to remove the ability of companies to adopt the 19.5% RWT rate. Choosing this rate gave companies a short-term timing advantage before they make good the discrepancy by paying provisional or terminal tax. Key features •A new section NF 2B is inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994 to require companies that begin receiving interest on or after 1 April 2001 to notify the interest payer that they are a company. This notification must be made on becoming entitled to receive interest. •Interest payers must deduct RWT at the appropriate rate on or after receiving a notice. The appropriate rate is dependent on the election made by the company and whether it has provided a tax file number. •The current treatment continues to apply until a company notifies interest payers of its status. To minimise compliance costs, the onus of notification lies on the company receiving the interest to determine its status, not the interest payer. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 39 EARNINGS-RELATED COMPENSATION AND DEFINITIONS OF EMPLOYEE, EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYMENT Section OB 1 Introduction The definitions of “employee”, “employer” and “employment” are amended to ensure that the Accident Compensation Corporation is not treated as an employer for the purposes of the fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules in respect of earnings-related compensation it pays. Background For the purposes of the FBT rules, a person is an employer if that person pays a source deduction payment to another person and is therefore liable to pay FBT on any fringe benefits provided to employees (entitled to receive a source deduction payment). As earnings-related compensation is a source deduction payment, the Accident Compensation Corporation is potentially an employer for FBT purposes in respect of earnings-related compensation, and is therefore liable to FBT on any fringe benefits it provides to persons receiving earnings-related compensation such as medical benefits. To avoid this, the definitions of “employee”, “employer” and “employment” exclude earnings- related compensation payable under the Accident Compensation Act 1982 and the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 as being a source deduction payment. However, when the Accident Insurance Act 1998 was enacted, consequential amendments to these definitions were not made to exclude weekly compensation and other payments made under that Act. Key features The definitions of “employee”, “employer” and “employment” in section OB 1 are amended to ensure that the Accident Compensation Corporation is not treated as an employer for the purposes of the fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules in respect of earnings-related compensation it pays under the Accident Insurance Act 1998. These definitions are amended by excluding weekly compensation and other payments payable under that Act from being a source deduction payment for the purposes of the FBT rules. Application date These amendments apply from 19 December 1998. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 40 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Sections BB 2, BC 2, OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994; sections 15B, 33A, and 141JA of the Tax Administration Act 1994; sections 60 and 80 of the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 Introduction Minor remedial amendments have been made to the Income Tax Act 1994, the Tax Administration Act 1994, and the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. They do not involve policy changes. The amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 are: •Sections BB 2 has been amended to make it clear that non-filing taxpayers are not required to file income tax returns. •Section BC 2 has been amended to ensure that the tax liability of non-filing taxpayers is the total of the tax deductions required to be made from their income. •Section LD 1 has been clarified so that non- filing taxpayers with excess or a shortage of tax credits do not lose their status as non-filers. •The definition of non-filing taxpayer in section OB 1 has been amended to make it clear that it includes those to whom the Commissioner is not required to send an income statement. The amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 are: •Section 15B has been expanded to clarify that non-filing taxpayers are not obliged to calculate their tax. •Section 33A has been corrected to make it clear that the Commissioner may not issue an income statement to a non-filing taxpayer. •A new section 141JA has been inserted to ensure that penalties for non-payment of tax do not apply to non-filing taxpayers. All of the amendments to the Income Tax Act 1994 and the amendments to sections 15B and 141JA apply to the 1999–2000 and subsequent income years. The amendment to section 33A(4) applies from 27 March 2001. The amendments to the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 are: •Section 60(7) has been replaced to correct the application date of the extensions made by that Act to the serious hardship and financial difficulty provisions in the Tax Administration Act (sections 176 and 177). •Section 80(2) has been replaced to correct the application date of a new definition of “tax” in section 184A of the Tax Administration Act that requires rebates to be refunded by direct credit. These amendments apply on or after 10 October 2000. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 41 CHANGES TO TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 OFFSETTING USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST AGAINST UNPAID TAX Section 120F(2) Introduction An amendment allows Inland Revenue to offset use-of-money interest payable to a taxpayer (credit interest) against a taxpayer’s unpaid tax before the terminal tax due date. This reduces a taxpayer’s exposure to debit use-of-money interest and penalties. Background Under previous legislation, Inland Revenue was entitled to apply credit interest against a taxpayer’s unpaid tax only if the taxpayer had failed to pay the tax by the due date. This means the tax must first have become overdue, exposing the taxpayer to penalties. Key features Section 120F(2) has been amended to allow Inland Revenue to offset credit interest against a taxpayer’s unpaid tax liability at the time an initial assessment is able to be made, that is, the date a tax return is filed. This amendment does not prevent taxpayers from requesting that credit use-of-money interest be paid out directly. Application date Because the rules relating to offsetting credit interest applied from 1 April 1998, this amendment is retrospective from that date. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 42 TAX SIMPLIFICATION FOR BUSINESS Example If a GST payment of $6,500 due 31 May 2002 was not paid until 3 June 2002 a 1% penalty of $65 would be imposed on 1 June 2002. If, however, the tax was not paid until 9 April 2002, in addition to the 1% penalty of $65, a 4% penalty of $262.60 would be imposed at the end of 7 April 2002. The 1% penalty supports the original due date while not overly penalising those who pay just a few days late. If overdue payments are not paid within a week after the due date, the taxpayer will be in nearly the same position as arises under the current rules. Providing some relief to those who pay just a few days late prevents the penalty becoming disproportionate to the underlying omission. It also reduces the costs associated with applications for remission. The initiative responds to some of the concerns expressed during the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s inquiry into the powers and operations of the Inland Revenue Department. The penalty was seen as harsh when applied to basically honest taxpayers who have failed to pay their tax by only a few days. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance also expressed similar concerns. The initial late payment penalty will apply in a phased way on and after 1 April 2002. Cancelling incremental late payment penalties during instalment arrangements Under the previous law incremental penalties continued to accrue on outstanding tax even if the taxpayer had entered into an instalment arrangement with Inland Revenue to meet their debt. On the successful completion of the arrangement, those penalties were cancelled. However, if a taxpayer defaulted on any of the terms of the arrangement, the whole arrangement was cancelled and all the accumulated incremental penalties that would otherwise have been cancelled were reinstated. As discussed in Less Taxing Tax, the effect of this policy was that a partial, possibly small, failure to comply with the provisions of an instalment arrangement could result in a disproportionate penalty. Sections 139B, 183B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and sections 20, 21IC, and 23A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Introduction Several amendments have been made to improve voluntary compliance by preventing small failures from creating significant compliance costs. The amendments will: •provide substantial relief from the initial late payment penalty for those who pay a few days late •cancel incremental late payment penalties when obligations under an instalment arrangement are being met, and •move the payment of GST on fringe benefits from GST returns to fringe benefit tax returns. Background The Less Taxing Tax discussion document, released in September 1999, outlined tax simplification measures for businesses. Some of those measures were enacted by the Taxation (FBT, SSCWT and Remedial Matters) Act and the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act last year. The initiatives in this Act also implement measures outlined in that document and continue the programme of tax simplification for businesses. Key features Phased application of the initial late payment penalty Section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 imposes an initial late payment penalty of 5% when the due date for payment passes. The penalty reinforces a fundamental obligation of the tax system—the requirement to pay taxes by the due date. New subsections (2), (2A), (2B), (3), (3A) have been inserted into the section so that the initial late payment penalty applies in two stages: •as a 1% penalty the day after the due date, and •if the amount outstanding is not paid within a week of the due date, as a further 4% penalty of the total outstanding amount. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 43 A new subsection (3B) has been inserted into section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to prevent the second phase of the initial late payment penalty from being imposed if: •the taxpayer enters an instalment arrangement before the due date, or •Inland Revenue has exercised powers of compulsory deduction before the second phase of the initial late payment penalty is imposed. Similarly, a new subsection (5A) has been inserted into section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to prevent incremental late payment penalties from being imposed for any month that: •the taxpayer has met all of the terms of the instalment arrangement, or •Inland Revenue has exercised powers of compulsory deduction. Example A taxpayer who anticipates that she will not be able to meet a GST payment due 31 May 2002 of $13,000 enters into an instalment arrangement on 28 May 2002 to pay $1,000 on the first day of each of the next thirteen months. The taxpayer fails to make the tenth payment but meets all her other tax obligations. A 1% penalty of $130 would be imposed on 1 June 2002 (the first phase of the initial late payment penalty). The second phase of the initial late payment penalty would not be imposed because the instalment arrangement would have been in place before the due date. No incremental late payment penalties would be imposed for the first nine months of the arrangement. However, in relation to the tenth month, a 1% penalty of $40 would be imposed. No incremental late payment penalties would apply after that. Removing incremental penalties as taxpayers meet the terms of their instalment arrangements will reduce compliance costs by helping to create a more simple and certain tax treatment for those with overdue tax. It will also reward compliance and prevent the imposition of penalties disproportionate to the underlying failure. Obligations that taxpayers will need to meet to have incremental late payment penalties cancelled include: •paying the agreed instalments by the due date •paying future payments by the due date •filing future returns by the due date, and •informing Inland Revenue if their financial circumstances change. These changes apply to late payment penalties imposed on and after 1 April 2002 and instalment arrangements entered into on and after 1 April 2002. Consequential amendments have been made to section 183B of the Tax Administration Act 1994: •to make it clear that from 1 April 2001 arrangements of one payment are eligible for relief, and •to repeal it from the time that the reforms described earlier take effect. GST on the value of fringe benefits Employers are required to account for GST on some fringe benefits they provide. This is because the provision of the benefit is a supply for GST purposes. Under the previous law, the GST adjustment was calculated and returned with GST. However, to calculate it employers had to refer to their FBT returns to determine the value of output credits associated with the fringe benefits. As outlined in Less Taxing Tax, the omission to make this adjustment is a common discrepancy identified in GST audits. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance noted that while the omission may be the taxpayer’s fault, the tax system should be designed to minimise the likelihood of its occurrence. The legislation has been amended to require this adjustment to be returned with FBT rather than GST. Three amendments have been made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to: •exclude GST on fringe benefits from output tax (new section 20(3A)) •deem that the supply of goods and services takes place at the time the fringe benefits are provided (replaced section 21IC(3)), and •require the adjustment to be paid with the underlying FBT (new section 23A). Including the payment of GST on the value of fringe benefits into FBT returns should reduce compliance costs. While eliminating the risk of an employer forgetting to include the payment in a GST return, and thereby incurring penalties for the oversight, it will also reduce the need for employers to keep records to ensure that they correctly account for GST on the fringe benefits that they provide. It should simplify accounting procedures, because, like fringe benefit tax itself, GST on fringe benefits is an expense. The new policy applies to fringe benefit tax returns due on and after 31 May 2002 for quarterly or annual filers, and by the terminal tax date for the 2001–2002 income year for income year filers. Some taxpayers may have to make a transitional payment to realign the payment of the adjustment with FBT returns from GST returns. Adjustments that have not been included in GST returns before these changes are due with the first FBT return, which includes a GST payment under the new rules. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 44 SHORTFALL PENALTIES ON REFUNDS Sections 141E(1)(d), (e) and 141E(3) Introduction Sections 141E(1)(d), (e) and 141E(3) have been amended to re-establish that a shortfall penalty for evasion can be imposed in all cases where someone wrongfully attempts to obtain a refund. Background Section 141E(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 imposes a shortfall penalty for evasion of 150% in cases where taxpayers obtain a refund or payment of tax knowing that that they are not lawfully entitled to it. Section 141E(1)(e) imposes a similar penalty if a taxpayer enables another person to obtain the refund or payment of tax knowing that that they are not lawfully entitled to the refund or payment. However, if, for example, someone attempted to obtain a refund knowing that they were not entitled to it, but the refund was halted by Inland Revenue, a penalty for evasion was not imposed simply because Inland Revenue did not make the refund. The position that a taxpayer may attempt evasion and not be subject to a penalty if Inland Revenue detects that evasion, represented a significant deficiency in the tax legislation. All taxpayers who knowingly seek to obtain a refund or payment to which they are not lawfully entitled should be subject to the evasion penalty. Taxpayers should not benefit from Inland Revenue actions that result in the refund or payment not being made. This amendment was included in the Bill at the select committee stage as a matter raised by officials. Key features The legislation has been amended to reflect its underlying intent. Penalties for attempted evasion have always been part of the tax system. Sections 141E(1)(d), (e) and 141E(3) have been corrected to re-establish that in cases where the taxpayer attempts to obtain a refund or payment of tax, an evasion penalty can be imposed. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 1997, the date the compliance and penalties legislation took effect, apart from cases where the taxpayer has been advised by the Commissioner that a penalty for evasion cannot be imposed. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 45 CANCELLATION OF INTEREST Section 183C(5) Introduction This amendment clarifies the period for which taxpayers who receive both a notice of assessment and a statement of account are eligible for a cancellation of use-of-money interest. Background Taxpayers with unpaid tax who receive either a notice of assessment or a statement of account may be eligible for a cancellation of use-of-money interest if they pay the full amount outstanding within a defined grace period. In some instances taxpayers were issued with both a notice of assessment and a statement of account, which resulted in the grace periods overlapping. Previous legislation was unclear as to the period for which a taxpayer in this situation is eligible for an interest cancellation. Key features Section 183C(5) has been amended to clarify the period for which taxpayers are eligible for a cancellation of interest when they make payments of unpaid tax within overlapping grace periods. The period for which interest can be cancelled will begin the day after the date that the first notice or statement is issued and will end on the day that the payment is made, providing the payment is made within the overlapping grace period. Application date The amendment applies from 27 March 2001. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 46 CHANGES TO GOODS AND SERVICES TAX ACT 1985 TOKENS, STAMPS AND VOUCHERS Sections 5(11D) to 5(11I) The changes removed difficulties with the GST treatment of progressively redeemed tokens, stamps or vouchers and aligned the treatment of tokens, stamps or vouchers with the GST time of supply rules. The main difficulty with the new rules was in relation to multi-party arrangements, as illustrated below: Introduction Amendments have been made to section 5 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, which applies to transactions involving the supply of tokens, stamps or vouchers. The amendments are to deal with issues that have arisen with the new rules enacted in the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. Background Sections 5(11D) to 5(11I) replaced sections 10(16) to 10(17A) in relation to supplies of tokens, stamps and vouchers. Before the rules were introduced a supply in relation to a token, stamp or voucher was generally recognised, if there was no face value at the time of issue, or if there was a face value at the time of redemption. Under the new rules the supply of a token, stamp or voucher (regardless of whether it has a face value) is recognised at the time the token, stamp or voucher is issued. In relation to tokens, stamps or vouchers with a face value where it is not practical to recognise the supply on issue, GST may be recognised when the token, stamp or voucher is redeemed for goods and services. A multi-party arrangement involving the supply of vouchers Industry association Retailer 1Retailer 2 Customer (consumer) Voucher Voucher Voucher Cancelled voucher Goods or services $$ $ Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 47 In this illustration, the industry association issues a stock of vouchers, with a face value, for consideration to a participating retailer—retailer 1. Retailer 1 records the purchase of the voucher stock in its accounts. A customer purchases one of the vouchers from retailer 1 and some time later presents the voucher as consideration at participating retailer 2. Retailer 2 accepts the voucher as consideration for goods and services and in the process cancels it. Retailer 2 seeks reimbursement from the Industry Association in respect of the cancelled voucher. In accounting for GST, the industry association and the participating retailers agreed that GST should be accounted for when the voucher was redeemed rather than when it was issued. The difficulties with the application of the new rules were: •The potential for double taxation to occur: Although the rules were designed to ensure that GST was payable only once, the wording of the recent amendments arguably created the possibility, where GST is recognised at the time of redemption, that GST could be triggered on any subsequent transaction after a token, stamp or voucher was issued. Therefore the sale between retailer 1 and the customer could arguably be subject to GST. •The meaning of the word “redemption”: There was also an argument that when participating retailer 2 seeks reimbursement from the Industry Association another imposition of GST could be triggered, as the word “redemption” was not limited to the redemption of the voucher for goods and services. •“Not practical”: Another problem was that the “not practical” requirement for adopting the redemption basis did not extend to an issuer of tokens, stamps or vouchers who was also the supplier of the goods and services for which the tokens, stamps or vouchers were redeemed. Key features The amendments: •Remove the potential for transactions involving the supply of tokens, stamps or vouchers to be taxed twice. •Clarify that “redemption” does not include redemption of a token, stamp or voucher for money. •Extend the “not practical” requirement to situations where the issuer of a token, stamp or voucher and the supplier of the goods and services are the same person. Analysis Issue or sale One of the purposes of the amendments was to align the GST treatment of transactions involving the supply of tokens, stamps or vouchers with the general time of supply rule, being the earlier of invoice or payment. Therefore the general rule that is applicable to the supply of a token, stamp or voucher is that GST is recognised when the token, stamp or voucher is issued. The amendments confirm in relation to the general rule that GST should be recognised only when a token, stamp or voucher is issued or sold to a final consumer. The legislation achieves this by excluding from the term “supply” the issue or sale of a token, stamp or voucher to a person who will subsequently issue or sell that token, stamp or voucher. Redemption It has been clarified that redemption of a token, stamp or voucher for money does not give rise to further GST consequences. It has also been clarified that it is the bearer of the voucher who redeems the voucher rather than the supplier of the goods and services. “Not practical” In order to recognise GST on redemption of a token, stamp or voucher with a face value the supplier must establish that it is not practical to return GST when the token, stamp or voucher is issued. This exception to the general rule was included to reduce compliance costs. With regard to the interpretation of the words “not practical”, in some cases it was considered that the legislation could unjustifiably require taxpayers to change longstanding arrangements and account for GST when a token, stamp or voucher is issued. The amendment clarifies that when the issuer of a token, stamp or voucher and the person supplying the goods or services in exchange for the voucher are not the same person, they may elect to recognise GST at the time of redemption rather than issue. The application of the amendment still requires that there be an agreement between the taxpayers to this effect but now, in the alternative, requires that they are party to such an agreement. The amendment also allows the redemption basis when the issuer and the supplier are the same person provided it is impractical for the taxpayer to account for GST when the token, stamp or voucher is issued. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 48 The following situations are examples of where the “not practical” requirement is likely to have been met: •The supplier of the voucher and supplier of the goods and services are different persons and are parties to an agreement: A member of a franchise chain of food stores sells a gift voucher to a customer. The voucher is redeemable at any of the franchise stores throughout New Zealand. Neither the customer nor the store selling the voucher has control over where the voucher is redeemed. The franchise stores are all party to an agreement to use the redemption method. •The supplier of the voucher and the supplier of the goods and services are branches of the same company: A department store sells a gift certificate to a customer. At the time of sale the department store cannot tell whether the voucher will be redeemed at its store, or a related branch. The store and its affiliated branch are legally the same person but have separate accounting systems. •The supplier of the voucher is the same person as the supplier of the goods and services but the vouchers are regularly used as part payment for goods and services: A fashion retailer sells gift vouchers to customers. The vouchers can only be redeemed with that particular fashion retailer as it is the only store of its kind. The vouchers are regularly used in conjunction with cash to purchase clothing of a greater value than the face value of the voucher. Variations of these examples may also meet the requirements where it is “not practical” to recognise GST at the time when a token, stamp or voucher is issued. No consideration Some tokens, stamps or vouchers such as those that received in the mail will allow consumers to receive goods and services to a specified value. These vouchers have been excluded from the scope of sections 5(11D) to 5(11I). If a token, stamp or voucher is issued for no consideration, no GST consequences will arise on the issue of that token, stamp or voucher. However, when the token, stamp or voucher is redeemed it will be treated under the general GST provisions as consideration for the supply of goods and services at the time it is converted. Application date The amendments to sections 5(11D) to 5(11I) apply from 10 October 2000. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 49 OTHER REMEDIAL CHANGES The amendment clarifies that the method of allocation chosen by taxpayers under section 21A(1) or (2) should give a fair and reasonable result. New assets Section 21B(3) determines the method of allocation that taxpayers apply when they have elected to make a one-off adjustment. The amendment to section 21B(3) widens its application to include assets acquired as new when there is no existing pattern of use. In circumstances where an existing pattern does not exist the taxpayer will need to revise the estimate twelve months after the date of purchase or production. Cross-references and minor corrections Further amendments have been made to correct cross- references to the Customs and Excise Act 1996 in section 21E and to correct minor drafting errors in sections 5(13A) and 42 of the GST Act. Application date The amendments to the GST Act apply on or after 10 October 2000. Definition of “associated persons” Section 2A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 has been amended to exclude from the definition of “associated persons” the relationship between a settlor of a trust and a trustee that is a charitable or non-profit body. A settlor of a trust is widely defined to include any person that provides anything to a trust for less than market value. The wide ambit of the definition is necessary to prevent the trustee–settlor associated persons test being circumvented. Before the amendment, the definition of “settlor” could have resulted in a donor to a non-profit body or a charitable trust being associated with that body or trust. This outcome was not intended. Zero-rated supplies Section 11(1)(f) allows goods to retain their zero-rated status in the event that the goods are destroyed or die. The section has been amended so that the circumstances leading to the death or destruction of the goods must be beyond the control of both the supplier and the recipient. Before the amendment, the section referred to the event being out of the control of either the supplier or the recipient. Adjustments Remedial amendments have been made to sections 21A and 21B, which require taxpayers to make GST adjustments when goods and services are used for a purpose other than that of making taxable supplies. Fair and reasonable Section 21A sets out the methods for allocating input tax credits between taxable and non-taxable uses of goods and services: •Section 21A(1) sets out the two general methods of allocation—actual use (direct attribution) and a Commissioner-approved alternative method if the method results in a fair and reasonable allocation. •Section 21A(2) allows the use of either of the two methods in section 21A(1) or the turnover method for ascertaining the proportion by which input tax credits should be allocated where the taxpayer makes exempt supplies. This method is generally used when the actual use method is difficult to apply—for example, in the case of overhead expenses. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 50 CHANGES TO THE STAMP AND CHEQUE DUTIES ACT 1971 APPROVED ISSUER LEVY Sections 86I, 86K, 86KA and 86M of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971; and section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction Amendments have been made to the approved issuer levy (AIL) rules in order to improve their equity as well as to ensure more consistent administration with other revenues. They allow the compliance and penalty rules to apply to payments made after the due date of AIL, consistent with other revenues, rather than imposing non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) as was previously the case. Also, consistent with similar provisions in the resident and non-resident withholding tax rules, it is now possible to make payments of AIL six-monthly rather than monthly when the expected annual liability to AIL is less than $500. Additionally, the amendments clarify that persons other than the approved issuer may make payments of AIL, from the date a security has been registered with Inland Revenue, and have NRWT zero-rated. This amendment has been passed retrospectively to the inception of the AIL rules, 1 August 1991. Background As the AIL rules are concessionary, the original intent was that they apply only if the borrower complied with strict conditions, including payment on time. Although there was limited scope for payments made after the due date to stay within the AIL rules, a payment made after the due date of AIL usually meant the full rate of NRWT was payable. Payment of NRWT at the full rate was not originally considered a penalty, as in 1991 NRWT was the norm, and AIL was a concession. Over time, however, as the payment of AIL has become the norm, in relation to interest derived from New Zealand by non-residents, the imposition of NRWT had come to be seen as a penalty for late payment out of line with other penalties for payments made after the due date. Thus for consistency with all other revenues administered by Inland Revenue, an amendment has been made to incorporate AIL within the compliance and penalty rules. It was envisaged at the time AIL was introduced that persons other than the approved issuer (borrower), such as nominee companies, should be able to make payments of AIL, and still comply with the conditions for NRWT to be zero-rated. Tax practitioners, however, recently highlighted that this policy was not reflected in the legislation. Consistent with the original policy, amendments have been made, retrospectively to the inception of AIL, to allow zero-rating of NRWT when a person other than the approved issuer makes the payment of AIL. As a simplification measure consistent with the resident and non-resident withholding tax rules, an additional amendment has been made to allow taxpayers with expected annual liabilities of under $500 to make payments of AIL six-monthly rather than monthly as was the case. Key features Paragraphs (a)(vii) and (d)(vii) of the definition of “tax” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and section 86M of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 have been repealed, and section 86I(b) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act amended. This is to allow non-resident withholding tax to be zero-rated when AIL is paid late, on the condition that accrued penalties and interest are paid in accordance with the compliance and penalty rules. Sections 86I and 86K(1) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 are amended retrospectively to allow persons other than the approved issuer to make payments of AIL and still be zero-rated for NRWT. Section 86KA of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 is added to allow taxpayers with an expected annual AIL liability of $500 or less to make payments every six months, rather than every month as previously. Application dates The change in policy to allow the compliance and penalty rules to apply to AIL paid after the due date applies to payments of interest on and after 27 March 2001. The retrospective amendments to section 86I and 86K(1) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, apply from 1 August 1991. The right to make payments of AIL six-monthly applies on and after 27 March 2001. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 51 ORDER IN COUNCIL – THE GOODS AND SERVICES TAX (LOCAL AUTHORITIES ACCOUNTING ON PAYMENTS BASIS) ORDER 2001 (SR 2001/85) A recent Order in Council, the Goods and Services Tax (Local Authorities Accounting on Payments Basis), made on 7 May, allows nine local authorities four years in which to change to an invoice basis of accounting for GST. It provides for the Far North, Gisborne, Kaipara, Opotiki, Ruapehu, Waitomo, Whakatane and Western Bay of Plenty District Councils and the Northland Regional Council to continue to account for GST on a payments basis until June 2005. From 1 July 2001, the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 requires all local authorities to account for GST on an invoice basis rather than a payments basis. The Order allows time for these local authorities to resolve transitional issues associated the shift to invoice basis accounting. Notice of the Order was made on 10 May 2001 in the New Zealand Gazette. The Order will not come into force until 28 days after that date. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 52 QUESTIONS WE’VE BEEN ASKED This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. CASH PRIZES IN SPORTING COMPETITIONS – GST IMPLICATIONS FOR ORGANISING CLUB Sections 5(10) and 10(14), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – supply where game of chance etc The secretary of a GST-registered amateur sports club has asked us to clarify whether or not the club is able to claim GST input tax deductions on cash prizes awarded to participants in bowls competitions organised by the club. They have noted that section 10(14) permits the amount of prizes paid in cash to be deducted from total proceeds in relation to certain games and competitions, thus reducing the net amount of GST payable in respect of the competition. Many clubs run regular sporting competitions, and these competitions are part of the club’s taxable activity. A membership fee allowing a person to use the club facilities may be payable, and this fee may also allow members to enter competitions. Alternatively, a separate fee may apply for entry into the competition. In both cases such fees contribute towards the costs of administering and running the competition, as well as allowing the use of facilities. As a registered person, the club will return output tax on membership fees and competition entry fees. The club will be able to claim input tax on all the goods and services purchased in order to provide the competition. “Goods” and “services” are both defined in section 2 of the Act. “Goods” means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money: “Services” means anything which is not goods or money: Trophies, bottles of wine, meat packs, or similar items fall within the definition of goods. As such input tax deductions can be made. If a prize is donated, there is no GST component as there is no consideration paid for that prize. Cash prizes, however, are treated differently because they do not fall within either the definition of “goods” or “services”. The section 2 definitions of “goods” and “services” specifically exclude money. Thus it is not possible for the club to claim GST on any money acquired for the purposes of awarding a prize, because money is not a good or service. Having concluded that money is neither “goods” nor “services”, a further question arises as to whether the sporting competition is a “game of chance”, “lottery”, “prize competition”, etc, in order for sections 5(10) and 10(14) to apply. Relevant sections of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 are: Section 5: (10) Notwithstanding anything in this Act, for the purposes of this Act where any person pays an amount in money to participate in a game of chance, lottery, New Zealand instant game, New Zealand lottery, New Zealand prize competition, or prize competition, the amount of money so paid to participate shall be deemed to be for a supply of services by the person, society, licensed promoter, or organiser who, pursuant to the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977, conducts the game of chance, lottery New Zealand instant game, New Zealand lottery, New Zealand prize competition, or prize competition. (11) For the purposes of subsection (10) of this section— (a)The terms “game of chance”, “gaming machine”, “lottery”, “prize competition”, and “society” have the same meanings as defined in section 2 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977: (aa) The terms “New Zealand instant game”, “New Zealand lottery” and “New Zealand prize competition” have the same meanings as defined in section 71 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977: (b)The term “amusement device” has the same meaning as defined in section 10 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977: Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 53 (c)The term “licensed promoter” has the same meaning as defined in Part V of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977: (d)The term “organiser” means the New Zealand Lotteries Commission established by section 72 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977. Section 10: (14) Where a supply of services is deemed to be made under section 5(10) of this Act, the consideration in money for the supply shall be deemed to be such portion of the amount in money a person pays to participate in a game of chance, lottery, New Zealand instant game, New Zealand lottery, New Zealand prize competition, or prize competition, as repre- sents the total proceeds (after deducting the amount of all prizes paid and payable in money) in respect of that game of chance, lottery, New Zealand instant game, New Zealand lottery, New Zealand prize competition, or prize competi- tion. (15) For the purposes of subsection (14) of this section¾ (a)The terms “game of chance”, “lottery”, and “prize competition” have the same meanings as defined in section 2 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977: (b)The terms “New Zealand instant game”, “New Zealand lottery”, and “New Zealand prize competition” have the same meanings as defined in section 71 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977. In addition, the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977 defines “game of chance” and “prize competition” in the following terms: “Game of chance” means a game– (a)In respect of which direct or indirect consideration is paid to participate; and (b)That is played with a view to winning money or money’s worth; and (c)The outcome of which depends wholly or partly on chance;— but does not include an athletic game, or a sporting event, or a New Zealand lottery, or a New Zealand prize competition: “Prize competition” means a scheme or competition in respect of which direct or indirect consideration is paid to participate, and of which the result is determined partly by a considerable element of chance (whether chance plays the greater or lesser part), and partly by the performance by the contestants of some activity of a kind that may be performed more readily by contestants possessing or exercising some knowledge or skill, whether or not it may also be performed successfully by chance; but does not include— (a)An instant game; or (b)A New Zealand instant game; or (c)Any such scheme or competition to which Part VII of this Act applies: Section 10(14) allows cash prizes to be deducted from the total proceeds of a “game of chance”, “lottery”, “prize competition”, etc, thus reducing the net amount of GST payable. However, section 10(14) only applies to taxable supplies under section 5(10). Section 5(10) deals with supplies where there is a “game of chance”, “prize competition”, etc. Paying money to participate in any of the defined “games of chance”, “prize competition”, etc, is treated as payment for a supply of a service. The particular activities listed in the section are all defined in the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977, including the term “prize competition”. “Prize competition” has the same meaning in the GST Act as it does under the Gaming and Lotteries Act. Thus, if an event is a “prize competition”, the rules of the Gaming and Lotteries Act will apply. The Gaming and Lotteries Act definition of “game of chance” excludes an “athletic game” and a “sporting event”. A “game of chance” by definition is one that depends on luck, and not the skill of the competitor. In the context of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, the definition of “game of chance” refers to “chance” in a gambling sense, i.e. the Gaming and Lotteries Act deals with the promoting, licensing, and regulation of gambling-related activities by a person, society, licensed promoter, or organiser pursuant to that Act. A sports competition does not become a “prize competition” for the purposes of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, simply because prizes are awarded. A “prize competition” requires there to be a considerable element of chance, and some skill or knowledge. A sports competition will not generally come within the definition of “prize competition”, as the participants are competing on the basis of their skill or knowledge in the relevant sport. Nor will such sporting competitions come within any of the other definitions referred to in section 5(10) as they will not be organised, licensed, or promoted pursuant to the Gaming and Lotteries Act. Because section 5(10) does not apply, section 10(14) will not apply either. Section 10(14) contains a particular concession for games of chance in which GST is only payable on the proceeds of the game of chance, prize competition, etc, after the amount of the prize money has been deducted. Therefore, the sports club will not be able to rely on the provisions of sections 5(10) and 10(14) to deduct the amount of any cash prizes from the total proceeds received from the amateur sports (bowls) competitions. Accordingly, the GST payable in respect of the competition will not be reduced, or other GST relief obtained, in respect of cash prizes for clubs’ sports competitions. While every case will depend on its own facts, the Commissioner does not generally consider the awarding of minor “spot” prizes as part of the sporting competition would alter this characteristic unless part of the fee could be seen to be attributed to the possibility of receiving such spot prizes.

WHETHER SALE OF VESSEL ATTRACTED GST – JUDICIAL REVIEW Case:Simunovich Fisheries Ltd v CIR and Owen Joseph Knock Decision date:26 April 2001 Act:Judicature Amendment Act 1972, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Judicial review Summary Priestley J, found for the Commissioner on all issues. Facts In June 1995 Simunovich Fisheries Ltd (“Simunovich”) purchased a fishing vessel (Longva III subsequently renamed Kermadec). Simunovich claimed the purchase price of the vessel as an input tax credit for the GST period ending 31 July 1995. In December 1997 Simunovich sold the vessel. For the GST period ending 31 January 1998 Simunovich claimed that the vessel was subject to GST at a 0% rate. On 10 August 1999 the Commissioner issued Simunovich with a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”) for the 31 January 1998 GST period. The NOPA proposed that the sale proceeds of the vessel should, so far as the 31 January 1998 taxable period was concerned, attract GST. The NOPA asserted that the transaction attracted GST because the vessel’s acquisition by the plaintiff in January 1995 was the supply of a secondhand good by an entity that was not registered for GST. That assertion was contrary to the stance previously adopted by the Commissioner for the 31 July 1995 GST taxable period in respect of which the last Notice of Assessment, issued 6 November 1995, allowed the purchase price of the vessel as an input tax credit, that is as a taxable supply. Decision His Honour, Priestly J, stated that so far as the substantive provisions of the GST Act are concerned, the December 1997 sale of the vessel should have attracted GST at the normal 12.5% rate. Since Simunovich in fact acquired the vessel as a secondhand good from a non-registered GST entity a section 11(1)(ag) zero rating provision was not available. Having decided this, His Honour looked at whether there was anything arising out of the facts or any legal principles that would exonerate Simunovich from its GST liability for the 31 January 1998 period. In regards to the four-year time limit contained in section 108A(1), His Honour stated that this time limit must be seen in the context of that provision and the statutory regime generally. His Honour said that the legislative policy is to stipulate a period beyond which the Commissioner cannot issue further assessments that have the effect of increasing the amount of tax payable. In regards to the facts of this case His Honour found that the 10 August 1999 NOPA did not purport to alter or amend the assessment of the plaintiff’s GST liability for the 31 July 1995 period. Nor does the treatment of the June 1995 purchase of the vessel as a purchase of a secondhand good from a non-registered entity, rather than as a taxable supply, alter the assessed figure for the 31 July 1995 period. In this case there has only potentially been a change of grounds and no increase in the assessment. On that analysis the four-year time limit contained in section 108A(1) does not apply. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 55 In response to Simunovich’s submissions that the Commissioner’s decision, signalled in the NOPA, to alter the ground on which the vessel’s purchase price is treated as a taxable supply, has the effect of creating a new taxation liability on the wrong side of the four- year period where no liability had existed, His Honour stated that this argument is flawed. His Honour found that the grounds for the assessment can properly be distinguished from the assessed figure. Such a distinction was recognised by the Court of Appeal in its recent decision of Hyslop v Commissioner of Inland Revenue where, in the context of objection procedures, the Court drew a distinction between making an assessment and giving notice of an assessment, such distinction being essentially the difference between coming to a decision and communicating a decision. The Court also made a distinction between giving notice of assessment and providing the taxpayer with details of such assessment to facilitate framing an objection. The 6 November 1995 Notice of Assessment and the resulting refund to Simunovich were based on the premise that the purchase price of the vessel entitled the plaintiff to an appropriate input tax figure because the vessel was acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Neither Simunovich nor the Commissioner seek to resile from that situation. His Honour concluded that section 108A(1) does not prevent the Commissioner from rejecting the plaintiff’s claim that the sale of the vessel in December 1997 was not a zero-rated transaction but instead attracted GST at the normal rate. His Honour also stated that if he is wrong in that conclusion he would additionally hold against Simunovich on the basis that section 108A(1) applies on its face to amended assessments in respect of which there is none for the July 1995 period. Even if there were such an amended assessment on a new ground there has been no increase in the amount assessed. Court of Appeal’s dicta in Dandelion Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue and Brierly Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue applied and require an increased amount of payable tax as an essential component of the section 108A(1) bar. In regards to Simunovich’s claim that the Commissioner’s decisions were reviewable on the grounds of legitimate expectation and estoppel, His Honour stated that, since the passage of section 6 and section 6A of the Tax Administration Act, the door has not permanently been closed on the possibility that the Commissioner can be reviewable on these grounds. However, the facts of this case go nowhere close to being one in which relief on those grounds can seriously be contemplated. The facts of this case do not permit any finding that Simunovich has been misled by the Commissioner or his actions in the August to November 1995 period. His Honour also found that Simunovich’s own actions have undoubtedly contributed to the dilemma in which it now finds itself. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 56 WHETHER AWARD FOR LOSS OF WAGES AND BENEFITS WAS ASSESSABLE, WHETHER LEGAL EXPENSES DEDUCTIBLE In his statement of claim the plaintiff sought the following remedies: Loss of salaries 1/7/89 to 12/6/91 due to$4,059.42 lower salary Loss of capitalised retiring allowance$10,815.26 Loss of payment of retiring leave$3,113.05 Loss of income 13/6/91 to 18/7/95$183,516.16 Loss of annual retiring allowance$20,284.53 during life expectancy Loss of financial benefits$221,788.42 The Employment Court found that the plaintiff had suffered a constructive dismissal and awarded him $126,000 made up in the following way: Loss of wages due to date of hearing $46,000 (s 229 LRA) Humiliation (section 227(c)(i) LRA)$30,000 Loss of benefits (section 227(c)(ii) LRA)$50,000 Total$126,000 The plaintiff sought to deduct the legal expenses he incurred in pursuing the Employment Court award. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction on the basis that the legal fees were income from employment and therefore prohibited from deduction. The Commissioner also assessed $96,000 of the award made under section 227(c)(ii) and 229 of the LRA (being the loss of benefits and the loss of wages) as monetary remuneration as defined in section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976. The plaintiff objected to this assessment. A case was stated to the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) and in a decision dated 20 March the TRA found in favour of the Commissioner. The plaintiff appealed the TRA decision. Case:Derek Earl Cleland v CIR Decision date:30 April 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Deductibility of legal expenses, monetary remuneration Summary The plaintiff was unsuccessful in his appeal from the TRA. Facts The plaintiff was an Inland Revenue employee. The plaintiff’s employment contract provided for an optional retirement date of 18 July 1990 and a compulsory retirement date of 18 July 1995. As part of a restructuring process Inland Revenue placed the plaintiff in the position of technical officer to take effect from July 1989. This position attracted a lower salary than the plaintiff’s previous position as a senior auditor and Inland Revenue paid him an abating equalisation allowance. The plaintiff refused to accept the new position because he lost the benefits of any future salary increase and because any retirement lump sum or leave entitlement would have been based on the lower salary alone as would any capitalisation of government superannuation fund payments. The plaintiff initiated a dispute of rights mediation and a personal grievance mediation. His complaints were not upheld. In February 1991 Inland Revenue issued an ultimatum to the plaintiff that he either work as a technical officer or be dismissed. On receiving this ultimatum the plaintiff resigned. On 11 November 1991 the plaintiff filed a statement of claim in the Employment Court claiming that the termination of his employment amounted to an unjustified constructive dismissal and seeking compensation pursuant to the Labour Relations Act 1987 (“LRA”). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 57 Decision His Honour, Hammond J, found for the Commissioner on all issues. His Honour stated that in this case the section 229 award was clearly for loss of wages due up to the date of hearing and easily came within the definition of monetary remuneration in section 2 of the Act. The section 227 award was “forward looking” and was for the loss of any benefit, monetary or otherwise, which the taxpayer might reasonably have expected to obtain had the personal grievance not arisen. His Honour found that given the fact that a specific award had been made for humiliation, the section 227(c)(ii) portion of the award was of an economic character. His Honour found that whether the section 227(c)(ii) portion of the award fell within the definition of monetary remuneration depended upon whether it could be said to be awarded “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service”. Hammond J concluded that the taxpayer would not have received the award at all had he not previously been employed by Inland Revenue and that the award was clearly in respect of or in relation to the taxpayer’s past employment. Hammond J specifically found against the plaintiff’s argument that, because the award was calculated on future wages and benefits, it was not compensation for loss of office or employment. In examining the issue of whether the award fell within the definition of a redundancy payment, his Honour said that it was necessary to look at the true nature of the legal arrangements pursuant to which the payment was made. His Honour found that the Employment Court did not compensate the taxpayer for redundancy and nor could it have done so under section 227 and 229 LRA had it wished. His Honour also rejected the plaintiff’s argument that a redundancy payment need not necessarily be received upon the occasion of the termination of employment. In respect of the legal fees, His Honour found that they were incurred in gaining or producing the award (which fell within the definition of “extra emolument” in section 2 of the Act) and were therefore prohibited from deduction by section 105 of the Act 1976 as expenses incurred in gaining or producing income from employment. Costs of $3,000 plus disbursements were awarded to the Commissioner. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 58 WHETHER SUPPLY OF REPAIR SERVICES UNDER WARRANTY AGREEMENT ZERO-RATED FOR GST The dispute is focussed on the GST treatment of sums received by SNZ from SMC Japan. No issues arise in respect of the warranty payments from SNZ to dealers. Decision A Full Bench upheld McGechan J’s first finding that SNZ supplied repair services to SMC, which were not zero-rated. This was sufficient for the Commissioner to succeed. It was not necessary to determine the cross appeal, but the Court indicated that had it been necessary, it would have been sympathetic to the Commissioner’s cross-appeal. This meant that the Court of Appeal indicated it did not agree with the High Court finding in favour of the taxpayer that SMC’s payments were not in consideration for SNZ’s supply of repair services under the SNZ warranty. Whether SNZ supplied repair services to SMC Japan On the first issue, concerning whether SNZ made a supply of repair services to SMC, the taxpayer argued the payments were not for repair services, and the particular documentation should be interpreted as a mere obligation by SMC to pay compensation for defects. The Court held on the documentation the payments by SMC were in respect of supplies of repair services by SNZ to SMC. The contracts were simply an illustration of a common situation where performance of an obligation under one contract is also performance under the other. Whether repair services zero-rated under section 11(2)(c) The second leg of the first issue concerned whether the repair services were zero-rated or standard-rated. Quite simply the court had no doubt repair services were carried out on cars in NZ, so the supply could not be zero-rated. Whether payments by SMC Japan to SNZ consideration for repairs by SNZ for customers The second issue concerned whether payments by SMC Japan were “consideration” for repairs by SNZ for the customers. The CIR relied on this as an alternative argument, which had already failed before the TRA and the HC. The Court of Appeal indicated that it would have been sympathetic to the view that the payments by SMC could be held to be consideration of SNZ’s supply of repair services under SNZ’s warranty. Case:Suzuki New Zealand Ltd v CIR Decision date:7 May 2001 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Summary The taxpayer’s appeal and Commissioner’s cross- appeal were both dismissed, resulting in a win for the Commissioner. Facts Suzuki New Zealand (“SNZ”) purchases Suzuki motor vehicles from Suzuki Motor Corporation (“SMC”) which is the Japanese parent company. The terms of the sale and purchase agreement include a provision under which SMC warrants the goods to SNZ. The warranty is in respect of parts and labour for up to one year from the date the vehicle is sold to any particular customer. The beneficiary of the warranty is SNZ. Once the Suzuki products arrive in NZ, they are sold to independent dealers. The dealers then sell to the public. Each vehicle is sold with a warranty provided by SNZ. This warranty is separate from the warranty agreement between SMC and SNZ. SNZ has an agreement with each dealer that if the dealer repairs a vehicle covered by the warranty provided by SNZ the dealer will be paid by SNZ at standard rates for the work. The warranty provided by SNZ covers any repairs specified in the agreement that are necessary within a period of three years after the purchase of the Suzuki product. The work is generally done by the same dealer that sold the vehicle to the customer. SNZ contracts with the eventual purchaser of vehicles to provide the retail warranty. The dealers are authorised to offer the warranty to the purchasers. When a customer has a problem with a vehicle, the customer normally returns it to a dealer, who assesses the vehicle to determine whether it is covered by the warranty. If he or she considers the repairs will cost more than $250, authority from SNZ to begin work is needed. The dealer repairs the vehicle free of charge to the customer. The dealer seeks payment from SNZ, who pays according to their agreement. The dealer accounts for output tax on the payment from SNZ and SNZ claims an input tax credit. SNZ may only then, after the repairs have been completed, approach SMC under the warranty between SMC and SNZ. If SMC is satisfied it is liable, it pays SNZ under the terms of the agreement between SMC and SNZ. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 59 WHETHER LEGAL FEES IN RESPECT OF PERSONAL GRIEVANCE ACTIONS WERE DEDUCTIBLE Decision On the first issue, Judge Willy found that the disputant was in fact carrying on a business during the four-month period in question. His Honour weighed the activities the disputant was engaged in against the relatively short period of that activity and held that a business had nonetheless commenced. In so doing he considered the business tests set out by the Court of Appeal in the well-known Grieve, Eggers and Stockwell cases. His Honour found for the Commissioner on the second issue, that, even if there was a business activity, there was insufficient nexus with the expenditure claimed and the income-earning activity. The disputant’s argument turned on the “preservation of reputation” cases such as Case N4 (1991) 13 NZTC 3030, and A v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5074. His Honour followed the Commissioner’s submissions that the legal costs did not arise from the conduct of the purported business, as did the taxpayers’ expenses in the cited cases, but had their genesis in a completely separate action. On this basis Judge Willy held that the disputant failed, and confirmed the Commissioner’s assessments. This was followed by an obiter discussion of the Commissioner’s alternative submissions. His Honour rejected the argument that the legal fees were expenses of a capital nature, noting that “...there are cases in which the incurring of legal costs to prosecute defamation proceedings to protect an established business have been allowed...” Further, his Honour found that the next submission that the expenditure was purely a private or domestic matter (being the preservation of personal reputation) did not arise on the facts, but if it had, then it couldn’t be private. The submission that the deduction was barred by section BD2(2)(c) of the Act (obtaining income from employment) was also discussed: “This is in my view really another way of looking at the question of whether a nexus exists between the business activity and the payments concerned. If that nexus does not exist, as I have found, then the work to which the payments attach is clearly connected with the disputant’s employment contract with his former employers. To that extent it may be that the Commissioner is correct in this submission, but it can only become relevant once it has been found that the payments are too remote to comprise a business expendi- ture.” Finally, his Honour accepted the Commissioner’s submissions that, had the issue arisen, the disputant would have failed the Buckley and Young apportionment test, proceeding as he did on an “all or nothing” basis. Case:TRA Number 00/026. Decision Number 4/2001 Decision date:2 May 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1994 Keywords:Deduction, course of carrying on a business, reputation, capital, income from employment, gross income, nexus, apportionment Summary The Authority found for the Commissioner, confirming all assessments. Facts The dispute concerned a claimed deduction for legal fees, which were incurred by the disputant after he was made redundant. The disputant felt he had been unjustifiably dismissed and commenced grievance proceedings, firstly with the Employment Court, seeking an injunction for reinstatement, then secondly with the Employment Tribunal seeking damages under the Employment Contracts Act 1991. The disputant was made redundant on 23 October 1997 and commenced employment with another company on 2 March 1998. During the intervening four-month period, he sought to gain income by marketing his services to business associates and other contractors in his field of expertise. A number of agreements were signed with various contractors but no paid work was obtained. During the four-month period the disputant returned no income from self-employment. The disputant sought to deduct legal expenses of some $101,000 representing invoices in respect of his personal grievance actions in the Employment Tribunal, Employment Court and Court of Appeal. The Commissioner has declined the deductions on the basis that the expenses were incurred in respect of gaining income from employment rather than being incurred in deriving gross income or in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 60 WHETHER INCENTIVE PAYMENT IS EMOLUMENT OF SERVICE AND ASSESSIBLE would have merely forfeited his right to the Payment. Judge Willy acknowledged that payments of a capital nature, such as restraints of trade, may still be assessable if they were caught within the definition of “monetary remuneration” under section BB4(b) of the Act. The Commissioner argued that such was the case as the payment was “... in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. It was held however, that only the last category of payment in the definition of “monetary remuneration” required such nexus: “... the words must be construed within the statutory framework in which they appear. That is they can only relate to one of the categories of payment referred to in s.OB1 ... ‘other benefit in money in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer’”. The Commissioner appealed the decision arguing that it erred in both fact and law. Decision His Honour Justice McGechan found that, on the evidence before the Authority, there was no basis for the finding that the defendant remained in employment beyond his final pay date, nor that there was a separate contract entered into, nor any form of positive obligation binding the defendant. The words used by the employer in making the offer were held to be determinative of the nature of the payment—it was to “encourage” staff to remain with the company. “When that is combined with the label used for the payment – Retention ‘Incentive’ – there is little room for any finding that this was an arrangement which imposed obligatory continued service upon the Taxpayer.” Earlier, his Honour noted his jurisdiction in such matters: “This Court is as well equipped to make factual findings, including the drawing of inferences, as the Authority. To the extent findings of fact were not open on the evidence, or inferences drawn are not supportable, this Court can and should intervene.” Having so found, his Honour held that the decision could not stand. The payment was clearly an emolument of service in line with everyday meaning of the term: “I consider this would be the case even if the word ‘emolu- ment’ stood in isolation. It is even more so given the added words “emolument (of whatever kind)”. The concept of ‘emolument’ is intended to be approached on the broadest possible basis. The present facts are readily included.” Case:CIR v Darryl Kerslake Decision date:3 May 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1994 Keywords:Errors of fact on appeal, monetary remuneration, emolument, benefit in money Summary The Commissioner was successful in an appeal against the decision of Judge Willy in TRA Case U21 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,199. Facts The defendant was employed by a pharmaceutical company that was winding down its New Zealand operation. The company wished to retain key employees until the operation ceased. The defendant received a retention incentive payment (“the Payment”) from his employer at the end of his service as part of a redundancy package. The Payment was offered to all employees who had been given notice of impending redundancy, and was paid out upon severance to those employees who remained with the company until they were no longer required. The Payment was calculated as 3 months gross salary and was paid in addition to a normal redundancy payment. The company made a source deduction from all employees’ final payments but by clerical error, neglected to do so for part of the defendant’s payout. The Commissioner assessed the defendant for tax on the whole redundancy package, including the Payment. The defendant commenced challenge proceedings. The TRA Decision In the TRA, Judge Willy found for the disputant. He considered the case raised a “novel point” and that the circumstances of the case were unique. His Honour found that the Payment was made at the commencement of an agreement between the parties that the disputant would temporarily surrender his rights to leave the employer’s service. As such the payment was held to be akin to a restraint of trade payment and not to be an emolument. This finding varied with the evidence before the Court that showed the Payment to be an inducement rather than a restraint, and that the disputant was free to leave his employer’s service at any time. Had he done so, he Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 61 His Honour also corrected a misstatement of law by the Authority regarding the nexus with employment. He noted that the words “in respect of” in the OB1 definition of “monetary remuneration” do not relate only to the words “other benefit in money”, they relate to all items listed previously in the definition. His Honour further stated that the payment was also a “benefit in money” and that whatever category it fell into, it was clearly related to the employment or service of the defendant. Based on his findings of fact, his Honour held that the restraint of trade cases did not assist the defendant as it was not paid to stop the defendant working for another, but to remain working for the company. The Commissioner’s assessment was confirmed. 6.120,000 from the Development Finance Corporation. Decision In respect of the 500,000 shares given to the disputant as an inducement for leaving his law practice, Judge Barber held that they did not come within section 65(2)(e). His Honour stated: “Whatever the objector may have brain-washed himself into now believing, it is not credible that a man of his integrity and prominence would accept the inducement shares for no monetary consideration on a short term basis. Indeed, it is commercially disturbing to me that such a proposition has been so earnestly advanced for the objector.” However, in respect of 470,332 shares acquired up to January 1987, Judge Barber accepted that the disputant acquired the shares with a purpose of resale. His Honour said: “That was his evidence on oath and, all in all, other evidence is neutral on the point. I do not think that the objector is an untruthful witness although, as already indicated, I think he has brainwashed himself on some aspects and, with a lapse of time, become a little hazy on some key matters. However, bearing in mind that the onus of proof is on the objector to the standard of the balance of probabilities, I am just able to accept his evidence that the shares acquired \[the 470,332 shares\] ... were broadly for his original purpose of resale...” In respect of his interest in his farming partnership Judge Barber said: “I am just able to accept his evidence that he then intended to sell the shares as soon as he felt appropriate in the short- term.” Overall Judge Barber held that 470,332 shares were acquired on revenue account and 644,000 shares on capital account. However, the majority of the loss relates to the shares on revenue account. WHETHER LOSS INCURRED ON THE SALE OF SHARES WAS DEDUCTIBLE Case:TRA Number 001/00. Decision Number 3/2001 Decision date:10 April 2001 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Section 65(2)(e) Summary Both the Commissioner and the disputant were partially successful (the disputant was allowed to deduct 53% of the loss claimed). Facts The disputant purchased approximately fifteen parcels of shares between 1985 and 1989 in a company that he founded and was the managing director of. In 1991 he sold all the shares to his family trust with a loss on the sale of $494,469.40. A total of 1,114,342 shares were involved. The disputant acquired the majority of the shares as follows: 1.100,000 shares at the time of the company’s public float. 2.90,000 shares from the disputant’s family trust. 3.59,400 shares from a sharebroker. 4.512,998 shares in consideration for the company acquiring a farming partnership of which the disputant was a member (300,000 of these shares were not at issue in this case). 5.500,000 shares as an inducement to leave the disputant’s law practice and give his available time to the company. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 5 (May 2001) 62 PROPERTIES APPLIED FOR NON-TAXABLE PURPOSE Case:CIR v Carswell Investments Co Ltd Decision date:3 May 2001 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Section 21(1), adjustments Summary The Commissioner was successful in his appeal from the Taxation Review Authority. Facts Carswell Investments Co Limited (“Carswell”) is a property development company. Its main activity during the relevant period (April 1995 to March 1998) was the acquisition of vacant sections onto which existing houses were relocated. This case concerned twenty properties that were let as rental accommodation pending their sale. The Commissioner and the taxpayer agreed that the principal purpose for which the properties were held was a taxable one (property development) but the Commissioner considered that the letting of houses (an exempt supply (section 14(c))) brought section 21(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 into play. Section 21(1) (since amended) is entitled “Adjustments”. In the TRA Judge Willy, though recognising he was bound by the earlier High Court decision of Giles J in CIR v Morris (1997) 18 NZTC 13,385, distinguished this case from Morris on its facts. Morris was an appeal from a TRA decision of Judge Barber (Case S81). Judge Willy made it clear that he preferred an alternative approach taken by Judge Barber in Case S81 stating “if I was free to I would have applied the reasoning of Judge Barber.” However, Judge Willy described the facts of this case as “a far cry from the facts of the Morris case.” His Honour held that the properties were let to facilitate their security while they were marketed for sale, rather than to derive rents from them. Decision Panckhurst J, found for the Commissioner. His Honour endorsed the reasoning of Giles J in Morris and held that it applied in this case. He noted that there was a distinction in section 21(1) between “principal purpose” and “a purpose”. He also noted that Giles J had also recognised the difference between motive and purpose. However, Panckhurst J considered that this distinction might not be that helpful in cases like this. Panckhurst J also accepted Giles J’s reasoning that the test for purpose is objective and that the search is for a new purpose, which is separate and distinct from the principal purpose. Panckhurst J also noted that an appeal from the TRA is by way of rehearing and therefore that the High Court is required to reconsider the essential issues and reach its own conclusion. His Honour also noted that this was not “a case where issues of credibility loomed large and where therefore the trial Judge enjoyed a marked advantage.” In respect of the TRA decision Panckhurst J stated: “With respect I am of the clear view that the Authority in this case erred in reaching the conclusion that there was no subsequent purpose, non-taxable in nature, to attract the operation of s21(1). “The key finding that the properties were let to facilitate their security while they were marketed for sale, not to derive rents from them, is simply at odds with the objective facts of this case. It is inescapable that Carswell was involved in substantial domestic rental activity. Income of about $377,000 was generated over the three relevant financial years, an agreed fact which incidentally was not acknowledged let alone faced up to in the decision under appeal. I do not suggest that security was not part of the motivation for Carswell in letting the properties, but to seize upon it as the company’s purpose, to the exclusion of the rental income activity, was in my view unreal.” Panckhurst J also considered the duration of the tenancies: “Eight of the twenty properties were let throughout the entire three year period. The average time for which the properties were let was about twenty-three months... Again the judgment does not confront this aspect of the evidence.” Panckhurst J held that there was a subsequent purpose in this case and that section 21(1) applied.

Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 3 BINDING RULINGS This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet Adjudication & Rulings, a guide to Binding Rulings (IR 715) or the article on page 1 of Tax Information Bulletin Vol 6, No 12 (May 1995) or Vol 7, No 2 (August 1995). You can download these publications free of charge from our website at www.ird.govt.nz PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/07 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by BNZ Investment Management Ltd as trustee of the BNZ 25 NZ Equity Index Fund (the “Fund”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section HH 3(5) and the definitions of “superannuation fund” and “qualifying trust” in section OB 1 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the operation by the Bank of New Zealand of a superannuation fund known as the BNZ 25 NZ Equity Index Fund. The operation of the Fund is governed by the Trust Deed dated 24 th February 1997. The Trust Deed was amended on 23 March 2001 (“the Amended Trust Deed”). Major changes effected by the Amended Trust Deed are as follows: •A definition of “Cash Pool” has been added which sets out the terms and purposes of the cash pool. •The definition of “Quarter” has been amended. It is now defined as the three months ending on the 15 th of April, July, October and January respectively. •The investment policy of the Fund has been amended to include an investment policy for the cash pool. •The “home exchange” of equities in the Index, has been amended so that the “home exchange” can be New Zealand or any of the “grey-list” countries. •The minimum liquidity measure for inclusion in the Index has been increased from 0.5% to 0.75%. •The discretion to elect to include a substitute security in the same company in the case of constituent securities, which are identical except for ownership restrictions, has been removed. •The clause governing when securities listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (“NZSE”) for the first time will be included in the Index has been amended to set out the criteria for inclusion in the Index. •A clause has been added to address the situation where there is a merger, take-over offer or scheme of arrangement for 100% of the issued securities of any company’s shares forming part of the Index. The current arrangement is the original arrangement as amended. Details of the Arrangement as it will be on entering into the Amended Trust Deed are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Trustee of the Fund is BNZ Investment Management Ltd (“the Trustee”). The Fund acts as a “wholesale” superannuation fund into which other “retail” superannuation funds invest. The Fund also operates for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to the limited number of natural persons who invest directly in it. The minimum investment amount required in respect of natural persons is $200,000. 2.The Fund is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, as are the “retail” superannuation funds which invest in it. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 4 3.Members of the Fund will receive payments from the Fund on withdrawal of part or all of the relevant member’s account (being the account maintained for the member under the Trust Deed). Withdrawal may occur as a result of a request made at any time after a member attains the age of 50 years, on death of a member upon a request being made by the member’s legal personal representatives, or at any other time upon a withdrawal request being made by a member. 4.The fund is a passive investment vehicle, investing only in a portfolio of equity securities each of which is listed on the NZSE. The Fund will be managed so as to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities which together form the constituent part of an Index known as the BNZ 25 Equity Index (“the Index”). 5.The Index comprises up to 25 of the largest New Zealand equity securities listed on the NZSE, based on average weekly market capitalisation. The Fund will not be subject to any active management as such. Rather, it will be managed to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities that together form the constituent parts of the Index. The weighting of each security in the Index will reflect its respective market capitalisation on the NZSE at the relevant date. 6.The “home” exchange of each stock can be any of the “grey list” countries as they are defined in New Zealand tax law. If the equity security is listed on the NZSE and meets the other criteria, it will be included in the Index. There is no discretion as to whether a grey-list country security listed on the NZSE is included in the Index. The equity securities will normally be shares but there may also be convertible notes. 7.The market capitalisation for securities that have their “home” exchange outside New Zealand will be calculated under the standard NZSE rules for weighting of non-New Zealand equities. 8.Where identical constituent securities exist in the market except for ownership restrictions (such as Air New Zealand A and B shares) (“identical securities”), the Index previously only included one of those constituent securities. The Index will now include all the identical securities. 9.Approximately 95% of the net asset value of the Fund will be invested in such investments as the Trustee considers necessary to track the Index. While the majority of available funds will be invested to track the Index, a “cash pool” of the net assets of the Fund will be maintained in order to minimise the number of sale and purchase transactions and to fund any daily net fund withdrawals and net fund inflows pending purchase of equity securities and to manage the liquidity of the Fund in respect of meeting anticipated liabilities, withdrawals and distributions. The pool is only invested in bank accounts, cash or futures contracts that give appropriate equity exposure. 10.Changes will only be made to the Index composition in the following circumstances: (a) When this ruling is issued, and the consequential changes are made to the Trust Deed, the Trustee will recalculate the index taking into account the dual-listed securities that enter the Index, the inclusion of all identical securities (as discussed above in paragraph 8) and the higher liquidity threshold. This will result in a number of existing index securities being replaced. (b) At the end of each quarter, securities will be ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the previous 6-month period. If a security not previously included in the Index has risen at the quarter end above 21st position, that security will be included as a constituent security in the Index and the lowest ranked Index security held at the quarter end will be removed. If a security that is currently included in the Index at the quarter end has dropped below a ranking of 30th, that security will be removed as a constituent security from the Index and the highest ranked security at the quarter end not already included in the Index will be included. An amendment to the Trust Deed is proposed so that “quarter” is defined as the three months ending on the 15th of April, July, October and January respectively. Currently, the quarterly rebalancing occurs at the end of a month. (c) At the end of each quarter, securities are reviewed with regard to compliance with the necessary minimum liquidity requirements. In order to be included and to maintain inclusion in the Index, a constituent security must meet a minimum liquidity requirement. Liquidity is defined as the average daily trading volume of a security (over a 6-month period leading up to the end of the relevant quarter, after eliminating the highest and lowest Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 5 months), expressed as a percentage of the total issued and quoted securities of the same class. The minimum liquidity measure for inclusion in the Index is 0.75% per month. This requirement does not apply to a security listed on the NZSE for the first time until the end of the second complete quarter following listing. If there are less than 25 securities which meet the minimum liquidity requirements, then there may be less than 25 securities included in the Index. (d) If an event such as a share issue or share buy-back occurs so as to increase or decrease the number of any constituent security on issue and that increase or decrease, measured by market capitalisation on a cumulative basis since the last adjustment, is less than 0.03% of the Index, then any adjustments to the Index will be made at the end of the quarter in which the number of listed securities are increased or decreased. In the event that an increase or decrease represents more than 0.03% of the Index, an adjustment to the Index will be made, subject to five business days’ notice, on the 15th of the month in which the number of listed securities is increased or decreased. (e) If a security is listed on the NZSE for the first time, it will be included in the Index in the month of listing if: (i) it ranks, in terms of market capitalisation, above 21st position (compared with other Index securities ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the previous 6-month period); and (ii) at least 25% of the security is freely tradeable at the time of listing. If the security is listed before the 15th day of the month, it will be included in the Index on the 15th day and otherwise will be included at the end of the month. The security previously ranked 25th within the Index at that time will be removed. If a security listed on the NZSE for the first time does not meet the 25% free float test at the time of listing but meets that 25% test at the end of the quarter in which listing occurs or the following quarter, it will be included in the Index at the relevant quarter end (subject to ranking above 21st at that time). Again, the security previously ranked 25th will be removed at that time. (f)If the Trustee recommends, and the Fund’s auditors agree, the Index must be altered to reflect a material change to the rules governing the NZSE 40 Index structure made by the NZSE. (g) If there is a merger, takeover offer or scheme of arrangement sanctioned by the High Court for 100% of the issued securities of a company: (i) the company’s securities will be removed from the Index when the offeror or aquiror becomes entitled to, and announces that it will, proceed with compulsory acquisition; and (ii) if the offer has less than 100% acceptance, but nevertheless proceeds and, at that time or any time after the merger, takeover offer or scheme of arrangement proceeds, less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable as a result of the merger or takeover offer, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. 11.The Trustee will use best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible. In circumstances where the Trustee is using best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible, deviation from the Index may occur where it is not possible to exactly replicate the Index for one or more of the following reasons: (a) The time taken to buy equities; (b) Difficulties in acquiring equities; (c) Rounding errors; or (d) Price fluctuations but in any such case deviation from the Index will not exceed the following levels: (a) in the case of securities the Index weighting of which is 10% or greater of the total Index, the deviation from the Index replication is no larger than 1% of the Index; or (b) in the case of securities whose Index weighting is less than 10% of the Index, the deviation from the Index replication is no greater than 10% of the relevant security’s weighting in the Index. 12.The Trustee has appointed an independent party (the Fund’s auditors) to provide an annual confirmation that the operations of the Fund have conformed to these criteria. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 6 13.The minimum subscription amount for a natural person investing in the Fund is $200,000. The Trustee is authorised to accept from an investor a subscription in kind, i.e. a subscription in the form of a basket of securities that achieves a result of the Fund tracking the then Index composition. 14.Disposition of securities by the Trustee on behalf of the Fund (other than those in the cash pool) will only occur in the following circumstances: (a) It is anticipated that the 25 largest listed New Zealand equity securities will alter significantly when the Trust Deed is amended as proposed and dual-listed securities are included, all identical securities are included and the liquidity threshold is raised. (b) If the Fund is ever wound up. (c) If, at any time, the Index composition changes and as a result the composition of the securities in the Fund no longer tracks the weightings in the Index. (d) If, on any day, there is a net withdrawal of funds from the Fund by investing superannuation funds or natural persons which cannot be met out of the cash pool. (e) If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met other than as a result of liquidating some securities. This is not anticipated, but the Trustee needs some ultimate protection against extraordinary circumstances such as, say, a change in taxation law or an unanticipated liability or expense. In respect of the events under subparagraphs (a) to (e), sales of securities will only be made to the extent required in each case. 15.A fee will be payable to the Trustee of 0.3% per annum of the value of the net assets of the Fund. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)The Fund is registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. b)“Retail” funds which invest in the Fund will be registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicant and the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicant and the Arrangement as follows: •The Fund is a “superannuation fund” as defined in section OB 1. •The Fund is a “qualifying trust” under paragraph (b) of the definition of “qualifying trust” in section OB 1 of the Act. •By virtue of section HH 3(5), any amounts received by investors from the Fund shall not be included in the gross income of the investor. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 28th day of March 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 7 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/08 Key aspects of the prospectus are as follows: (i)Investors (also referred to as “members” or “growers”) purchase a minimum parcel of 250 “D” class shares of $1 each in a land owning company (BOGL): additional shares may be applied for in parcels of 250. (ii)Holders of “D” class shares have the following rights: •A member shall have the absolute right to occupy one “Farm” (or section of olive grove) in respect of each 250 “D” Class shareholding held by that member, subject to the payment of all moneys due to BOGL. The Farm shall be an identified area of land as nearly as practicable in area to 0.08 hectares and suitable for the planting of 20 olive trees at spacings of approximately 5 metres by 8 metres. The member’s Farm or Farms will be separately identified on a master plan maintained under the supervision of the directors of BOGL. •A member shall have an absolute right to process up to 1.5 tonnes of olives per annum in respect of each 250 “D” Class shareholding, subject to the payment of Factory Access Fees. The time allotted for each member’s processing operations will be advised at least two weeks prior to commencement of the harvest period. The member may exchange his or her allotted time with any other member or members with the approval of BOGL: such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. The time allotted per 250 “D” Class shareholding will be as near as practicable to one half-hour and will be with respect to a machine or machines capable of processing in excess of 3 tonnes per hour. •A member shall have the right to own and operate a business, as defined by the Constitution of BOGL, for the commercial cultivation and harvesting of olives on the member’s Farm and the sale of produce therefrom. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Barkworth Olive Groves Pty Limited (“BOGL”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections EP 1, BD 2(1)(b)(i), BD 2(2)(e), EG 1, and the section OB 1 definition of “depreciable property”. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the potential application (if any) of sections EF 1 and BG 1, or Determination E 10. This Ruling considers expense deductibility in relation to section BD 2(1)(b)(i) (incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income). Accordingly it has not been necessary for the purposes of this Ruling to consider or rule on whether investors are carrying on a business for the purposes of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the purchase of a minimum of 250 “D” class shares in BOGL, and the growing of olives on certain land situated in Australia in respect of which the shares provide the right to grow olives, and the appointment of Barkworth Olive Management Limited (“BOML”) to manage the growing, processing and marketing of those olives. This Ruling only applies to investors who appoint BOML to manage their Farms. All amounts quoted in this Ruling are exclusive of Australian GST (if any). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Arrangement is governed by the terms of the “Barkworth Olive Groves Project No. 4” (“Project No. 4”) prospectus dated 3 March 2000 (“the prospectus”). Project No. 4 is in no way dependent on the Barkworth Group’s three existing projects and may be operated independently of the other three. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 8 •A member shall also have the right to own and operate a business as defined in the Constitution of BOGL, for the commercial processing and marketing of processed olive products which include, but are not necessarily limited to, olive oil and pickled table olives. •A member shall have the right to use the agricultural infrastructure which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, roads around the property, access to irrigation mains and storage areas. This will be subject to the reasonable regulations imposed by BOGL’s directors. •A member shall have the right to use the processing infrastructure which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, loading and unloading equipment, storage areas, grading and sampling equipment. This will be subject to the reasonable regulations imposed by BOGL’s directors. •A member shall have the right to appoint BOML to manage his or her interests in accordance with the Management Agreement. Alternatively, growers have the right to manage the business personally or to appoint an employee, contractor, or agent to manage the business on their behalf. •A member shall have the right to assign, transfer, or otherwise deal with the abovementioned special rights to any person, persons, or corporation with the approval of the directors of BOGL: such approval not to be unreasonably withheld. (iii)The rights attaching to “D” Class shares expire on 1 July 2020 and, in accordance with the Constitution of BOGL, become ordinary shares. At that time BOGL will assume responsibility for, and the benefits of, the olive trees and from then on the member’s benefits will be derived from the member’s interest in BOGL by virtue of shares held. (iv) A member or his or her assignee is obliged to ensure the efficient running of the business. If an employee, contractor, or agent is engaged to fulfil this function, BOGL must be satisfied in regard to the competence of that person or corporation and give its written approval. Relationship between BOGL and members (v) The members’ interests are separate from the operation of the business of BOGL. (vi) BOGL will derive income from annual Farm Administration Fees received from members. The year one Administration Fee in respect of the 2000 - 2001 year will be $88 for each parcel of 250 “D” Class shares allotted to the member. (vii) In year two the Administration Fee will be $75 payable in advance. (viii)Thereafter, until and including the year 2020, the annual Administration Fee shall be 10% of the gross income generated from the sale of olives attributable to the member’s Farm. (ix)BOGL will also derive income from the payment by the member of Factory Access Fees for each 250 “D” Class shareholding as follows: •Year 1 - $225 •Year 2 - $225 •Year 3 and thereafter – 15% of the gross income generated from the sale of processed olive products attributable to the member’s processing allocation. 90% of all income derived by BOGL for Factory Access Fees will be paid to the Factory Owner and the remaining 10% will be retained by BOGL to cover administration costs. BOGL may also derive income from the commercial use of that residue of BOGL land not being used for olive growing and from any direct interest in olive processing which BOGL may acquire. 2.The members may appoint BOML as the manager of the Farms. The Management Agreement is entered into between BOML and BOGL (as the agent of the members). 3.The Manager’s duties until 30 June 2001 (as provided in clause 4.1 of the Management Agreement) are as follows: (i)BOML will carry out the duties required to supply olive trees, plant olive trees on the grower’s Farm, bring the trees to an initial harvest, process olives (whether those olives are sourced from the Farm or elsewhere), and market olives and processed olive product.

If there is insufficient income earned from the sale of processed olives to pay this amount, the fee is capped at the income earned. (iii) In addition, if BOML procures and markets processed olive products on behalf of the grower, then BOML is entitled to be paid 85% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the processed olive products. From this fee BOML must pay all costs associated with procuring and marketing processed olive products. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 12 9.The Management Agreement makes the following provision for remuneration in the fourth and following years: (i)In consideration of BOML carrying out its duties under clause 4.3 for the fourth year and all subsequent years, BOML is entitled to be paid fees calculated according to the following table: Year no.% of gross% of gross incomeincome of of olivesprocessed olives 490%70% 590%70% 660%70% 750%70% 8 to 2040%70% (ii)In the above table, “Gross Income of Olives” means the gross income generated from the sale of olives attributable to the grower’s Farm, and “Gross Income of Processed Olives” means the gross income generated from the sale of processed olives attributable to the grower’s processing allocation.

However, some units may be acquired with funds from “designated sources” as defined in section HE 2 (3) (“category B units”). These category B units are subject to the same rules regarding income distribution and redemption of units as apply to category A unit holders. 6.Investors are able to redeem their units at any valuation time (weekly) by giving notice to the fund manager. Their units are redeemed in cash at a price equal to the current unit value. 7.It is possible for the fund manager, in the ordinary course of the fund manager’s activities, to purchase the units from the unit holders as an alternative to redemption. 8.The purchase price of the units paid by the fund manager is determined according to the current unit value. 9.Other facts of the Arrangement and relevant information are as set out in the prospectus of the Fund dated 30 September 1996. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)The Fund is a “qualifying trust” as defined in section OB 1; and b)All cancellations of units by the Fund are in whole but not in part; and c)None of the units is a “non-participating redeemable share” as defined in section CF 3 (14); and d)Any relevant cancellation is not, and does not form part of, a “pro rata cancellation” as defined in section CF 3 (14); and e)The Fund is an “unlisted trust” as defined in section CF 3 (14); and f)The units are issued on such terms that their redemption is subject to section CF 3 (1)(b)(iv)(B); and g)No election is made by the Fund to treat the category A units issued as shares of a separate class; and This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Ltd as Trustee for the NZGT30 Fund (“the Fund”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. •This Ruling applies in respect of sections BG 1, CF 2 (3), CF 2 (3A) and Subpart LE, CF 3 (1)(b), GB 1 (3), and HH 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling Applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of the Fund, pursuant to the Deed of Trust dated 5 September 1996 and Deed of Amendment dated 15 September 2000, which acts as a specialist investment fund to hold a portfolio of shares and other securities that match the composition and weighting of the NZSE 30 Capital Share Price Index (“Index”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The trustee and manager of the Fund is The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited. It is registered as a trustee company under the Trustee Companies Act 1967. The Fund is established under the Trustee Companies Act 1967 and meets the definition of “group investment fund” contained in section OB 1. The beneficial interest in the Fund is divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in the Fund, but does not confer any interest in any particular investment of the Fund. 2.Income derived by the Fund comprises of dividends, interest on convertible notes, gains on futures contracts and interest on deposited funds. This income is distributed to investors holding units in the Fund as at the income distribution date, which is semi-annually. 3.Each investor subscribes for the issue of units in the Fund. The issue price is determined by dividing the total market value of the net assets of the Fund by the number of units issued in the Fund (“current unit value”). Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 21 h)Any relevant cancellation is not an “on-market acquisition”; and i)At the date of redemption there is no arrangement for the units redeemed to be replaced by the subsequent issue of new units where the arrangement is intended to effect a substitution for the payment of dividends; and j)Any cancellations of units are only effected in order to allow unit holders to exit the Fund; and k)The unit holders do not in any way retain any interest in the units which are sold to the fund manager. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •In the case of a payment or transaction with an investor in the Fund that is a dividend under section CF 2 (3), section CF 2 (3A) will treat the Fund as if it were a company for the purposes of Subpart LE; and •The entire amount paid to category A unit holders on the redemption of their units is excluded from the definition of dividend by section CF 3 (1)(b) to the extent it does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled; and •In respect of category B income distributed to category B unit holders semi-annually this will be treated as “beneficiary income” for tax purposes and subject to section HH 3; and •Any gain on the redemption of category B units by a category B unit holder is not liable for income tax to the extent that it does not include beneficiary income, under section HH 3 (5). The accrued income component representing beneficiary income on distribution will be taxable to the category B unit holder; and •In the absence of other factors relating to the circumstances of any particular category A unit holder, any gain on the sale of the category A units to the fund manager does not of itself give rise to the application of section GB 1 (3) and section BG 1; and •In the absence of other factors relating to the circumstances of any particular category B unit holder, any gain on the sale of the category B units to the fund manager does not of itself give rise to the application of section BG 1. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 2001 until 30 June 2001. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29 th day of March 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 22 PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 01/13 3.The Index is an equivalent of the well-known NZSE 10 and NZSE 40 indices, except that it will comprise up to 25 of the largest listed New Zealand equity securities, measured by average weekly market capitalisation. As with the NZSE 10 and NZSE 40 indices, the weighting of each security in the Index will reflect its respective market capitalisation on the NZSE at the relevant date. The “home” exchange of each stock can be any of the “grey list” countries as they are defined in the New Zealand tax law. 4.If the equity security is listed on the NZSE and meets the other criteria, it will be included in the Index. The equity securities will normally be shares, but there may also be convertible notes. 5.The market capitalisation for securities that have their “home” exchange outside New Zealand will be calculated under the standard NZSE rules for weighting of non-New Zealand equities. 6.Where identical constituent securities exist in the market except for ownership restrictions (such as Air New Zealand A and B shares), the Index previously only included one of those constituent securities. The Index will now include all the identical securities. 7.Approximately 95% of the net asset value of the Trust Fund of the Trust will be invested in such investments as the Manager considers necessary to track the Index. While the majority of available funds will be invested to track the Index, a “cash pool” of the net assets of the Trust will be maintained in order to minimise the number of sale and purchase transactions and to fund any daily net fund withdrawals and net fund inflows pending purchase of equity securities and to manage the liquidity of the Trust in respect of meeting anticipated liabilities, withdrawals and distributions. The pool is only invested in bank accounts, cash, derivatives or futures contracts that give appropriate equity exposure. 8.The beneficial interest in the Trust is divided into units. Each unit (other than a fractional unit that will confer a proportional interest in the Trust) confers an equal interest in the Trust, but does not confer any interest in any particular part of the Trust or any investment of the Trust. This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the Public Trustee as trustee of the BNZ NZ Equity Index Trust (“the Trust”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CF 3(1)(b) and CF 3(7) and the definition of “excess return amount” in section CF 3(14). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the operation of the Trust which holds a portfolio of securities listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange (“NZSE”) and the repurchase by the Manager of, or arranging for the redemption of, units in the Trust for the Unit Holders. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1.The Bank of New Zealand (“the Settlor”) formed a unit trust, under the Unit Trusts Act 1960 known as BNZ NZ Equity Index Trust (“the Trust”). The operation of the Trust is governed by the Trust Deed dated 19 March 1997 as amended by Deeds of Modification dated 26 November 1998 and 23 March 2001. The Trust is managed by BNZ Investment Management Limited (“the Manager”) and its trustee is the Public Trustee (“the Trustee”). Members of the public hold units in the Trust and units in the Trust are offered to new investors continuously. 2.The Trust is a passive investment vehicle, managed so as to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities which together form the constituent part of the Index (“the Index”), known as the BNZ 25 Equity Index. The index comprises up to 25 of the largest New Zealand equity securities listed on the NZSE. The Trust will not be subject to any active management as such. Rather, it will be managed to track the composition of a set of listed equity securities that together form the constituent parts of the Index. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 23 9.Changes are made to the Index composition in the following circumstances: (a) When this ruling is issued, and the consequential changes are made to the Trust Deed, the Manager will recalculate the Index taking into account the dual- listed securities that enter the Index, the inclusion of all identical constituent securities (as discussed above in paragraph 6) and the higher liquidity threshold. This will result in a number of existing Index securities being replaced. (b) At the end of each quarter, securities will be ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the previous 6-month period. If a security not previously included in the Index has risen at the quarter end above 21st position, that security will be included as a constituent security in the Index and the lowest ranked Index security held at the quarter end will be removed. If a security that is currently included in the Index at the quarter end has dropped below a ranking of 30th, that security will be removed as a constituent security from the Index and the highest ranked security at the quarter end not already included in the Index will be included. An amendment to the Trust Deed is proposed so that “quarter” is defined as the three months ending on the 15th of April, July, October and January respectively. Currently, the quarterly rebalancing occurs at the end of a month. The change in date is purely administrative, that is, to avoid clashing with the end of the financial year of the Trust and to avoid the inconvenience resulting from the high level of market activity at that time. (c) At the end of each quarter, securities are reviewed with regard to compliance with the necessary minimum liquidity requirements. In order to be included and to maintain inclusion in the Index, a constituent security must meet a minimum liquidity requirement. Liquidity is defined as the average daily trading volume of a security (over a 6-month period leading up to the end of the relevant quarter, after eliminating the highest and lowest months), expressed as a percentage of the total issued and quoted securities of the same class. The minimum liquidity measure for inclusion in the Index is 0.75% per month. This requirement does not apply to a security listed on the NZSE for the first time until the end of the second complete quarter following listing. If there are less than 25 securities which meet the minimum liquidity requirements, then there may be less than 25 securities included in the Index. (d) If an event such as a share issue or share buy-back occurs so as to increase or decrease the number of any constituent security on issue and that increase or decrease, measured by market capitalisation on a cumulative basis since the last adjustment, is less that 0.03% of the Index, then any adjustments to the Index will be made at the end of the quarter in which the number of listed securities are increased or decreased. In the event that an increase or decrease represents more than 0.03% of the Index, an adjustment to the Index will be made, subject to five business days’ notice, on the 15th day or the last day (whichever next follows the relevant increase or decrease) of the month in which the number of listed securities is increased or decreased. (However, it should be noted that if there is a rights issue to existing security holders including the Trustee, the Manager will endeavour to take up the rights issue in anticipation of the change to the Index which is expected to result from the issue.) (e) If a security is listed on the NZSE for the first time, it will be included in the Index in the month of listing if: (i) it ranks, in terms of market capitalisation, above 21st position (compared with other Index securities ranked according to their average weekly market capitalisation for the previous 6-month period); and (ii) at least 25% of the security is freely tradeable at the time of listing. If the security is listed before the 15th day of the month, it will be included in the Index on the 15th day and otherwise will be included at the end of the month. The security previously ranked 25th within the Index at that time will be removed. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 24 If a security listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange for the first time does not meet the 25% free float test at the time of listing but meets that 25% test at the end of the quarter in which listing occurs or the following quarter, it will be included in the Index at the relevant quarter end (subject to ranking above 21st at that time). Again, the security previously ranked 25th will be removed at that time. (f)If the Manager recommends, and the independent party (the Trust’s auditors) agrees, the Index must be altered to reflect a material change to the rules governing the NZSE 40 Index structure made by the NZSE. (g) If there is a merger, takeover offer or scheme of arrangement sanctioned by the High Court for 100% of the issued securities of a company: (i) the company’s securities will be removed from the Index when the offeror or acquiror becomes entitled to, and announces that it will, proceed with compulsory acquisition; and (ii) if the offer has less than 100% acceptance but nevertheless proceeds and, at that time or any time after the merger, takeover offer or scheme of arrangement proceeds, less than 25% of the company’s securities are freely tradeable as a result of the merger, takeover offer or scheme of arrangement, the company’s securities will be removed from the Index. 10.The criteria stipulated in paragraph 9 (with the exception of subparagraphs (e), (f), and (g)) are similar to the criteria adopted with regard to the NZSE 10 Index. The Manager has appointed an independent party (the Trust’s auditors) to provide an annual confirmation that the operations of the Trust have conformed to these criteria. 11.The Manager will use best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible. In circumstances where the Manager is using best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible, deviation from the Index may occur where it is not possible to exactly replicate the Index for one or more of the following reasons: (a) The time taken to buy equities; (b) Difficulties in acquiring equities; (c) Rounding errors; or (d) Price fluctuation but in any such case deviation from the Index will not exceed the following tolerance levels: (a) in the case of securities the Index weighting of which is 10% or greater of the total Index, the deviation from the Index replication is no larger than 1% of the Index; or (b) in the case of securities whose Index weighting is less than 10% of the Index, the deviation from the Index replication is no greater than 10% of the relevant security’s weighting in the Index. 12.The minimum subscription amount for units in the Trust will be $5,000. Investors are able to subscribe for units in the Trust by making a cash payment. The Manager is authorised to accept from an investor a subscription in kind, i.e. a subscription in the form of a basket of securities that achieves a result of the Trust tracking the then Index composition. 13.Disposition of securities by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust (other than those in the cash pool) will only occur in the following circumstances: (a) It is anticipated that the 25 largest listed New Zealand equity securities will alter significantly when the Trust Deed is amended as proposed. Following these amendments dual-listed securities and all identical constituent securities are included in the Index and the liquidity threshold is also raised. Such dispositions will only occur once: when the trust Deed is amended and the Index recalculated. There is no profit-making purpose in any such disposition, and it will not involve any discretionary exercise of investment management powers. (b) If the Trust is ever wound up either by sale of securities for cash and distribution of the cash, or alternatively by distribution of securities in specie to investors holding units in the Trust. (c) If, at any time, the Index composition changes and as a result the composition of the securities in the Trust no longer tracks the weightings in the Index. Any such disposition will not involve any discretionary exercise of investment management powers. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 25 (d) If, on any day, there is a net withdrawal of funds from the Trust by investors holding units in the Trust. It is expected that dispositions of securities to fund withdrawals will be likely on at most a weekly basis. It will be possible for the Trustee to satisfy a withdrawal request by distributing a basket of securities in specie. (e) If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Trust that cannot be met other than as a result of liquidating some securities. This is not anticipated, but the Trustee needs some ultimate protection against extraordinary circumstances such as, say, a change in taxation law or an unanticipated liability or expense. In respect of the events under subparagraphs (a) to (e), sales of securities will only be made to the extent required in each case. 14.A fee will be payable to the Trustee of 0.07% per annum of the net assets of the Trust, calculated and accruing on a daily basis. A management fee is to be payable to the Manager of 0.95% per annum of the net assets of the Trust, calculated and accruing on a daily basis. No other general management fee will be levied, but it is contemplated that front-end promotion fees (entry fees) will be payable. 15.Any income on the held securities received by the Trustee in respect of the Fund will be distributed, on an annual basis, to investors holding units in the Trust at that point in time. To the extent that the distribution can be fully imputed, an amount equal to taxable gross income will be allocated to Unit Holders and reinvested, normally annually, by the Manager into new units on behalf of the Unit Holders. The Unit Holders will, therefore, derive dividends for tax purposes. In addition, it is possible that the Trust may on occasions distribute cash amounts on account of taxable gross income. 16.The Trust will generally determine dates of allocation of entitlements and the distribution periods to which entitlements relate in terms of clauses 32 and 33 of the Trust Deed so that investors receive distributions just prior to the 31 March of each year. 17.Under clause 32 of the Deed, the Manager is required to allocate taxable gross income to Unit Holders, and reinvest those amounts into new units on behalf of the Unit Holders. To the extent that the distribution can be fully imputed, an amount equal to taxable gross income will be allocated to Unit Holders and reinvested, normally annually, by the Manager into new Units on behalf of the Unit Holders. Any departure from this practice can only occur if Unit Holders elect to have their entitlements distributed in cash pursuant to clause 33.4 of the Trust Deed. 18.Unit Holders are able to redeem their units at any time by giving notice, in the form of a repurchase request, to the Manager. Their units will be redeemed at a price equal to the net assets of the Trust (adjusted to take into account the costs of selling the net assets of the Trust) at the time, divided by the number of units on issue. 19.It is possible for the Manager to purchase the units from the Unit Holders as an alternative to redemption. Where units are repurchased, the Manager will pay the Unit Holder a price equal to the net assets of the Trust (adjusted to take into account the costs of selling the net assets of the Trust) at the time, divided by the number of units on issue. 20.The issuing of units and their redemption will be effected directly by the Trustee. No units are otherwise quoted on the official list of any “recognised exchange”, as defined in section OB 1. All units will be issued on terms that the reverse ordering rule applies. 21.Any cancellation of units will only be effected in order to allow Unit Holders to exit the Trust or decrease their holding in the Trust, unless an investor’s unit holding falls below a minimum value specified in the Trust Deed, in which case the Manager can require the Unit Holder to redeem their units. Units will also be cancelled in the event that the Trust is liquidated. 22.Except in the event of liquidation of the Trust, any cancellation of units will be in response to the activities of a particular Unit Holder, and not all the Unit Holders of the Trust. All redemptions will be of whole units (including whole fractional units), not part units. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 26 Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a)Subject only to the second paragraph of this condition, the proportion of the Applicant’s assets to be held as the cash pool will not exceed what is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the purposes of the cash pool (as described in paragraphs 7 and 8 of this Ruling), and will not in any event exceed 5% of the total assets of the Trust. This condition will not be regarded as being breached if, pending investment of contributions or disbursement of the redemption proceeds, the Trust is forced to hold cash in excess of 5% of the net asset value of the Trust. In any such case the excess will only be to the extent, and exist only for the time, that is strictly necessary in order to invest contributions or disburse redemption proceeds and the Trust will invest or disburse such cash, as soon as possible. b)The cash pool must not be used in order to increase the performance of the Trust or to enhance the Trust Fund’s value. To the extent that the operation of the cash pool seeks to obtain the maximum market rate of return on cash pool investments, any such maximisation will not of itself be taken to be a breach of this condition. c)The reason for changing the end of the quarter from the end of the relevant month (being March, June, September, and December) to the 15th of the relevant month (being, April, July, October and January) is purely administrative. It is to avoid the need to undertake the re-balancing and matters associated with the end of the financial year of the Trust at the same time, and also to avoid a flurry of activities in the market at that time because of the large number of “passive” index-linked funds that are in existence in the market and rebalance then. The purpose of this change is not to increase the performance of the Trust or enhance the value of the share capital in the Trust. (d)The Manager will not exercise its discretion under clauses 32 and 33 of the Deed to determine the dates of allocation of entitlements and the distribution periods to which entitlements relate to increase the performance of the Trust or to enhance the Trust Fund’s value. (e)The Manager will only depart from the requirement to reinvest taxable distributions for Unit Holders in further units upon a written request from Unit Holders to do so pursuant to clause 33.4 of the Deed. (f)The Manager will use best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible. In circumstances where the Manager is using best endeavours to track the Index as closely as possible, deviation from the Index may occur where it is not possible to exactly replicate the Index for one or more of the following reasons: (i)The time taken to buy equities; (ii)Difficulties in acquiring equities; (iii)Rounding errors; or (iv)Price fluctuations, but in any such case, deviation from the Index will not exceed the following levels: (i)in the case of securities the Index weighting of which is 10% or greater of the total Index, the deviation from the Index replication is no larger than 1% of the Index; or (ii)in the case of securities whose Index weighting is less than 10% of the Index, the deviation from the Index replication is no greater than 10% of the relevant security’s weighting in the Index. g)Decisions by the Manager not to participate in dividend reinvestment plans will only be made to avoid an acquisition of equity securities that would lead to the Trust not tracking the Index. h)Dispositions resulting from changes to the Trust Deed, and the resultant inclusion of dual- listed securities and the inclusion of identical constituent securities will only occur once, and any disposition will not be to increase the performance of the Trust or to enhance the Trust Fund’s value or involve any discretionary exercise of investment management powers. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 27 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicant and the Arrangement Except in relation to Unit Holders who are non-resident companies holding 20% or more of the units in the Trust, and subject in all respects to the conditions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •Amounts paid from the Trust to Unit Holders on redemption of units do not constitute amounts paid in lieu of dividends for the purposes of section CF 3 (1)(b)(iii). •Equity securities of the Trust constitute “capital assets” for the purposes of section CF 3 (7) and the definition of “excess return amount” in section CF 3 (14). •For the purposes of the definition of the term “excess return amount” in section CF 3 (14), gains realised on dispositions of equity securities by the Trust are capital gain amounts available for distribution to Unit Holders at the time of winding up of the Trust in the present circumstances where prior distributions of amounts to Unit Holders on redemption of units will be treated as falling outside the definition of the term “dividend”, as a result of the application of section CF 3 (1)(b) and the reverse ordering rule. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29 th day of March 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 28 EMPLOYMENT COURT AWARDS FOR LOST WAGES OR OTHER REMUNERATION – EMPLOYERS’ LIABILITY TO MAKE TAX DEDUCTIONS PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 01/06 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: A. Monetary remuneration The payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under the Employment Relations Act 2000 is “monetary remuneration” of the employee as defined in section OB 1. As the payment is monetary remuneration, it is gross income of the employee under section CH 3. B. Employer’s liability to make tax deductions from the award The payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under the Employment Relations Act 2000 is an extra emolument and is a “source deduction payment” under section OB 2 (1). The employer must make tax deductions from the payment under section NC 2 and account for those deductions to Inland Revenue in the normal way. If an employer fails to make the required tax deductions from a payment, the employee is liable, under section NC 16, to pay an amount equal to those tax deductions to the Commissioner (and is also required to furnish to the Commissioner an employer monthly schedule showing details of the payment). C. When the payment is derived by the employee Under section EB 1 (1), an employee derives a payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under the Employment Relations Act 2000 when the employee receives the payment, or when the payment is credited to an account or otherwise dealt with on the employee’s behalf. A person who is a shareholder-employee for the purposes of section EB 1 (as defined in sections OB 1 and OB 2 (2)) derives a payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under the Employment Relations Act 2000, in the income year that the expenditure on that award is deductible to the employer. If the expenditure on the award is not deductible to the employer, the shareholder-employee derives the award in the year of receipt. Note (not part of ruling): This ruling replaces Public Rulings BR Pub 97/7 and 97/7A published in TIB Vol 9, No 6 (June 1997). This new ruling is essentially the same as the previous rulings. The main changes take into account the new employment legislation and tax law amendments, and update relevant case references. The ruling applies from 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2005. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CH 3, EB 1, NC 2, NC 16 , OB 1 (definitions of “employee”, “extra emolument”, “monetary remuneration”, and “shareholder-employee”), and OB 2 (definition of “source deduction payment”). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is an order by the Employment Court or the Employment Relations Authority requiring an employer to make a payment for lost wages or other remuneration to an employee under the Employment Relations Act 2000. The Court or Authority will make such an award when an employee has lost wages or other remuneration as a result of an action by the employer which has been the subject of a personal grievance by the employee against the employer (e.g. unjustifiable dismissal or other unjustifiable action by the employer). An award for lost wages or other remuneration will usually be made under sections 123(b) or 128 of the Employment Relations Act, but may be made under another provision. This Ruling does not apply to an award of compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings made under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 29 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received between 1 October 2000 and 30 September 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12 th day of June 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR PUB 01/06 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/06 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Rulings BR Pub 97/7 and 97/7A published in TIB Vol 9, No 6 (June 1997). The Ruling applies for the period from 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2005. The commentary refers to the Income Tax Act 1994, particularly section CH 3 and the concept of “gross income”. Background The Employment Relations Act 2000 provides for a number of remedies when an employee has a personal grievance against a current or former employer. This includes compensation for wages lost by the employee as a result of actions by the employer which are the subject of a personal grievance. Such compensation will usually be awarded under sections 123(b) or 128 of the Act but may be made under another provision. For example, in Cleland v CIR AP 44/00 High Court, Hamilton, 30 April 2001, Hammond J was concerned with the assessability of part of an award made by the Employment Court in 1992. The Employment Court awarded compensation for lost wages up to the date of hearing under the equivalent of section 128 of the Employment Relations Act. An award for lost wages from that date on was made under the equivalent of section 123(c)(ii) which provides for compensation for the loss of a benefit. The law in this area seems to be evolving and while awards for lost wages or other remuneration are now generally made under section 123(b), the Ruling will apply under whatever provision such an award is made. This Ruling confirms the Commissioner’s existing practice in respect of the assessability and deduction of tax from awards for lost wages or other remuneration made under the Employment Relations Act 2000. Legislation Relevant provisions of the Employment Relations Act 2000 Section 103 of the Employment Relations Act 2000 (“the ERA”) defines “personal grievance” as: For the purposes of this Act, “personal grievance” means any grievance that an employee may have against the employee’s employer or former employer because of a claim— (a)that the employee has been unjustifiably dismissed; or (b)that the employee’s employment, or 1 or more conditions of the employee’s employment (including any condition that survives termination of the employment), is or are or was (during employment that has since been terminated) affected to the employee’s disadvantage by some unjustifiable action by the employer; or (c)that the employee has been discriminated against in the employee’s employment; or (d)that the employee has been sexually harassed in the employee’s employment; or (e)that the employee has been racially harassed in the employee’s employment; or (f)that the employee has been subject to duress in the employee’semployment in relation to membership or non-membership of a union or employees organisation. Section 103(3) provides: In subsection (1)(b), unjustifiable action by the employer does not include an action deriving solely from the interpretation, application, or operation, or disputed interpretation, application, or operation, of any provision of any employ- ment agreement. Section 123(b) of the ERA states: Where the Authority or the Court determines that an employee has a personal grievance, it may, in settling the grievance, provide for any 1 or more of the following remedies: ... (b)the reimbursement to the employee of a sum equal to the whole or any part of the wages or other money lost by the employee as a result of the grievance ... Section 128 of the ERA states: (1) This section applies where the Authority or Court determines, in respect of any employee, - (a)that the employee has a personal grievance; and (b)that the employee has lost remuneration as a result of the personal grievance. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 30 (2) If this section applies then, subject to subsection (3) and section 124, the Authority must, whether or not it provides for any of the other remedies provided for in section 123, order the employer to pay to the employee the lesser of a sum equal to that lost remuneration or to 3 months’ ordinary time remuneration. (3) Despite subsection (2), the Authority may, in its discretion, order an employer to pay to an employee by way of compensation for remuneration lost by that employee as a result of the personal grievance, a sum greater than that to which an order under that subsection may relate. Section 124 of the ERA states: Where the Authority or the Court determines that an employee has a personal grievance, the Authority or Court must, in deciding both the nature and the extent of the remedies to be provided in respect of that personal grievance,— (a)consider the extent to which the actions of the employee contributed towards the situation that gave rise to the personal grievance; and (b)if those actions so require, reduce the remedies that would otherwise have been awarded accordingly. Application of the Legislation Monetary remuneration An award for lost wages or other remuneration is made to compensate the employee for wages or other remuneration he or she may have lost as a result of an action by the employer which has been the subject of a personal grievance by the employee against the employer. The wages or other remuneration that would have been received if it were not for the personal grievance are “monetary remuneration”. Section OB 1 defines “monetary remuneration” as meaning: ... any salary, wage, allowance, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer ... The words “emolument (of whatever kind) or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer ...” cover an award for lost wages or other remuneration. The payment of the award for lost wages or other remuneration is made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”, even though the payment is made to resolve a personal grievance rather than for services actually performed. A wide interpretation of the words “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service” was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, in response to Shell’s argument that a payment was not made in respect of or in relation to employment because it was not made under a contract of employment. The Court stated that the words “in respect of or in relation to” are words of the widest import. The Court also found that the words “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” were not to be read ejusdem generis with the preceding words, the genus being reward for services. Thus, for the purposes of the definition of “monetary remuneration”, the words “emolument ... or other benefit in money” are not confined to rewards for services. In Shell the Court found it important that the employees were only in a position to receive compensation payments (for changing the employees’ place of employment) because of their employment relationship with the employer. So, although the employees received compensation for the costs of moving rather than payments for services, this was still monetary remuneration. Similarly, the lost wages or other remuneration awarded on the personal grievance claim arise directly out of and as a result of an employee’s employment relationship with the employer. Again, although this is not a payment for services, it is within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. The earlier TRA decisions on the previous legislation also illustrate the wide meaning that may be attributed to the words “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. In Case L92 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,530, Barber DJ considered the term “monetary remuneration” in relation to a payment of compensation for unjustified dismissal under the Industrial Relations Act 1973. The compensation was calculated on the basis of the personal hurt and procedural unfairness suffered by the objector. Barber DJ found that, even though the compensation was damages in nature, it was money received in respect of the objector’s employment. He stated that the words “compensation for loss of office or employment”, “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” and “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer” have a wide embrace and go beyond the narrower concept of “salary, wage, allowance, bonus gratuity, extra salary” which precede them. On the particular facts of this case he said that “monetary remuneration”, interpreted widely, covered the payment in issue. Barber DJ reached the same conclusion in relation to a similar compensation payment in Case L78 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,451. This case examined the nature of an ex gratia payment made to an employee as a result of a personal grievance claim brought against the employer under section 117 of the Industrial Relations Act 1973 which covered reimbursement for lost wages. The ex gratia payment was made up of six weeks’ holiday pay and pay for untaken sick leave. This holiday and sick leave was not owing to the taxpayer. The payment, which the taxpayer said he regarded as “extra wages”, was held to fall within the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section 2 of that Act. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 31 In Case P19 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,127, Barber DJ examined whether a severance payment of $77,598 paid to an objector by his overseas employer was assessable income. The objector was a jockey who entered into a three-year oral contract to ride his employer’s horses. The employer became dissatisfied with the objector’s performance and unilaterally terminated the contract after about 4 months. After negotiation, the matter was settled on the basis that the employer made the severance payment. Barber DJ held that “the severance payment was made as compensation for the objector’s loss of income due to the millionaire having terminated the contractual relationship”. He inferred that “the payment was a top-up of the first year’s minimum income” made to “assist the objector re-build his income earning process” and said that that type of payment “must be revenue in nature”. He stated that: In terms of the definition of “monetary remuneration”, the payment made to the objector must be “compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer;” Although not concerning a Court award, Case P19 supports the proposition that payments made as compensation for loss of income fall within the definition of monetary remuneration. In Case S96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603 and Case U38 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,361 the taxpayers in each case did not dispute that the portion of their compensation payment that was for lost wages was taxable, and this was accepted by the TRA. Doogue J in the High Court decision in Sayer v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,249 also accepted the assessability of the part of a settlement agreement attributed to lost remuneration. In Case U39 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,369 an IRD officer was awarded compensation of $126,000 being $46,000 (loss of wages), $30,000 (humiliation), and $50,000 (loss of benefits) by the Employment Court in 1992. The Commissioner accepted that the humiliation payment was not assessable and assessed the balance of $96,000. Barber DJ readily found that the compensation for lost wages was monetary remuneration, and so was the compensation for loss of benefits. He said (at paragraph 26, p 9,374): Awards made by the Employment Court pursuant to ss 227(c)(ii) above and 229 (for lost income) of the Labour Relations Act 1987 are generally deemed to be “monetary remuneration” and assessable income pursuant to s 65(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Indeed, because awards under s 229 are a reimbursement of, or compensation for, “lost remuneration” for the worker, any such award (in this case $50,000 \[sic\] of the $96,000 in issue) must, obviously, be revenue in character and within the above s 2 (of the Act) definition of “monetary remuneration”, and assessable. (Section 128 of the Employment Relations Act 2000 is the equivalent of section 229 of the Labour Relations Act). In his decision on appeal dated 30 April 2001, Hammond J upheld the TRA’s decision: Cleland v CIR AP44/00 High Court, Hamilton. He found that the reimbursement of lost wages was “monetary remuneration”, saying, at paragraph 41: I cannot see how the loss of wages due up to the date of hearing under s229 ($46,000) is not “monetary remunera- tion” under s2 of the Income Tax Act 1976. He went on to find that the $50,000 awarded by the Employment Court under section 227(c)(ii) for loss of benefits, which included an element of future wages, was also assessable as “monetary remuneration”. As noted earlier in this commentary, the law in this area seems to have moved on from requiring a division of awards of lost wages between those up to the date of the hearing (under the reimbursement remedy), and those from that date on (under the loss of benefits remedy). Compensation for lost wages, including those that the employee would have been likely to receive over some future period but for the grievance, are generally awarded under section 123(b) of the Employment Relations Act. See for example, Trotter v Telecom Corporation of NZ Ltd \[1993\] 2 NZER 659. These cases clearly indicate that an award for lost wages or other remuneration is assessable as monetary remuneration. All monetary remuneration is gross income of the employee. When the employment relationship has ended In some cases the employment relationship of the employer and employee will have ended by the time the employer pays the court award to the employee. The fact that the employment relationship may have ended by the time the employer pays the award does not change the fact that the award is made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service” of the former employee. In Freeman & Ors. v FC of T (1982) 82 ATC 4,629 the Supreme Court of Victoria found that a payment is made “in relation to the employment” of a former employee when the entitlement to that payment arises out of the employment or from services performed by the employee before the termination of employment. In Freeman the taxpayers were directors, shareholders, and employees of the appellant company which ceased to carry on business. The next day the business was sold to another company controlled by the taxpayers and carried on business as before. Six months later it was decided that the appellant company should pay to each of the taxpayers certain lump sum payments. The evidence suggested that the source of the greater part of the payments consisted of fees (or “salaries”) received by the appellant company after it ceased carrying on business. The Court found that the payments received by the appellants were assessable income under section 26(e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936–1978. Section 26(e) Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 32 provided that assessable income included the value to the taxpayer of all allowances, gratuities, compensations, benefits, bonuses and premiums given to him or her in relation directly or indirectly to their employment or services rendered by him or her. Kaye J found that payments out of the income of the appellant company to employees by way of allowances for past services, which had been rendered by them, were within section 26(e). The decision on this aspect of the case was unchanged when the appeal was heard by the Federal Court. Awards for lost wages or other remuneration arise out of the employee’s previous service with the employer. A court award that compensates for lost wages or other remuneration is made as a result of the employee’s service with the employer, and so is made in relation to the employment of the employee. Employer’s liability to make tax deductions from the award for lost wages or other remuneration The Ruling states that the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration is a source deduction payment. Under section NC 2 (1), an employer must make the appropriate tax deduction from every source deduction payment made to an employee. Award is a source deduction payment The definition in section OB 2 (1) of “source deduction payment” includes a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument, or a withholding payment. Section OB 1 defines “extra emolument” as: ... in relation to any person, means a payment in a lump sum (whether paid in one lump sum or in 2 or more instalments) made to that person in respect of or in relation to the employment of that person (whether for a period of time or not), being a payment which is not regularly included in salary or wages payable to that person for a pay period, but not being overtime pay ... An award for lost wages or other remuneration is generally paid in a lump sum. As discussed above, the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration is made to a person in respect of or in relation to the employment of that person. As the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration is made in a lump sum, is in respect of or in relation to employment of a person, and is not a payment of salary or wages, it is an extra emolument. As the payment of the award is an extra emolument, it is included in the definition of “source deduction payment”. A former employee is an “employee” Section NC 2 requires an employer to make tax deductions from source deduction payments to employees. Section OB 1 defines “employee” as a person who receives or is entitled to receive a source deduction payment. As discussed above, the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration constitutes a source deduction payment. A payment can still be “monetary remuneration” and a source deduction payment when it is paid to a former employee. A former employee who is entitled to receive this source deduction payment is also an “employee” for the purposes of section NC 2 (even though he or she may no longer be in an employment relationship with the employer). The appropriate tax deduction Section NC 2 requires the employer to make the appropriate tax deduction from source deduction payments to employees. As the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration constitutes an “extra emolument”, the employer must deduct tax at the extra emolument rate as provided for in section NC 2(5) and clause 8 of Schedule 19. (This currently provides a minimum rate of 21 cents in the dollar, or 33 cents or 39 cents in the dollar depending on the recipient’s income level, or on whether the recipient makes an election for a particular rate under section NC 8(1A).) The employer must also: •deduct ACC earner premium and earners’ account levy from the payment, and •account for the deductions to Inland Revenue in the normal way and pay the remaining amount to the employee, and •pay employer premium and residual claims levy in respect of the gross award for lost wages or other remuneration. By deducting tax from the gross award and paying the net sum to the employee, the employer will satisfy the requirements under both the court award and the Income Tax Act. When an employer has deducted tax from a source deduction payment, section NC 19 (a) deems the employer to have paid the amount deducted to the employee. Thus, the employer is deemed to have paid the total amount of the award to the employee for the purposes of satisfying the obligation imposed by the Court or Authority. When the Court or Authority awards a net sum In some cases a Court or Authority may make an award for lost wages or other remuneration net of tax, i.e. the sum that the employee would have received as remuneration after the deduction of tax. Because it is a “source deduction payment”, in such cases the employer would normally “gross up” the award to take account of the PAYE, the ACC earner premium, and the earners’ account levy. The employer is then required to pay the tax on the gross of the net award to Inland Revenue and pay the net award to the employee. In this way the employer would fulfil his or her obligations to both the employee and the Commissioner. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 33 If the employer breaches the Court’s or the Authority’s direction to pay the net sum to the employee, the onus will be on the employee to enforce the terms of the award by requiring the employer to pay the employee the full net amount of the award. The required tax deduction must be made from whatever amount is paid to the employee. When an employer fails to make tax deductions Under section 168 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, if the employer fails to make the correct tax deductions from the payment of the award, the unpaid tax deductions become a debt owed by the employer to the Commissioner. The debt is due and payable on the date that the tax deductions were due to be paid to the Commissioner. Where an employer fails to make a deduction, the employee is liable, under section NC 16, to: •furnish the Commissioner with an employer monthly schedule containing particulars of the source deduction payment (i.e. the award) by the 20th of the month following the payment of the award, and •pay the Commissioner a sum equal to the tax deductions that the employer should have made on that source deduction payment (unless the employee is exempted from this requirement) by the 20th of the month following the payment of the award. When the payment is derived by the shareholder-employee Under section EB 1, a person is a shareholder- employee if he or she is a shareholder-employee in a close company and has met the criteria set out in section OB 2 (2). Example 1 An employee is dismissed from her job. She issues proceedings against her former employer alleging unjustifiable dismissal. She seeks reinstatement and damages for wages lost as a result of the unjustifiable dismissal. The Employment Relations Authority orders the employer to reinstate the employee and awards her $27,000, a sum equivalent to the employee’s wages from the time of dismissal to the time of reinstatement, to compensate for the wages lost as a result of the unjustified dismissal. The Authority makes the award for lost wages on 20 March 2001. The employer pays this award to the employee on 10 April 2001. 1.The award for lost wages is derived by the employee in the 2001–2002 income year, as this is the year of receipt. 2.The employer must deduct tax and ACC earner premium and earners’ account levy from the court award, and pay the following amounts to the employee and Inland Revenue respectively (in the 2002 income year): Award for lost wages$27,000 Less tax at the extra emolument rate,$5,670 in this case 21% Less ACC earner premium. $ 297 ($27,000 x 0.011) Total payable to Inland Revenue $ 5,967 Total payable to the employee$21,033 Example 2 The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the Authority awards damages of $27,000 and states that this sum is net of tax. In order to ensure that it pays the employee a net sum of $27,000, the employer “grosses up” the payment by the extra emolument tax rate plus ACC earner premium and levy. The employer should make the following calculations and payments: Award for net lost wages$27,000.00 Divided by 0.779 (1 - 0.21 - 0.011)$34,659.82 to give the gross wage Less tax at the extra emolument$ 7,278.56 rate of 21% Less ACC earner premium $ 381.26 ($34,659.82 x 0.011) Total payable to Inland Revenue $ 7,659.82 Total payable to the employee$27,000.00 In both examples: •The employer must also pay the employer premium and residual claims levy on the gross award. •Any other source deduction payments received by the employee from that employer in the 4 weeks prior to payment of the award must also be taken into account in calculating her annualised salary or wages and determining the appropriate tax deduction rate. •If the employee is required to file an income tax return, she will include the amount of the award for lost wages in her return for the 2001–2002 income year and claim the tax paid as a credit. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 34 FOREIGN CURRENCY AMOUNTS – CONVERSION TO NEW ZEALAND CURRENCY CORRECTION TO A PREVIOUS ITEM In TIB Vol 13, No 4 (April 2001), there was an item with exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency under the CFC and FIF rules for the 12 months ending March 2001. The internet version of the TIB showed the correct conversion rates. However the paper copy contained an error in both the mid-month and end-of-month rates for 23 countries. In each case the numeral to the far right of the decimal point had been rounded down by a value of one as a result of a software conversion problem. The corrected tables are republished in this month’s TIB.

38 NEW LEGISLATION WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE CONSULTED ON THE VALUATION OF NURSERY PLANTS? Draft guidelines for using discounted selling price to value nursery stock It is proposed to allow nursery growers to use an industry-wide category approach in applying the Discounted Selling Price (DSP) method to value their nursery stock. DSP is a low compliance cost method of valuing trading stock available to taxpayers with small turnover and some retailers. Most nursery growers should be eligible to use DSP. Eligibility is set out in sections EE 8, EE 9 and EE 10 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Nursery plants have been divided into seven categories. The DSP of mature plants in each category would be calculated by multiplying the selling price of the plant by the DSP value. The proposed DSP values have been determined by surveying taxpayers within the industry. Type of stockDSP value Bedding plants58% House plants and roses55% Liners/plugs52% Shrubs and perennials48% Trees42% Example A nursery has 500 mature rose plants on hand at balance date. The nursery sells their mature roses to a retailer for $15 each. The value of that stock for trading stock purposes is $4,125 (500 plants x $15 x 55%). Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 12 (December 2000) announced that the administrative interpretation issued in 1999 on how nursery plants should be valued for trading stock purposes would be extended to apply to the 2000–2001 income year. It was announced that Inland Revenue was working with industry representatives to develop a new draft interpretation for wider consultation. That draft has been developed and we are very grateful to the Nursery & Garden Industry Association and its members for their work in that process. Once finalised, the interpretation statement will apply from the 2001–2002 income year and will succeed the one in place since the introduction of the new trading stock rules, which reflected the best available information for the valuations of nursery plants at cost or market at that time. Your views The draft valuation method aims to minimise compliance costs while ensuring that nursery stock is valued accurately under the trading stock rules. We welcome your views on it. You can send us a written submission, or if there is sufficient interest, we will organise a small number of meetings in various parts of the country in mid to late July. Please let us know if you are interested in attending such a meeting and your preferred location. Written submissions should be received by 31 July 2001. Submissions, further enquiries and preferences for meetings can be sent to Bhagee Ramanathan in the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington, ph 04 4747 083, fax 04 4747 217, or to bhagee@ird.govt.nz Those of you who have already contacted us expressing interest in being part of this round of consultation will have received a copy of the draft interpretation. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 39 Immature plants It is proposed to calculate the DSP of immature plants my multiplying the DSP of a mature plant by a ratio of the whole years of completed growth to the number of whole years the plant takes to reach maturity. Whole years have been used in the ratio to minimise compliance costs. The fact that most nursery plants are propagated and sold within a 12-month cycle, and balance dates tend to be at times when stock at hand is at its lowest, should prevent significant numbers of plants being valued at nil for trading stock purposes despite the use of whole years in the calculation. Example Another nursery has 500 13-month-old flax plants and 300 25-month-old flax plants on hand at balance date. The flax plants take three years to mature and sell for $10 each. The value for the purposes of the trading stock rules of the 1-year-old plants would be $800 (500 plants x $10 x 48% x 1/3); and the 2-year plants would be $960 (300 plants x $10 x 48% x 2/3). Over-mature plants It is proposed to value plants past their prime, or whose value drops, by multiplying their revised market value by the DSP value. The revised market value is the actual price at which the grower expects to sell a plant in that condition. The principle underlying this proposal is that because the cost of scrapping plants is very low, the decision to retain over-mature stock must necessarily anticipate an economic return on the stock. Revising down the market value to the anticipated sale price of such stock is, however, appropriate. On the other hand, plants that are scrapped are effectively no longer part of a grower’s business and therefore they should not have any value as trading stock. The particular treatments proposed for different circumstances are illustrated in the following table. CircumstanceTreatment The market selling value dropsNil value for a particular stock item, or there is no demand for the item, and the stock is scrapped The market selling value dropsDSP based for a particular stock item,on revised or there is no demand butmarket value stock is not scrapped Plant is damaged and leftDSP based in a “bargain area”on revised market value Plant is irrecoverably damagedNil value and is scrapped Plant is over-mature and is scrappedNil value Plant is over-mature and is not scrappedDSP based on revised market value Example A third nursery business has 400 mature but frost- damaged Kahikatea plants at the back of its nursery. Mature plants in prime condition are sold for $30 each. The frost-damaged items are being offered for sale at $20. The value of these plants for trading stock purposes is $3,360 (400 plants x $20 x 42%). Questions Will all growers eligible to use DSP have to use the industry standards? Nursery growers who prefer to calculate their own discounted selling prices will still be eligible to do so. They will need to keep records that justify their valuations. How should large growers value their stock? The DSP method is not available to all taxpayers. These taxpayers will have to value their stock at cost (using a cost valuation method) or at market selling value. How will plants in the ground be valued? Plants in the ground are part of the land in which they grow and are thus not trading stock. On the other hand, once they are lifted and ready for sale they become trading stock and any such plants on hand at balance date will be subject to the trading stock rules so will need to be valued.

We’ve given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. SUMMARY JUDGMENT Decision The Master held that in order to invoke the provisions of section 46, the Commissioner must notify the taxpayer of his intention to invoke the section, and the taxpayer must receive that notification, within 15 working days following the day the return is received by the Commissioner. Case:Sea Hunter Fishing Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Decision date:8 May and 23 May 2001 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Facts The plaintiff is a company which carries on business as a fishing vessel owner. The plaintiff claimed an input tax credit under section 21(5) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in respect of the fishing vessel. The claim was made in a GST return received by the defendant on 19 January 1998. It was for the period ended 31 May 1997. The return sought a GST input tax credit of $2,495,850. The senior investigator handling the matter determined that more information needed to be sought from the plaintiff before a credit adjustment or refund could be considered. As a result an account halt was activated on 3 February 1998. The account halt was due to expire on 18 February 1998. After the account halt expired, a refund cheque was issued to the plaintiff. The investigator became aware that the GST credit adjustment claim had been released notwithstanding an incomplete review of the matter. The investigator was unable to access the defendant’s computer system due to the power cuts in the Auckland region at the time and a stop payment request was, therefore, issued through the banking system. On 27 February the plaintiff banked the cheque. However, on 5 March 1998 the plaintiff’s bank account was debited as a result of the stop payment request. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 44 WHETHER CHARGE OVER UNCOLLECTED BOOK DEBTS WAS FIXED OR FLOATING CHARGE Lordships attached no significance to this distinction. Prior to the receivers’ appointment, however, the company was free to collect the book debts and deal with the proceeds in the ordinary course of its business, though it was unable to assign or factor them. Decision The question was whether the company’s right to collect the debts and deal with their proceeds free from the security meant that the charge on the uncollected debts (though described in the debenture as fixed) was, nevertheless, a floating charge. Lord Millet, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, began by tracing the history of the floating charge from its inception to present day, paying particular attention to charges over book debts. Their Lordships noted that as early as 1910 it was evident that the classification of a security as a floating charge was a matter of substance and not merely a matter of drafting. If the chargor is free to deal with the charged assets and so withdraw them from the ambit of the charge without the consent of the chargee, then the charge is a floating charge. The decision of Nourse J in New Bullas was then considered in some detail. Having observed that the principal theme of that judgment was that the parties were free to make whatever agreement they liked (the question then being simply one of construction), their Lordships stated that they considered this approach to be fundamentally flawed, and that deciding whether a charge is a fixed or a floating charge is a two-stage process: “At the first stage it must construe the instrument of charge and seek to gather the intentions of the parties from the language they have used. But the object at this stage of the process is not to discover whether the parties intended to create a fixed or a floating charge. It is to ascertain the nature of the rights and obligations which the parties intended to grant each other in respect of the charged assets. Once these have been ascertained, the Court can then embark on the second stage of the process, which is one of categorisa- tion. This is a matter of law. It does not depend on the intention of the parties. If their intention, properly gathered from the language of the instrument, is to grant the company rights in respect of the charged assets which are inconsistent with the nature of a fixed charge, then the charge cannot be a fixed charge however they may have chosen to describe it.” To summarise, the question is whether the charged assets were intended to be under the control of the company, or of the charge holder. Case:Agnew v CIR Decision date:5 June 2001 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Fixed and floating charges Summary The taxpayer’s appeal from the Court of Appeal was unsuccessful. Facts A debenture was entered into by Brumark Investments Limited (“the company”) which purported to create two distinct charges—a fixed charge on the book debts while they remained uncollected, and a floating charge on their proceeds. The proceeds of the debts were released from the fixed charge as soon as they were received by the company. The company went into receivership, and the only assets available for distribution to creditors were the proceeds of the book debts that were outstanding when the receivers were appointed (and which were subsequently collected). If the charge over the uncollected book debts were a fixed charge, the proceeds would be payable to the company’s bank (Westpac Banking Corporation) as the holder of the charge. If, however, it was a floating charge at the time it was created then, by the combined effect of the Seventh Schedule to the Companies Act 1993 and section 30 of the Receiverships Act 1993, the proceeds would be payable to the employees and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue as preferential creditors. The High Court held the debenture to be a fixed charge, but this was reversed in the Court of Appeal. The taxpayer appealed to the Privy Council. The debenture in question was closely modelled on the instrument that was the subject of the English Court of Appeal case In re New Bullas Trading Ltd \[1994\] 1 BCLC 449. As in the present case the debenture purported to create two distinct charges, a fixed charge on the book debts while they remained uncollected and a floating charge on their proceeds. It differed from the debenture in the present case only in that the proceeds of the debts were not released from the fixed charge until they were actually paid into the company’s bank account, whereas in the present case they were released from the fixed charge as soon as they were received by the company. Their Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 45 Their Lordships held that the reasoning of Nourse J, in saying that the book debts ceased to be subject to the fixed charge because that was what the parties had agreed when they entered into the debenture, was “entirely destructive of the floating charge” and would “turn every floating charge into a fixed charge”. The Lordships also could not accept that the critical distinction between a floating charge and a fixed charge lay in the presence or absence of a power on the part of the company to dispose of the charged assets to third parties (it being sufficient to create a fixed charge that the company be prohibited from assigning, factoring, or charging the book debts). This, they held, was contrary to principle, authority, and commercial sense: “A restriction on disposition which nevertheless allows collection and free use of the proceeds is inconsistent with the fixed nature of the charge; it allows the debt and its proceeds to be withdrawn from the security by the act of the company in collecting it.” Finally, their Lordships turned to the question of whether a debt or other receivable can be separated from its proceeds. It was acknowledged that while a debt and its proceeds are two separate assets, the latter are merely the traceable proceeds of the former and represent its entire value. To attempt to separate the ownership of the debts from ownership of their proceeds, in this context, makes no commercial sense. Although the instant debenture did not purport to separate the book debts and their proceeds, the Lordships held that : “the critical factor which is determinative of the nature of the charge in respect of the uncollected book debts is that the event which is said to convert the charge from a fixed to a floating charge (if there is only one) or to replace the one charge by the other (if there are two) is the act of the company”. Here, the debenture was so drafted that the company was at liberty to turn the uncollected book debts to account by its own act. The company was left in control of the process by which the charge over the uncollected book debts was extinguished and replaced by different assets, which were not subject to a fixed charge and were at the free disposal of the company. That, their Lordships held, was inconsistent with the nature of a fixed charge, and the charge was, therefore, floating. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 46 WHETHER SUPPLY OF A GOING CONCERN TO A REGISTERED PERSON WAS ZERO-RATED The Commissioner assessed the disputant for output tax on the sale to person A, the basis being that, although the supply may have been of a going concern, the purchaser was not a registered person. The disputant contended that the purchaser was in fact ABC (who took the property from person A on the same day). Decision Judge Willy found that the disputant knew, on the facts, that at all times the purchaser was acting on behalf of a registered person and that the sale was a supply of a going concern. His Honour found too that the purchaser deliberately misled the vendor as to his intention to take the property in his own name and the involvement of Inland Revenue in obtaining a favourable ruling (there was no criticism of the Commissioner in so doing as his Honour stated that the ruling was “... acting upon the information supplied to him ...”). The Commissioner had submitted that the cut and thrust of commerce is often of this nature and the taxing statutes levy tax on what actually occurs, rather than what a party may have thought or wished. In this case, there was no unequivocal act of nomination, and in his next submission, no agency relationship in fact or law. His Honour made reference to English cases regarding the construction of written contracts. Moving on from his earlier findings of fact, he held that the background determined the meaning of the ASAP, inasmuch as both parties understood it to mean the sale of a going concern. The Commissioner also submitted that “... or nominee” requires a positive notification. The Judge noted authorities that clearly showed that such wording merely flagged a potential legal right to nominate: Lambly v Silk Pemberton Limited \[1976\] 2 NZLR 427. He distinguished Lambly on the basis that, in the present matter, “ ... the disputant knew and accepted that the purchase would be made by a limited liability company”. And later “ ... this is one of those cases in which the vendor readily accepted that it would sell either to the nominor named in the contract or his nominee. It is not a case where the vendor seeks to hold the nominor liable.” Case:TRA No.032/00. Decision 005/2001 Decision date:8 June 2001 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Going concern, zero rating, time of supply Summary The Taxation Review Authority found that the Disputant supplied a going concern to a non- registered person, but that the actual purchaser had led the supplier to believe the purchaser would be a registered company of his. The zero-rated conditions of the Act were thus meet. Facts A property was sold to a property developer while subject to an existing tenancy. The vendor would accept no less than $2.85 million net of GST and the purchaser would pay no more than $2.5 million. The parties finally signed an agreement for sale and purchase (ASAP) for $2.80 million stating the contract to be “GST-inclusive if any” and “subject to existing tenancy”. The purchaser was said to be “Person A or nominee”. Clearly, the vendor had zero-rating in mind. The purchaser on the other hand did certain things to reinforce that impression while at the same time setting out to obtain an input credit for the supply. In order to do so, the purchaser set up a company, ABC, which would act as a holding company in order to pass it on to a development company and claim an input credit on the second supply. ABC was formed after the ASAP was signed and the deposit was paid by a cheque from ABC’s account. The purchaser, still not having made a nomination, applied to Inland Revenue for a binding ruling on the proposed transaction. The ruling considered that the transaction was caught by section 76 of the GST Act. The purchaser applied for a second ruling on a varied transaction where person A, who was not registered for GST, took the property in his own name before transferring it to his development company and claiming an input credit. This transaction was approved by Adjudication & Rulings on the facts submitted and the settlement proceeded on that basis. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 47 Again, his Honour referred to his earlier factual findings that the disputant intended to contract with a company to be formed, that it was formed and was registered for GST, and that it did not matter that the company did not exist when the contract was entered into. These findings were read into the relevant sections of the GST Act: •the nominee existed when the deposit was paid—the time of supply (section 9) •section 60(2) then deems the supply to be made to the principal, not the agent •it is not relevant who pays the consideration Turakina Maori Girls College v CIR (1995) 15 NZTC 10,032 •GST is payable in accordance with the legal consequences of the transaction actually entered into—not on what they might otherwise have done: Nicholls v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,233 (CA) He concludes that the transaction was the sale of a going concern. Judge Willy also held that it was a pre-incorporation contract in terms of section 182 of the Companies Act 1993, and that ratification was the taking of the property on the same day as person A. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 48 LIABILITY FOR GST – WHETHER APPELLANT CARRYING ON A TAXABLE ACTIVITY; JUDICIAL REVIEW – WHETHER ASSESSMENT MADE OUT OF TIME and Newman the partnership deeds had expressly provided for the land to be made available for the exclusive use of the partnerships. There was no equivalent provision in the deed in this case and there was no need to imply a term to that effect. Consequently there was no supply, and no taxable activity. Rodney Hansen J considered that the arrangements in this case led to the same conclusion reached in Bayly and Newman despite there not being an express provision in the partnership agreement. The deed of partnership clearly contemplated that the business of the partnership would be conducted on the property. This was confirmed in the evidence given by the appellant before the Authority. His Honour concluded that “the circumstances in which and the terms on which the partnership farmed the land leave no room for doubt that the appellant was carrying on the taxable activity of providing the farming partnership with land”. Further, his Honour stated: “In my view, there is no material distinction between the facts of this case and those in Bayly and Newman. The absence of an express agreement to make the land available makes no difference. As the Authority pointed out, it is the act of repetitively and habitually making the land available which constitutes the taxable activity. ... The reality of what has gone on behind the documentation cannot be ignored.” Judicial review Facts The application for review was brought on the grounds that the Commissioner’s assessment was made outside the four-year period permitted by the old section 31 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the time bar is now in section 108A of the Tax Administration Act 1994). The assessment related to the GST period ending 31 August 1994. The period would have been time barred on 31 August 1998 but the taxpayer signed a waiver extending the time bar for a further six months (to 28 February 1999). The assessment was made on 25 February 1999. Following the decision of Vela Fishing Limited v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,885 the appellant’s advisors took the view that the waiver of time bar was not valid and that therefore the Commissioner’s assessment was out of time. The Vela Fishing decision held that some waivers (relating to certain income tax periods) were not valid. Case:William Palmer Nelson v CIR Decision date:11 June 2001 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and Judicature Amendment Act 1972 Keywords:Taxable activity, judicial review Summary The taxpayer was unsuccessful both in his appeal from the Taxation Review Authority and his application for judicial review. Tax case Facts The appellant is a farmer. He owed a property (“the property”) with his family trust (“the trust”) as tenants in common (he owned three-fifths, the trust owned two-fifths). From 1 July 1974 the appellant and the trust farmed the property in partnership (a formal deed of partnership was entered into on 21 May 1977). The partnership continued until 30 June 1994 when it was dissolved by agreement. The property was then sold to a company (“the company”) formed and owned by the appellant and the family trust. The company made a secondhand goods GST claim when it acquired the property. The Commissioner allowed that claim but determined that the appellant and the trust would each be assessed with GST in respect of the sale. The Taxation Review Authority held that the appellant was liable for the GST assessed. Decision The Taxation Review Authority held that in providing the partnership with land the appellant was carrying on a taxable activity. The Authority applied the Court of Appeal decision of CIR v Bayly (1998) 18 NZTC 14,073 which held, in circumstances similar to the present case, that landowners who made land available to farming partnerships were carrying on a taxable activity. Bayly was also applied by Smellie J in Newman v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,666, which had similar facts to the present case. Counsel for the taxpayer attempted to distinguish Bayly and Newman on the basis that the property in this case had not been supplied to the partnership in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. The appellant considered it significant that in Bayly Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 49 Decision Hansen J firstly considered the old sections 27 and 31 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These sections restricted the Commissioner’s power to reassess for GST (up to 30 September 1996). However, from 1 October 1996 the sections relating to the time bar for assessment of GST were “reorganised”. The Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1996 replaced the reference to section 31 in section 27 with a reference to sections 108A and 108B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 31 was repealed and replaced without being saved. Sections 108A and 108B (which allowed a waiver of the time bar) were inserted into the Tax Administration Act 1994 by the Tax Administration Amendment (No 2) Act 1996. The legislation provided that all these amendments would come into force on 1 October 1996. Counsel for the appellant argued that the waiver provision of section 108B was not available because the relevant legislative provisions should be those in force at the time of the relevant GST period. Counsel also argued that the time bar conferred a right that was unaffected by the repeal of former sections 27 and 31 of the GST Act, that the Commissioner was attempting to give retrospective effect to sections 108A and 108B by relying on the waiver, and that the reasoning in the Vela Fishing decision applied in this case. Hansen J rejected the appellant’s arguments. His Honour concluded that the ability granted to taxpayers by sections 108A and 108B was not retrospective and that the Vela Fishing decision was distinguishable from the present situation. The amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 “achieved a seamless transition on 1 October 1996”. Section 31 was repealed and there was no savings provision. Sections 31 and 108A referred to the same four-year period. Section 108B did not offend against the principle of retrospectivity. His Honour stated that “\[i\]t is sufficient for present purposes to acknowledge that it is a voluntary process which, it must be presumed, would be utilised only if a taxpayer perceived it to be advantageous.” There were at least two critical points of distinction that made the Vela Fishing decision inapplicable to the present case. Firstly, section 25 of the Income Tax Act 1976 was saved by section YB 5(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Former sections 27 and 31 were not saved. Secondly, the “triggering event” for income tax was changed in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. As a result Penlington J in Vela Fishing was not prepared to construe a reference to section 108 to include a reference to section 25. There was not a similar change in the GST legislation. Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 50 CHALLENGE TO ASSESSMENT OUTSIDE RESPONSE PERIOD – REVIEW OF TEST It was noteworthy that this warning refers to action being taken by “you” (KPMG, not the taxpayer). In fact the formal assessments referred to in the letter of 5 December were issued on 6 December 2000 (with one exception which was issued on 18 December 2000). Because the taxpayer’s address was the one in Inland Revenue’s computer system, the Notices of Assessment were sent to the address of the taxpayer and not to KPMG. Fuji’s chief accountant gave evidence that he was informed by members of his staff that Notices of Assessment had been received but that he had no reason to expect any correspondence from Inland Revenue concerning the investigation and so he did not discuss the nature of them with his accounts staff. However, payment of the assessments was made because the taxpayer’s policy was to pay all amounts due to Inland Revenue on time to avoid interest and penalties. Meanwhile, the person responsible for the taxpayer’s affairs at KPMG also expected that the assessments would be sent to KPMG. He had previously worked at Inland Revenue and his evidence was that he was not sure when the assessments would arrive and that his experience was that they could sometimes arrive some time after the advice that an assessment was about to be issued. However, he became concerned when no assessments had arrived by early February and rang the responsible officer at Inland Revenue on 7 February 2001. He was told that the assessments should have been issued but no details were provided. He did however enquire with Fuji’s chief accountant whether he was aware of any Notices of Assessment being received and he, without checking, said he was not aware that they had been received by the taxpayer and that he expected they would be sent to KPMG. It was only some time later it was discovered that the Notices of Assessment received by Fuji’s accounts staff in December 2000 had been the Notices of Assessment to which the 5 December 2000 letter to KPMG referred. By then the response period had expired and Fuji took these proceedings seeking leave under section 138D of the Tax Administration Act, to commence a challenge out of the response period. Case:Fuji Xerox New Zealand Ltd v CIR Decision date:14 June 2001 Act:Section 138D Tax Administration Act 1994 Keywords:Response period, leave to proceed with challenge Summary The plaintiff was given leave to proceed with a challenge to the Commissioner’s assessment. Facts The Commissioner undertook an audit of the tax affairs of the taxpayer. The tax audit began in the middle of 1998. The tax audit at first concerned Fuji Xerox’s income tax affairs, but later was expanded to include GST matters as well. KPMG is the taxpayer’s nominated tax agent in respect of income tax matters and all correspondence in relation to the tax audit (both in respect of income tax and GST matters) has been conducted by KPMG on behalf of the taxpayer. However, KPMG is not the taxpayer’s nominated tax agent in respect of GST matters, and so the address in the Department’s computer system for GST assessments in relation to the taxpayer is the taxpayer’s own address rather than that of KPMG. There was considerable correspondence between Inland Revenue and KPMG in relation to the tax audit. A letter dated 28 May 1999 from Inland Revenue was sent to the taxpayer itself and copied to KPMG but the subsequent correspondence was between KPMG on behalf of the taxpayer and Inland Revenue. The final letter, indicating that Notices of Assessment were to be issued, is addressed to KPMG (not to the taxpayer care of KPMG) and refers to recent discussions, attaches a Statement of Amendment and contains the statement “Notices will be issued in due course” without saying to whom the Notices will be issued. It then continues: “As you are aware, to protect your client’s objection rights, certain actions must be taken by you within two months of the Notice. Full details are contained on the back of the Notice.” Inland Revenue Department Tax Information Bulletin: Vol 13, No 6 (June 2001) 51 Decision His Honour, O’Reagan J, applied the test set out by Gendall J, on similar facts in Milburn New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005. That test is: It must always be a matter of judgment when assessing individual factual situations, unique in themselves, whether exceptional circumstances apply. But there must be: “( 1 ) an event or circumstance which is unusual or out of the ordinary (but not so rare as to be categorised as extraordinary), which operates alone or together with other circumstances (unusual or not); (2)which must be beyond the control of the taxpayer; (3)so as must provide the taxpayer with a reasonable justification for not commencing the challenge within the required period; (4)an act or omission of an agent of the taxpayer is only an exceptional circumstance if it was caused by an event or circumstances beyond the agent’s control and could not have been anticipated and the effect of which could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct.” On the “unusual or out of the ordinary” argument his Honour held that “ ... the sending of the assessments to the taxpayer’s address when all other correspondence had been conducted with KPMG was sufficient to make this situation one which was out of the ordinary”. His Honour held that the circumstances he had set out amounted to sufficient justification for Fuji not commencing the challenge within the required period “\[n\]otwithstanding that a lack of prudence on the taxpayer’s behalf has been a contributing factor”. His Honour did not believe “... that the situation in the present case provides as strong a case for the taxpayer as the Treasury Technology case. On the other hand, there has been conduct by Inland Revenue in this case which I have found amounts to exceptional circumstances, which distinguishes the case from Milburn”.
