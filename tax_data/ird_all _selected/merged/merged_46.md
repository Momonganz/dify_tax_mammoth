3 TIMEFRAMES TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW LEGISLATION Submission (ASB) New Zealand-sourced retirement savings may not be transferred from Australia to a third country. This will require communication and amendments to current disclosure material in order to comply with securities legislation. The amendment process means that providers are required to amend and reprint documentation, including investment statements and prospectuses. Therefore, providers should have a suitable timeframe to implement the new legislation. Alternatively, an exemption should be provided so that the changes do not require existing disclosure documents to be updated until the proposed rules are enacted and come into force. Comment Participation in the trans-Tasman portability facility will be voluntary for providers, so providers have flexibility regarding if and when they choose to offer this facility. The timeframes for implementation are, therefore, within providers’ control. If it is not considered viable to reprint documentation upon enactment, later implementation by providers is possible. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 4 NON-ALIGNMENT OF INVESTMENT INCOME TAX RATES Submissions (ING, Workplace Savings NZ, KPMG) If New Zealand is serious about encouraging the consolidation of retirement savings accounts here, further consideration needs to be given to aligning tax rates on investment income with the rate payable in Australia. The recent Tax Working Group report suggested that New Zealand is currently reliant on taxing factors most harmful to economic growth, including income from capital (savings). A debate on New Zealand’s savings policy, and the role of tax, needs to occur. (KPMG) Comment Portability is designed to assist labour market mobility and contribute towards achieving a single economic market with Australia. It does not aim to achieve equal tax treatment on retirement savings. New Zealand and Australia apply different tax rates to earnings on retirement savings, with Australia’s rate being lower. However Australia also taxes capital gains on equities, whereas New Zealand does not tax capital gains on Australasian equities. It is therefore not straightforward to make a comparison between the two tax regimes, or to conclude that the Australian tax environment for superannuation savings is more favourable than New Zealand’s. In addition, there are a number of factors other than the tax rate that may encourage members to transfer their savings. For example, individuals with Australian savings benefit from transferring them to New Zealand as they avoid paying multiple administration and management fees on their savings, and are able to manage more easily their savings if they are consolidated in one account in their country of residence. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 5 WITHDRAWAL IN CASH AFTER EMIGRATION TO AUSTRALIA Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) New Zealanders who permanently migrate to Australia should have the choice of transferring their retirement savings to an Australian superannuation scheme or withdrawing their savings entirely. This would be consistent with the original framework of the KiwiSaver regime. Furthermore, the portability of superannuation to Australian complying schemes should not remove existing rights. Individuals who permanently migrate to Australia should not be disadvantaged compared with individuals who migrate to other countries. Comment The introduction of retirement savings portability will support an integrated single superannuation market between the two countries by allowing New Zealanders and Australians to consolidate their financial affairs in their country of residence. Superannuation portability also builds on the unique relationship between New Zealand and Australia by supporting trans-Tasman labour mobility. To allow the cash withdrawal of savings would compromise an objective of trans- Tasman portability, which is to assist and encourage retirement savings after emigration. A key feature of both the Australian complying superannuation scheme and the New Zealand KiwiSaver scheme is that savings are locked in until retirement age. This would also undermine the concept of an integrated single superannuation market: allowing cash withdrawals on trans-Tasman emigration would be equivalent to allowing cash withdrawals on migration within New Zealand, which is not allowed. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 6 RING-FENCING AUSTRALIAN-SOURCED SUPERANNUATION SAVINGS Submission (ASB) For providers to separately administer funds transferred from Australian superannuation schemes, further registry development, testing and time will be required. To reduce the costs and complexities of KiwiSaver administration, transferred Australian savings should be administered under the existing KiwiSaver rules. This change will ensure ease of implementation, less confusion for members and less risk of error, and will help to ease the cost of implementing further complexities to registry systems. Comment The arrangement on portability between New Zealand and Australia specifies that savings transferred to New Zealand may not be used to assist with the purchase of a first home or be transferred to a third country. Also, a member retains the right to access their transferred savings at 60 years of age (if they meet the Australian definition of “retirement”). These provisions are a core feature of the portability arrangements, and will ensure that portability supports labour market mobility instead of being used to take advantage of regulatory and policy differences between New Zealand and Australia. After consultation with industry representatives, officials consider that the requirement to identify separately the original transferred amount of savings will not result in high costs and complexity for scheme providers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 7 COMPLYING SUPERANNUATION FUNDS EXCLUDED FROM PORTABILITY Submissions (Chapman Tripp, ING, Workplace Savings NZ) As complying superannuation funds essentially operate in the same way as KiwiSaver schemes, there is no persuasive policy reason for excluding them from the trans- Tasman savings portability facility. The portability arrangements should, at a minimum, allow transfers direct from complying superannuation funds to Australian superannuation schemes. (Chapman Tripp) The extension of this facility to complying superannuation funds should be included in future discussions with Australian officials. (Workplace Savings NZ) Comment Officials agree that in policy terms complying superannuation funds should be allowed to offer the portability facility. However, as the arrangement between New Zealand and Australia only refers to KiwiSaver schemes, a decision would need to be made jointly between the two countries to include complying superannuation funds. Officials will raise this matter with Australia. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 8 REALLOCATION OF SAVINGS IF MEMBERSHIP CONSIDERED INVALID Submission (Workplace Savings NZ) Clauses 75 and 76 of the bill involve “net” amounts to be paid if an individual’s membership is found to be invalid. This potentially undermines the simplicity principle and could, in many cases, require registry system changes of a significant and costly nature. It would be preferable to retain the simplicity of the “amount transferred” (disregarding subsequent investment returns) in these sections if possible, thereby avoiding the need for additional record keeping. Comment Officials recognise that this presents concern for providers, as it would require additional data and potentially complex accounting. Officials agree with the approach suggested in the submission because it is consistent with the current invalid membership rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 9 TRANSFERS BACK TO AUSTRALIA IF MEMBERSHIP CONSIDERED INVALID Submissions (Chapman Trip, Workplace Savings NZ) The bill proposes that if an invalid KiwiSaver enrolment is not later validated under the KiwiSaver Act’s provisions, any net amount transferred from an Australian scheme must be transferred back to that scheme. This will be impossible where that scheme, for example, does not allow transfers back from KiwiSaver or otherwise refuses to accept the transferred amount. The Australian scheme may also have been wound up after the transfer. An affected individual should be able to nominate another Australian complying superannuation scheme or, if this does not happen, Inland Revenue should be able to choose a default Australian scheme (and then notify the member). Comment Officials agree that an affected individual should be able to nominate another Australian superannuation scheme if their original Australian provider will not accept the transfer or no longer exists. The transfer of savings back to Australia, if an individual’s KiwiSaver membership is found to be invalid, would be administered by the provider and not Inland Revenue. This is because providers would have the direct relationship with both the member and the Australian scheme provider. This will be noted in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 10 TRANSFERS IN EXCESS OF AUSTRALIA’S CONTRIBUTION THRESHOLD Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Workplace Savings NZ) Individuals who migrate to Australia should be allowed to withdraw their KiwiSaver savings in part, to avoid being taxed on contributions in excess of the Australian contribution threshold. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Amounts transferred from KiwiSaver schemes to Australia should be exempt from the Australian “contributions cap”, as there is little scope for abuse of the Australian tax system from excessive contributions made during this process. The exemption of such transfers should be discussed with Australian officials at some point in the future. It is not likely to be an issue in the immediate future but may become so as savers build their KiwiSaver balances. (Workplace Savings NZ) Comment Currently, officials do not consider that this is a major concern because the low dollar amounts in the KiwiSaver accounts that may be transferred. However, as these amounts grow in the future, the contributions cap may become an issue. Consequently, officials may raise this with Australian officials in the future. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but note that New Zealand officials may raise this issue with Australian officials in the future. 11 FEES FIRST DEDUCTED FROM NEW ZEALAND-SOURCED SAVINGS Submissions (Workplace Savings NZ, Chapman Tripp) Proposed clause 2B of the KiwiSaver scheme rules requires fees to be first deducted from the net value of amounts not transferred from Australia. This is unreasonable and impractical as it would necessitate duplicate unit prices within KiwiSaver schemes. The costs associated with attempting to comply with such a requirement may preclude providers from offering this service. Clause 2B should be reworded to provide that fees cannot be deducted from the amount transferred from Australia to a greater extent than in proportion to the total value of the member’s accumulation in the scheme at the time. (Workplace Savings NZ) The requirement that fees be deducted first from New Zealand-sourced savings (in proposed clause 2B) seems unworkable, as it would necessitate duplicate unit prices within KiwiSaver schemes. Proposed clause 2B should be deleted. (Chapman Tripp) Comment Officials agree that there are potential difficulties for providers in the identification and administration of separate fees, and that clause 2B should be deleted. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 12 SECTION CW 29B – INCOME COMPONENT OF THE TRANSFERRED AMOUNT Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It may not be clear what part of the amount transferred from the Australian complying superannuation scheme is the income component. The rules to determine the taxable dividend in section CD 22(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 rely on the cost of the interest, which may not be easily determined. To ensure no doubt or ambiguity, a better approach would be to refer to an “amount”. As the amount originates from a transfer of funds, the language of section CW 29B should be consistent. Comment Because the provisions in the Income Tax Act only tax income, officials consider that the current wording of proposed section CW 29B is correct. The reference to income in proposed section CW 29B is also consistent with other exemption provisions, in particular, section CW 29. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 13 SECTION MK 8 – PAYING MEMBER TAX CREDITS TO COMMISSIONER AFTER EMIGRATION Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Section MK 8 should be amended to clarify that it does not apply to a transfer under proposed clause 14B, schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Comment Existing section MK 8 provides that, on the transfer or cash withdrawal of a member’s savings after their permanent emigration from New Zealand, a provider must pay the individual’s member tax credits to the Commissioner. Officials agree that, in the absence of any amendment, section MK 8 may also apply after permanent emigration to Australia under proposed clause 14B of the KiwiSaver scheme rules. Because this is not intended, section MK 8 should be amended accordingly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 14 DEFINITION OF “AUSTRALIAN COMPLYING SUPERANNUATION SCHEME” Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) As Australia’s Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 contains multiple divisions labelled “Division 2”, the proposed definition of “Australian complying superannuation scheme” in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended to refer to a specific part of the Australian Act. Comment Officials agree that the cross-reference is not clear. The legislation should be amended to refer to Division 2 of Part 5 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Aust). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 15 DEFINITION OF “RETIREMENT” TO AVOID CROSS-REFERENCE Submission (Workplace Savings NZ) Clause 80 of the bill introduces a new clause 4B in schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act. This introduces a cross-reference to Australian legislation for the term “retirement”. It would be preferable to define retirement in clause 4B, thus avoiding the cross- reference. It is recognised that this might then lead to an amendment being required if the relevant Australian legislation is changed at some future date. Comment If the definition of Australian retirement is included in the KiwiSaver Act, the Act would no longer refer to the source Australian legislation. As noted in the submission, if Australia changes its definition, the KiwiSaver Act would need to be amended also. For this reason, officials consider that the cross-reference linking to the source legislation is needed to future-proof the definition. To ensure users’ understanding of the legislation, the Australian definition of retirement will be explained in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 CLAUSE 80 – CLARIFICATION OF “NECESSARY MODIFICATION” Submission (Workplace Savings NZ) Clause 80 refers to “necessary modifications” for KiwiSaver scheme trustees. It is not clear what this might cover, so clarification is desired. Comment Australian savings can be withdrawn when an individual is retired according to the definition of “retirement” in the Australian legislation. To ensure that providers do not face onerous compliance costs in checking whether an individual meets the Australian definition of “retirement”, some flexibility has been built into the KiwiSaver Act with the term “necessary modification”. For example, to meet the requirement that the trustees of a KiwiSaver scheme be reasonably satisfied that an individual does not intend to become gainfully employed ever again, a statutory declaration signed by the member could be considered sufficient. The flexibility afforded by the “necessary modification” wording may also mean that KiwiSaver scheme providers do not need to expend resources investigating and policing a member’s eligibility for retirement in each individual case. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 17 PROVISION FOR NON-PERMANENT EMIGRATION Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There is no provision in the rules that deals with the situation when emigration transpires not to be permanent. For example, Mr and Mrs A emigrate permanently to Australia. Both transfer their KiwiSaver balances to Australian complying funds. However, after a period of years the relationship breaks down and Mr A returns to New Zealand. Technically the requirements to transfer the fund balance are no longer met as emigration was not permanent. A provision is required for when emigration transpires not to be permanent. On the other hand, if the test is to be at the time of emigration, then the legislation should state this. Comment Whether an individual has permanently emigrated is tested at the time of application to transfer their KiwiSaver savings. The fact that an individual later returns to New Zealand does not mean that emigration was not permanent at the time of application. Officials do not consider that a further amendment is necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 18 19 KiwiSaver 20 21 ENROLMENT OF UNDER 18-YEAR-OLDS Issue: Clarification of the requirements for guardians Submissions (Chapman Tripp, ING, Workplace Savings NZ) If it remains intended that (for consistency with the requirements in the Care of Children Act 2004) all guardians must act jointly, then there should be a facility for one guardian to sign an application form while confirming (perhaps by oath or statutory declaration) that he or she is acting for both or all guardians jointly. There will be many situations where it is not practicable for the prospective member to have a form signed by all their guardians. Receipt of an oath or declaration from a signatory should suffice to verify guardianship (or lack thereof), as it is not practicable for providers to verify guardianship reliably. It is not apparent how a provider is to establish whether the individual has a guardian. Section 74 refers to those aged 16 years old, with no guardian, being able to enrol as if they are aged 18. If the provider is able to rely on a statement by the applicant that they have no guardian in these circumstances it would be helpful to make this clear. (ING, Workplace Savings NZ) Comment Officials consider that in practice a signed statutory declaration from a guardian would be sufficient evidence to verify their guardianship of a child. Similarly, if a child has no legal guardian a statutory declaration from the child to that effect is sufficient. Guidance on these evidential issues will be set out in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin. Section 16 of the Care of Children Act 2004 states that in exercising the duties and responsibilities of a guardian in relation to a child, a guardian of the child must act jointly with any other guardians of the child. Therefore officials consider that for children under 16 years of age, agreement and joint signatures must be obtained from all of the child’s guardians. A clarifying amendment should be made to ensure this. In the case of children aged 16 to 17, because they will have to co-sign with their guardians in order to enrol in KiwiSaver, one guardian’s signature will be sufficient to enrol them. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 22 Issue: Membership-related discretions for minors in KiwiSaver Submission (Chapman Tripp) The relevant provisions in the bill do not address who may exercise membership- related discretions for minors (for example, regarding investment choice) after minors have joined. The bill could also usefully clarify that membership-related discretions can be exercised by guardians for minors. Care should be taken here, however, to avoid over-prescription in the area of requiring all guardians to act jointly and/or requiring statutory declarations. Comment Officials consider that membership-related discretions for under 18-year-olds can be made by either the guardian or member aged 16 and over without requiring them to be joint signatories. This will be explained in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin article on these amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Member tax credits and compulsory employer contributions for under 18-year-olds Submissions (ASB, ING, Workplace Savings NZ) KiwiSaver benefits should be consistent across the board. If a working minor contributes to KiwiSaver, the minor should also qualify for member tax credits and compulsory employer contributions. (ASB) Individuals aged 16 or 17 who wish to contribute through the workplace to their KiwiSaver account should be encouraged to do so by making them entitled to compulsory employer contributions (exempt from employer’s superannuation contribution tax) and member tax credits. (ING, Workplace Savings NZ) Comment The entitlement age of 18 for eligibility for member tax credits and compulsory employer contributions is an existing design feature of KiwiSaver. Changing the entitlement age to 16 would create an inconsistency as employees are not subject to the automatic enrolment rules until they reach age 18. This inconsistency could create confusion for employers with their compliance obligations. Officials do not consider 23 that reducing the automatic enrolment eligibility requirements to 16 years old is appropriate, as under 18-year-olds could then be automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver while not fully appreciating the consequences. Furthermore, reducing the eligibility age for compulsory employer contributions to 16 would impose additional costs on employers. Similarly, reducing the eligibility age for member tax credits to 16 would impose additional costs on the Crown. Officials do not consider this appropriate in the current fiscal and economic environment. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Age limit applies at the time of application to KiwiSaver Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 74(3) and (4) should be amended by adding after “16 or 17 years old” the words “at the time of application”. This will clarify that the age limit applies at the time of application to remove any doubt. Comment Officials consider that the current legislation is already clear on this matter so the suggested amendment is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reference to parents as well as guardians Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 74(2), (3) and (4) should be amended by adding before “guardian” the words “parent or”. This will clarify that parents or guardians have the same authority to bind a child, or jointly apply for enrolment. The Care of Children Act 2004 in section 15 defines “guardianship” as the same as a parent, but a guardian has a different relationship with the child than a parent. 24 Comment Section 15 of the Care of Children Act defines “guardian” as including parents. The proposed amendment is therefore unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 25 “LEASEHOLD ESTATE” – FIRST HOME WITHDRAWAL AND DEPOSIT SUBSIDY Issue: Earlier application date to cover inadvertent applications Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 80(4) removes the ineligibility of individuals with a leasehold interest from the first home withdrawal or deposit subsidy in clause 8, schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. There is no good reason to apply this amendment from 1 July 2010 so it should apply retrospectively to cover those individuals who have inadvertently applied and been granted a first home withdrawal or deposit subsidy with a leasehold interest. Comment As a result of the KiwiSaver commencement date of 1 July 2007 and the minimum three-year contribution period required for eligibility for first home withdrawal and the deposit subsidy, the earliest that any member could apply or be granted either of these benefits is 1 July 2010. Therefore, there is no need for a retrospective application date. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 26 PROVISION OF ANNUAL REPORT VIA HYPERLINK Issue: Amendment should extend to all superannuation schemes Submissions (ASB, Chapman Tripp, ING, Workplace Savings NZ) It would seem logical to extend this facility to all schemes registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, to broaden the application of annual report distribution via hyperlink. This could be achieved by amending section 17 of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 in the same way as has been proposed to amend the KiwiSaver Act. Comment This bill is a taxation bill and does not propose amendments to the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. The Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 is not administered by Inland Revenue, and policy for that Act is advised on by the Ministry of Economic Development. Therefore any request to consider an amendment to the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, allowing annual reports to be provided via hyperlink, should be addressed by that Ministry. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Agreement in writing to receive annual reports by hyperlink Submission (Chapman Tripp) If there is to be any conditionality around providers’ ability to send annual reports by hyperlink, it should suffice simply for a member to have provided his or her email address. Anything more than that would rob the amendment of any immediate utility in relation to an existing KiwiSaver member (who will, at most, simply have given email addresses and possibly much more generic consents to receipt of electronic information). Comment Officials consider that the requirement for members to give consent could be expedited easily. For example, a member’s acceptance could be received via a check box in an email sent from the provider. This would be consistent with other consent requirements for consumer protection. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 27 TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT – REQUIREMENT TO MAKE KIWISAVER DEDUCTIONS Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to ensure that existing KiwiSaver members who begin temporary employment are able to give their employer a KiwiSaver deduction notice requiring deductions of contributions to be made from salary or wages. This will also ensure that, provided certain other criteria are met (in section 101C), a temporary employee is entitled to receive compulsory employer contributions. Comment Temporary employees such as those employed for less than 28 continuous days are not enrolled automatically in KiwiSaver. However, a temporary employee can opt-in to KiwiSaver either by giving their employer a KiwiSaver deduction notice or by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver scheme provider. The KiwiSaver deduction notice requires an employer to deduct KiwiSaver contributions from an employee’s salary or wages. The requirement that an employer deduct an amount for the employee’s KiwiSaver scheme also ensures that, as long as certain other criteria are met, compulsory employer contributions are made to the employee’s KiwiSaver account. However, if an individual is already a KiwiSaver member and begins temporary employment, the policy intent is that such an individual should have KiwiSaver deductions made from their salary or wages, and receive compulsory employer contributions. However, the current definition of “KiwiSaver deduction notice” in the KiwiSaver Act may prevent this from happening. This appears to be an anomaly in the legislation and should be rectified. The purpose of KiwiSaver is to encourage long-term savings for all workers. Therefore, temporary employees who are already KiwiSaver members should be able to participate in KiwiSaver and receive employer contributions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 28 EMPLOYER EXEMPTION FROM AUTOMATIC ENROLMENT RULES Submission (Chapman Tripp, Workplace Savings NZ) The exempt employer provisions in section 25 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 should incorporate “successor in business” provisions which are analogous to those in section 35 of the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. (Chapman Tripp) A “successor in business” provision should also ensure that the employer’s exempt status is not lost due to the employer migrating its superannuation scheme to a new provider due to dissatisfaction with the existing provider’s performance or service. (Workplace Savings NZ) Comment Sections 24 to 32 of the KiwiSaver Act contain the rules allowing certain employers to be exempt from the requirement to automatically enrol their new employees in KiwiSaver. Employers can apply to the Government Actuary for approval for their employees to be exempt from the automatic enrolment rules if they provide access to an approved registered superannuation scheme which complies with specific criteria. The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 introduced a provision to ensure that employers could not establish schemes which are not KiwiSaver schemes for the apparent purpose of avoiding the automatic enrolment rules. It was considered that this behaviour undermined the policy intent of KiwiSaver and the rationale behind the exemption from the automatic enrolment rules. To overcome this concern, a sunset clause was introduced for the exemption from automatic enrolment. The exemption applies only if the scheme was in existence at the date of enactment of the amending legislation (6 October 2009). There is concern that the sunset clause is not flexible enough to take into account situations such as mergers and acquisitions. In this situation, the replacement agreement would fall outside of the sunset clause and the employer concerned would lose its exempt employer status. A successor provision would preserve relief previously enjoyed by the employer by ensuring that an agreement that succeeds and replaces an existing agreement qualifies for the same relief which applied before the merger or acquisition. Officials acknowledge that the sunset clause was not intended to be problematic in these situations and agree that a successor provision should be included in the legislation. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 29 ONGOING SHARING OF KIWISAVER MEMBER ADDRESSES Submission (ASB) A legislative change should be made to allow the sharing of KiwiSaver members’ address updates between Inland Revenue and providers. This change would help providers with the ongoing costs of returned mail and tracing members’ address details. Comment This submission does not relate to an item in the bill. Officials consider it would be better to consider the matter for the next available tax bill to allow submissions to be received on the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 30 MISLED/MISINFORMED MEMBERS AND INCORRECT ENROLMENTS – WITHDRAWAL PROVISIONS Submissions (ASB, Chapman Tripp) An independent body (such as the Ministry of Economic Development or the scheme’s independent trustee) should have the power to instruct providers to close an account if they are satisfied the closure is in the best interests of the member. A high threshold test and strict guidelines should be put in place to ensure that this process is used only in extreme circumstances. (ASB) It is unclear whether the KiwiSaver Act excludes the application of remedial statutes such as the Contractual Remedies Act 1979 where KiwiSaver membership contracts are entered into in circumstances of otherwise remediable mis-selling or mistake. The KiwiSaver Act could usefully be amended to prescribe, for avoidance of doubt, that it does not limit the application of relevant contract and consumer protection legislation. (Chapman Tripp) Comment These submissions do not relate to an item in the bill. This is a significant issue that requires extensive research. However, officials are aware of the issue and may consider it further as resources allow. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 31 SHORT-PAID EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS Submission (ASB) The KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended to take the responsibility away from the trustee and place the responsibility on employers and/or Inland Revenue to follow up on short-paid compulsory employer contributions. This should be a contractual issue between employees and employers. Comment Officials note that this is not a submission relating to an item in the bill. It is a significant issue that requires extensive research and investigation of fiscal costs. However, officials are aware of this issue and may consider it further as resources allow. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 32 KIWISAVER HARDSHIP CLAIMS Issue: Access to employer contributions under the significant financial hardship criteria Submission (ASB) A change to the legislation should be made to remove the ability for members to withdraw employer contributions if they are facing significant financial hardship. Alternatively, members should be allowed to withdraw only their own personal contributions in cases of significant financial hardship. Comment Officials note that this is not a submission relating to an item in the bill. It is an issue that requires further research. However, officials are aware of this issue and may consider it further as resources allow. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Discretion for trustees to pay third parties in cases of significant financial hardship Submission (ASB) The trustees of some other non-KiwiSaver superannuation schemes have the discretion to pay a member’s balance (in full or in part) to a third party creditor if they have proven significant financial hardship and if the trustee believes it is in the best interest of the member to do so. KiwiSaver scheme trustees should be given the same flexibility to pay amounts directly to creditors of proven arrears. This will ensure that KiwiSaver amounts withdrawn for significant financial hardship are used for the reasons claimed. Comment Officials note that this is not a submission relating to an item in the bill. It is an issue that requires further research. However, officials may consider this further as resources allow. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 33 WITHDRAWING CROWN CONTRIBUTIONS FOR SERIOUS ILLNESS Submission (ASB) There is nothing to prevent an individual who is suffering from a serious illness from joining KiwiSaver. Once a KiwiSaver member, they are potentially eligible for a serious illness withdrawal, therefore entitling them to withdraw the government contributions. A legislative change should be made to ensure that, if it is proven that a member was suffering from a serious illness at the time that they joined KiwiSaver, they are unable to withdraw any Crown contributions. Comment Officials note that this is not a submission relating to an item in the bill. This issue will require further research. However, officials may consider it further as resources allow. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 34 35 Binding rulings 36 37 LEGISLATION SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE COMMISSIONER TO RULE Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The overall policy intent of the changes is supported. However, the overall statutory scheme of the binding rulings regime needs to be reset to encourage the Commissioner to rule as the default or starting position. More specifically, the amendments to the rulings regime should ensure that: • the changes encourage the Commissioner to issue a binding ruling rather than decline to rule; • the Commissioner does not use his powers of restriction unnecessarily; and • there is consistency of application of the law by the Commissioner and the Crown. Comment The binding rulings system is aimed at providing certainty for taxpayers in assessing their tax liabilities. Officials agree that restrictions to this ability need to be justifiable. Relevant factors to take into account in setting any restrictions are the need to protect the revenue base and the need for consistency in interpreting tax laws. Several proposals in this bill are aimed at improving taxpayer certainty by clarifying when the Commissioner can rule (for example, the amendments to the prohibition of ruling on questions of fact and the discretion not to rule when a similar matter is subject to appeal). Other proposals are aimed at expanding the circumstances when a ruling can be made (for example, allowing the Commissioner to make a binding ruling in favour of one tax type only, even though the application relates to more than one or allowing promoters to apply for rulings). None of the proposals in the bill give the Commissioner greater powers to decline to rule than currently exist. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 38 QUESTIONS OF FACT Issue: Matters on which the Commissioner cannot rule Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) While it is accepted that the Commissioner should not generally be expected to be an “expert” in items (b) – (d) (of the definition of “proscribed question”) the Commissioner should be able to rule on these matters on the basis that he is satisfied with the level of evidence provided by a taxpayer in support of either: • their intention; • the value of something; or • what is commercially acceptable practice. Inland Revenue operational/audit staff are expected to satisfy themselves of these matters on a daily basis, routinely deciding whether to audit a taxpayer or when undertaking an audit. Therefore we believe it is reasonable and appropriate to enable the Commissioner to provide a view outside of an audit context on the above matters. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Inland Revenue should be able to issue binding rulings on any matter on which it can make an assessment (for example, questions of fact, commercially acceptable practice, and generally accepted accounting practice). (KPMG) Consistent with our view that the statutory scheme of the binding rulings regime should be designed to encourage the Commissioner to rule, the Commissioner should not be prohibited from giving a ruling in relation to a person’s purpose or intention (proposed paragraph (b) of the definition) or what is commercially acceptable practice (proposed paragraph (d) of the definition). (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Under the Tax Administration Act 1994 taxpayers who seek rulings (currently private, product and status rulings) are not required to follow the ruling, whereas Inland Revenue must apply the law as set out in the ruling. Officials consider there is some validity to the submitters’ questioning the argument that the Commissioner does not have expertise in relation to matters such as valuation and commercially acceptable practice. However, the more general question is how Inland Revenue applies its resources. If the Commissioner were to rule on a very broad a range of matters, the time taken to make binding rulings would increase. This is not the outcome sought by submitters. 39 Officials consider that it is important to differentiate the rulings process from the process of considering a taxpayer’s self-assessment. We note that an audit or investigation occurs after a taxpayer has made their tax self-assessment and factual matters can be the subject of more lengthy debate and expert evidence may be called for. In a ruling the Commissioner rules on the facts as provided by the taxpayer. The ability for taxpayers to seek binding rulings was intended to enable them to gain certainty in undertaking the self-assessment process. Hence binding rulings have a specific purpose rather than being a general source of assistance from Inland Revenue. Revenue risks will arise if the Commissioner, owing to resource constraints and the need to respond in a timeframe that meets the taxpayer’s business needs, is forced to make an early determination about the facts. This risk is compounded by the complexity and large dollar amounts involved in many rulings applications. This risk would arise when the facts turn out not to be as presented and the Commissioner has to argue that the ruling will not apply. The Commissioner can do this only if the arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling or there was a material omission or misrepresentation in the application for the ruling. If the arrangement being ruled on is prospective the Commissioner could not sensibly determine questions of fact since something must be in existence for it to be a fact. We note that rulings are not limited to prospective transactions, however, for pragmatic reasons. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Discretion to rule on intention and value Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Commissioner should be given the option to provide a ruling regarding a person’s purpose or intention, or what is “commercially acceptable practice”. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The general rule that the Commissioner cannot rule on questions of fact should be retained, but the Commissioner should have the discretion to rule on, for example, a taxpayer’s intention, purpose, or the value of a business or asset. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The list of criteria under which the Commissioner has a discretion not to rule is very limited. Giving the Commissioner a discretion in relation to proscribed questions of fact would reduce certainty about the issues the Commissioner can rule on. This would defeat the objective of the proposals which is to clarify what constitutes a question of fact. 40 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Commercially acceptable practice Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If the purpose of prohibiting the Commissioner from ruling on what is commercially acceptable practice is to prevent the Commissioner from dictating what is or is to be “commercially acceptable practice”, the Institute agrees with the proposed amendment. If this is so the wording of paragraph (d) of the definition of “proscribed question” should be reworded to clarify its meaning. Comment Currently the Commissioner may not rule if the application for the ruling would require the Commissioner to form an opinion as to generally accepted accounting practice or to form an opinion as to a commercially acceptable practice. Officials note that the current scope of the exclusion for commercially acceptable practice is unclear. The proposal clarifies that the exclusion for commercially acceptable practice is limited to where that term is used in tax legislation (such as in the rules relating to the tax treatment of financial arrangements). It does not therefore prevent the Commissioner from ruling on broader matters such as the application of the general anti-avoidance provision. Ruling on anti-avoidance matters may require the Commissioner to consider the commerciality of the arrangement and the Commissioner should not be restricted in doing so. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Proposal should not proceed Submission (Ernst & Young) The proposed new definition of “proscribed facts” and the resulting amendments are not necessary and do not provide any further certainty or clarity for taxpayers but may open more scope for argument as to the extent to the Commissioner’s powers in relation to binding rulings. 41 Comment Under current sections 91E(4)(a) and 91F(4)(a) the Commissioner is prohibited from ruling on questions of fact. The Commissioner can rule on the facts as presented by the applicant, but cannot determine the correctness of the facts. The submission appears to consider that the provisions should and do allow the Commissioner to rule on the application of the general anti-avoidance provisions in the income tax and GST legislation. On an alternative interpretation of sections 91E(4)(a) and 91F(4)(a), however, it could be argued that the Commissioner is prohibited from making a ruling when doing so would expressly or implicitly require particular facts to be found to exist. In that case, the Commissioner may be unable to rule on fact-dependent issues such as the application of the general anti-avoidance provision or specific anti-avoidance provisions. Such a broad interpretation would be inconsistent with the understanding and application of the binding rulings provisions by taxpayers, tax practitioners and Inland Revenue since the binding rulings regime was introduced in 1994. The inability to obtain a binding ruling on questions of avoidance would reduce certainty for businesses. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of “may” Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The interpretation of the word “may” in the context of sections 91E(3), (4) and 91F(3), (4) should be clarified. Comment The context of sections 91E (which allows the Commissioner to make private binding rulings on request) and 91F (which allows the Commissioner to make product rulings) provide sufficient clarity for the legal interpretation of the words “may” and “may not” as they are variously used in those sections. In sections 91E(4) (which lists the circumstances when the Commissioner may not make a private ruling) and 91F(4) (which lists the circumstances when the Commissioner may not make a product ruling), the words “may not” clearly introduce mandatory prohibitions, despite “may”, on its own (that is, when “may” is unqualified by “not”), usually conveying discretion or permission. 42 In sections 91E(3) and 91F(3), the word “may” is not qualified by “not”. It therefore introduces a discretion and is intended to do so. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 43 TREATMENT OF INFORMATION Issue: Response to proposal Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Institute supports the proposed amendment which clarifies that the Commissioner may make a ruling based on the facts provided by the applicant and may inquire as to the correctness or existence of fact provided by the applicant, but is not required to do so. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed change should not be enacted. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The bill proposes that the Commissioner cannot rule as to whether a fact is correct or exists. The proposal clarifies that the Commissioner must make a ruling based on the facts provided by the applicant. If there is something apparently incorrect in the application, the proposal allows the Commissioner to question this but he is not required to do so. The PricewaterhouseCoopers submission is concerned that the last aspect of the proposal does not sit comfortably with the proposal to introduce “proscribed questions of fact”. The aspect of the proposal that is causing concern allows the Commissioner to inquire as to the correctness of facts when there is an obvious error in the application. However, this should save time and money for both the Commissioner and the applicant. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 44 ABILITY TO RULE WHEN THE MATTER IS SUBJECT TO A CASE BEFORE THE COURTS Issue: The restriction should be removed Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Inland Revenue should be able to issue binding rulings on matters before the courts. (KPMG) The restriction on issuing a ruling when the matter is the subject of a dispute by way of objection, challenge, or appeal should be removed altogether. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The Commissioner has a discretion under which he can decline to rule “if the matter on which the ruling is sought is subject to an objection, challenge or appeal, whether in relation to the applicant or to any other person”. The provision is expressed in general terms and its scope, particularly the term “matter” is unclear. The provision does not allow for an unduly narrow interpretation such as requiring an identical transaction and the same or an associated taxpayer. At the other extreme, it would be inappropriate to apply it to all instances when an issue arises that is commonly determined in a transaction – for example, the application of the general anti- avoidance provision – as that would allow the Commissioner to turn down any ruling application on that issue. This lack of clarity does not give businesses certainty. The bill proposes that the Commissioner’s discretion not to rule on matters before the courts be limited to cases involving substantially similar issues or arrangements. Therefore, while it is proposed to retain the discretion, it is being substantially narrowed. Narrowing, or removing, the discretion further would mean that the Commissioner would be required to rule in an area of law that is uncertain. This could result in taxpayers obtaining inconsistent outcomes. It could also result in revenue risks were the Commissioner forced to rule before a similar arrangement in existence at the same time had been tested by the courts. This is particularly so given the inability of the Commissioner to investigate facts in the rulings context (which officials recommend should be retained). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 45 Issue: The term “substantially the same” should be defined Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The term “substantially the same” should be defined in the legislation or replaced with a more precise term. Comment The proposal narrows the scope of current section 91E(3)(b) in that it would no longer apply to a “matter on which the ruling is sought” but rather to “an arrangement on which the ruling is sought or a separately identifiable part of the arrangement, substantially the same as the arrangement subject to the objection, challenge or appeal”. The word “substantial” has been interpreted by the courts and officials understand that this imports a high threshold. There is no reason to think that the word “substantially” would be interpreted differently. Given the differing factual scenarios that could arise under the proposed new rule, officials do not consider that further definition would be particularly helpful. We note that the term “substantially” is used elsewhere in tax legislation and that an attempt at further definition has not been made there either. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Should not apply to separately identifiable parts of the arrangement Submission (Ernst & Young, KPMG) The references to separately identifiable parts of the arrangement should be deleted. (Ernst & Young) The effect of the proposed amendment on an arrangement which is only partly the subject of a court dispute needs to be clarified. (KPMG) Comment The Ernst & Young submission notes that “the tax treatment of a “separately identifiable part of an arrangement” may differ significantly, depending on the rest of the arrangement of which it is part”. Officials agree and note that ruling on a separately identifiable part of the arrangement rather than the whole arrangement will be at the Commissioner’s discretion. 46 However, we consider that the references to separately identifiable parts needs to be retained for those cases when there are differences in the arrangement being considered but the principal underlying feature in both is the same. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The definition of “arrangement” should be widened Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of “arrangement” in section 3 should be widened for the purposes of the rulings regime. Comment The definition of “arrangement” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is already very broad. The same definition is used in the rulings regime and the general anti-avoidance provision and in the financial arrangement rules. A rulings “arrangement” has the additional feature of allowing the Commissioner to include in it “facts that the Commissioner considers are material or relevant as background or context”. Officials are not aware of any problems with the current definition. Basing the rulings regime on the “arrangement” concept seems appropriate as it is a regime to provide certainty and this can be achieved by ensuring consistency with usage in other areas of the law. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The arrangement should be the same arrangement Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Law Society) Any such inability or discretion to rule should be limited to situations where the court proceedings are already in train and relate to the specific arrangement and parties who are seeking the rulings. (Ernst & Young) 47 Sections 91E(3)(b) and 91F(3)(b) should be confined to situations in which the challenge proceedings concern the same arrangement and the particular tax laws on which the ruling is sought. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The legislation currently gives the Commissioner a discretion not to rule if the matter on which the ruling is sought is subject to appeal. The proposal narrows the current legislation in that it would no longer apply to a “matter on which the ruling is sought” but rather an arrangement on which the ruling is sought or a separately identifiable part of the arrangement, substantially the same as the arrangement subject to the objection, challenge or appeal”. If the Commissioner’s discretion were exercised only in relation to the same arrangement and parties, a ruling could be sought, and given in relation to another arrangement covering the same issues as those being appealed, resulting in inconsistent outcomes for the parties. This would reduce certainty for the parties and give rise to the revenue and other risks officials identified earlier. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Guidelines Submission (KPMG) Inland Revenue should publicly release guidelines on what factors are taken into account in the exercise of the discretion. Comment Officials consider that the factors that would be taken into account in exercising this discretion are not general – that is, the exercise of the discretion will be considered on a case-by-case basis. We consider that it would be difficult to compile a useful list of facts that would determine two particular arrangements in a ruling application and a dispute to be substantially the same. Each case would involve an individual judgement based on the particular facts and their degree of similarity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 48 Issue: The Commissioner should be required to notify an applicant that the issue is before the courts Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If Inland Revenue exercises that discretion, it should inform the taxpayer of its position on the tax law involved. (KPMG) As part of this amendment the legislation should require the Commissioner to notify the applicant that the issue is before the court and what Inland Revenue’s position is. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The 1994 discussion document, Binding Rulings on Taxation, explained the policy intention of the discretion in section 91E(3)(b) and noted that “Inland Revenue will notify the applicant that the issue is before the court and what Inland Revenue’s position is”. The proposal to notify the applicant did not proceed. As the provision applies to ruling and dispute arrangements that may involve different parties, such a requirement could be contrary to taxpayer secrecy, including under section 81. In practice, Inland Revenue will advise an applicant affected by the provision about the dispute if the dispute is in the public domain (for example, a decision is under appeal). If both the ruling and disputed arrangement are entered into by the same person, Inland Revenue is obviously able to discuss the relevant issues. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 49 MASS MARKETED AND PUBLICLY PROMOTED SCHEME RULINGS Issue: Authority of person making a statutory declaration Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants,) The legislation should stipulate the level of authority of the person who is to make the statutory declaration of the promoter. Comment The proposal requires the person making the application, being the promoter of the arrangement, to make a statutory declaration. Any person signing the declaration is therefore doing so on behalf of the promoter. If they are falsely representing the promoter other sanctions will be available. Specifying in the legislation the minimum level of authority seems to be unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of “promoter” Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants,) The definition of “promoter” should be amended and supporting administrative practices within the Inland Revenue Department should be put in place to confirm the scope of the proposal and to ensure that a consistent view is adopted of who or what a “promoter” is. Comment There is a definition of “promoter” already in section 141ED(1) of the penalty provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994. The definition provides that a “promoter” means: (a) A person who is a party to, or is significantly involved in formulating, a plan or programme from which an arrangement is offered; or (b) A person who is aware of material and relevant aspects of the arrangement and who sells, issues or promotes the selling or issuing of, the arrangement, whether or not for remuneration. 50 This proposal will use the same definition in sections 91FC and 91FD. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 51 DECLINING TO RULE WHEN AN ARRANGEMENT IS THE SUBJECT OF A DISPUTE Issue: Extension of proposal to audits Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment to allow the Commissioner to make a ruling if the application relates to an arrangement that is being disputed, provided the application for the ruling relates to a different tax type from that being disputed, should be extended to cases when the Commissioner is auditing or investigating the taxpayer and not limited to tax type. Comment Under section 91E(4)(ga) the Commissioner may not make a private ruling if the application relates to an arrangement that is being disputed by way of a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA). This provision ensures that there is no overlap between the disputes resolution process and the binding rulings regime. It also ensures that certainty for the taxpayer about the Commissioner’s position is maintained. The section is being amended to provide an exception to this prohibition which will apply if the application for the ruling relates to a different tax type from that being disputed. In an audit or dispute, factual matters can be the subject of more lengthy debate and expert evidence. In a ruling, the Commissioner rules on the facts as provided by the applicant may be used. The arrangement is often prospective. Any questions over the correct tax treatment of an arrangement are best resolved in the audit or dispute context if these have begun. Considering a binding ruling application can involve considerable resources on Inland Revenue’s part and is not necessarily conducive to the speedy resolution of an audit or dispute. Currently the disputes process is being reviewed to further facilitate resolution; having the taxpayer able to apply for a binding ruling at the same time may be detrimental to this process. We also note that the proposal in relation to disputes only applies when the tax type on which the ruling is sought is not being disputed. In an audit situation one tax type may be audited initially but the other tax types subsequently considered. Ruling on a particular aspect of a taxpayer’s assessment could undermine the audit process. This risk is not a concern in the disputes context. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 52 Issue: Taxpayers should be able to seek a ruling when they have self- assessed Submission (KPMG) Taxpayers should be able to request a binding ruling for the current tax period after their self-assessment for the current tax period. Comment Rulings may be sought only on prospective arrangements or on arrangements in relation to which the taxpayer has not made the relevant self-assessment and has therefore not taken the relevant tax position. As we have noted, officials consider that it is important to differentiate the rulings process from the process of considering a taxpayer’s self-assessment. Once the self- assessment is undertaken, the taxpayer may be either subject to audit or (within a four-month period) file a taxpayer-initiated notice of proposed adjustment. Officials have noted that in the case of an audit that process is better suited for reaching an outcome. If the concern is with the taxpayer notice of proposed adjustment, the issue would be best dealt with as part of the Government’s current review of the tax disputes process. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date Submission (Ernst & Young) The changes should apply to all applications which have not been declined on the paragraph 91E(4)(ga) ground, or which have not been finalised and issued, before enactment of the bill. Comment Section 91E(4)(ga) is being amended to provide an exception to the prohibition on ruling on disputed arrangements that are the subject of a NOPA. The exception will apply if the application for the ruling relates to a different tax type from that being disputed. Currently, the proposal will apply from the date the bill is enacted. 53 Officials are unaware of any reason for the proposal not to apply to ruling applications which have already been lodged but have not yet been declined or finalised by the time the bill is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 54 A RULING THAT FAILS IN PART Issue: Agree with proposal Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill’s amendments that are intended to allow taxpayers to rely on a binding ruling in part, based on tax type, are sensible and agree with our previous submissions on the binding rulings system. (KPMG) The Institute supports the proposed amendment as it allows taxpayers to rely on parts of a ruling that they apply without having to apply all the rulings made by the Commissioner in relation to the arrangement. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Currently under section 91EB(2) a binding ruling involving material differences with the arrangement actually undertaken is treated as fully invalid even if those differences are material only to certain aspects of the ruling. An example is when a ruling relates to both GST and income tax and the material differences relate only to the GST issues. Amendments are proposed so that a ruling can be made invalid in part rather than only in full. The partial validity will apply if not all tax types ought to be affected by a general invalidity. The proposal will provide greater flexibility in the rulings process. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application of proposal to rulings on more than one tax law Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The scheme of the rulings regime should be reconsidered to confirm that the amendment achieves the desired objective of requiring a taxpayer to apply all the Commissioner’s rulings in relation to a tax type and the tax position(s) being considered. Comment Officials consider that a ruling which has two issues (for example, deductibility and assessability or a ruling on more than one tax) is only one, not two, rulings. 55 In other words, under the amended legislation, Inland Revenue’s practice of treating a ruling on a number of issues as one ruling will remain unchanged. The legislation will, however, allow a ruling that is taxpayer-positive for one tax type and taxpayer- negative for another to apply when it relates to the positive outcome only. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date Submission (Ernst & Young, KPMG) The changes should apply to all applications which have not been finalised and issued before enactment of the bill. (Ernst & Young) The amendments are limited to binding rulings whose application is received after the date of Royal assent for the bill. This limitation is inconsistent with the purpose of the bill to increase certainty. We submit that all existing rulings should be able to take the benefit of the amendments at any time after the date of Royal assent. (KPMG) Comment Officials agree that the application date of the amendments to section 91E(4)(ga) as they relate to allowing a partially accepted application should be amended to extend to all existing rulings. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 56 PUBLICATION OF NOTIFICATION OF BINDING RULINGS IN THE GAZETTE Issue: Agree with proposal Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Institute agrees with the proposal to no longer require the Commissioner to publish notification of rulings in the Gazette and instead publish this information in a publication chosen by the Commissioner. Comment The binding rulings legislation requires Inland Revenue to notify the making and withdrawal of public and product rulings in the Gazette. Public and product binding rulings are also published in full in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin (TIB). The TIB is available on Inland Revenue’s website and a paper copy can be requested. The TIB will continue to be the main vehicle for publication. The bill proposes to replace the requirements that the Commissioner publish the making and withdrawal of public and product rulings in the Gazette with requirements that the Commissioner publish this information in a publication chosen by the Commissioner. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Other provisions which should be amended Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) There are other sections in the Tax Administration Act 1994 requiring the Commissioner to publish the making or revocation of determinations that have been omitted from the bill. The amendment should be extended to notifications of extension of public rulings (section 91DD(2)) and status of product rulings (section 91GG(2)(a)). (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The reference to “the Gazette” in the following sections should also be replaced with the phrase “a publication chosen by the Commissioner” in sections 91AAl(4)(b), 91AAK, 91DD(1) and 91GG(2). (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 57 Comment Similar amendments should be made to the following sections in the Tax Administration Act 1994: • 91AAK (Notice of setting economic rate); • 91AAQ (Determination of insurer as a non-attributing active CFC); and • 91AAR(6) (Determination relating to eligible relocation expenses). However section 91AAF(6), 91AAG(7) and 91AAI(4) provide for the revocation of provisions effective the day after publication in the Gazette. The Gazette is published weekly. The Tax Information Bulletin, for example, is published in most cases monthly. Officials therefore consider, due to the frequency of the Gazette’s publication, these sections should continue to refer to the Gazette. The issue will be considered further at a later date. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Specification of publication Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Commissioner should be required to specify the publication(s) that notices will be published in. Comment It is not necessary to specify the publication in which the Commissioner will publish notices. The Commissioner will publish the notices in an appropriate publication. Naming, for example, the Tax Information Bulletin, in legislation or regulation would mean that if the name of the publication changed the legislation or regulation would need to be updated. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 58 UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION PENALTIES AND USE-OF- MONEY INTEREST Issue: Agree with proposal Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The changes made to remove both penalties and use-of-money interest where a taxpayer has relied on the advice of the Inland Revenue are supported. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) KPMG agrees with the proposed amendments clarifying that if a taxpayer has relied on official advice from Inland Revenue, the unacceptable tax position penalty and use-of-money interest cannot apply. (KPMG) The Institute agrees with this proposal in principle. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment A shortfall penalty for taking an unacceptable tax position can be imposed when a taxpayer’s tax position fails to meet the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct”. The penalty applies when the tax position involves a significant amount of tax. Use-of-money interest imposed on a taxpayer is charged when tax is underpaid and compensates the Crown for not having the use of its money. It is possible that an unacceptable tax position penalty and/or use-of-money interest may apply if the taxpayer has underpaid their tax, even if this is as a result of having relied on advice provided by Inland Revenue. Proposed sections 120W and 141B(1D) and a definition of “Commissioner’s official opinion” are included in the bill to ensure that taxpayers who rely on official Inland Revenue advice will not be subject to use-of-money interest or to the unacceptable tax position penalty. The provision will apply to advice provided orally or in writing by the Commissioner as the official position of Inland Revenue and which is applicable specifically to the taxpayer (with all the relevant facts having been provided by the taxpayer). The amendment will not apply to advice that is in the form of a private binding ruling. As the ruling is binding on the Commissioner, the taxpayer, in following the ruling, is already not be subject to interest or the unacceptable tax position penalty. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 59 Issue: Application to Commissioner’s public statements Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society) The legislation should be extended to situations where the taxpayer has relied on general advice provided by Inland Revenue, such as commentary provided in Inland Revenue publications or on its website. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The bill should extend the exemptions from use-of-money interest and the unacceptable tax position penalty to taxpayers who rely on general statements. (KPMG) The amendment should be extended to apply to the Commissioner’s publicly released statements. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed new safe harbour relating to reliance on the “Commissioner’s official opinion” should extend to written guidance published by the Commissioner, if applicable to the particular taxpayer and their particular circumstances. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment If the proposal were to extend to general guidance or statements Inland Revenue will not necessarily be able to determine whether a taxpayer did or did not at the relevant time rely on the advice. Alternatively, the taxpayer may interpret a general statement in a way that Inland Revenue would not agree fitted their particular case. The unacceptable tax position penalty and use-of-money interest (which is intended to apply generally to underpayments rather than as a penalty) would therefore be relatively simple to avoid. This in turn would undermine the voluntary compliance objectives of these measures. Section 183D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner to remit use-of-money interest if remission is consistent with the Commissioner’s duty to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law. The Commissioner’s standard practice statement 05/10 sets out the Commissioner’s practice in granting remission of penalties and interest. The Commissioner will remit use-of- money interest in limited circumstances, such as when an Inland Revenue officer has given incorrect advice to the taxpayer, and that advice has directly resulted in the non- compliance. The Commissioner considers each case on its merits. The remission provisions are therefore available to taxpayers and will be applied by the Commissioner if appropriate when reliance on general guidance or statements has resulted in the taxpayer taking an incorrect position. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 60 Issue: Scope of the proposal Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There needs to be clarification of the respective scope and commencement of the two new proposed provisions, of the interaction between them and of what will constitute “official departmental advice” and a “Commissioner’s official opinion”. The proposed new subsection 120AA(3) of the Tax Administration Act should apply only to relieve taxpayers from use-of-money interest on underpaid tax and should not prevent them being credited with use-of-money interest when tax has been overpaid when relying on the Commissioner’s advice or opinions. (Ernst & Young) The consequences of relying on the “Commissioner’s official opinion” or “official departmental advice” should be the same. A person who overpays income tax as a result of relying on the official advice or opinion of the Commissioner should be entitled to receive use-of-money interest. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Officials agree that the scope of the proposal needs to be clarified. If a taxpayer overpays tax, Inland Revenue should pay use-of-money interest. Both provisions should apply to oral and written advice from Inland Revenue which is provided specifically to the taxpayer. Officials recommend that clause 67 be omitted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted by removing clause 67. Issue: Phrases should be defined Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The term “official departmental advice” should be defined. Further definition is required on what is meant by “advice that is standard in nature” and the term “common tax issue”. Comment Officials are recommending that the clause containing the phrases “official departmental advice”, “advice that is standard in nature” and “common tax issue” be omitted. Defining these terms in the legislation would in any case be difficult. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 61 Issue: “Solely” should be deleted from the proposal Submission (Ernst & Young) The word “solely” should be deleted from the proposed new section 120W. Comment Under the proposed changes a taxpayer is liable to pay penalties and use-of-money interest to the extent to which these arose solely because the taxpayer relied on the Commissioner’s official opinion. The inclusion of “solely” imposes an almost impossible test – if the taxpayer had relied on advice from a number of sources, including Inland Revenue, the taxpayer would not have relied on advice “solely” from Inland Revenue and could be subject to penalties and interest. Officials agree that “solely” should be deleted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The Committee should also give consideration to bringing forward the application date of this safe harbour, so that it may apply to tax positions taken on or after the date of Royal assent, at least for opinions published as guidance for the general public or a particular group of taxpayers. Comment As noted previously, these proposals do not cover public statements, but rather advice provided orally or in writing by the Commissioner as the official position of Inland Revenue and which are applicable specifically to the taxpayer. In this more limited context the issue does not arise. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 62 Issue: Guidelines Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Inland Revenue should provide guidelines for how this provision will operate, for example, it should explain the steps that a taxpayer is required to take when seeking to rely on the Commissioner’s official opinion. Comment Inland Revenue usually provides information to taxpayers about how key administrative processes operate following the enactment of legislation affecting those processes. The submission will therefore be considered for this purpose. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 63 CHARGING FOR BINDING RULINGS Issue: Agree with proposal Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Institute agrees with this proposal. Comment Private, product and status binding rulings all incur fees that are based on recovering the cost of providing the ruling. Currently, Inland Revenue may in exceptional circumstances, at the Commissioner’s discretion, waive in whole or in part any fee payable by an applicant. More flexibility is required for the exercise of the waiver. Currently, the fees assume a GST-inclusive rate of 12.5% and do not take into account the fact that binding rulings issued to non-residents outside New Zealand may be zero-rated under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and making the ruling more costly if the non-resident is not GST-registered. The bill proposes an amendment to the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1999 to provide for a more flexible fee-waiver provision based on what the Commissioner considers is fair and reasonable. The fees for zero-rated supplies of binding rulings will be reduced by the tax fraction of the fee. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Guidelines Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Guidelines on what the Commissioner would consider to be fair and reasonable circumstances for a fee waiver would be helpful. To ensure the policy intent of the amendments is applied in practice, a wide interpretation of “fair and reasonable” should be adopted. 64 Comment The bill proposes that the waiver provision be amended based on what is fair and reasonable in the circumstances and having regard to the nature of the issues that are the subject of the application, the level of skill and experience required in the consideration of the application, and any other relevant factors. Officials consider that guidelines would be difficult to draft as what the Commissioner considers “fair and reasonable” must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 65 OTHER MATTERS Issue: Time limit Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Time limits should be imposed on the Commissioner in the binding rulings process. Comment Inland Revenue has conducted an administrative review of the rulings process, and consulted with interested groups about ways in which concerns relating to timeliness can be addressed. Inland Revenue is undertaking more up-front consultation with the applicant to ensure the issues are clearly identified, allocating some ruling applications to areas of the department other than the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel and aiming to complete rulings within three months of receipt of the application. The issues raised in a binding ruling application can be numerous and complex, therefore some flexibility in the timeframes may be needed in exceptional cases. If the legislation were amended to set out a time limit for binding rulings and the deadline could not be met, the Commissioner would issue a negative ruling – and if the taxpayer chose to withdraw the ruling application or not follow the ruling, the taxpayer would not be provided with any certainty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Content and notification of a public ruling Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The legislation should be amended to state that all public rulings will apply only on a prospective basis. Comment Currently the Commissioner is not restricted in his ability to rule retrospectively. This may not seem desirable to taxpayers. However, in practice ruling retrospectively is only done to ensure that there is certainty when there would otherwise be a “gap” between the expiry of one ruling and the issuing of another. 66 Inland Revenue is aiming to ensure that a replacement ruling is issued on or before the previous one expires. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application of ruling after expiry Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to confirm the application of a public ruling in the period after the date of expiry to the date the ruling is reissued. Comment The submission is inconsistent with one of the key aspects of the scheme and purpose of the binding rulings legislation. The regime is intended to give the Commissioner the option of ruling for a period of time (section 91DA(1)(e)(i)) or indefinitely (section 91DA(1)(e)(ii)). Given the option of taking a binding position for a period, this means that once a ruling expires it will have no effect. The Commissioner may in those circumstances decide to “reissue” a ruling for a further period or indefinitely. In some cases he may decide not to reissue or replace a ruling at all. This could be for a range of reasons – for example, if the legislation has changed, or the arrangement does not occur or occurs so infrequently as to make the ruling largely redundant. An automatic extension would not sit comfortably with rulings that needed to be changed or that were not appropriate for reissue. Currently, the Commissioner does have the power to extend an expired ruling (section 91DD). This power has been exercised only once or twice but does allow the possible continuation of a view without needing to formally consult as would be the case if the ruling was reissued. Recommendation That the submission be declined 67 Issue: Definitions Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definitions “Commissioner’s official opinion”, “Promoter”, and “Proscribed question” should be added to section 91B or included in the main body of the legislation as part of the substantive provisions that refer to these terms. Comment The issue of the placement of definitions is much wider than that of how the particular definitions referred to in the submission are placed. It requires a more comprehensive consideration of this structural aspect of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and needs to be considered further. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 68 69 Other policy matters 70 71 BETA DEBITS Clauses 29 and 30 The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 introduced a number of reforms to the international tax rules. Before the rule changes, New Zealand companies with controlling interests in foreign companies were taxed twice on the income of those companies. Firstly, they were taxed when the company earned the income (the company’s income was “attributed” back to the New Zealand shareholder). Secondly, they were taxed when the money was returned to New Zealand as a dividend. To prevent double taxation, branch equivalent tax accounts (BETAs) were used. If tax was paid on attributed income first, a credit arose in the BETA and could be used to satisfy any subsequent tax liability relating to a dividend. If tax was paid on a dividend first, a BETA debit arose and could be used to satisfy any subsequent liability for tax on attributed income. Since the changes to the international tax rules, New Zealand companies with controlling interests in foreign companies are taxable at most once – when the income is earned by the company. BETA accounts can therefore be phased out. 1 Transitional issues and announcement of transitional period Although BETA accounts can be phased out, they do need to remain for a transitional period to prevent double taxation that could occur if: • tax was paid on a dividend from a controlled foreign company, under the old rules; and • the income from which the dividend was paid is attributed for tax purposes later than the dividend, under the new rules; and • the attributed income is of a kind that is taxable under the new rules (that is, “passive income” such as interest or royalties). In that event, BETA debits that arose from tax paid on the dividend should be able to be used – for a limited period – to relieve tax on passive attributed income. For this reason, it was announced in mid-2008 that existing BETA debits could be retained and used for a period of two years. 1 Foreign dividends are now exempt. There are some exceptions, but in those cases there is a corresponding tax deduction which can be claimed in the calculation of tax on attributed income. This prevents double taxation without the need for BETA accounts. 72 The conduit tax relief regime Overlaying the taxation of interests in controlled foreign companies and the BETA mechanism, were rules to give conduit tax relief. Conduit tax relief meant that if the New Zealand company with the controlling interest in a foreign company was itself owned by a foreigner, New Zealand would not impose any tax on income from the interest (because it was effectively foreign-sourced income of a non-resident, even though passing through a resident company). Even though no tax was imposed by New Zealand when conduit relief was claimed, BETA credits or debits continued to arise and to be used; conduit relief was only claimed when there were insufficient credits or debits to offset all tax liabilities. 2 The conduit tax relief rules were repealed as part of the international tax change and replaced by an active income exemption and a foreign dividend exemption. No further conduit tax relief will arise. Developments following changes to the international tax rules Following the changes to the international tax rules, it was brought to our attention that it was unnecessary to retain BETA debits if conduit tax relief had been claimed on the dividend that generated the debit. If conduit tax relief was claimed when the BETA debits arose, no tax was paid and so there is no double taxation to relieve. The income will be taxed once at most, under the new rules. The change in the current bill The purpose of the change in the current bill is to cancel those BETA debits that arose from dividends that were subject to conduit tax relief. There is no need for the BETA debits in that case, because there is no possibility of double taxation. Issue: All BETA debits should be retained for a two-year transitional period Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Telecom) All BETA debits should be retained for a two-year transitional period. (New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Telecom) 2 The continued application of the BETA mechanism was technically necessary to correctly keep track of amounts that had been relieved of tax. These amounts were “tagged” to ensure they were eventually paid out to non-residents and not to New Zealanders. If payments were made to New Zealanders from these amounts, tax was re-imposed. Without the BETA accounts, too much tax would have been re- imposed. 73 Cancelling BETA debits would have a retrospective effect. (New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Telecom) The provision would retrospectively reverse conduit tax relief available before the effective date of the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. The scheme of New Zealand’s old international tax rules was to apply tax (or conduit relief) at the earlier of distribution to a New Zealand resident or attribution to the New Zealand resident under the CFC or FIF rules. (New Zealand Law Society) Retrospective legislation that has a negative effect on taxpayers should be used sparingly and only when there are serious base maintenance concerns. The group cannot understand how there is now a base maintenance concern that did not exist when the detailed tax reforms began in 2006 and when the press release was issued in 2008. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Cancelling BETA debits would impact negatively on businesses that made decisions based on the previously announced two-year window. (New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Telecom) New Zealand companies with BETA debit balances have been making decisions, issuing financial reports, and making representations to the market and shareholders on the basis of the previously announced two-year window. Telecom has made key business decisions relying in good faith on what had been, until recently, a clear publicly stated position. The proposed change will have a net cost to Telecom of more than $20 million and will require Telecom to restate its accounts and financial projections. (Telecom) The proposed measure will negatively impact on ordinary business arrangements in addition to any potential mischief. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment There are essentially two types of BETA debit: one where the BETA debit was generated as a result of tax being paid on the dividend, and another where the BETA debit was generated even though no actual tax was paid on the dividend because of conduit tax relief. If tax has been paid on the dividend there is potential for double taxation in the transition to the new international tax rules. Accordingly, it is appropriate to allow companies to continue to use these BETA debits for a two-year transitional period. If no tax has been paid on the dividend (because of conduit tax relief) there is no potential for double taxation. If these BETA debits are not cancelled, the company that has them can use them to offset any tax on attribution of foreign income, resulting in no taxation at all. 74 The July 2008 commentary on the Taxation (International Tax, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill was explicit that the transitional period for BETA debits was “intended only to prevent double taxation in the rare cases in which dividends have been paid significantly in advance of attributed passive income arising.” \[emphasis added\]. Double taxation is not an issue for conduit income. Allowing taxpayers to keep these debits will effectively prolong conduit tax relief and allow non-taxation of passive income for two years. Based on the BETA debit balances that we know about, it is estimated that retaining all BETA debits could have a potential fiscal cost of $200 million or more. Retrospective impact The proposed change will cancel BETA debits in cases when there is no possibility that taxation of future income will be double taxation. It will not reverse the conduit relief that applied at the time the dividend was derived and the BETA debit was generated. However, if attributed income from an interest in a controlled foreign company is subject to tax under the new rules, there will be no further conduit tax relief. This means that companies that entered into arrangements when conduit tax relief was available will not get what they expected. Sometimes when tax laws are changed, existing arrangements are “grandparented” so that the rules applying when they were entered into continue to apply after the rules changed. However, there was no grandparenting when the international tax rules were changed. For example, New Zealanders that owned companies in “grey list” countries may have entered into arrangements on the assumption that they would enjoy an exemption from New Zealand tax on their income, but that income will be taxed under the new rules if it is “passive” income. This will occur even if the income is income out of which a dividend was paid under the old rules. The lack of grandparenting was intentional. The international tax rule changes were part of a package that replaced the comprehensive taxation of controlled foreign company income with an active income exemption and a foreign dividend exemption. As part of the package, conduit tax relief and the grey list exemption were repealed. It was not intended that companies would be able to make use of the active income exemption for some existing arrangements while at the same time continuing to have the benefit of either the conduit or grey list exemptions for other existing arrangements. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 75 Issue: Only those BETA debit balances that were generated after 2 June 2008 (the date of the policy announcement) should be cancelled Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, Telecom, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Any perceived risk to the tax base should exist only through CFCs (and FIFs where relevant) paying disproportionately large dividends to CTR companies, in order to accelerate the taxing point for such income to maximise the extent to which it qualifies for conduit relief. (New Zealand Law Society) Before 2 June 2008, dividends can reasonably be expected to have been in a “business as usual” category, and not driven by any desire to create BETA debits that could provide a benefit following the repeal of the conduit regime. (New Zealand Law Society) This would target the potential mischief of companies generating BETA debits after the announcement of the Government’s intention to retain BETA debits for a two-year transitional period. It would also mitigate the business uncertainty and unfairness that would occur from cancelling earlier BETA debits. (Telecom) The government should introduce a specific avoidance rule if it is concerned about particular mischief arising from the transitional rules. We understand that the mischief the Government is concerned with in relation to the transitional rules is where taxpayers have created BETA debits in anticipation of the conduit tax relief rules being repealed. Specific avoidance rules could be used to target such mischief. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Cancelling only those BETA debit balances that were generated after 2 June 2008 would prevent companies from generating BETA debit balances to take advantage of the two-year transitional window after the policy was announced. Although such behaviour would be worrying, this is not the basic policy concern. The basic policy concern is that retaining BETA debits arising from conduit relief – whenever they arose – effectively extends the conduit tax regime for some companies. That is, those companies can escape tax on future attributed income from controlled foreign companies, even though the conduit tax relief regime is supposed to have ceased and there is no possibility of double taxation. In this respect the problem is more about any existing BETA debit balances, rather than newly created BETA debits. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 76 Issue: The drafting of the clauses in the bill does not match the policy intent as expressed in the commentary and should be amended Submissions (Telecom, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The bill, as drafted, cancels all BETA debits, including those relating to actual tax paid or foreign dividend withholding payments. Cancelling such BETA debits creates double taxation. (Telecom) The drafting of the provision means that BETA debits would be cancelled out for all dividends from CFCs rather than just those that were conduit relieved. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The provision needs to be reworded as this section extinguishes BETA debits that arise from dividends where actual tax was paid, as well as BETA debits that arise where conduit tax relief was claimed in respect of the dividend. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) To achieve the policy intent the legislation would need to be quarantined to BETA debits from dividends which have benefited from section RG 7 (that is, dividends that have benefited from conduit relief). (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed new section OE 11B should be limited to BETA debits arising in respect of conduit-relieved dividends paid from 2 July 2008. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials agree that the current drafting does not reflect the policy intent. The policy intent was that BETA debits would only be cancelled to the extent that they arose from dividends that were subject to conduit tax relief. To correct this, a specific reference to those BETA debits that were generated in respect of tax liabilities that were offset by conduit relief under section RG 7 needs to be added to the provision. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 77 Issue: The application date should be modified to ensure debits can be used against pre-reform CFC income Submissions (Ernst & Young) Some modification of the legislation is required to ensure BETA debit balances remain available for use to offset income tax liabilities on attributed CFC income for pre-reform CFC years. Comment The submission identified a technical problem with the application date of the provisions. As the bill stands, BETA debits will be cancelled as soon as the international tax rules apply. This causes a difficulty because a company might not file an income tax return for CFC income that was earned prior to the reforms, until months after the new international tax rules take effect. In such cases the company would be unable to use its BETA debits against pre-reform income (they would already be cancelled). In general, we accept that companies should be able to use their BETA debits to offset tax on pre-reform income (at least until the complete repeal of BETA accounts). We note that it adds some complexity to the legislation to allow this, in part because measures are required to prevent manipulation. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to appropriate anti-manipulation rules being included. Issue: Clarifying how taxpayers should measure the amount of debit balance which is cancelled Submissions (Ernst & Young) The legislation should clarify how taxpayers should measure the amount of the debit balance which is cancelled. More specifically, ordering rules for BETA debits and credits such as those contained in section OA 8(8)(c) should be included in the provision. Comment The policy is to cancel BETA debits arising because a conduit-relieved dividend has been paid and not BETA debits arising for other reasons. 78 If a company’s BETA debits have arisen only from conduit-relieved dividends, then it is straightforward to work out how many debits to cancel (all of them). When some BETA debits have arisen for other reasons, and BETA debits have been used to offset tax liabilities, it may be unclear which debits have been offset and which have not. The submission suggests that the legislation should include an ordering rule to make it clear which debits have been offset and which remain. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 79 GIFT DUTY EXEMPTIONS Issue: Support for the proposed exemptions Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Corporate Taxpayers Group supports the proposed exemptions. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants supports the intent of the proposed exemptions. Recommendation That these submissions are noted. Issue: Gifts to central government bodies – clause 82(3) Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The rationale for exempting state service bodies covered by “section 2 of the State Sector Act 1988” is not immediately apparent. The submission questions the appropriateness of using the “state services” definition to target the application of the proposed exemption, as this would mean that the exemption would be applicable to organisations that are also subject to income tax – that is, income-tax-paying entities. The breadth of the definition should be carefully reconsidered. Comment The proposed exemption is intended to apply to gifts to organisations that are part of the “state services as defined in section 2 of the State Sector Act 1988”, which are not educational institutions and not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. We accept that some of the state service bodies that could benefit from the gift duty exemption are also income-tax-paying entities. However, it is important to keep in mind that the policy objectives underlying income tax and gift duty may not necessarily be the same. For example, certain central and local government entities were intended to be explicitly subject to tax to facilitate their commercial focus and to ensure that they did not enjoy an advantage over their competitors. 80 We also consider that the requirement in the proposed legislation that no person should be able to derive a private pecuniary benefit from a local or central government body, over and above that which would normally be permitted, should provide sufficient comfort that the exemption is appropriately targeted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Gifts to local authorities and council-controlled organisations – clause 82(4) Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Russell McVeagh) If a person makes a gift to either a local authority or a council-controlled organisation, then such gifts should not be subject to gift duty. There are a large number of local authorities that receive gifts or bequests from members of the public which are used for the betterment of the area they administer. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If there is an amalgamation of various local authorities then gift duty should not apply to that reconstruction. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed exemption should not be restricted to the tax definition of “council- controlled organisation” contained in the Income Tax Act 2007. Instead, the proposed exemption should use the definition of “council-controlled organisation” in the Local Government Act 2002. (Russell McVeagh, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The first two submissions are already covered by the proposed exemption. The proposed exemption will exempt from gift duty gifts made to either a local authority, or a council-controlled organisation. It will also cover transfers of property in amalgamation situations. Officials agree with the third submission. The tax definition of “council-controlled organisation” was intended to exclude non-business, non-corporate entities from being eligible for the charities-related income tax exemption. We accept that this definition is not appropriate for gift duty exemption purposes as it is too restrictive. Consequently we consider that the local government definition of “council-controlled organisation” should be used instead, as it would better meet the stated policy intentions. The local government definition of “council-controlled organisation” includes council-controlled trusts which are not in the business of making a profit but hold significant funds for charitable (or public) purposes benefiting all or a significant portion of the public within the territory of the local authority. Because there is some 81 uncertainty under the Charities Act 2005 whether such trusts can be registered with the Charities Commission, they would not be eligible for the current gift duty exemption that applies to registered charities and therefore donors would be required to account for gift duty on any gifts over the threshold that they make to council- controlled trusts. For this reason, it would be appropriate for gifts made to these organisations to be eligible for the proposed exemption. Recommendation That the third submission be accepted. This means that the local government definition of council-controlled organisation should be used to define council- controlled organisation for gift duty exemption purposes, not the tax definition of council-controlled organisation. Submission (Deloitte) The exemption from gift duty for gifts made to local authorities and council- controlled organisations should apply from 1 July 2008. Comment The submission seeks to apply the exemption from 1 July 2008, the date on which the tax-related provisions in the Charities Act 2005 were included in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Those provisions explicitly linked eligibility for the charities-related income and gift duty exemptions to registration as a charitable entity with the Charities Commission. Local authorities and council-controlled organisations who were not registered with the Charities Commission prima facie have been subject to gift duty since 1 July 2008. Local authorities cannot be registered as a charitable entity and there is some uncertainty under the Charities Act 2005 as regards the registering of local authority trusts – that is, these entities might not have sufficient dissolution provisions that require charities to apply their funds to a charitable purpose on dissolution. We note that there was no explicit consideration given to the gift duty treatment of gifts made to local authorities and their council-controlled organisations when the tax- related provisions in the Charities Act 2005 were being considered. If the exemption were applied from 1 July 2008 it would preserve the exempt status of gifts made to local authorities and their council-controlled organisations without break. If accepted, this measure would have the following implications. • Revenue cost to the Government, as donors who had paid gift duty for gifts made in the interim period (1 July 2008 to the date of Royal assent of the legislation) would be entitled to a refund. We do not consider that this cost would be large, because the total gift duty revenue collected each year is up to $3 million. 82 • Administrative costs for Inland Revenue, which would need to undertake reassessments and refund any gift duty paid. • Compliance costs for donors in seeking reassessments, and compliance savings for those donors who made gifts during the interim period but did not pay the required gift duty on those gifts. Overall, we expect the impact of this change to be very low. This is largely because of the current gift duty threshold whereby most donors keep their gifting at a rate of under $27,000 per year to avoid having to pay gift duty. There have only been two known occasions where a donor wanted to discuss gifts to a local government authority – they were advised of the potential changes to the bill, and the gifting has yet to take place. Recommendation That the submission is accepted. Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The wording of the bill does not achieve the policy intent, as the exemption does not extend to transfers of assets by local authorities. Comment The policy intention was to exempt from gift duty transfers of assets by local authorities to other local authorities to deal with local authority restructuring transactions. This is achieved by the current provision in the bill. Officials accept, however, that this policy intention was not clear in the Commentary to the bill. We note that under the current scheme of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968, exemption from gift duty applies to gifts made to a particular donor, rather than gifts made by a particular donor. Extending the exemption to apply to gifts made by local authorities would be inconsistent with the current scheme of the Act. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 83 Issue: Gifts to donee organisations – clause 82(5) Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The exemption from gift duty for gifts to donee organisations should be retrospective to overcome the fact that donations have been made by people in good faith on which no gift duty has been paid. Comment The submission is silent on the exact date the exemption should apply from. Officials consider that an appropriate date could be 1 April 2008. This is the date on which the limit on qualifying donations for the purposes of individuals’ donation tax credit was lifted. This change would be consistent with the underlying policy intention of the proposed exemption, which is to align the gift duty treatment with the policy for encouraging greater giving to charitable and philanthropic causes. We note that the limit on qualifying donations for the purposes of the company deduction for donations was also lifted. This change applied from the 2008–09 income year. However, any retrospective date for the proposed exemption should apply from the same date for simplicity. As with the previous issue, applying the exemption from 1 April 2008 will involve revenue, administrative and compliance costs to the extent that gift duty has been paid on gifts to donee organisations (which are not registered with the Charities Commission) in the period 1 April 2008 to the date of Royal assent. However, we do not expect these costs to be large because the vast majority of donee organisations are in fact registered with the Charities Commission and so gifts to those organisations would already be covered by the current exemption from gift duty. About 1,400 donee organisations are currently not registered with Charities Commission. Furthermore, Inland Revenue has advised that its processing centre cannot recall coming across a situation where a liable gift had been made to a donee organisation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. We recommend that the proposed exemption for gifts to donee organisations apply from 1 April 2008. 84 Issue: Repeal of gift duty Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG) believes that gift duty should be repealed but it appreciates that this is outside the ambit of the bill. CTG would like to see gift duty restricted to only apply between individuals, or family trusts and individuals. Specifically, CTG submits that there should be no dutiable gift in any transaction between corporate entities (including local authorities). (Corporate Taxpayers Group) New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants believes that there is a good case for gift duty to be repealed. The current exemptions in the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 are well out of date. This raises the issue of whether gift duty should play a part in our tax system. Gift duty complicates family and not-for-profit transactions, adding unnecessary compliance costs and delays. Market value rules exist in the Income Tax Act to buttress other tax regimes. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Officials consider that these submissions should be taken into account as part of the review of gift duty, which is on the Government’s current tax policy work programme. The review is focused on developing options for better targeting the application of gift duty. It will seek to ensure that the Government’s intention for gift duty as a means of protecting against income tax avoidance, defeating creditors and social assistance targeting is met, and to ensure that the integrity of the tax system is maintained. Policy options arising from the review will be included in an officials’ issues paper or a government discussion document, and public submissions would be sought. The document is likely to be released mid-year. Recommendation That the submissions are noted and will be considered as part of the current review of gift duty. 85 Issue: Gift duty threshold of $27,000 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The gift duty threshold of $27,000 a year per person should be increased to a level commensurate with a value in today’s dollars. In today’s terms, the exemption would be $77,220. Comment This issue is being considered as part of the current review of gift duty. Recommendation That the submission is noted and will be part of a suite of issues being considered in the current review of gift duty. Issue: Gift duty exemption for small gifts of up to $2,000 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The exemption from gift duty for small gifts of up to $2,000 to any one recipient in one calendar year (as long as the gifts are part of the donor’s normal expenses) should be increased to a level commensurate with a value in today’s dollars. In today’s terms, the exemption would be $5,720. Comment Officials recommend that this issue be considered in the current review of gift duty. Recommendation That this submission is noted and be considered as part of the current review of gift duty. 86 SUPPLEMENTARY DIVIDEND RULES Clause 27 Issue: Amendments relating to changes enacted by the Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 Submission (Ernst & Young) The submission does not, in fact, relate to clause 27 of the current bill, but to the changes to the supplementary dividend rules (previously known as the foreign investor tax credit rules) made by the Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. Specifically, the submission seeks amendments to: • allow supplementary dividend holding companies to continue to pay supplementary dividends to any non-resident shareholders (including non- portfolio shareholders) up to the end of an income year that includes 31 March 2011 and to claim related tax credits under section LP 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007; • expressly provide for supplementary dividends to be paid and for related section LP 2 tax credits to be claimed (subject to the percentage interest test for relevant non-resident beneficiaries) if the registered shareholders hold shares on fixed or discretionary trusts for beneficiaries including non-residents, but those trusts are not bare trusts; and • provide, under section RF 11B of the Income Tax Act 2007, for a nil rate of non-resident withholding tax on imputed dividends (subject to the percentage interest or tax rate tests for relevant non-resident beneficiaries) if the registered shareholders hold shares on fixed or discretionary trusts for beneficiaries including non-residents, but those trusts are not bare trusts. Comment The Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 introduced new rules for dividends paid by New Zealand companies to non-resident shareholders. The Act made changes to the supplementary dividend rules and the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules. The amendments are described in the February 2010 Tax Information Bulletin (Vol. 22, No. 1). These domestic law changes reflect the inclusion of lower limits for NRWT on dividends in some recent tax treaties. It is sensible to consider this submission in two parts. The first point raised relates to the transitional arrangements for supplementary dividend holding companies. The second and third points relate to the treatment of shares held through trusts (other than bare trusts). 87 Transitional arrangements for holding companies The amendments made by the Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 mean that, from 1 February 2010, credits are no longer available for supplementary dividends paid to non-residents in respect of non-portfolio (10% or more) interests in New Zealand companies, or if the rate of tax applicable to the dividend is less than 15%. The Act also provides for the repeal of the special supplementary dividend rules for holding companies. As a transitional measure, credits may continue to be claimed for supplementary dividends paid to supplementary dividend holding companies until 1 April 2011. This allows time for distributions to be paid through a chain of holding companies and on to non-resident portfolio investors. It is intended to deal with the possibility that a lower-tier holding company received a dividend and a supplementary dividend before 1 February 2010 but has not made a corresponding distribution by that date. The timing difference ensures that a higher-tier holding company can continue to receive supplementary dividends and correspondingly adjusted imputation credits, and therefore have a tax liability against which to use a credit claimed under subpart LP of the Income Tax Act 2007, when making a distribution to a portfolio investor. The submission argues that holding companies should be allowed to continue to claim credits for supplementary dividends paid to non-resident non-portfolio investors until 1 April 2011. However, it would then be straightforward for foreign-owned New Zealand companies to set up holding company structures and thereby continue claiming credits for dividends paid to non-residents in respect of non-portfolio interests after 1 February 2010. This would frustrate the intention of the 2009 amendments. The submission notes that a holding company receiving a dividend and supplementary dividend will face an additional tax charge, and possibly use-of-money interest, if those amounts are paid on to non-resident non-portfolio investors after 1 February 2010. This is necessary to prevent the use of holding company structures to avoid or defer tax during the transitional period. The granting of credits for supplementary dividends paid to non-residents assumes NRWT of 15% on those dividends, whereas a nil rate now applies to imputed non-portfolio dividends under section RF 11B of the Income Tax Act 2007. Under section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, a supplementary dividend holding company must have an ongoing purpose of enabling the payment of a supplementary dividend to a non-resident. Supplementary dividends are no longer payable to non- residents in respect of non-portfolio holdings. Accordingly, we would not expect supplementary dividend holding companies to be maintained beyond 1 February 2010, except when this is necessary to enable payment of supplementary dividends to non-resident portfolio investors before 1 April 2011. 88 Treatment of shares held through trusts The amendments made by the Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 distinguish between portfolio and non-portfolio interests according to the size of an investor’s “direct voting interest” in a company. If a person has a direct voting interest of 10% or more, or if the tax rate applicable to the dividend is less than 15%, then credits for supplementary dividends are no longer available. Instead, a nil rate of NRWT applies, to the extent the dividends are imputed. The submission notes that, for interests held through discretionary or fixed trusts, the 10% threshold will apply by reference to the trustee’s holding, rather than according to the proportionate interests of underlying beneficiaries. This is similar to the position before 1996, when the foreign investor tax credit was available only in respect of dividends paid to non-resident portfolio investors. At that time, section LE 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 set out when a person was considered a portfolio investor for these purposes. The core requirement was that they had a voting interest of less than 10% in the company and, if a market value circumstance existed, a market value interest of less than 10%. The boundary introduced by the Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 focuses on direct voting interests, in part for consistency with related provisions in double tax agreements, but also (as before 1996) for reasons of operational simplicity. The corporate look-through provision is disapplied for the same reasons. We do not consider this approach to be inconsistent with the comments made in the Officials’ Report of 23 November 1995 (cited in the submission), nor with the subsequent Tax Information Bulletin (March 1996, Vol. 7, No. 11). The submission refers to the possibility that the “voting interest” test under domestic law may in certain circumstances be interpreted differently to the equivalent treaty test, which refers to “voting power”. Regardless of an investor’s voting interest, credits for supplementary dividends are unavailable, and a nil rate of NRWT may apply, if the rate of tax for a dividend, after taking account of any double tax agreement, is less than 15%. This ensures consistency of classification under domestic and treaty law. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 89 ANNUAL RATES OF INCOME TAX Clause 3 Issue: Taxation of lump-sum payments of back-dated ACC compensation Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) An amendment should be made to the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that ACC loss of earnings payments received in relation to an accident in an earlier income year are not overtaxed. This could be achieved by allowing a rebate in the income year the payment is received. Comment The issue of the tax burden caused by payment of arrears of earnings-related compensation was raised by the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants in its submission on the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill in 2008. In response to that submission officials advised that they would report to the Minister of Revenue with proposals to address the concerns raised. The Minister of Revenue has had the opportunity to consider options and has decided that no further work will be done on providing tax relief for lump-sum payments that include arrears of an entitlement to ACC payments, for the reasons outlined below. It would be very difficult to design tax relief that would restore recipients to the position they would have been in had the payments been made in the earlier years, because of the wide variance in the level of arrears payments, the number of years they might be for and the possibility that a benefit previously paid has had to be repaid. Any potential solution, such as spreading income to earlier years, raises complex issues – for example, the effect on income-contingent entitlements or liabilities, such as Working for Families tax credits and child support. More importantly, spreading income would move away from the fundamental tax concept of taxing the cash receipts of individuals who are not in business, in the year of payment. An alternative would be to provide a tax credit; however, this requires a trade-off between simplicity and arbitrary results. A flat rate may be simple to administer and understand, but has the potential to both under- and over-compensate the recipient. This trade-off was recognised when options for granting tax relief for redundancy payments were being considered. Finally, despite a tax credit being available to recipients of redundancy payments, extending this ability to ACC lump-sum arrears payments is likely to lead to further requests for tax concessions for other one-off payments such as retiring allowances and bonuses. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 90 EXEMPTION FOR NON-RESIDENT DRILLING RIG OPERATORS Clause 9 Issue: Scope of the exemption Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The exemption should not distinguish between residents and non-residents. Otherwise it would create a disincentive or competitive disadvantage for non-resident companies that prefer to undertake petroleum exploration via a New Zealand subsidiary. The exemption should also be extended to apply to income derived from suppliers of specific services to offshore drill rig operators and resident companies such as supply/support vessels. Comment New Zealand’s domestic tax rules generally tax non-resident offshore rig operators and seismic vessels on their New Zealand-sourced income. However, in some situations where non-residents come from a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement, the non-resident rig operators are exempt from tax in New Zealand if they stay for less than 183 days in any 12-month period. If they stay for more than 183 days all income will result from the first day of presence in New Zealand and will be subject to New Zealand tax. Because of this rule, prior to the exemption being introduced in 2004, non-resident offshore rig operators and seismic vessels had tended to stay in New Zealand for a period of less than 183 days. Even if further exploration would be desirable beyond the 183 day window, there were strong incentives for rigs to leave by this time. Different rigs were then required to be brought to New Zealand to complete the work, causing extra mobilisation and demobilisation costs. This also disrupted sensible exploration and development programmes. The bill extends the existing exemption (which was due to expire on 31 December 2009) until 31 December 2014. The purpose of the exemption is to remove the distortion created by New Zealand’s double tax agreements for non-resident rig operators to operate for less than 183 days. It is not intended to subsidise oil and gas exploration more generally. If a resident company were to operate a rig in New Zealand it would not get relief under New Zealand’s double tax agreements and so would not face the same incentives to operate for less than 183 days. 91 Extending the scope of the exemption to cover income from companies that supply ancillary services to an offshore drill rig operator could increase the fiscal cost of the exemption but would be unlikely to further accelerate the exploration of New Zealand’s offshore oil and gas reserves. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 92 ADDITIONS TO THE LIST OF CHARITABLE DONEE ORGANISATIONS – SCHEDULE 32 Individuals who donate to charitable donee organisations are entitled to a donations tax credit (formerly the donations rebate) of 33⅓ percent of the amount donated (capped to the amount of the individual’s taxable income). Companies and Māori authorities who donate to charitable donee organisations are entitled to a deduction for donations up to the amount of their net income. A charitable organisation that applies some or all of their funds outside New Zealand must be approved as a charitable donee organisation by Parliament. These organisations are listed individually in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. There are currently 87 named charitable donee organisations listed in schedule 32. This bill provides that Cure Kids be added to the list. Orphans’ Aid International Charitable Trust has submitted that it also be added to the list. Issue: Orphans’ Aid International Charitable Trust Submission (Clause 34 – Parry Field Lawyers) That Orphans’ Aid International Charitable Trust be added to the list of charitable donee organisations in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment If an overseas-focussed charitable organisation is seeking a legislative change to be included in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007, they are currently referred to Inland Revenue tax policy officials, and must provide information about their organisation. Officials then make a recommendation to the Minister of Revenue based on this information and with reference to the Cabinet criteria which guide the policy considerations about whether to include the organisation or not. Cabinet has established criteria for guiding the policy work around additions to the list of charitable donee organisations. These criteria were formally set out by Cabinet in 1978. The original Cabinet decision was: Basic criteria for adding an organisation to the list of approved “overseas” charities: i the funds of the charity should be principally applied towards: • the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the ravages of war or natural disaster; or • the economy of developing countries\*; or • raising the educational standards of a developing country\*; ii charities formed for the principal purpose of fostering or administering any religion, cult or political creed should not qualify; iii .... \* developing countries recognised by the United Nations. 93 To further assist organisations seeking to be included on schedule 32, the Government released a set of guidelines in December 2009 setting out its expectations of these organisations. The guidelines respond to growing interest from organisations that see “donee status” as an endorsement of their overseas activities. The guidelines seek to downplay expectations that additions to the schedule are automatic, by making it clear that the decision by the Government to legislate is a policy decision. 3 In making this decision, the Government considers whether the organisation is robust, transparent and has an established history of operation. This involves consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NZAID and the Police’s Strategic Intelligence Unit. The Charities Commission is also consulted. The removal of the donations cap on the tax credit and deduction in 2008 also means careful consideration is required on the effectiveness of the organisations concerned and whether any potential exists for taxpayer funds to be misapplied or abused. Left unchecked this could lead to significant fiscal cost. It is important to look at how the organisation is structured and operated both in New Zealand and overseas. The organisation’s transparency is also considered and whether there are adequate checks and balances in the management of the organisation to prevent any risk of “mission drift”. Mission drift describes the situation when an organisation begins to engage in activities that are outside the scope of the organisation’s rules such that, over time, it ends up carrying out activities that the New Zealand government may not want to support. Officials are considering as many requests as possible each year. Also a wider review on overseas donee status policy scheduled for this year is being fast-tracked by officials. Given this established process for the consideration of organisations to be included in schedule 32, officials are concerned that organisations should not be able to avoid the process by seeking inclusion in schedule 32 through the select committee process. This would effectively result in organisations jumping the queue and not being fully vetted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 3 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/archive.php?year=2009&view=726. 94 Issue: Support for Orphans Aid International Charitable Trust Submission (Clause 34 – Foresee Communications Limited) Foresee Communications Limited supports the Orphans Aid International Charitable Trust’s submission that it be added to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 95 TAX TREATMENT OF EMISSIONS UNITS Issue: Treatment of units allocated to owners of fishing quota Submission (Sandford Limited – submitted by Deloitte) Emissions trading units allocated to owners of fishing quota should be on capital account and so non-taxable. Comment The application of the Emissions Trading Scheme to liquid fossil fuels will increase the cost of diesel, which is one of the major costs in the fishing sector. Recent amendments to the Climate Change Response Act 2002 provide for the allocation of emissions units to owners of fishing quota to compensate them for the fall in value of fishing quota expected to result from the impact of the increase in the cost of diesel. The default treatment for all unit allocations is revenue account treatment, with the exception of pre-1990 forestry. Revenue account treatment means that a tax liability will arise as a result of receipt of the units, and any increase in their value between the date of receipt and the date of their sale will also be taxable. However, the underlying rationale for the allocation of units to the owners of fishing quota is the loss of value of that quota, which is a capital loss. It is inconsistent with this rationale for revenue account treatment to be applied to these units – capital account treatment for these units is appropriate. As allocations to owners of fishing quota are proposed to be made in the second half of 2010, it is recommended that this amendment be made from 1 July 2010. The Ministry for the Environment has been consulted on this issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Deduction for cost of timber for person carrying on a PFSI forestry business Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) There should be a separate tax deduction in the Income Tax Act 2007 for the cost of timber for a person carrying on a permanent forest sink initiative (PFSI) business. 96 Comment PFSI foresters are entitled to a tax deduction for the costs incurred in planting and maintaining their trees. All foresters (PFSI and those who grow trees for harvest) who purchase land with part-grown trees on it are required to carry forward the proportion of the purchase price attributable to the trees until those trees are harvested. PFSI foresters can harvest: • while the PFSI covenant is in force, provided they maintain a “continuous canopy”; • at any time, if they breach their PFSI covenant; • 50 years after entering into the covenant, if they withdraw from the covenant; • 99 years after entering into the covenant. PFSI foresters will be entitled to claim a deduction for the cost of timber in any of the above situations. A liability to surrender emissions units will also arise. If the emissions units originally allocated have been sold, a deduction will be available for the purchase of units to meet the surrender liability. PFSI foresters will be entitled to claim a deduction for the cost of timber in any of the above situations. There seems to be no reason why the current, generally taxpayer friendly, forestry tax rules should be changed for PFSI foresters. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the Ministry for the Environment have been consulted on this issue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Market value transfer rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application of the market value transfer rule to emissions units should be clarified. Comment The Income Tax Act contains provisions which apply to disposals of certain items which deem those disposals to take place at market value, where the parties have used a price below market value. This is to ensure that disposals at below market value are not used as a mechanism to transfer wealth without appropriate tax consequences. The current form of the legislation relies on trading stock rules in section GC 1 to apply a market value rule to emissions units. However, it is not clear that emissions units are trading stock. We recommend that a specific market value transfer rule be introduced for emissions units, which will also include exemptions where transactions below market value are not carried out for tax purposes. 97 It is recommended this amendment be made from 26 September 2008, the date the former specific anti-avoidance provision was repealed. The Ministry for the Environment has been consulted on this issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of market value transfer rules to forestry rights arrangements Submission (Matter raised by officials) The rule which deems a transfer of emissions units for less than market value to be a transfer at market value should not apply to transfers of emissions units: • between a forestry rights holder and the landowner which is party to that forestry right; • where those emissions units were allocated by the Crown in relation to pre-1990 forestry. Comment Forestry rights agreements are entered into between a landowner and another party, who will normally take responsibility for planting, maintaining and harvesting the forest. The forestry rights agreement will normally contain a clause under which revenue earned from the forest is shared between the parties. Forestry rights agreements are registered under the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983. The Climate Change Response Act 2002 allows only either the landowner or the holder of the forestry right to register to receive all of the units allocated for any particular piece of land, but not both. The party which receives all of the units will normally satisfy its obligations under the forestry rights agreement by transferring a proportion of the units to the other party without consideration. However, current legislation would treat that transfer as a disposal at market value, so triggering a tax liability for the transferee. Following informal discussions with the Ministry for the Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and foresters outside the legislative process of this bill, we recommend that the Tax Act be modified so that a market value disposal, and a consequent tax liability, is not triggered in these circumstances. It is recommended that this amendment take effect from 1 January 2009, before the first date of allocation of emissions units for forestry. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 98 Issue: Transfer of pre-1990 forestry emissions units to interim entities pending Treaty of Waitangi settlements Submission (Matter raised by officials) The capital treatment of emissions units allocated to interim entities in relation to pre- 1990 forestry land should be extended to the ultimate owners of that land where it is eventually transferred under a Treaty settlement. Comment A significant proportion of pre-1990 forestry land is currently held by the Crown. We are advised that much of this land is expected to eventually be transferred to Māori under Treaty of Waitangi settlements. The Climate Change Response Act 2002 provides that the relevant Minister is to appoint a person to apply for emissions units in relation to that land. It is expected that that person will in due course transfer those emissions units to those Māori persons or entities along with the relevant land when the Treaty settlements are implemented. Emissions units allocated in relation to pre-1990 forestry land are the only types of units which currently receive capital treatment. This is because this allocation is to compensate for the loss in the value of this land resulting from the introduction of the Emissions Trading Scheme. Capital treatment only applies to the initial recipient of the units – once they leave that person’s hands they will normally have revenue account treatment, consistent with the fungible nature of emissions units. However, this means that those Māori persons or entities who receive the emissions units from the person appointed by the Minister will hold those units on revenue account, and be taxable on any gains made on disposal. Revenue account treatment is not consistent with the underlying purpose and nature of these arrangements. Following informal discussions with the Ministry for the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry outside the legislative process of this bill, we recommend this amendment take effect from 1 April 2010, before the date any transfers of units are expected. Recommendation That this submission be accepted. 99 DISTRIBUTIONS TO COOPERATIVE COMPANY MEMBERS Clauses 6, 7, 12 and 32 The amendments in effect extend a provision in the Income Tax Act 2007 that applies to resident co-operative companies that require members to hold shares in proportion to their trading stock transactions with the company (say, 1 share for each 1kg of meat sold to the co-operative). The existing provision, section CD 34, has been repealed and replaced by new section CD 34B. Currently, a co-operative can elect to deduct a distribution to a member-shareholder when the distribution is in proportion to the member’s supply of trading stock to the co-operative. The distribution is taxable to the member. The new provision introduces some flexibility to reduce compliance costs for such co- operatives until a general review of the tax treatment of co-operative distributions takes place, planned for this year. These co-operatives will be able to elect to deduct a distribution paid on shares that are held to back a member’s expected trading stock transactions, not just actual trading stock transactions. They may also deduct a distribution on a limited number (20 percent) of other shares held by the member. The new provision also allows a co-operative that elects to deduct distributions some flexibility in setting the date on which members’ entitlement to dividends is determined under the Companies Act 1993. Issue: Consistent terminology Submission (Fonterra, Ernst & Young) Terminology in the existing section DV 11(3) should be amended to match that in the new section CD 34B. Comment Section DV 11 permits a co-operative to deduct a distribution described in proposed section CD 34B. Fonterra is concerned that inconsistent terminology between these two provisions may cause confusion, and submit that section DV 11(3) should refer to “the income year to which the distribution relates”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 100 Issue: Election to deduct distribution Submission (Ernst & Young) There should be no requirement for an irrevocable election to be made, or notice given, before deductible distributions are made. The election provisions in existing section CD 34 should be repeated in new section CD 34B. Comment A co-operative currently elects to deduct a distribution by giving the Commissioner notice when providing its tax return for the year in which it claims the deduction. This election then applies for subsequent years. The timing of the election differs in new section CD 34B because of the link with Companies Act requirements. A co-operative electing to deduct distributions may also choose to be exempt from the Companies Act requirement that there be no more than 20 working days between the date on which an entitlement to dividends is determined and the date the company resolves to pay a dividend. If a co-operative claims exemption from this requirement, the Registrar of Companies should be notified before a distribution is made. Section 34B provides that one notice serves as an election to the Commissioner and notification to the Registrar of Companies. Although we consider that the election should therefore continue to be made before the first distribution, we agree that it is not necessary for an election to be irrevocable. In order to reduce compliance costs, companies should continue to elect deductible treatment once rather than annually. However, an election should apply until a company notifies the Commissioner otherwise, rather than being irrevocable. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part and that, once made, an election to deduct distributions should apply for subsequent income years until a co-operative notifies the Commissioner otherwise. 101 Issue: Transition Submission (Ernst & Young) In the transition from section CD 34 to section CD 34B, it should be clear that there are no gaps, and that distributions made after 1 April 2010 representing profits arising in an income year ending before 1 April 2010 are deductible in that year. Comment There are no gaps in the transition from section CD 34 to section CD 34B. The new rules apply to any distribution made on or after 1 April 2010. Distributions made after 1 April 2010 that relate to a year ending before that date will be deductible in that year. We have discussed this with Ernst & Young who agree that the legislation works as described. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 102 OTHER MATTERS RAISED IN SUBMISSIONS Transitional imputation over-crediting Submission (Deloitte) The penalty rules for transitional imputation over-crediting should be amended to allow for companies to pass on over-imputed credits attached to dividends received during the transitional period without penalty. Comment This submission concerns the penalty designed to ensure that during the two-year transitional period after the 1 April 2008 company tax cut, companies do not distribute too many over-imputed credits. We agree that the submission is correct and will draft the appropriate amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Petroleum mining foreign branch ring-fencing rules Submission (Greymouth Petroleum Holdings Limited) Greymouth Petroleum Holdings Limited (Greymouth) submits that its investment in Chile should be grandparented from the foreign branch ring-fencing rules that were enacted by the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. This legislation prevents a petroleum miner offsetting its foreign branch expenditure against its New Zealand income. Greymouth considers that its Chilean operations meet the normal grandparenting parameters. In particular, Greymouth considers its Chilean investment should be grandparented because: • On 17 November 2007 it was contractually committed to sign formal contracts, known as CEOPs and undertake the work programmes that were the basis of its winning bids. • Had it not signed the CEOPs on 30 April 2008, Greymouth would have been legally liable to a claim from the Chilean Government for contractual damages (including consequential losses) and its reputation would have been damaged. 103 Comment Greymouth has submitted to the Committee on this matter several times. Additionally, Ministers have also been asked to reconsider this matter a number of times. The most recent response from the Government to Greymouth was on 10 February 2010 when it advised Greymouth of its decision not to amend the petroleum mining foreign branch ring-fencing rules that were brought into effect by the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. The following timeline details the relevant aspects of this matter: June 2007 The Chilean Government announces international bidding round for 10 hydrocarbon blocks. October 2007 Greymouth posts bid bonds (US$100,000 per bid) and bids on five blocks. 16 November 2007 The Chilean Government announces Greymouth as the successful bidder on four blocks. Under Chilean law, Greymouth as the successful bidder is contractually bound to sign formal contracts. 4 March 2008 The New Zealand Government announces an amendment to the income tax treatment of expenditure incurred, on or after 4 March 2008, through a foreign branch of a petroleum miner. Such expenditure is no longer allowed to be offset against New Zealand petroleum mining income 30 April 2008 Representatives from Greymouth signed formal contracts (CEOPs) with representatives of the Chilean Government. The CEOPs oblige Greymouth to post performance bonds worth $28 million (the amount of expenditure committed under the CEOPs for the first three years). 2 July 2008 The Government introduces the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill that includes the petroleum mining foreign branch ring- fencing rules. 30 June 2009 The Finance and Expenditure Committee report says that the Committee considered and did not accept Greymouth’s submission that its Chilean branch operations should be grandparented from the law change. However, the Committee noted that some petroleum mining companies might have difficulty fulfilling their contractual obligations under these binding contracts entered into before 4 March 2008, but only where expenditure is incurred pursuant to a binding contract entered into before 4 March 2008, and that Inland Revenue may consider recommending legislation in the future to remedy any unintended consequences. 104 9 October 2009 The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill is enacted. Officials generally support grandparenting in cases where taxpayers have invested on the basis of a specific tax legislation consequence. However, grandparenting decisions are subject to some important conditions. Decisions to grandparent weigh-up the benefits of grandparenting, such as providing investor certainty, against the costs of grandparenting, including the fiscal costs. Grandparenting is generally limited to transactions of a specific nature that can be expected to be completed in a relatively short time. In this case, officials recommend against grandparenting on the basis that: • Had Greymouth had not entered into the contracts, as it did on 30 April 2008, officials consider that it would have only forfeited US$400,000 of bid bonds. The formal contracts were entered into after the law change was announced, in full knowledge of the Government’s intention to change the law. This was therefore a commercial decision. • Grandparenting in this case represents a significant fiscal risk for the Crown. Greymouth is seeking to grandparent five years of expenditure. The formal contracts specify a minimum amount that must be spent over the relevant period (the first seven years). While Greymouth has reduced the period of time it seeks to be grandparented to five years, on the basis of reducing the Crown’s fiscal risk, there is no limit to the amount that Greymouth can spend over the five years in Chile and offset against New Zealand petroleum mining income. • This fiscal risk is heightened because other taxpayers with overseas operations may also, on the basis of equal treatment, require grandparenting. • Given that petroleum miners with foreign branches were gaining a tax advantage, not from a deliberate policy standpoint but from a gap in the legislation, it is not unreasonable to expect that at some point the Government would change the tax law to protect its taxing right on New Zealand’s petroleum resources. • The recent law change was designed to ensure that New Zealand received its proper share of benefit from its petroleum resources. As such, it should apply equally to all petroleum miners operating in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 105 Remedial matters 106 107 PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT ENTITIES Issue: Application of portfolio class land loss amendment Submission (Ernst & Young) Clause 22 of the bill proposes an amendment to the definition of “portfolio class land loss” to clarify that PIEs that own land offshore can allocate tax losses arising from foreign exchange contracts to investors. It is submitted that an equivalent amendment should also be made to the Income Tax Act 2004 to apply from 1 October 2007 for taxpayers’ 2007–08 income years. Comment Officials agree. It was not intended that foreign exchange losses relating to portfolio investments in offshore portfolio land companies should be required to be carried forward by the PIE. Therefore it is appropriate that the amendment applies from the beginning of the PIE rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Foreign exchange losses Submission (KPMG) All foreign exchange losses should be able to be passed through by the PIE to investors even if the investment relates to a greater than 20% interest in a foreign land-owning company. Comment Officials agree in principle that foreign exchange losses should be able to be passed through to investors. However, in relation to certain PIEs that own predominantly land, this would require the rules to distinguish and treat differently losses that relate to the land (these would be carried forward) and foreign exchange losses (these would be passed through to investors). This would require major changes to the PIE calculation rules and would increase the complexity of the rules significantly. Officials consider that the approach adopted in the bill will solve the issue of allocating foreign exchange losses for the majority of PIEs that own interests in offshore portfolio land companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 108 Issue: Portfolio investment entity tax rates Submission (KPMG) Remedial amendments should be made to portfolio investment entity (“PIE”) tax rates. Comment The Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 made changes to the tax rates on PIEs and the income thresholds so they align with the new personal tax rate structure enacted in 2008 (section 124 of the 2009 Act; schedule 6, table 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007). However, schedule 6, table 1 does not accurately reflect the appropriate prescribed investor rates (“PIRs”) and income thresholds for New Zealand resident natural person investors. Accordingly, amendments should be made to ensure the rates and thresholds are correct. Additionally, row 2 of schedule 6, table 1 should be amended to clarify that the 30% PIR applies to all non-resident investors, whether or not they have provided a notification. Officials recommend that the amendments apply from 1 April 2010. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Miscellaneous drafting issues Submission (KPMG) Section HL 4(2)(a) and (ab) should be linked with an “or” rather than an “and”. Comment Officials agree. Section HL 4(2) sets out the requirements for which an entity ceases to be eligible to be a PIE. Section HL 4(2)(a) sets out the requirements under sections HL 6 or HL 9 at a class level, whereas section HL 4(2)(ab) sets out the requirements under section HL 10 at an entity level. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 109 Submission (KPMG) The reference to “investor membership requirement” in section HL 9(2) is incorrect and should be replaced with “investor interest size requirement”. Comment Officials agree. This was incorrectly changed in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (KPMG) The reference to the “last day of the first quarter” in section HM 25(2)(a) should be amended to the “day following the last day of the first quarter”. The reference to the “last day of the second quarter” in section HM 25(2)(b) should also be amended to the “day following the last day of the second quarter”. Comment Officials disagree. The date for cessation of PIE status is intended to be at the end of the quarter and not at the start of a new quarter. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (KPMG) Section HM 33(1) should include a requirement for a PIE investor proxy (PIP) to provide other information the Commissioner requires. Comment Officials disagree. This requirement has been placed within the “duties” of a PIP rather than within the eligibility requirements. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 110 Submission (KPMG) The reference to section HM 35(5) is not required in section HM 36(3)(b) and (c) as the taxable income/loss of the PIE is calculated under section HM 35(7). Comment Officials disagree. Section HM 35(5) calculates a “taxable amount”. Section HM 35(7) defines the result of HM 35(5) as “taxable income” or “taxable loss”. Therefore both sections are required for the purposes of section HM 36(3)(b) and (c). Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (KPMG) The reference in section HM 53(2) to section HM 52 is incorrect. The correct reference is section HM 51. Comment Officials agree. This was incorrectly inserted in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (KPMG) The reference to section CX 56B in section HM 60(4) should be removed. Comment Officials agree. The reference is unnecessary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 111 Submission (KPMG) Section HM 69(5) should clarify that any residual formation losses available after expiry of the three-year period should be applied under section HM 68. Comment Officials agree that an amendment is required to ensure that residual formation losses are made available after the three-year period has expired. This should be achieved by ensuring that residual formation losses are allocated to the next attribution period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Submission (KPMG) The reference to “portfolio exit period” in section 31(2B)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is incorrect and should be “portfolio investor exit period”. Comment Officials agree. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (KPMG) The submitter has raised the other minor drafting issues with the PIE rules. These are as follows: • There should be an exception for “zero-rated investors” from section HM 6(2)(a). • The reference to “correct rate” in section HM 6(2)(a) should be replaced by “prescribed investor rate”. • In section HM 6(2)(b) it should be clarified that an investor is liable for tax on any assessable income arising from proceeds for which the PIE has “no” tax liability. 112 • Section HM 24 should be aligned with section HL 15(2)(b). The loss of PIE status should be from the start of the next quarter. • In sections HM 26 to 28, loss of PIE status should be from the start of the next quarter to align with current requirements. • In section HM 30(1), the loss of foreign PIE equivalent status should be aligned with the rules for loss of PIE status. • In section HM 46, between the steps outlined in subsections (b) and (c), there should be an investor income attribution step, for clarity. • In section HM 60(3), subsection (3) should be reworded as follows: “the PIE has made a voluntary payment of tax under section HM 45 that is intended to satisfy its income tax liability for the period in relation to the investor, unless the multi-rate PIE applies the last notified investor rate to the voluntary repayment”. Comment Officials consider that these drafting issues required further consideration. It is therefore recommended that they be considered further and any changes arising will be included in a future tax bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (KPMG) In section HM 25(3)(b) the correct references should be “the first quarter ends within three months before an announcement by the entity to its investors that it, or the relevant investor class, is winding up within 12 months of the announcement”. Comment The exclusion in section HM 25(3)(b) is currently worded so that the further eligibility requirements do not need to be met if the relevant quarter ends more than three months before a wind-up announcement to investors. This gives rise to an anomalous outcome – that is, the further eligibility requirements do not need to be met at any time prior to a quarter ending within three months of a wind-up announcement to investors. This is unintended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 113 Issue: Electronic returns by PIEs Submission (Matter raised by officials) A number of cross-referencing errors need to be amended in the Tax Administration Act 1994. In section 40(2)(a) there should be references to sections 35, 36AB, 36BB, 36BC and 36E. In section 36C there should be a reference to section 36AB. Comment These are cross-referencing amendments of a technical nature only and have been raised in the context of Transform IR, Inland Revenue’s major programme to move its paper-based processing to electronic forms. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Rewrite amendment Submission (Matter raised by officials) In the definition of “land investment company” in section YA 1, at the end of subsection (a) the “:” should be changed to “; and”. Comment This unintended change was made in the rewritten legislation in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 and should be corrected. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 114 Issue: Credits for PIE tax liability Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section LS 2 should be clarified to provide investors with a credit for the PIEs tax liability on income when that income is taxed to the investor. Comment In certain situations PIE income is taxed to the investor as well as the PIE. This can occur when the investor has elected a rate with the PIE that is lower than their correct PIE tax rate. To prevent double taxation, section LS 2 is designed to provide the investor with a tax credit for the PIE tax. There is a technical problem with section LS 2 as it currently does not provide a credit when the PIE’s tax liability is offset by a credit at the PIE level (for example, an imputation credit). It is recommended that section LS 2 be changed to provide investors with a credit for the PIE’s tax liability on that income rather than PIE tax paid. This amendment would be consistent with the policy intention of the PIE credit rules and is taxpayer-friendly. It is therefore further recommended that the change applies retrospectively from the start of the PIE rules in October 2007. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Hedging tax mismatch with FDR securities Submission (KPMG) The NZ dollar hedging arrangements entered into by PIEs (and other taxpayers) in respect of fair dividend rate (FDR) equities should be excluded from the scope of the financial arrangements rules. The gain or loss on the hedge should instead be taxable as part of the FDR return. A hedging tax mismatch will arise for a PIE because the gain or loss under a hedge is fully taxable under the financial arrangements rules whereas the taxable income in respect of the underlying equities is limited to 5% of their market value, under the FDR regime. This can result in a portfolio of offshore securities, which is perfectly hedged on a pre-tax basis, being imperfectly hedged on an after- tax basis. KPMG has previously made submissions on this issue. Officials have agreed, in principle, with the above approach but have consistently indicated that further work and consultation was necessary to develop the detail of any solution. 115 Comment Officials agree that the hedging mismatch described by the submitter can result in compliance issues for PIEs. Resolving this issue is complex and the appropriate solution is not obvious. Officials will continue to consider the issue and will include the submitter in any consultation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 116 FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS Issue: $10,000 limit on foreign non-dividend income for qualifying companies Submission (KPMG) The foreign non-dividend income requirement, under the qualifying company rules, should also take account of income under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules (or FDR income should be excluded as it is effectively a proxy for a “fair dividend”). Alternatively, qualifying company status should cease only if the amount of foreign non-dividend income, less the amount of foreign dividend income which would be treated as arising if the FIF rules did not apply, is greater than $10,000. Comment Officials agree that it is appropriate that FIF income calculated under the FDR method should be excluded from the limit on foreign income in section HA 9. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Ring-fencing of certain foreign losses under qualifying company rules Submission (KPMG) The ring-fencing of FIF losses under section HA 25 in the qualifying company rules should be removed. Comment Officials note that FIF losses that are no longer subject to the FIF loss ring-fencing rules are not within the ambit of section HA 25. This is because section HA 25 applies only to “a FIF net loss” which is now restricted to a FIF loss calculated under the branch equivalent method. Officials also note that section HA 25 only applies if an election has been made. Officials therefore consider it is not necessary to make any further amendment to section HA 25. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 117 MEANING OF CONTROLLED FOREIGN COMPANY Clauses 18 and 85 Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Law Society) The proposed changes to the meaning of a controlled foreign company (CFC) should be worded as “the person’s control interest is no greater than a control interest in the same category held by another person; and” or as “the person’s control interest is less than or equal to a control interest in the same category held by another person”. (Ernst & Young) That the savings provision in the proposed section 85(2)(b) be extended to include the 2005–06 income year. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials agree that the amendment to section EX 1(1)(b)(i) in the Income Tax Act 2004 and 2007 in clauses 18 and 85 is intended to state that a New Zealand resident’s control interests in a foreign company must be less than or equal to the control interests held in the same company by the other person. The other subparagraphs in section EX 1 require that the other person must be a non- resident who is not an associated person of the New Zealand resident. That reflects the policy intention. Officials agree with the New Zealand Law Society that the savings provision in clause 85(2)(b) should apply from, and including, the 2005–06 income year. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 118 IMPUTATION CREDITS AND TAX POOLING – AMENDMENTS TO SECTION OB 6 Clause 28 Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Tax Management New Zealand Ltd, matters raised by officials) We support the sentiment behind this amendment, but the drafting of the legislation needs to be improved. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed paragraphs OB 6(1)(b) and (c) should be removed from the bill. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Management New Zealand Ltd) Proposed section OB 6(3) should be amended by removing paragraph (a) and amending paragraph (c) so that it also deals with the situation where the intermediary transfers a deposit to another taxpayer. These changes will restore the effect of section ME 492)(ad) of the 2004 Act. Paragraphs (b) and (c) should be re-lettered (a) and (b). (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Management New Zealand Ltd) Section OB 6 should provide that the credit date for an amount transferred by an intermediary from a tax pooling account to a taxpayer’s tax account with the Commissioner be determined under the effective date rules in sections RP 19 and RP 20. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The drafting of section OB 6 in clause 28 of the bill should be amended to clarify that the provision: • should not apply to a company in relation to funds it has deposited into a tax pooling account; and • applies to a company in relation to an amount representing an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account that the company has acquired from another person under the tax pooling rules. (Matter raised by officials) Sections OB 34, OB 35, OP 9, OP 32 and OP 33 of the 2007 Act should be amended to more appropriately reflect the policy intention. (Matter raised by officials) The tables of imputation credits and debits should be consequentially amended as necessary in relation to the above submissions. (Matters raised by officials) 119 Comment The provisions of section OB 6 were the subject of a submission to the Rewrite Advisory Panel. The Panel agreed with the submission and their recommendation to amend the provision resulted in an amendment to section OB 6 being included in the first reading of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver and Remedial Matters Bill) 2009. The Panel had recommended that section OB 6 should be amended to correct an unintended change in outcome. The unintended change identified was that section OB 6 did not provide for an imputation credit for a company disposing of an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account. The Panel also noted that section OB 6 in the 2007 Act did not appear to reflect its corresponding provision in the 2004 Act. The Panel suggested that policy officials should review that issue, with a view to correcting the provision further, if necessary. In carrying out this review, the other imputation (tax pooling) provisions in the 2007 Act were reviewed. The matter raised by officials reflects the outcome of that review. Purpose of tax pooling The purpose of “tax pooling” is to provide a pool of funds for use by companies to reduce exposure to use-of-money interest and late payment penalties – in particular, for provisional tax. A tax pooling intermediary administers the tax pooling account, including a transfer (when requested) of funds to a taxpayer’s tax account with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Under the tax pooling rules, if a taxpayer pays an amount for tax into a “tax pooling account”, that payment is held under trust for that taxpayer’s benefit. Funds held for the benefit of a taxpayer in a tax pooling account are normally described as an entitlement to funds in the tax pooling account. However, taxpayers may “sell” their entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account to another taxpayer. On that sale, the tax pooling intermediary transfers the entitlement to those funds to the other taxpayer. Tax pooling and imputation credits Under the tax pooling imputation rules, the policy is that a company is intended to have a credit in its imputation credit account (ICA) for: • a payment for tax made into the tax pooling account (that is, the taxpayer’s own deposits into the tax pooling account); • the purchase of an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account. 120 It is also possible that a purchaser of an entitlement may, instead of transferring the underlying funds to the purchaser’s tax account with the Commissioner: • later on-sell that entitlement to another taxpayer; or • later request that the intermediary refunds to the purchasing company the funds representing that entitlement from the tax pooling account. The tax pooling imputation rules provide specific timing rules for the imputation credit that relates to a deposit of funds or purchase of funds. These timing rules are necessary to ensure consistency with the overall objectives of: • the tax pooling rules; • enabling the benefit of tax paid at the corporate level to be available for shareholders; and • the rules relating to the transfer of other tax types to a taxpayer’s income tax account with the Commissioner. The policy intention for imputation in relation to an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account is as follows: • The date of the imputation credit for a deposit into a tax pooling account is the date of the deposit. If an entitlement to funds is on-sold, the vendor company must debit its ICA for the amount of the entitlement sold. • For a purchased entitlement, the date of the imputation credit for a purchased entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account is permitted to be backdated if the funds are transferred to the company’s tax account with the Commissioner. The backdating of the credit is to a date selected by the taxpayer, but can be no earlier than the date of the original deposit made to the tax pooling account. Some restrictions also apply to the backdating to prevent abuse of the backdating rule. • The date of the imputation credit for a purchased entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account that is on-sold (transferred) to another taxpayer is the date of the transfer. A debit to the company’s imputation credit also arises for the amount on-sold on the transfer, because the purchased amount is not transferred to the company’s tax account with the Commissioner and therefore does not represent tax paid by the company. • The date of the imputation credit for a purchased entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account that is refunded to the company from the tax pooling account is the date of the refund. A debit to the company’s imputation credit also arises for the amount on-sold, because the purchased amount is not transferred to the company’s tax account with the Commissioner and therefore does not represent tax paid by the company. Technical issues existing in the imputation credit tax pooling rules Officials agree with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Rewrite Advisory Panel that the imputation rules for tax pooling: 121 • should not result in a company having an imputation credit for a deposit of funds into a tax pooling account and another imputation credit when that payment is later transferred to the company’s tax account with the Commissioner; and • should not result in a company having an imputation credit for a deposit of funds into a tax pooling account, and another imputation credit when the company either on-sells the entitlement to those funds or has those funds refunded from the tax pooling account. Section OB 6 As currently drafted in the 2007 Act, section OB 6 applies to a company that has either made a deposit into a tax pooling account or has purchased an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account. Officials agree with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants that the policy intention for section OB 6 is that it should apply only to a company that has purchased an entitlement in a tax pooling account. Section OB 5 addresses the imputation effects for a company that has made a deposit into a tax pooling account. Section OB 6 in the bill should be redrafted to provide that the purchasing company has an imputation credit for the acquisition of an entitlement to funds in a tax pooling account, and further provide that the date of the credit is as follows: • if the purchasing company requests the intermediary to transfer to the company’s tax account with the Commissioner, an amount representing an entitlement to the funds in the tax pooling account, the date of the credit is determined under the effective date rules in sections RP 19 and RP 20; or • if the purchasing company on-sells to another taxpayer that entitlement to the funds in the tax pooling account, the date of the credit is at the date the entitlement is transferred to the other taxpayer; or • if the purchasing company requests that the intermediary refunds the funds representing the purchased entitlement from the tax pooling account to the company, the date of the credit is the date of the refund. Other imputation (tax pooling) provisions In addition, as recommended by the Rewrite Advisory Panel, officials have now completed a review of other imputation tax pooling provisions in sections OB 34, OB 35, OP 9(1) and (3)(b), OP 32 and OP 33. Officials have identified that those provisions contain similar drafting issues for purchased entitlements to funds as contained in current section OB 6. For example: • Section OB 34 provides for a debit to a company’s imputation credit account for a refund to the company of funds representing an entitlement in a tax pooling account. As drafted, section OB 34 applies only to a company in relation to a deposit of its own funds in a tax pooling account. Its corresponding provision in the 2004 Act applied also to a company that had purchased the entitlement to those funds in the tax pooling account. 122 • Section OB 35 provides for a debit to a company’s imputation credit account for an amount equal to the entitlement to funds on-sold to another taxpayer. As drafted, section OB 35 applies only to an on-sale of an entitlement that was deposited by the selling company. Its corresponding provision in the 2004 Act applied also to an on-sale of the entitlement by a company that had previously purchased the entitlement to those funds in the tax pooling account. • Section OP 9 is a provision for consolidated imputation groups that should “mirror” the effect of section OB 6. As drafted in the 2007 Act, section OP 9 contains the same drafting concerns identified by submitters and the Rewrite Advisory Panel for section OB 6. Section OP 9 should be amended in a similar manner to section OB 6. • Sections OP 32 and OP 33 apply to consolidated imputation groups and should “mirror”, respectively, the effect of sections OB 34 and OB 35. As drafted, section OP 32 has same drafting issues as identified above for sections OB 34 and OB 35. Section OP 33 as drafted in the 2007 Act is inconsistent in its language to section OB 35 and, in particular, does not refer to the intermediary’s role in transferring entitlements to funds in a tax pooling account, as the trustee of those funds. Sections OP 32 and 33 should be redrafted to be consistent with the recommended drafting changes for sections OB 34 and OB 35. Recommendations That New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountant’s and Tax Management New Zealand Ltd’s first submission be accepted, and that its second and third submissions are accepted in principle, subject to officials’ comments on the intended policy outcomes. That PricewaterhouseCoopers’ submission is accepted. That the matters raised by officials’ be accepted. 123 CURRENCY CONVERSIONS – ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL FOR RATES AND METHODS OF CONVERTING FOREIGN CURRENCIES INTO NEW ZEALAND CURRENCY Clause 33 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, matter raised by officials) The legislation allows taxpayers to use whatever method they have historically applied, as long as it is consistently applied by the taxpayer across income years. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Clarification is required to ensure that the Commissioner’s approval is given on a general basis and does not require each affected taxpayer to make specific or repeated applications to the CIR for approval of the rates and methods used. (Ernst & Young) For a provision of the Act (other than section YF 1) that provides a rate or method for currency conversion, the CIR should be empowered to determine a rate that is representative of the actual rate or close of trading spot exchange rate. (Matter raised by officials) Comment The policy intention is that the Commissioner is able to approve a currency conversion rate or method, for the purposes of determining a person’s income tax obligations. This was the Commissioner’s administrative practice under the 2004 Act and earlier legislation, under which the Commissioner had approved a currency rate or methods for general application. If a taxpayer did not use a method approved by the Commissioner (either generally or a specific method approved for a taxpayer), the law required foreign currency amounts to be converted using the spot rate applying at the transaction date, unless a legislative conversion rule applied (for example, conversion of attributed CFC income expressed in a foreign currency). The purpose of the amendment in the bill is to empower the Commissioner to approve: • a general method or methods for converting foreign currency into New Zealand currency, which may include approval of the use of certain rates (for example mid-monthly exchange rates published by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand); and • a specific method for converting foreign currency into New Zealand currency to suit a taxpayer’s particular circumstances. 124 Officials agree that the bill is not sufficiently clear that the Commissioner is empowered to approve for general application (including setting of rates), methods for the conversion of foreign currency into New Zealand currency amounts for income tax purposes. Officials also agree with the Corporate Taxpayers Group that the bill is not sufficiently clear that a taxpayer would normally be required to use an approved method consistently across income years. Officials do not agree that taxpayers should be permitted to use specific conversion methods without that method having been approved by the Commissioner, unless that specific method is provided for under an existing legislative rule. Such an approach is inconsistent with the previous administrative practice of the Commissioner and would give rise to unacceptable risks to the tax base. Officials consider that if a taxpayer’s specific conversion method had been approved by the Commissioner under the previous administrative practice at the time the 2007 Act commenced, that approval would continue to be effective. Officials consider that, if a taxpayer applies a previously approved conversion method consistently across tax years, the amendment to section YF 1 will not require taxpayers to re-apply for approval of their method for currency conversion. This will mean that a taxpayer will need to apply where they wish to use a new currency conversion method or rate that has not already been approved for the taxpayer or as a rate or method for general application. This point can be emphasised in the TIB item on this amendment. Section YF 1, including the amendment in the bill, applies to transactions arising in a foreign currency but for which there is no specific currency conversion rate or method (as, for example, in the calculation of income from a foreign investment fund). However, the Commissioner has also adopted an administrative practice for specific currency conversion rules, to permit taxpayers to use an exchange rate that is representative of actual exchange rates. The purpose of this administrative practice is to minimise compliance costs for taxpayers. Consistent with the recommendation that the submissions on section YF 1 officials consider that it would assist in minimising compliance costs for taxpayers if the Commissioner’s administrative practice for specific currency conversion rules is also codified. Recommendations That the submission of the Corporate Taxpayers Group be declined in so far as it relates to currency conversion methods not previously approved by the Commissioner. That the submission of the Corporate Taxpayers Group be accepted in so far as it relates to a requirement that the currency conversion method be consistently adopted across tax years. That the submission of Ernst & Young be accepted. That the matters raised by officials be accepted. 125 PAYMENTS BY RWT PROXIES – CROSS-REFERENCING ERROR IN SECTION RE 18(2) (Matter not in the bill) Submission (Ernst & Young) The definition “tax rate” in subsection RE 18(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should refer to clause 3, not clause 2, of schedule 1, part D. Comment Officials agree with the submission. The corresponding provision in the 2004 Act is section NF 1(2B), and the cross reference from the term “tax rate” was to clause 1 of schedule 14 of the 2004 Act. Clause 1 of schedule 14 of the 2004 Act corresponds to clause 3 of schedule 1, part D of the 2007 Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 126 DEFINITION OF “CULTIVATION CONTRACT WORK” (Matter not in the bill) Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In schedule 4, part C, clause 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007, the definition of “cultivation contract work” should be amended to clarify that the schedular payments regime only applies to works or services provided under a contract or arrangement for the supply of labour, or substantially for the supply of labour in relation to land that is intended to be used for the cultivation of fruit crops vegetable orchards or vineyards. Comment Officials agree with the submission. The amendment corrects an unintended consequence from the drafting of the definition of “cultivation contract work”. The policy intention is for tax to be withheld at source (under the PAYE rules) from payments for cultivation contract work that was for labour-only services, or substantially labour-only services. As drafted, the definition could include payments for services that involved a high capital element such as the use of a combine harvester. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 127 REWRITE REMEDIAL ITEMS – DISPOSAL OF TRADING STOCK FOR LESS THAN MARKET VALUE Submission (Matter raised by officials) Sections GC 1 and EB 24(1) of the 2007 Act should be amended retrospectively: • to correct an unidentified change in legislation as identified by the High Court with retrospective effect from the commencement of the 2007 Act; and • include an appropriate savings provision to protect taxpayers who have taken a tax position on the basis of the wording of section GC 1 or EB 24(1) in a return of income filed before 28 October 2009. Comment The High Court has identified that the effect of section GC 1 of the 2007 Act contained an unintended change in legislation in a recent High Court decision (Foodstuffs (Wellington) Co-Operative Society Limited v CIR (CIV 2009-485-1224). That decision of the High Court was released on 28 October 2009. The particular issue before the Court was whether the market value of shares (held as trading stock), which were cancelled on an amalgamation, was income of the shareholder. The Court held that section GD 1 of the 1994 Act (which corresponds to section GC 1 of the 2007 Act) applied and the market value of the shares was income of the taxpayer. The taxpayer’s argument was that section GD 1 required a recipient before it could apply. The Court rejected that argument, holding that section GD 1 did not require a recipient, noting that the section could apply to a sole trader who withdrew trading stock from the business for private consumption, which also did not require a recipient to be a separate person. In the 2007 Act, both sections GC 1 and EB 24(1) address the disposal of trading stock for less than market value by one person to another person. Section EB 24(1) stems from the same policy background as section GC 1 and contains the same type of unintended legislative change identified in section GC 1 by the Court. Officials recommend that sections GC 1 and EB 24(1) be retrospectively amended to ensure that the sections do not require a recipient of the trading stock, as noted by the High Court relation to section GD 1 of the 1994 Act. 128 However, taxpayers have notice of the Court’s finding of the meaning of the law in the 1994 Act only from 28 October 2009, being the date the High Court released its decision in Foodstuffs. Until that date, it is possible that a taxpayer has taken a tax position in a return of income filed before 28 October 2009 for either of the 2008–09 or 2009–10 income years, on the basis of the plain wording of sections GC 1 or EB 24(1) of the 2007 Act. In this circumstance, a savings provision is recommended to protect taxpayers who have adopted this tax position. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 129 NON-REWRITE REMEDIALS – REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS Issue: Section CX 16(4) – 2004 Act remedial item Submissions (Matters raised by officials) Section CX 16(4) should be amended retrospectively, with an appropriate savings provision, to prevent a company from electing to treat any benefit provided to a shareholder employee as a dividend. Section CX 17(4) of the 2007 Act should be consequentially amended, as it is the corresponding provision to section CX 16(4) of the 2004 Act. Comment The Taxation (Annual Rates, Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 amended section CX 16(4), by replacing the punctuation between paragraphs (a) and (b) in section CX 16(4) of the 2004 Act. A submission to the Panel set out that this amendment had made a change to the outcome and was inconsistent with the policy intention of the rule. The policy for section CX 16(4)(a) and (b) is that a company may elect to treat as a dividend (instead of a fringe benefit), an “unclassified benefit” provided to a shareholder-employee. This election was not available to other types of fringe benefit that were specifically listed (such as, for example, a motor vehicle). However, as drafted, section CX 16(4) permits the company to elect that any benefit provided to a shareholder employee may be treated as a dividend. Officials agree that outcome is inconsistent with the policy intention. The Rewrite Advisory Panel noted that the submission was not a rewrite matter, but concluded that the change in legislation produced an incorrect policy outcome. The Panel therefore recommended to officials that the provision should be retrospectively amended to restore the correct policy effect, as a minor remedial item. The Panel also recommended that the amendment should contain an appropriate savings provision to protect taxpayers who may be adversely affected by such a retrospective amendment. Officials agree with the conclusion and recommendations of the Panel. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 130 REWRITE REMEDIAL ITEMS – REWRITE ADVISORY PANEL RECOMMENDATIONS (Matters raised by officials) Issue: Sections CB 33, DV 19 – Mutual associations and the mutuality principle Submissions Section CB 33 of the 2007 Act should be amended retrospectively to ensure it overrides the common law principle of mutuality in the same manner as its corresponding provision in the 2004 Act. Section DV 19 of the 2007 Act should be amended retrospectively to ensure that an association may deduct an association rebate paid to members to the same extent as was allowed under the corresponding provision in the 2004 Act. Comment The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with a submission that section CB 33 of the 2007 Act contains an unintended change by not overriding the principle of mutuality in the same manner as its corresponding provision in the 2004 Act (section HF 1(1)). The principle of mutuality arises under common law. The Courts consider that a person cannot derive taxable income from mutual transactions, as a mutual transaction is of a similar nature to trading with oneself. The policy intention is for the income tax rules to override the common law principle of mutuality for amounts derived that would otherwise be income under the Act. However, to give some effect to the mutuality principle, a “mutual association” is allowed a deduction, under section DV 19 of the 2007 Act, for a distribution to its members of net taxable profits (known as “an association rebate”). The amount of the deduction can be no greater than the part of the association’s net income that arises from certain types of transactions made between the association and its members. The Panel concluded that, consequential on the unintended change in section CB 33, section DV 19 of the 2007 Act contains an unintended change in outcome. Section DV 19 allows a deduction for the association rebate, but its current drafting results in a smaller deduction than was allowed under its corresponding provision in the 2004 Act (section HF 1(2)). Officials agree with the Panel’s conclusions and recommendation that sections CB 33 and DV 19 should be amended retrospectively. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 131 Issue: Section EE 51(3)(b) (2004 Act) and section EE 60(3)(b) (2007 Act) – Accumulated tax depreciation and mothballed assets Submission Section EE 51(3)(b) of the 2004 Act should be amended retrospectively to ensure that a depreciable asset that has been withdrawn from the business is not required when accounting for accumulated tax depreciation while the asset is not available for use in the business. Comment The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with the submission that section EE 51(3)(b) of the 2004 Act contains an unintended legislative change. The Panel noted that this unintended change had been re-enacted as section 60(3)(b) of the 2007 Act. The Panel recommended that sections EE 51(3)(b) of the 2004 Act and EE 6)(3)(b) of the 2007 Act should be retrospectively amended to restore the effect of the defined term “adjusted tax value” in the 1994 Act. During the time a depreciable asset is withdrawn from a business, a taxpayer is not allowed a deduction for depreciation. In addition, accumulated depreciation is stopped at the time of that withdrawal from business use. An example where the rule is intended to apply is if a taxpayer “mothballs” an asset, such as plant or equipment, which has become obsolete and replaced. Officials agree with the Panel’s conclusion and recommendation that section EE 51 of the 2004 Act (and consequentially section EE 60 of the 2007 Act) should be retrospectively amended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 132 Issue: Section FM 12(2) – Interest deductions for consolidated groups Submission Section FM 12(2) of the 2007 Act should be amended retrospectively to disallow a deduction for interest incurred on money borrowed from another company, when both companies are members of the same consolidated group of companies. Comment Section FM 12(2) of the 2007 Act allows a company a deduction for interest incurred on money borrowed from another company within the consolidated group. The Rewrite Advisory Panel considers this outcome is an unintended legislative change, when compared with section HB 2(1)(d) of the 2004 Act, and has recommended that the provision be amended retrospectively. Section HB 2(1)(d) of the 2004 Act which is the corresponding provision to section FM 12 of the 2007 Act, prevented a company within a consolidated group from being allowed a deduction for interest incurred on money borrowed from another company within the same consolidated group. This prohibition on deductibility is matched by section HB 2(1)(e) of the 2004 Act, which provided that interest derived by one company from money lent to another company within a consolidated group of companies is not income for income tax purposes. Officials note that section FM 12(2) in the 2007 Act has inadvertently omitted the word “not”, and that the consolidated companies regime reduces compliance costs by providing that many transactions within the group are ignored for income tax purposes. Therefore, officials agree with the Panel’s conclusion and recommendation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section GB 25(3) (b) – Excessive remuneration paid by a close company to a shareholder, director or relative Submission Section GB 25(3) of the 2007 Act should be amended retrospectively to ensure that it does not apply to a director, shareholder or a relative of the director or shareholder who is employed substantially full-time and is participating in the administration of the business. 133 Comment The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with the submission that section GB 25(3) of the 2007 Act should not permit the Commissioner to re-assess a director, shareholder or a relative of the director or shareholder, if that person is employed substantially full-time and is participating in the administration of the business. The Panel considered that section GD 5 of the 2004 Act (which corresponds to section GB 25 of the 2007 Act) did not apply to a director, shareholder or a relative of the director or shareholder who was employed substantially full-time and participating in the administration of the business. Officials agree with the Panel’s conclusions and recommendation that section GB 25(3)(b) should be amended retrospectively. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section HA 1(1)(a) – Qualifying companies Submission Section HA 1(1)(a) should be amended retrospectively to replace the term “tax paid” with a phrase that is consistent with the treatment of dividends pad by a qualifying company as being fully imputed or as exempt income. Comment The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with a submission to the Panel that the use of the phrase “tax paid” in section HA 1(1)(a) is an unintended legislative change, and has recommended that the provision be retrospectively amended. The Panel concluded that the use of the phrase “tax paid” is inconsistent with the treatment of a dividend paid by a qualifying company as exempt income, when the dividend does not have imputation credits attached at the maximum imputation ratio. Although the drafting of section HA 1(1)(a) was intended to be read as a purpose provision, outlining the scheme of subpart HA, officials agree that the use of the phrase “tax paid” is inconsistent with the treatment of an unimputed dividend paid by a qualifying company as exempt income. Officials agree this inconsistency might give rise to an erroneous interpretation and, therefore, agree with the conclusion and recommendation of the Panel. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 134 Issue: Section HA 11(4), section HA 11B – Loss-attributing qualifying companies Submission Section HA 11(4) of the 2007 Act should be repealed and replaced retrospectively by section HA 11B to provide that a loss-attributing company that ceases to be a loss- attributing company also ceases to be a qualifying company, in the same manner as provided in section HA 11(4)’s corresponding provision in the 2004 Act (section HG 18). Comment The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with a submission that section HA 11(4) contains an unintended change in outcome when compared with its corresponding provision in the 2004 Act and recommends it be retrospectively amended. Officials agree that the corresponding provision in the 2004 Act (section HG 18) provides that when a loss-attributing qualifying company no longer satisfies the ongoing shareholder decision-making requirements, the company also ceases to be a qualifying company. Officials agree with the Panel’s conclusion and recommendations for this issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section HA 24(5) – Loss carry-forward and loss-attributing qualifying companies Submission Section HA 24(5) should be amended to ensure that a loss-attributing qualifying company is able to carry forward a loss balance arising in an earlier income year in which the company was a qualifying company, but prior to the company becoming a loss-attributing qualifying company. Comment The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed that section HA 24(5) incorrectly prevents a loss-attributing qualifying company from carrying forward a loss balance arising in income years, during which it was a qualifying company, and prior to it becoming a loss-attributing qualifying company. 135 Section HG 16(1)(c) of the 2004 Act permitted a qualifying company that later became a loss-attributing company to carry forward unused tax losses that arose during the years in which the company was a qualifying company but not a loss- attributing company. Officials agree that section HA 24(5) does not correctly reflect the effect of section HG 16(1)(c) of the 2004 Act. Therefore, officials agree with the Panel’s recommendation that the unintended change be corrected retrospectively. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section HA 26 – Loss-attributing qualifying companies Submission Section HA 26 of the 2007 Act should be retrospectively amended to permit a shareholder in a loss-attributing qualifying company to elect, in the same circumstances provided for in section HG 16(2) of the 2004 Act, to defer the transfer the net loss of a loss-attributing qualifying company to shareholders of the company. Comment The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with a submission that section HA 26 of the 2007 Act does not permit a taxpayer to elect, in certain circumstances, to defer the transfer the net loss of a loss-attributing qualifying company to shareholders of the company. The Panel noted this right existed in the corresponding provision to section HA 26, being section HG 16(2) of the 2004 Act. Under section HG 16(2), a shareholder could elect to defer the transfer of a loss- attributing qualifying company’s net loss to shareholders to the following tax year. This election could be made if the company’s tax balance date was later than the electing shareholder’s tax balance date and the difference in balance dates meant that waiting for the information could cause the shareholder to file their return of income later than the due date. The Panel has recommended that section HA 26 be retrospectively amended to restore the effect of section HG 16(2) of the 2004 Act. Officials agree with the Panel’s conclusions and recommendations for this issue. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 136 Issue: Section IC 3(3) – Commonality of shareholding for groups of companies and tax losses Submission Section IC 3(3) of the 2007 Act should be amended retrospectively to ensure that the commonality of shareholding rules are not applied in a manner akin to the shareholder continuity rules. Comment The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with a submission that section IC 3(3) of the 2007 Act contains an unintended legislative change. Section IC 3(3) sets out certain requirements a company must satisfy for that company to be able to offset tax losses against another company in the same group. In section IG 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 2004, a group of shareholders was required to have at least a 66% common shareholding interest in both companies for each tax year, from the tax year the tax loss arose until the loss is offset. Provided there was at least the 66% common interest between the two companies for each year, it did not matter if the group of shareholders was different in one year from another due to transfers of shareholding. However, in the 2007 Act, section IC 3(3) requires the lowest common shareholding after a change in shareholding to be taken into account in determining whether the 66% common shareholding threshold was breached in tax years before that change in shareholding. That outcome is inconsistent with the policy and therefore the Panel has recommended that section IC 3(3) be retrospectively amended to restore the effect of section IG 1(2) of the 2004 Act. Officials agree with the conclusions and recommendation of the Panel that section IP 5 of the 2007 Act should be amended retrospectively. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section IC 12 – Loss carry-forward and grouping Submission Section IC 12 of the 2007 Act should be amended retrospectively to permit a company to carry forward tax losses from one year to another, and then use that carried-forward loss to offset against the company’s own net income for that later income year. 137 Comment The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with a submission that section IC 12 of the 2007 Act incorrectly prevents a company from carrying forward tax losses and offsetting those losses against its own net income for a later income year. The Panel concluded that this outcome differed from the outcome under section IG 2(6) of the 2004 Act. The Panel recommended that section IC 12 be amended retrospectively. Section IG 2(6) of the 2004 Act prevented a company from grouping tax losses that have arisen from bad debts or share losses if the financing of the debt or shares was provided by a group company. However, section IG 2(6) did not prevent the company from carrying forward those losses for use against its own income in future income years. Officials agree that section IC 12 of the 2007 Act does not correctly reflect the outcome given by section IG 2(6) of the 2004 Act and therefore agree with the Panel’s recommendation to restore to section IC 12, the effect of section IG 2(6) of the 2004 Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section IP 5 – Carrying forward losses and part-year rules Submission Section IP 5 should be amended retrospectively to ensure that in a year in which a company breaches the shareholder commonality or continuity requirements, section IP 5(2) does not prevent the company’s tax losses from earlier tax years being carried forward to the year in which the breach of commonality or continuity occurs. Comment The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with a submission that section IP 5 of the 2007 Act incorrectly prevents a company from carrying forward tax losses to a year in which either of the commonality or continuity of ownership rules are breached. The Panel considers that section IP 5 should be retrospectively amended. For part-years, a company is permitted to carry forward tax losses arising in one tax year to the next tax year, provided the company satisfies both of the commonality and continuity of ownership rules. Unused tax losses carried forward may then be carried forward to the next succeeding tax year or years, until the benefit of those tax losses are fully utilised. 138 For a year in which a company breaches the commonality or continuity requirements, tax losses arising from earlier years may be carried forward to the year of breach and the benefit utilised for the part-year before the breach. Officials agree with the conclusions and recommendations of the Panel relating to section IP 5 of the 2007 Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section OB 32(2)(b) – Imputation credits and refunds of income tax Submission Section OB 32(2)(b) should be amended retrospectively to ensure that the debit to an imputation credit account for a breach in shareholder continuity is correctly adjusted for a debit for income tax refunded to the company before the breach in shareholder continuity occurred. Comment The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with a submission that section OB 32(2)(b) of the 2007 Act limits the adjustment to a debit for breach of continuity for income tax refunded prior to the breach, to an amount that is less than the debit for the breach in continuity. The Panel has recommended that section OB 32(2)(b) should be retrospectively amended. The purpose of this adjustment is to prevent two debits being made to a company’s imputation credit account in relation income tax that refunded before the breach and for which continuity is lost. On a breach of shareholder continuity, the company’s imputation credit account (ICA) is debited for the amount of imputation credits for which shareholder continuity is not satisfied. However, as income tax refunded prior to a debit for breach of shareholder continuity also gives rise to a debit to the ICA, section OB 32(2)(b) provides an adjustment to the debit for breach of shareholder continuity to take into account the earlier debit for a refund of income tax. Officials agree with conclusions and recommendation of the Panel for section OB 32(2)(b) of the 2007 Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 139 Issue: Minor maintenance items referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel Submissions The following minor maintenance items provided to the Rewrite Advisory Panel should be amended retrospectively as follows: • Section CW 31(3) Income Tax Act 2004 should be added retrospectively to the list of unintended changes in schedule 22A. • The definition of “amount of tax” in section YA 1 should be amended retrospectively to clarify that the meaning of “amount of tax” includes “income tax”. • The section 52(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to insert “not” after “for which RWT is” Comment For drafting consistency, section CW 31(3) is inserted into schedule 22A to ensure that the schedule refers to section CW 31(3) and section CW 32(3), as both sections are drafted in the same manner. The term “amount of tax” in subpart RM is ambiguous as to whether it includes income tax for the purpose of the refund rules. The amendment removes the ambiguity. The amendment corrects a drafting error in the consequential amendment in schedule 50 of the 2007 Act. These amendments have been referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel as minor maintenance items and retrospectively correct any of the following: • ambiguities; • compilation errors; • cross-references; • drafting consistency, including readers’ aids, for example the defined terms lists; • grammar; • punctuation; • spelling; • subsequential amendments arising from substantive rewrite amendments; or • the consistent use of terminology and definitions. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 140 LIFE INSURANCE – TRANSITION AND TECHNICAL ISSUES The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 introduced comprehensive changes to the taxation of life insurance business. The current bill does not contain any provisions dealing with life insurance. Officials consider it desirable, however, to address the remedial matters identified below in order to provide clarity and certainty for the life insurers who are implementing the new rules, which are due to start 1 July 2010 (or earlier if the insurer elects). The recommendations in this report are a practical response to matters that insurers have raised with officials in respect of the application of the transitional provisions. As such, the changes recommended in this report are largely technical in nature and ensure the new life insurance rules are broadly consistent with policy intent. Officials have consulted with representatives from various insurers in developing the majority of these recommendations. Issue: Workplace group policies – definition Submission (Sovereign Limited, Tower Limited and AXA New Zealand) The rules supporting the application of the transitional rules to workplace-related life policies should be extended to deal with the following situations: • life policies provided to members of an employment-related superannuation scheme; • broker-administered schemes that allow multiple employers (typically smaller- sized firms) to provide life insurance cover to their employees; and • life insurance policies sponsored by industry associations. Comment “Workplace group policies” are life insurance policies provided by an employer or union. The policy compulsorily covers employees or union members. The rules for workplace group policies are meant to overcome practical difficulties faced by insurers in obtaining information about the underlying lives covered by the policy. The grandparenting period for these policies is up to three years instead of up to five years for most other life insurance policies. The shortened period of time is a trade- off for allowing workplace group policies to cover new lives after 1 July 2010 (the start date of the life insurance tax changes). 141 Life insurers note that the current rules do not adequately cover all situations when workplace group policies are sold. Specifically identified as being outside the scope of “workplace group policies” are policies sold to trustees of workplace superannuation schemes, and life policies sold to industry associations and employer- collective groups. Officials agree that the rules for workplace group life policies should be extended as suggested by submissions because they are similar in nature to life policies provided directly by employers and unions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Workplace group policies – voluntary elements Submission (Sovereign Limited, Tower Limited and AXA New Zealand) Related to the submission above, some workplace policies allow for voluntary top-ups in the amount of life cover and allow spouses of employees to be covered under the policy. Policies with these features should also be included in the transitional rules for workplace group policies. Comment Officials understand that these voluntary elements are generally an incidental part of workplace group life policies. Provided that the policy is in effect, for example, the policy has been issued and the insurer has received a deposit from the insured before 1 July 2010, the workplace group policy can be grandparented. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Level-premium life policies – adjustments for CPI Submission (Matter raised by officials) Life insurers have asked officials to review the operation of the current rules as they apply to level-premium policies (sometimes referred to as “term life policies”). Section EY 30 provides transitional relief for level-premium policies. The purpose of the relief is to reflect that such policies have been priced on the basis of certain conditions and may not provide the insurer with the opportunity to alter premiums. The legislation limits transitional relief to level-premium policies when there is no movement in the premium. 142 Insurers have advised that a considerable portion of the level-term insurance market provides the policyholder with the option to index the level of cover to protect its real value. Such adjustments have a natural reflex in the premium. Comment The current rules were designed to cater for life policies where the insurer had little or no ability to change premiums, or for commercial reasons chose not to increase premiums in response to the taxation changes. We have since been advised that the rules may not apply to a large proportion of the level-premium market because most policyholders choose to preserve the real value of life cover. While this increase has a reflex in the premium charged, it is usually determined by a predetermined formula that may not allow the life insurer to adjust for matters other than movements in the consumer price index (CPI). Officials consider that an increase in the premium for a level-premium policy should not remove it from the scope of the transitional rules if the increase is as a result of using a CPI formula to preserve the amount of cover under the life policy. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Group life policies Submission (Matter raised by officials) Life insurers have asked officials to consider two issues concerning the application of group life policies. • The definition of “group life master policy” (life insurance policies that cover more than one life) has a requirement that the policy is not available to the general public. The requirement is not necessary and practical. • Section EY 30(3) needs to be clear that its application is based on an individual life in connection with group life master policies. For example, if a life policy provides cover to a couple/family and one of the lives insured results in a breach in transitional rules, the current rules would appear to disqualify the entire policy, not just the cover connected with the affected life. Comment These changes are recommended to ensure that the transitional rules can be applied in a practical manner. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 143 Issue: Transitional relief for reinsurance products Submission (Matter raised by officials) If reinsurance relates to workplace group life or credit card repayment insurance, the requirement to look through should be removed. Comment Reinsurance treaties are deemed to be group life master policies and therefore have up to five years’ transitional relief as long as the reinsurer can look through to the underlying lives. This outcome is not appropriate if the underlying policy is a workplace group policy or credit card repayment insurance. These policies are subject to more concessionary criteria for compliance cost reasons and this should be reflected in the rules applying to reinsurance. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: No restoration of transitional relief allowed Submission (Matter raised by officials) The transitional rules could be interpreted in such a way to allow insurers at the beginning of each cover review period to reinstate life policies that breached the transitional rules in an earlier period. Comment Life insurance policies that breach the transitional rules during the grandparenting period should not be restored for the purposes of receiving transitional relief. The purpose of the transitional rules is to provide a single opportunity to allow life insurers to grandparent life products where contractually or commercially it would be difficult to alter the price. If a policy breaches the transitional rules (for example, when the cover under an annual renewable term policy adjusts by more than the greater of 10 percent or a movement in the CPI index), the policy is treated as being a new contract for tax purposes and should not benefit from the tax treatment under the previous rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 144 Issue: Bifurcation of life insurance policies Submission (Matter raised by officials) Life insurers have asked officials to allow life policies to be bifurcated. Some life policies provide multiple benefits or products relating to a life policy. Apart from non-life-related cover, the legislation does not split or divide a life policy if it has aspects that would be subject to differential tax treatment under the transitional rules. Comment The transitional rules are based on a “single unified supply” notion, whereby a life policy is the sum of all its parts. Most life insurance policies are a “wrapper” for a range of life-related insurance. Life insurers have asked whether the entire life policy is disqualified or only the cover connected with that particular life product is disqualified. It is argued that without the ability to bifurcate life insurance policies, transitional relief for existing business could be unduly cut short. Because separate rules apply to life-related products such as credit card repayment insurance, and to core life products themselves (for example, single premium, term life, annual renewable term and group life master policies), it would seem sensible that life insurers are able to split a life policy according to the rules for those products. Any split or division of a life policy must be transparent to the policyholder, and policy documentation must clearly show that there is a separate price for each life product that forms part of the life insurance policy “wrapper”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of the term “cover review period” – balances that change in response to a financial arrangement or security Submission (Matter raised by officials) Life insurers have asked officials to clarify the application of the “cover review period”. 145 Comment The “cover review period” is a means to establish a point in time for the insurer to consider whether a life policy breaches the transitional provisions, which would result in the affected life policy ceasing to qualify for grandparenting. The test is based on a per policy basis and should be considered whenever the policy is renewed (and repriced). If the repricing results in a breach of the transitional rules, transitional relief ceases. Some life insurance products track an underlying financial arrangement (for example, a mortgage). The premium payable for the life cover will rise and fall in response to any changes to the balance of the financial arrangement. A similar issue has been identified in respect of life policies that provide cover in connection with superannuation benefits under KiwiSaver. The life insurance cover meets any shortfall in income and capital to the desired amount. Like the mortgage protection, the amount of insurance cover will vary in accordance with the investment returns and other issues that are outside of the control of the life insurer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted; specifically that increases in life cover be measured at the beginning of a cover review period and contrasted against the beginning of the next cover review period. Issue: Application of the term “cover review period” – transitional relief up to and including date of breach Submission (Matter raised by officials) Life insurers have requested that relief under transitional rules should cease on the date that a life policy ceases to qualify. Currently, the relief ends at the beginning of the income year in which a breach occurs. Comment Related to the previous submission, insurers have asked that the transitional relief connected with an existing life policy under section EY 30(8) ceases on the date the breach occurs. For a class of policies, a life insurer can elect to calculate a part-year transitional relief up to and including the date a breach occurs. If the life insurer does not make such an election, transitional relief will end at the start of the income year in which the breach occurs. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 146 Issue: Definition of “savings product policy” Submission (Matter raised by officials) Life insurers have asked for changes to ensure that the treatment of life policies that provide a payback of all or a portion of the premium for life risk is consistent with policy intent. Comment The Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 included changes to the definition of “savings product policy” to ensure that life policies that provide for a return of premiums paid in connection with providing life risk cover (contrasted against any savings component) were not treated as a savings product policy under the new life insurance rules. Further changes are required to ensure that the exclusion applies to situations when the entire life risk component of the premiums is repaid. Currently, the rule applies only when a portion of the total premium for life risk is repaid. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Part-year calculations Submission (Matter raised by officials) The calculations for part-year adjustments need refinement. Comment Two issues have been identified with the treatment of reinsurance when life business is transferred. • Section EY 5(4) should be changed so it produces an amount for reserves that is gross of reinsurance (because sections EY 23 to EY 27 calculate amounts net of reinsurance). In the absence of the change, the seller’s position will reflect a situation where the reinsurance arrangement has not been assigned, as the closing balance of the reserves will not include reinsurance amounts. This outcome is contrary to what the section should achieve. 147 • Section EY 5(6) produces an amount for reserves that is gross of reinsurance. The section adds reinsurance into the calculation on the basis that sections EY 23 to EY 27 are net of reinsurance. This produces an incorrect amount as section EY 5(6) is intended to reflect the situation where the recipient assumes the reinsurance, therefore this should be reflected in the value of reserves carried over to the new owner. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Opening balance of OCR and UPR reserves for the first year the new rules take effect Submission (Matter raised by officials) The effect of the current rules is that both the Outstanding Claims Reserve (OCR) and Unearned Premiums Reserve (UPR) may not report any movement for the first year of the new life insurance rules. Comment The current rules for determining the opening balance of the OCR for the first income year could arguably be read so that the amount calculated for the opening balance of the OCR will be the same as the closing balance. This would result in no movement in the reserve. A similar problem has been identified with the operation of the opening balance of the UPR for the first income year. The sections should refer to an amount that would have been the closing value in the prior income year as if the new rules had effect, and ensure that the calculation is made with necessary modification for the beginning of the income year when the new rules have effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 148 Issue: Incorrect reference Submission (Matters raised by officials) Several changes are required to correct erroneous references in the new life insurance rules. • In section EY 24 the adjustments for “mortality” profit and reinsurance amounts already returned under the old life rules have been put in backwards (mortality profit). • Life insurers that offer general insurance are also required to discount the balance of the Outstanding Claims Reserve. Defining “general insurance contract” by reference to IFRS 4 means that life insurers are excluded and therefore the legislation does not recognise situations when a life insurer has non-life policies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 149 Other matters raised by officials 150 151 RESIDENT WITHHOLDING TAX RATES: REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS The Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 made changes to resident withholding tax rates (RWT) on interest income so they align with the new tax rate structure enacted in 2008. However, a number of minor technical issues have come to light, which are outlined below. Officials recommend that these be fixed. The changes recommended are all consistent with the original policy intention. Issue: Clarification of transition to new resident withholding tax rates for individuals and companies Submission (Matter raised by officials) Amendments should be made to clarify the transition to the new 38% RWT rate for individuals and the transition to the new 30% and 38% RWT rates for companies. Comment An amendment should be made to clarify the transition to the new 38% RWT rate for individuals who elected the 39% rate before 1 April 2010. A similar clarification of the transition to the new 38% and 30% rates is required for companies that chose the 39% or 33% RWT rates before 1 April 2010 or 1 April 2011 respectively. These changes should apply from 1 April 2010, except for the transition to the new 30% company RWT rate, which should apply from 1 April 2011. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 152 Issue: Clarification of RWT rates for trustees, Māori authorities and portfolio investment entities Submission (Matter raised by officials) Amendments should be made to clarify the applicable RWT rates for trustees, Māori authorities and portfolio investment entities (PIEs). Comment It should be clarified that the optional 30% RWT rate for companies for the 2010–11 income year does not apply to a company that is a trustee or a Māori authority (as the RWT rates set out in table 2 of schedule 1, part D apply to these instead). A further change is required to ensure that trustees which are PIEs are able to use the 30% company RWT rate set out in table 3 of schedule 1, part D. Officials recommend that these changes apply from 1 April 2010. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Inland Revenue’s ability to instruct interest payers to change a person’s RWT rate – minor drafting Submission (Matter raised by officials) The wording of new section 25A of the Tax Administration Act should be amended to make it clear that the section applies to all individuals and not just those who have elected an RWT rate. Comment The Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 introduced a new provision which allows Inland Revenue to identify individuals who are on an RWT rate that is inconsistent with their marginal tax rate and instruct interest payers to shift those individuals to the appropriate rate. An amendment is required to ensure the section more accurately reflects the policy intent, which is that the provision should apply to all individuals who are interest recipients, whether or not they have elected an RWT rate. Officials recommend that the amendment apply from 1 April 2010. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 153 Issue: Optional 30% RWT rate for companies – minor drafting Submission (Matter raised by officials) Comment The Taxation (Consequential Rate Alignment and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 introduced a provision which allows for an optional 30% RWT rate to be applied by interest payers with respect to companies. A minor amendment should be made to ensure the section more accurately reflects the policy intent, which is that the provision should apply in respect of the payer from 1 April 2010. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 154 TAX TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS TO PUBLIC OFFICE HOLDERS Submission (Matter raised by officials) Schedule 4 to the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to provide a rate of tax for schedular payments made to public office holders. Background Schedular payments are generally payments for certain services when the relationship between the parties is not strictly one of employer and employee. Schedular payments made to non-employees are subject to withholding tax. They are treated as PAYE income payments for the purposes of the PAYE rules. The categories of payments subject to withholding tax were previously set out in the schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding payments) Regulations 1979. With the rewrite of the Income Tax Act the regulations were revoked, and the rates of tax to be withheld from schedular payments are now set out in schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment Payments to public office holders were previously covered under “honoraria” in the 1979 withholding payments regulations, but they are not explicitly included in schedule 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This means that there is now no authority for the payers of fees to public office holders to withhold tax from those payments. That problem has been compounded by the definition “honorarium” inserted into the Income Tax Act 2007 by the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009. The new definition explicitly limits the scope of the definition for the purposes of new provisions introduced in that Act relating to payments to volunteers, as well as for the purposes of schedule 4, part B (Rates of tax for schedular payments). These matters need to be rectified as a matter of urgency. A related issue has been raised in relation to the tax treatment of payments that reimburse costs incurred by public office holders. Under the previous law, reimbursements were also subject to withholding tax. However, the regulations allowed the Commissioner to determine that a specified amount or proportion of a withholding payment had been incurred in the production of the payment and that amount or proportion was not subject to withholding tax. The ability for the Commissioner to make those determinations has been preserved in the Income Tax Act 2007. 155 Reimbursements of costs incurred, when paid to employees or to volunteers, are now treated as exempt income (sections CW 17 and CW 62B of the Income Tax Act 2007, respectively). This means that only the amount of remuneration or honorarium paid to these persons is treated as a PAYE income payment. This has the same effect as the Commissioner’s determinations, but avoids the need for determinations to be made on a case-by-case basis. Other recipients of reimbursement payments are required to account for the payments when filing their income tax return and can claim a deduction for the actual costs incurred or apply for a determination, as indicated above. Public office holders will often have income from multiple sources and be required to file individual income tax returns. It is therefore not unreasonable to require them to individually account for reimbursements and claim a deduction for the related costs incurred. However, there would appear to be a low risk to the revenue in requiring that tax be withheld at source only from the amounts that are effectively remuneration for them. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.

a new rule to require GST-registered vendors in most cases to charge GST at the rate of zero percent on the supply to a registered person involving land or in which land is a component. The bill also streamlines transactions involving nominated persons, clarifies the boundaries of the definition of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” and simplifies the method for apportioning input tax deductions for goods and services that are used for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. Other matters in the bill include amending the “on premises” fringe benefit tax exemption, allowing deduction by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make deductions of tax from joint bank accounts and various other remedial matters relating to a broad range of subject matter, including the tax treatment of emissions trading and the Auckland council restructuring. Sixteen submissions were received on the amendments. Most submissions supported the intent of the bill, but raised concerns around the practical application of the proposed GST rules. This report sets out officials’ detailed responses to those submissions. Officials have taken into account the recommendations in submissions seeking further simplification and certainty in relation to the proposed GST rules. As a result, numerous changes to the bill of a largely technical nature are recommended. Officials have not, however, recommended changes to the fundamental design and structure of key policies reflected in the bill. 1 GST: zero-rating of land 2 3 SECTION 11(1)(mb) – REQUIREMENTS FOR ZERO-RATING LAND TRANSACTIONS Clause 10 Issue: Transitional provision for zero-rating rules Submission (Russell McVeagh) A transaction may be documented before the legislation is enacted, with a time of supply after 1 April 2011. In these circumstances, there will be contractual uncertainty as to the transaction document, given that the zero-rating rules will likely to be in “draft” form at the time of the contract. Since it will not be a straightforward matter to vary contracts already entered into, there should be an ability to preserve existing GST treatment at the parties’ option, or upon application by the parties to the Commissioner. Comment We consider that a transitional provision is needed for transactions to which the zero- rating rules would apply that are entered into before 1 April 2011. The supplier would have the option of either using the new rules or applying the legislation in existence before 1 April 2011 even if the time of supply is triggered after 1 April 2011. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of zero-rating to components other than land Submissions (KPMG, Ernst & Young) The legislation should be clarified as to whether the requirement to zero-rate a supply in section 11(1)(mb) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”) applies to all goods and services supplied with land or just land and buildings (except if the building is a residential building which is excluded from the application of the zero-rating rules by section 5(15)). (KPMG) The submitter seeks clarification as to which goods supplied as part of a supply involving land must be intended to be used for making taxable supplies. (Ernst & Young) 4 Comment By referring to a supply that “wholly or partly consists of land”, section 11(1)(mb) intends that a supply should be zero-rated in full if any part of that supply consists of land (unless it is a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply). For example, in the sale of a farming business, any livestock sold as part of the supply will also be zero-rated under the section, even if the transaction is not a supply of a going concern. The goods and services supplied under a transaction may be in part for making taxable supplies and in part not – in that case zero-rating would still apply. However, if the supply includes portions that are used for non-taxable purposes, an apportionment of the non-taxable and taxable components will be required. Thus the purchaser will be required to pay GST on any non-taxable portion under proposed section 20(3I). Moreover, section 5(15) of the GST Act already requires a private residence as part of wider supply to be treated as a separate supply. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: The required extent of taxable supplies Submission (Ernst & Young) Clarification is needed about the extent of taxable supplies for which recipients must intend using the land and other components of the transaction, as distinct from other types of supply. Comment The requirement in section 11(1)(mb)(i) that a recipient must intend to use the land and other components of the supply for making taxable supplies will be satisfied unless the recipient intends the use to be wholly for exempt and/or private purposes. Section 11(1)(mb)(i) seems to be sufficiently clear in this regard. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 5 Issue: The timing of the registration status of the recipient Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst & Young) Clarification is required as to when the parties’ registration status and the recipient’s intentions in respect of land are to be measured for the purposes of new section 11(1)(mb). The current wording is unclear on whether the recipient’s intention is required to be tested immediately or in the future (depending on what the ultimate intention is). Comment Officials agree with the submission. It is recommended that a purchaser be required to make representations regarding their registration status or that of the ultimate recipient, and their intentions in relation to land as they are expected to be at the time of settlement. By being able to make representations on a prospective basis, the purchaser will be required to provide information that they predict will be correct at the time of settlement. The purchaser will be responsible for any tax unpaid as a result of the representation not being correct. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 6 DEFINITION OF “LAND” FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTION 11(1)(MB) Clause 4(5) Issue: Leases and periodic payments Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The Corporate Taxpayers Group is concerned that the definition of “land” in the bill is too wide, and may catch transactions that are not intended by officials to be zero- rated. The concern is specifically about the meaning of “interest in land”, which will form part of the definition of “land”. Under ordinary legal principles, an interest in land will include leases. The creation or transfer of a leasehold interest should be within the zero-rating provisions, given that such a transaction is effectively a quasi sale and purchase of land. However, ongoing lease payments should be carved out. In order to achieve this outcome, the submitter suggests that there should be a bright- line test applying the zero-rating provisions to the creation or transfer of a leasehold interest that meets a particular threshold. An appropriate bright-line test would be to zero-rate the creation or transfer of leasehold interests which are 20 percent or more of the total market value of the land. Ongoing rental payments under a lease arising from such a transaction should be carved out and not subject to the zero-rating provisions. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The definition of “land” should expressly exclude payments for the supply of a commercial dwelling that are subject to the time of supply rules in section 9(3)(a) of the GST Act (that is, periodic payments). (KPMG) Normal commercial leasehold interests should not be captured by the zero-rating regime. Officials’ concerns in respect of leases being used for “phoenix” schemes could be addressed by zero-rating only transfers of leases and prepayments of more than 12 months on leases. (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The zero-rating rules should not apply to successive supplies of a commercial dwelling subject to a lease. The definition of “land” will need to be amended to exclude these transactions. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Further consideration could be given to whether periodic supplies of land, such as commercial leases, should be included in the application of the new zero-rating provisions. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 7 Comment Submitters consider that periodic supplies of land, especially commercial leases, should be excluded from the definition of “land” used for the zero-rating amendments. The key issue is the compliance costs that would arise from existing commercial leases or other periodic supplies of land having to be altered to take account of the zero-rate, even though the contract is unlikely to generate a phoenix fraud risk. Most submitters do recognise, on the other hand, that for new transactions leasehold interests could relatively easily become a substitute for freehold interests and give rise to the possibility of such a risk. Officials agree that the definition of “land” in the bill is too broad and should exclude most leases of land and other periodic supplies such as easements over land. The solution, however, must strike a balance that addresses both the compliance cost and the tax base risk concerns. The solution should also provide as much certainty as possible regarding which transactions should be zero-rated and which transactions should be standard-rated. Officials recommend an amendment to the definition of land that uses a “bright-line” test to exclude periodic or ongoing supplies of interests in land. The test would be based on whether, after 1 April 2011, more than 25 percent of the total consideration under the agreement is provided in advance of, or contemporaneously with, the provision of the land, in addition to the regular ongoing payments under the agreement. If the 25 percent threshold is exceeded, the whole transaction (or remaining part of the transaction) would have to be zero-rated. If not, the transaction would be standard-rated. The 25 percent figure should therefore apply to zero-rate all transactions with unusual commercial terms that could provide an incentive for phoenix fraud. We prefer basing the test on rental payments rather than the market value of the land as this should remove the compliance cost of any additional valuation. Officials have considered whether a transitional rule is needed that would allow the provisions in the bill to not apply to periodic supply contracts that met the 25 percent test and that were entered into before 1 April 2011. Given the limited number of agreements that would fall into this category, and that the issue is one of compliance costs only, we do not think that such a provision is warranted. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. That the definition of “land” be amended to exclude interests in land that involve more than 25 percent of the total consideration under the agreement provided in advance of, or contemporaneously with, the provision of the land, in addition to the regular ongoing payments under the agreement. 8 Issue: Clarifying whether certain supplies constitute “land” Submission (Ernst & Young) Further thought is required as to how the proposed definition of “land” will impact on any supplies involving some element of land or rights which are related to land in some way, with express clarification of the statutory provisions and publications of adequate examples to ensure there is clarity and certainty for taxpayers. For example, there may be considerable uncertainty and compliance costs to taxpayers in determining whether a variety of transactions with some connection to land include the supply of “land” for the purposes of section 11(1)(mb) (for example, supplies of timber rights, telecommunication lines, building fixtures, etc). Comment Officials accept that further certainty is required regarding the ambit of the definition of “land” used in section 11(1)(mb) and recommend that Inland Revenue publish guidelines on the matter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Flat- and office-owing companies Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend that shares in “flat-owning companies” or “office-owning companies” should be included within the proposed definition of “land”. Comment The GST Act specifically excludes shares in “flat-owning companies” or “office- owning companies” (as defined in the Land Transfer Act) from the GST definition of “financial services”. This exclusion was introduced to prevent taxpayers from incorporating such companies, acquiring land and then transferring shares in the company (without having to charge GST), rather than transferring the underlying asset (which would have attracted GST). However, this presents an issue in relation to the proposed rules, which seek to zero- rate all interests in land. If the shares in these companies are not “land” and are not “financial services”, a supply of the shares will attract the standard rate of GST. There is therefore a risk that these shares could be transferred between registered persons in a “phoenix” transaction. 9 Officials recommend including shares in flat-owning or office-owning companies within the proposed definition of “land” to clarify that the transfer of these shares should be zero-rated. Officials consider this is consistent with the policy intent of the changes and may prevent the zero-rating rules being circumvented by the imposition of company structures in certain cases. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 10 VENDOR’S INFORMATION-GATHERING OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 78F Clause 20 Issue: Limiting information to registration status Submission (KPMG) The vendor’s obligation should be limited to obtaining the purchaser’s registration details. If a supply is zero-rated and the purchaser does not acquire the land with the sole intention of using it for making taxable supplies, the new change-in-use provisions would require the purchaser to account for the non-taxable use of the land. Therefore, the requirement to confirm the intentions of the purchaser in relation to the land imposes additional compliance costs on the vendor with no additional tax revenue to the Government. Comment If the purchaser does not intend to use the goods or services for making taxable supplies and the relevant information is provided to the vendor, it is preferable, and more in keeping with the scheme of the GST Act, that the correct standard-rated treatment of the transaction applies from the outset. Furthermore, the recommended changes to section 78F will simply require a vendor to obtain a written representation, rather than confirmation from the purchaser regarding the purchaser’s intentions in respect of the land. Officials consider that this obligation on the vendor will not greatly increase their compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Reducing the vendor’s obligations Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, Russell McVeagh, Ernst & Young) The legislation as currently drafted does not provide sufficient commercial certainty as to the GST treatment applying at the time of a transaction. The proposed obligation on supplies in section 78F may be onerous, particularly the obligation to confirm the intentions of the purchaser. The submitters recommend: 11 • removing the requirement on the vendor to confirm the relevant details, and allow the vendor to rely on the written representation of the purchaser. • replacing the reference to the purchaser’s “registration details” with the purchaser’s “registration status”. • removing or clarifying subsections (3) and (5) (relating to misrepresentations by either party) from the bill. Comment Officials agree that draft section 78F has a range of issues that need to be resolved. This is best achieved by reconsidering the section as a whole and what it is intended to achieve. It is important to recognise that there are in essence only two problematic situations that can practically arise under the zero-rating provisions – the supply being zero- rated when it should have been standard-rated, and the supply being standard-rated when it should have been zero-rated. The information that the supplier must obtain under proposed section 78F consists of: • the recipient’s registration details; • confirmation that the recipient is acquiring the goods with the intention of making taxable supplies; and • confirmation that the goods are not intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient or a relative of the recipient. These requirements will, for the most part, be met through completion of the standard sale and purchase agreements, in which the purchaser would verify these matters. Section 78F(2), however, requires confirmation from the vendor of the above and submitters have expressed concern about the vendor’s ability in this respect. Subsections (3) and (5), which are also of concern to submitters, outline a number of consequences that may arise if this information is not obtained in the first instance, or is incorrect. Officials agree that information requirements should be as easy to comply with as possible, and compliance with the requirements should not generally have regard to the intentions or behaviour of either the vendor or purchaser. Officials therefore recommend an alternative approach that does not require an examination of whether the vendor has made sufficient enquiries to obtain the information. The alternative approach would recognise that the vendor will have either: 1. obtained all the information to zero-rate and the information is correct; or 2. for any reason, not obtained all the information or obtained incorrect information. 12 If the purchaser is in fact registered for GST and has met the other tests, zero-rating has achieved the right outcome. Such purchasers have the incentive to provide the correct information otherwise they will risk GST being charged at the standard rate. It is for the second situation that the legislation may need to provide further clarification of the parties’ obligations. In this situation, the vendor could either zero- rate the transaction (because they believe the information to be correct even though it later transpires that it is not) or charge GST at the standard rate (which would be the usual expected outcome). Information not correct/not obtained and the vendor zero-rates If the vendor zero-rates the transaction but the information was incorrect and the transaction should have been standard-rated, clause 6 of the bill (proposed section 5(23)) imposes the obligation on the purchaser to register and pay GST. As noted later, however, proposed section 5(23) would be amended to apply to all situations in which the transaction should not have been zero-rated. It would require the purchaser to register for GST but allow for deregistration without further tax cost once the tax had been paid. Information not correct/not obtained and the vendor standard-rates If the vendor standard-rates the transaction one of two outcomes could result: • the purchaser is not registered and/or does not meet the other tests; or • it transpires that the purchaser is registered for GST and meets the other tests. If the purchaser is not registered for GST and/or does not meet the other tests, standard-rating has achieved the right outcome. If the transaction is standard-rated but should have been zero-rated because the relevant tests were in fact met, the vendor will have overpaid GST and should be able to recover it from Inland Revenue in the usual manner – using the process in the GST legislation of providing credit notes. (We recommend later in this report that the credit note provision, section 25, should be amended to explicitly apply in these situations.) The purchaser will not be entitled to an input tax deduction since the position under the legislation is that the transaction is zero-rated. It is the legislation that determines that a transaction is zero-rated, not the written representation of the purchaser, which merely enables the vendor to decide how the transaction should, in the first instance, be treated. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Officials further recommend that: • in subsection (2) of proposed section 78F, the reference to the supplier having to “confirm” the information in question be replaced by a reference to the supplier being able to rely on the written representation of the recipient; • in subsection (2) “registration details” be replaced with “registration status”; and • subsections (3) and (5) of proposed section 78F be omitted. 13 ALTERATION OF AGREED PRICE Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Section 78E (alteration of agreed price in relation to a supply mistakenly believed to be of a going concern) should be amended to refer not only to section 11(1)(m) (“going concern” rules), but also to the proposed section 11(1)(mb) or to zero-rating in general. Comment Officials consider that if the vendor, based on incorrect representations by the purchaser, does not zero-rate the transaction and GST is paid, this can be dealt with under section 25 of the GST Act which provides the credit note mechanism (and which we later recommend should be amended to provide more certainty about its application). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 PURCHASERS’ OBLIGATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR OUTPUT TAX IF A SUPPLY WAS INCORRECTLY ZERO-RATED – PROPOSED SECTIONS 5(23), 20(4B) AND 51B(4) Clauses 6(2), 13, 15 and 17 Issue: Implications of incorrect zero-rating Submission (Russell McVeagh) New section 5(23) deems a recipient to make a supply chargeable at the standard rate if they have provided incorrect information relating to whether they are GST- registered. It is submitted that the provision should also apply if the recipient has provided incorrect information regarding their intentions in relation to land. Comment In situations when a zero-rated supply is made to an unregistered person, the person, without further legislation, would acquire the supply free of GST. Proposed sections 51B(4) and 5(23) will therefore require the person to register for GST and to account for the output tax on the supply. If a recipient of a zero-rated supply is already registered for GST, but does not satisfy the other requirements of section 11(1)(mb) (that is, they do not intend to use the land for making taxable supplies or intend to use the land as a principal place of residence), the proposed apportionment rules in section 20(3I) would require them to account to Inland Revenue for the non-taxable use of the goods and services. As a consequence, the recipient would be required to account for the output tax on the supply under that provision. However, to ensure that the consequences of not satisfying the zero-rating requirements are all in one place, officials agree that section 5(23) should be amended to apply to all situations of incorrect or insufficient information being provided. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 15 Issue: Requirement for purchaser to register Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Under new section 5(23) of the GST Act, a purchaser supplying incorrect information to a vendor is treated as though they were a supplier making a supply that is chargeable with GST at the standard rate. It seems unnecessary to require the purchaser to also register for GST under section 51B(4) to recover a payment of a GST amount. Comment The registration of unregistered purchasers who incorrectly purchase land at a zero- rate is necessary to ensure that a payment of output tax made by the purchaser under section 5(23) can be processed by Inland Revenue’s accounting systems. To ensure that the purchaser does not suffer any unexpected costs from the compulsory registration, the bill should allow for an immediate deregistration of the purchaser without further tax liability once the tax has been paid. Recommendation That the submission be declined. However, officials recommend that once the tax is paid, the purchaser should be able to deregister without incurring any further tax liabilities. Issue: Timing of registration under section 51B(4) Submission (Ernst & Young) Clarification is needed regarding the time at which recipients are to be treated as registered under section 51B(4) and making taxable supplies under the proposed new section 5(23). Comment Since the ultimate recipient of the supply may not be known until the time of settlement, it may not be known before then whether the decision to zero-rate the transaction is correct. Therefore, a recipient will be treated as making a supply under section 5(23) at the time of settlement. Section 5(23) should be clarified to that effect. Officials also consider that the proposed section 51B should clarify that a recipient is treated as registered from the date of the supply made under section 5(23), and not from the time when the original supply was made, if different. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 16 Issue: Entitlement to input tax Submission (Ernst & Young) The proposed input tax denial in section 20(4B) in respect of supplies made under section 5(23) should be qualified to ensure that recipients of section 11(1)(mb) supplies are not precluded from claiming input tax if they become GST-registered after the GST time of supply under section 11(1)(mb). Comment When a supply of land which should have been standard-rated is zero-rated, new sections 51B(4) and 5(23) require the recipient to register for GST and account for the output tax on the supply. To ensure that the newly registered recipient does not immediately claim back the GST paid as an input tax deduction, new section 20(4B) denies them a deduction in relation to the supply. Having accounted for GST under section 5(23), officials have recommended that the recipient will be deregistered at no further cost. Officials accept that if a recipient, having been required to account for output tax under section 5(23), later registers for GST and starts using the goods and services in question for making taxable supplies, they should be allowed an input tax deduction in respect of those goods and services under the new apportionment rules proposed in this bill. Officials’ responses to the submissions on the proposed apportionment rules recommend that the legislation be clarified to ensure that an input tax deduction is allowed in these circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 17 ADMINISTRATION OF THE ZERO-RATING REGIME Issue: Searchable register of GST registered persons Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The law should allow a searchable register of GST-registered persons to be established so that taxpayers or their tax agent can identify the GST-registration status of either party. This will assist in reducing compliance costs for taxpayers transacting in land. As an alternative, or a concurrent change, a certification approach could be adopted that requires the vendor and the purchaser to certify their GST registration status (or that of their nominee if applicable) on the contractual documentation. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Consideration should be given to updating Inland Revenue’s systems and processes to allow suppliers to validate GST registration numbers provided by customers. For example, Inland Revenue should be able to provide the recipient’s registration details at the request of the supplier. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Owing to the Commissioner’s obligations to maintain secrecy regarding taxpayer- related information, it is not currently possible to establish a public register of GST- registered persons. Officials consider that owing to the proposed relaxation of vendors’ obligations to identify purchasers’ details (as proposed in this report), vendors should not suffer substantial compliance costs as a result of the zero-rating rules. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 18 Issue: Possible tax base risks Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The Group acknowledges that the proposed changes resolve officials’ principal concerns with “phoenix” transactions. However, there is a risk that fraudulent GST activity has, in effect, only been moved to another area. Specifically, the GST risk has moved to sales by a commercial vendor to the end consumer when false declarations are made by the purchaser regarding their registration status and intentions in relation to land. The Group suggests that Inland Revenue consider other non-tax legislative measures for penalising vendors that entice purchasers to misrepresent that they are GST registered or otherwise avoid the requirements of section 78F. Comment Officials acknowledge the submitter’s concern and consider that adequate policing will be necessary to minimise the risk of zero-rating rules being used inappropriately. At this stage, officials are not recommending the inclusion of any specific measures in the bill to deal with this potential issue, but will monitor the situation. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Inland Revenue advice Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) NZICA submits that material should be made available warning purchasers of arrangements that involve them registering for GST when they are acquiring land, or using their GST registration as a means of acquiring land inappropriately at a zero rate. Comment Officials agree that Inland Revenue advice for taxpayers will be beneficial for ensuring a smooth transition into the new rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 19 INTERACTION OF ZERO-RATING RULES WITH THE “GOING CONCERN” RULES Clause 10 Submission (Ernst & Young) Sales of businesses which include a transfer of land could be zero-rated under the proposed section 11(1)(mb) (zero-rating of land) or the existing section 11(1)(m) (sale of a going concern). Clarification of the interaction of the proposed section 11(1)(mb) and the existing section 11(1)(m) is required. Comment The new zero-rating rules will apply to any supply that involves land. This will affect many supplies of going concerns, as these frequently involve transfers of land. This will remove the need to determine whether a going concern is being supplied and to meet the other requirements for zero-rating a going concern in these cases. It is expected that the zero-rating rules will be easier to apply then the going concern rules as, among other things, the parties will not have to establish the existence or otherwise of a going concern or decide whether to apply the new provisions (as they are mandatory). Therefore, a specific exclusion from the going concern rules is not necessary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 20 OTHER DRAFTING MATTERS Issue: Treatment of services supplied as part of a transaction involving land Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Since the proposed zero-rating changes may apply to supplies consisting of both goods and services, and section 11 applies only to goods, consideration should be given to inserting a provision (similar to section 5(21) in the GST Act) that would treat any services provided as part of a transaction involving land as “goods”, in order to fall within proposed section 11(1)(mb). Comment Officials agree with the submission but note that the exact wording is a drafting matter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor drafting matters Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Russell McVeagh) A number of technical changes need to be made to the current draft legislation. The majority of those are minor drafting matters that are needed to ensure that the legislation works as intended. Comment Officials have considered all the changes proposed in the submission and agree that most of them are necessary. They will be raised with the bill’s draftsperson. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 21 GST: transactions involving nominations 22 23 ZERO-RATING TRANSACTIONS WHEN THE RECIPIENT IS NOT KNOWN AT THE TIME A CONTRACT IS ENTERED INTO Clauses 10, 18 and 20 Issue: Vendor’s obligations Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Russell McVeagh, KPMG, Ernst & Young) It is not uncommon for sale and purchase agreements to be entered by a “purchaser or nominee”. When a nominee is involved, the vendor will likely need to determine the GST registration status and other information requirements of both the purchaser and their nominee, as it may not immediately be clear who will be the actual purchaser in the transaction. A further complication arises when a nominee is not known at the time the contract is entered into. Submitters consider that vendors’ obligations should be clarified for transactions involving a nominee. Comment The nomination rules proposed in the bill will determine whether a supply should be treated as made to a contractual purchaser or a nominee, depending on which party to a transaction provides consideration for the supply. These rules are expected to work well in transactions that do not involve land, as the GST treatment of those supplies would not depend on the nomination and will simply help to determine which party is eligible to claim deductions. In respect of transactions that involve supplies of land, the vendor has to obtain a representation from the purchaser that they: • are registered for GST; • are acquiring the land to be used for making taxable supplies; and • do not intend to use the land as a principal place of residence. On the basis of those representations, the vendor must be able to determine whether a supply should be standard-rated or zero-rated. The use of the land can really only be based on the intentions of the ultimate recipient. In order to avoid any confusion regarding which supply should determine the correct GST treatment in transactions that involve land, officials recommend that, in those transactions, the supply should always be treated as between the vendor and the nominee (that is, the ultimate recipient). 24 In addition, for the purposes of the proposed section 78F, the purchaser should be able to provide representations to the vendor regarding the registration status and intentions of the ultimate recipient of the supply on a prospective basis. If the purchaser does not intend to receive the land themselves but knows the identity of the nominee who will settle the transaction, they will be able to make representations to the vendor regarding the registration status and the intentions of the nominee. The vendor will be able to rely absolutely on representations made by the contractual purchaser, and to apply the GST treatment on the basis of the information provided. If the purchaser does not have the relevant information about the nominee and the time of supply is triggered earlier than the date of settlement, the correct tax treatment of the transaction may have to be reconsidered. If a supply is zero-rated and the ultimate recipient is registered for GST and has met the other tests, zero-rating has achieved the right outcome. If a supply is zero-rated and the ultimate recipient is not registered for GST, the correct outcome has not been achieved. As a consequence, the recipient would be required to register for GST and account for the output tax on the transaction under proposed section 5(23). Alternatively, if the supply was standard-rated this will either achieve the correct outcome or given rise to the need for a vendor credit note. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and: • that in nominee transactions involving land, the supply always be treated as being made from the vendor to the nominee (the ultimate recipient); and • the purchaser should, on a prospective basis, be able to make representations regarding the registration status and intentions of the relevant recipient of the supply if it is a person other than the purchaser (a nominee). 25 Issue: Transactions involving an undisclosed agent Submission (Russell McVeagh) It is submitted that in some situations, there may be a need for the anonymity of the ultimate recipient of a supply, such as for commercial or competition reasons. In these circumstances, the ultimate recipient of a supply (undisclosed principal) may, for commercial or competition reasons, be acting through an undisclosed agent to acquire land. It is not practical for the agent to disclose the registration details of the undisclosed principal or to inform the supplier that they act for an undisclosed principal. The question arises as to how the new zero-rating rules will apply to transactions where land is acquired by an undisclosed agent. Comment As noted earlier in this report, officials recommend that the vendor may absolutely rely on representations made by the purchaser regarding their registration status and intentions in respect of land, and to apply the appropriate GST treatment on the basis of those representations. If those representations are not made, the ultimate recipient either will be liable to account for the outstanding output tax under section 5(23) (if the supply is incorrectly zero-rated) or (more likely) will be able to seek redress from the vendor if the GST has been paid to the vendor and the transaction is one that should have been zero-rated. It is considered that the proposed rules provide a sufficient mechanism for transactions to be conducted by undisclosed agents. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Ability to issue debit/credit notes Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Inland Revenue should confirm that debit and credit notes can be issued to correct situations when a tax invoice has been issued to the wrong party to the transaction so that the nominations provisions can work as intended. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The application of the zero-rating rules will depend on to whom the supply is made. The question is whether section 25 (relating to the provision of debit/credit notes on a change to a supply) is robust and flexible enough to deal with recasting nominee transactions that were initially zero-rated and that need to be charged with the GST at the standard-rate, or vice versa. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) 26 Comment Officials have recommended an amendment to the bill to allow a vendor to rely on representations made by a contractual purchaser regarding the registration status and intentions of the ultimate recipient (nominee). However, it is important to provide a mechanism for the parties to change the GST treatment of a supply prior to settlement or to rectify the incorrect GST treatment following settlement if a nomination or the provision of incorrect (or no) information triggers a different GST treatment. Section 25 ought to allow for the vendor, following settlement, to adjust the GST on the supply to provide the correct outcome. For example, if a transaction is standard-rated when it should have been zero-rated, the vendor should issue the purchaser a credit note and claim back the GST. Officials consider that section 25 should be amended to clarify that it does in fact apply in this way. This change would apply in all situations, not just when a nominee is involved. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 27 THE APPLICATION OF SECTION 60B Clause 18 Issue: The ambit of the proposals Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The bill clarifies the applicable GST treatment for nominations; however, proposed section 60B does not appear to cover assignments. The Group assumes the bill was never intended to cover assignments of transactions, but notes that this is a further area of uncertainty similar in nature to the current issues with nominations. While clarity as to the GST treatment of assignments is not required in this bill, it does seem the opportune forum in which to provide certainty. The Group suggests that the bill should simply apply the same clarification being given to nominations to assignments. Comment The proposed rules are intended to apply to transactions that involve nominations. The submission that there are remaining aspects of uncertainty for other transactions involving more than two parties is noted. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Interaction between section 60 and section 60B Submission (Ernst & Young) The interaction of the proposed rules with the existing agency provision in section 60 needs to be clarified. Comment Section 60 applies to agency arrangements whereas the proposed section 60B will apply to transactions that involve nominations. The determination as to which section applies to a transaction has to be made by reference to the relevant facts. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 28 Issue: Bare trustee Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section 60B should not apply if the nominee is a bare trustee. Bare trustees are typically ignored for GST purposes and a supply is taken to be made to the principal (purchaser). It should be made clear that section 60B only applies if a nominee takes title in their own right. Comment A “bare” trustee is a trustee who has no active duty beyond conveying the property to the beneficiary at some future time determined by the trust. Officials consider that if the bill is changed to provide that the supply is always to the nominee in the case of land, the insertion of a bare trustee should be consistent with this approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 29 NOMINATION MADE AFTER THE TIME OF SUPPLY HAS BEEN TRIGGERED Clauses 15 and 18 Issue: Nominations made after the time of supply Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) While the proposed rules appear to work well for nominations that occur before the time of supply, it is not clear that the rules will work effectively when the nomination is made after the time of supply. It is submitted that the legislation needs to clarify the intended outcome in those situations. (Russell McVeagh) The Group suggests that it is unclear as to what will occur when the time of supply has been triggered prior to the nominee being registered. There appears to be a risk that no GST credit will be able to be claimed. The Group would like officials to clarify the intended outcome when the time of supply has been triggered prior to the nominee being registered for GST. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Nomination will be most commonly used in transactions that involve supplies of land. In such transactions, we have recommended that the nominee always be treated as the end recipient and that prospective representations by the purchaser be allowed. In transactions not involving land, the proposed nomination rules will clarify which party – the purchaser or the nominee – is entitled to a deduction. It is suggested that if a nomination is made after the time of supply has been triggered, the possible outcomes are as follows. • Both the purchaser and the nominee are registered. The purchaser contributes the full purchase price. The purchaser is entitled to the deduction. • Both the purchaser and the nominee are registered. The nominee contributes the full purchase price. The nominee is entitled to the deduction. • The purchaser is registered and the nominee is unregistered. Either the purchaser or the nominee contributes the full purchase price. Neither the purchaser nor the nominee is entitled to the deduction. • The purchaser is unregistered and the nominee is registered. Either the purchaser or the nominee contributes the full purchase price. The nominee is entitled to the input tax deduction. We do not consider that further clarification of the nominee provisions is warranted. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 30 Issue: Timing of the registration status Submission (Ernst & Young) The submitter seeks clarification of when B’s (purchaser) and C’s (nominee) registration status have to be compared for the purposes of section 60B. Comment It is expected that the registration status has to be confirmed at the relevant time of supply – in many cases, settlement. The ability to provide information about the recipient’s registration status and the other relevant matters in land transactions should provide greater clarity in most cases. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Tax invoices Submission (Ernst & Young) The question is raised as to the effect on the supplier’s obligation in respect of tax invoices under section 24, particularly in relation to the prohibition on issuing more than one tax invoice for each taxable supply and the requirement for most tax invoices to include details of the recipient of the supply. The proposed new section 24(7B) refers only to the nominated person’s obligation to maintain records if a tax invoice is unavailable. Comment The Commissioner relies on tax invoices and other records for ensuring that a recipient of a supply is entitled to input tax deductions. In transactions that involve nominees, a tax invoice will commonly be issued by a vendor to the contractual purchaser, especially when the nominee is not yet known. In this circumstance, the proposed section 24(7B) will allow the nominee to rely on other records to establish the particulars of a supply and their entitlement to an input tax deduction. For transactions involving land, the nominee will, as the ultimate recipient, generally not be entitled to deduct input tax because of the zero-rating treatment. For transactions not involving land, if the supply is deemed to be to the contractual purchaser, the contractual purchaser, having provided the consideration, should have the requisite tax invoice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 31 OTHER DRAFTING MATTERS Clause 18 Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Russell McVeagh) A number of technical changes need to be made to the current draft legislation. The majority of those are minor drafting matters that are needed to ensure that the legislation works as intended. Comment Officials have considered all the changes proposed in the submission and agree that most of them are necessary. They will be raised with the bill’s drafter. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 32 33 GST: proposed apportionment rules 34 35 APPLICATION DATE OF THE NEW RULES AND COMPLIANCE COSTS TO TAXPAYERS Clauses 5, 13 and 14 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Businesses should be able to opt out from the new rules and continue to use the current system. The new rules will be particularly complicated in practice for large, partly exempt organisations, such as financial institutions. (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Another solution would be to defer the application date of the proposed changes until a later date to enable businesses making significant exempt supplies to fully understand the new rules and implement new systems as necessary. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, Ernst & Young) Alternatively, entities should be allowed to continue their current practice to make adjustments for GST under agreements already reached with Inland Revenue, such as the Bankers Memorandum of Understanding with Inland Revenue. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The GST Act should explicitly allow Inland Revenue to negotiate fair and reasonable apportionment methods with taxpayers. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment Officials do not agree that the application date of the proposed measures should be deferred, especially in view of the simplification benefits that have been noted in the submissions. Providers of financial services are concerned that the proposed apportionment rules will give rise to significant compliance costs for them for little additional value. The main concern is that existing agreements with Inland Revenue or other practices that are compliant with the current legislation will be unduly altered. Officials agree that the legislation needs to be workable in practice for financial services providers, given the very wide range of financial assets that are held by this industry. Retaining the current legislation for the benefit of some would undermine the objectives of the proposed rules. However, we recommend the following amendments to the bill to address submitters’ concerns: • For businesses that are principally in the business of supplying financial services, to allow apportionment to be based on either actual use or an alternative method approved by the Commissioner if the method provides a fair and reasonable result having regard to the proposed apportionment rules. This should provide the necessary flexibility for financial institutions to agree a workable approach with Inland Revenue and, for those within the industry who have existing apportionment agreements with Inland Revenue, to allow those agreements to continue with any necessary modifications. 36 • Businesses which would qualify for an alternative approved method would include a company group that meets the test of principally supplying financial services and a single entity that meets the test even if the group as a whole did not. We have considered whether the recommended changes should apply more widely than the financial services sector and have concluded that this is unnecessary for the following reasons: • The current provision that allows for an alternative method extends to all taxpayers. However, this is to reflect the uncertainty of the current apportionment provisions. The proposed apportionment rules should, on the other hand, provide greater certainty to most taxpayers – especially SMEs who need to apportion primarily to reflect the business and private use of assets. In addition, extending the ability to seek an alternative method beyond the financial services sector could give rise to additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue. • Although no submissions have been received from the sector, the property sector is the other main sector affected by the apportionment rules. The number and range of assets held by this sector is necessarily far more limited than for the financial services sector. One issue that this sector could face is apportioning the concurrent use of assets – for example, when property that is being developed for sale is temporarily in whole or part rented out to tenants. However, the bill already provides a formula (draft section 21D) to deal with this situation and also provides the ability for the Commissioner to allow an alternative approach to the formula. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part. That the application date of the proposed rules should not be deferred. However, the legislation should allow businesses which principally make supplies of financial services to agree with the Commissioner a fair and reasonable method of apportionment having regard to the apportionment provisions. A business that principally supplies financial services could be either a single entity or a company group that meets this test. 37 THE MECHANISM FOR TRANSITIONING INTO THE NEW RULES Clause 14 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Submitters state that the transitional mechanism proposed in the bill will have a negative impact on taxpayers, as taxpayers that undertake this option will be required to account for output tax on the full market value of the supply at the time of the deemed sale, but will be able to claim input tax only for the portion of the estimated taxable use of the asset. This will result in a fiscal disincentive to transition into the new rules. Comment To transition into the new regime, the bill requires the registered person to account as though they had disposed of the relevant goods or services at market value (and account for output tax on the disposal) and then acquire the goods or services for the same market value under the new regime. Officials note that owing to the fundamental differences in the way the two regimes operate, most transitional methods would result in a loss to either the taxpayer or the tax base. Furthermore, owing to the voluntary nature of the transitional rules, it might be expected that the rules will only be used when providing a positive result for the taxpayer – meaning that the outcome of transitions is likely to be revenue negative. It is therefore important that the method adopted be as tax neutral as possible. Officials have considered three possible options for a transition to the new rules for current assets. 1. As currently provided in the bill, that current assets be deemed to have been sold at their market value and reacquired at that value for the purposes of the new rules. 2. That a recalculation be undertaken based on the original cost price and a retrospective application of the new rules. This would require an offset of deductions under the new rules with all deductions claimed under the existing rules. 3. Having a definite timeframe of five years from 1 April 2011 (1 April 2016), after which no further adjustments under the existing rules are required or allowed. This would not apply in the case of land, for which adjustments can be made for a much longer period. We recommend option 3 as it is the simplest to apply and should not give rise to significant revenue losses or gains for the taxpayer. 38 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted and new transitional rules provide for no further adjustments for current assets after 1 April 2016 (other than land). 39 TRACING INPUTS TO OUTPUTS Clause 13 Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) That the word “used” where it appears in new sections 20(3C) and 20(3F) be deleted. Further, if it is the intention that there is no change to the approach in the existing law to input tax credits – that is, that it is not necessary to directly trace acquired goods and services to taxable supplies produced – it should be clearly stated in the Finance and Expenditure Committee report to Parliament on the bill that this is the case. Alternatively, if there is a change in law this too should be clearly stated. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Consideration should be given to inserting a new purpose provision into the GST Act to deal with input tax deductions and the principle of GST neutrality. This would ensure that no direct tracing of inputs to outputs is necessary, which would simply preserve the current position. Alternatively, the “principal purpose” test should be retained for the point of acquisition, but subsequent changes to the use of the asset would be relevant under the new apportionment rules. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The aim of the proposed rules in respect of the apportionment of input tax is to change the method for calculating the extent to which input tax deductions may be claimed. Officials note that the current legislation does not provide any specific rules for tracing inputs to outputs, but also adopts an asset-by-asset formulation. As this is a feature of the current system, we do not consider that the changes suggested by submitters are necessary. As noted earlier, however, officials have recommended that financial services providers be able to apply to the Commissioner for a fair and reasonable method that not require an asset-by-asset determination. This should address most of the compliance cost concerns raised by the submitters. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 40 EXCLUSION FROM THE REQUIREMENT TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS UNDER SECTION 20(3D) Clause 13 Submission (Ernst & Young) Section 20(3D) is intended to relieve taxpayers from having to apportion input tax if they make mixed supplies and have reasonable grounds to believe that they will make a minimal amount of GST-exempt supplies. Clarification is required regarding: • whether the exclusion applies from the date of initial acquisition or at the end of an adjustment period; and • the length of period over which the requirement of the section must be met. Comment A purchaser may be required to apportion input tax (i) on acquisition and (ii) at the end of each adjustment period. The exclusion provided by section 20(3D) is intended to relieve taxpayers from having to apportion input tax in either or both of these situations. The determination of use should be undertaken at the time of claiming the initial input tax deduction and again on making the adjustment. For the latter, the time frame should be the period of use since the last adjustment. Officials suggest that Inland Revenue provide published guidance on this matter. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 41 THE MEANING OF THE TERM “ACQUISITION” Clauses 5, 13 and 14 Submission (Ernst & Young) Clarification is required as to what is considered by the terms “acquired” and “time of acquisition”. Comment The proposed legislation relies on the notion that input tax may only be claimed to the extent that an asset is used for making taxable supplies. In most situations, a purchaser will not be able to use goods or services until they obtain ownership of the goods and services. However, it is possible for goods and services to be acquired in other ways. Officials consider that the terms “acquired” and “time of acquisition” should be given their normal meaning. We do not consider that attempting to define the terms would be helpful. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 42 AVAILABILITY OF INPUT TAX DEDUCTIONS FOLLOWING REGISTRATION Clauses 13 and 14 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Input tax credits should be allowed when an asset moves from non-taxable to taxable, or to a partially taxable state. Comment An unregistered person cannot claim as input tax the GST component of taxable acquisitions that they make. However, the person may later register for GST and start using the goods and services that they previously purchased in their unregistered capacity for making taxable supplies. In these circumstances, the person should be able to claim an input tax deduction in respect of the previously acquired goods and services. The actual taxable use of the goods and services will have to be calculated from the date of the original acquisition and will take into account the previous non-taxable use of the goods and services. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 43 MAKING CHANGE-IN-USE ADJUSTMENTS IN RESPECT OF SERVICES Clause 14 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposal is to apportion input tax deductions in a “services” context in line with the actual use of those services. The submitter assumes that there will be no requirement for multiple GST change-in-use adjustments for services over a number of periods, but rather the supply of services will be treated as a one-off adjustment as is the case under the existing rules. Comment The proposed apportionment rules are intended to apportion input tax deductions in respect of goods and services in accordance with the taxpayer’s actual use of those goods and services until they are fully consumed or disposed of. It is not proposed to introduce special rules for limiting the number of adjustments that have to be made in respect of services. Under the current change-in-use adjustments legislation, services are subject to the same general rules as goods. It should be noted that, unlike goods, most services have a short lifespan and are generally consumed soon after acquisition. In the same way as under the current change-in-use regime, these services will normally require just one initial adjustment. Some services may, however, last for longer periods. These services typically relate to intellectual property rights – for example, a licence to use a copyright may be used for a number of years. Under the proposed rules, the input tax in relation to such services will be adjusted throughout their use (up to the maximum number of adjustments as prescribed by the proposed legislation). Again, this requirement to make continuous adjustments to input tax relating to services is a feature of the current regime. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 44 THE MEANING OF THE TERM “DISPOSE” Clause 14 Submission (Ernst & Young) Clarification is required as to how and when taxpayers might be considered to “dispose” of services so as to trigger a final adjustment of the nature provided in the proposed section 21E. Comment The term “dispose” is intended to apply to sales of goods and services, or any other disposition of goods and services, including a deemed disposition under the GST Act. The latter would include the deregistration of a GST-registered person. The exact circumstances of how and when taxpayers might be considered to “dispose” of services will depend on the relevant facts. Officials do not consider that the issue warrants legislative clarification. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 45 ADJUSTMENT PERIODS Clause 14 Issue: Time of first adjustment period Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, Russell McVeagh) Requiring the first adjustment period for an asset to be between 12 and 24 months will cause material compliance issues. This is because assets in their first adjustment period will not be able to be grouped with existing assets for the purposes of applying the taxable portion percentage for a year, but will need to be tracked individually and have a weighted average actual use percentage calculated over the two periods. The submitters suggest that a practical solution would be for the first adjustment period to be the time from acquisition to the first balance date. Comment Officials agree that allowing taxpayers to group acquired assets with existing assets would provide a compliance cost saving from not having to track assets on an individual basis. We note, however, that a shorter initial adjustment period could cause other problems – especially for the concurrent use of land provision. Therefore, while we accept the submission, taxpayers should have the option of the first adjustment period being the first balance date or the balance date which is at least 12 months after acquisition. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted subject to officials’ comments. 46 Issue: The effect of a change of balance date on adjustment periods Submission (Ernst & Young) Clarification is required of the effect of a taxpayer changing their balance date on the definitions of “first adjustment period” and “subsequent adjustment period” in section 21F(2). Comment As a compliance cost saving measure, section 21F(2) aligns taxpayers’ balance dates and dates for making adjustments by stating that a taxpayer’s first adjustment period should end on the date that corresponds with the taxpayer’s balance date (subsection (a)) and subsequent adjustment periods should be periods that run at 12-month intervals after the first adjustment period (subsection (b)). If a taxpayer changes their balance date without being able to also change the dates of subsequent adjustment periods, the compliance cost saving will not be achieved. The proposals should allow that if a taxpayer changes their balance date, they have an option of realigning their adjustment periods by reference to the new balance date. Thus, if in an adjustment period a taxpayer changes their balance date by moving it backwards (so as to effectively increase the length of the relevant adjustment period), their current adjustment period will end at the new balance date. In contrast, if in an adjustment period a taxpayer changes their balance date by moving it forwards (so as to effectively reduce the length of the relevant adjustment period), their current adjustment period will end at their new balance date of the following year. Once the taxpayer has realigned their adjustment periods with the new balance date, their subsequent adjustment periods would be identified by reference to the proposed section 21F(2) in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 47 THRESHOLDS Clause 14 Issue: Increase of thresholds for number of adjustment periods Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG) The thresholds governing the number of adjustment periods should be increased further. Comment Under the proposed rules, a taxpayer’s entitlement to an input tax deduction will depend on the extent to which they use the relevant goods and services for making taxable supplies. For this reason, the taxpayer will be required to estimate their actual use of the acquired goods and services, and to use those estimations in making adjustments to their input tax. Depending on the value of the goods and services acquired, the number of adjustments that have to be made for substantial changes in the use of goods and services will be either nil, two, five or ten. The higher the value of an asset, the greater number of adjustments the taxpayer will have to make over a longer period of time. By requiring taxpayers to make adjustments in relation to high-value assets for longer periods of time, the proposed rules aim to minimise the possibility of taxpayers under- or over-claiming input tax in relation to those assets, so that the final amount of the input tax claimed by the taxpayer corresponds as closely as possible with the actual taxable use of the asset in question. Although relaxing the thresholds would reduce compliance costs to taxpayers stemming from having to make continuous adjustments for changes in use, it would also reduce the accuracy of the final amounts of input tax claimed by taxpayers. Officials consider that the thresholds proposed in the bill strike a good balance between the need for accuracy and the reduction of compliance costs. Officials note that the recommended amendment to allow calculation of the first adjustment period from the date of acquisition to the first balance date (rather than to the balance date which is at least 12 months after the date of acquisition) will reduce the time period during which taxpayers have to make adjustments. Officials also note that, in most cases, the use of an asset will not vary significantly and only one initial adjustment will, in practice, be required. In comparison, the current change-in-use adjustment regime does not provide any limits for the number of adjustments that have to be made. Therefore, the new rules should, despite the numbers of adjustments that may be required, result in compliance cost savings. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 48 Issue: “Taxable value” Submissions (KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The word “taxable” should be deleted so that proposed section 21(2)(b) includes “the value of the goods and services”. This is consistent with the wording used in section 10(2) of the Act (being a GST-exclusive amount). (KPMG) The phrase “taxable value” in section 21(2)(b) should be defined. It is understood that it refers to the GST-exclusive value of goods and services. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comments Section 21(2)(b) allows businesses to not make adjustments for change in use if the value of acquired goods or services does not exceed $5,000. Officials agree with the suggestion to clarify that the “taxable value” refers to the GST-exclusive value of goods and services. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Increase of threshold for no adjustments Submission (KPMG) Section 21(2)(b) allows businesses to not make adjustments for change in use if the value of acquired goods or services does not exceed $5,000. KPMG suggests increasing the threshold, for example, to $20,000. Comment On acquisition of an asset, a taxpayer would need to make a fair and reasonable estimation of the extent to which goods and services are to be used for making taxable supplies. Typically, if it later transpires that the actual taxable use of the asset differs from the taxable use of the asset as estimated on acquisition, the taxpayer will be required to make subsequent change-in-use adjustments in relation to the asset. A subsequent change-in-use adjustment will, however, not be required if the GST- exclusive value of the asset is less than $5,000. 49 Although this exclusion will act as a compliance and administration cost-saving mechanism, it may potentially result in a loss to the tax base. For example, a taxpayer may purchase an asset for a GST-exclusive value of $5,000 and claim the full available input tax of $750 (at 15%). If, immediately following the acquisition, the taxpayer changes their use of the asset to solely private use, the taxpayer will not be required to make a subsequent change-in-use adjustment and will therefore have claimed $750 more in input tax than they would have claimed if they were required to make ongoing adjustments. Increasing the de minimis threshold to $20,000 would increase the potential losses described above to $3,000. At this level, the requirement to make adjustments seems warranted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Removal of $10,000 de minimis threshold Submission (KPMG) A person is not required to make a subsequent change-in-use adjustment if the exclusion in section 21(2)(c) applies – that is, if the difference between the actual taxable use of goods and services and the intended actual use of goods and services is less than 10%, and the monetary value of the adjustment is less than $1,000. The submitter considers that the $1,000 threshold is redundant and should be removed. Comment Depending on the value of goods or services and the GST component involved, a change of 10% may amount to a significant change in monetary terms. For example, a supply made for a GST-exclusive consideration of $10m would be subject to $1.5m of GST at 15%. A 9% change in the taxable use of the asset would therefore result in a potential adjustment of $135,000. The monetary value of the adjustment threshold is therefore necessary to ensure that adjustments for changes in use are made when the monetary value involved is substantial. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 50 Issue: Clarification of de minimis threshold Submission (KPMG) Clarification is needed about whether the 10 percent figure referred to in the new subsection 21(2)(c) relates to 10 percentage points or a percentage change from year to year. In addition, the proposed legislation states that if the 10 percent threshold in section 21(2)(c) is exceeded in an adjustment period, the person must make an adjustment for any percentage difference in all later adjustment periods. It is submitted that this reduces the effectiveness of the exclusion, as a business must continue to make the adjustment even if the amount is nominal. Comment The 10 percent threshold, as drafted in the bill, compares the percentage actual use of the goods and services (calculated from the date of acquisition until the end of the latest adjustment period) with the percentage of the intended use of the goods and services as estimated on acquisition. Officials recommend that the legislation clarify this. Officials agree that a further compliance cost saving may be achieved if taxpayers are not required to apportion the input tax when the change in use of the goods and services and the amount of the adjustment are not substantial. For this reason, we recommend amending the requirement for ongoing adjustments if the 10 percent threshold is exceeded, to provide a further de minimis exclusion. The exclusion would apply to any adjustment period if the difference between the use calculated at the end of the relevant adjustment period and the percentage previous use calculated in the period when the taxpayer was last required to make an adjustment does not exceed 10% and the monetary value of the adjustment does not amount to more than $1,000. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 51 Issue: 5 percent safe harbour threshold Submission (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) The 5 percent safe harbour threshold that was proposed in the 2009 discussion document Accounting for land and other high value assets should be retained. Comment The threshold proposed in the discussion document would allow a person to not make a subsequent change-in-use adjustment in relation to goods or services if the actual taxable use of goods or services differed from the intended use of goods or services by 5 percent or less. Depending on the value of goods or services involved, a change of 10% in respect of the GST component of the supply may amount to a significant change in monetary terms. Therefore, having considered the issue further, officials propose to raise the threshold to 10% but limit the exclusion to situations where the monetary value of the change does not exceed $1,000. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification of threshold for periodic supplies of goods and services Submission (Ernst & Young) Clarification is needed as to whether, in cases of periodic supplies of goods and services provided under section 9(3) (such as electricity, rates), the $5,000 threshold applies to each separate supply of goods and services received. Comment Periodic supplies under section 9(3) are treated as separate supplies for GST purposes. Therefore, the threshold in section 21(2)(b) would be able to be applied to each individual supply. We do not consider further clarification is needed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 52 CONCURRENT USE OF LAND Clause 14 Issue: Application of the concurrent use approach Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) That the rules for concurrent use of land be removed. The rules in section 21D are based on very similar principles to the previous change-in-use rules. Under the new approach, input tax is claimed based on how the taxpayer intends to use the goods and services. Under the new apportionment model, it is no longer appropriate to seek an adjustment when an asset is fully employed in the taxable activity. The asset, namely land and improvements, is fully committed to the taxable activity at all times. While the approach in section 21D for concurrent uses of land may be valid in a change-of- use model, there is no place in an apportionment model for requiring adjustments of this nature. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A concessionary period of 12 months, when no adjustment is required, should be considered for the purposes of the concurrent usage of land adjustment in section 21D. Otherwise, the rule may discourage property developers and other taxpayers in similar situations from renting their properties pending sale, as a portion of their initial input tax deduction will be reduced due to the derivation of the exempt rental income. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment Under the proposed apportionment approach, the portion of a deduction that a person should be entitled to must correspond with the extent to which the asset is used for taxable purposes. If the taxable use of the asset fluctuates, adjustments to the input tax deductions already claimed will have to be made to ensure that the overall amount of the deduction claimed corresponds with the actual taxable use of the asset from the date of the acquisition until the date when the adjustment is made. In most situations, an asset may only be used for either taxable or non-taxable purposes at one point in time. For example, at any given time a motor vehicle may be used either for making deliveries of goods and services or for taking children to school – but usually not both at the same time. In some circumstances, however, an asset may be used for taxable and non-taxable purposes at the same point in time – for example, a property developer may supply a house as a rental dwelling for a few months while advertising the house for sale. Thus, for the duration of the rental period, the asset is not only fully committed to the taxable activity (the sale), but is also simultaneously fully committed to the exempt activity (residential rental income). In this situation, it would be incorrect to simply ignore the non-taxable use of the property, considering that there is a chance that the property may never actually be sold. 53 Section 21D aims to provide guidance regarding the methodology to be used to apportion between concurrent uses of land for taxable and non-taxable purposes during adjustment periods when the land was so used. It allows taxpayers to apply to the Commissioner for an alternative approach if the formula is not workable in the circumstances. Officials understand that the predominant concern of the submitters is the compliance cost of adjusting for the exempt use when the exempt use is temporary and/or will not be reflected in the final wash-up calculation when the asset in question is disposed of. Officials consider that this concern would be partially addressed by the fact that the legislation would allow the first adjustment to be made after the second balance date. This should mean that in many cases of temporary exempt use, the adjustment will not be required. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application of the rules Submissions (KMPG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The application of section 21D is unclear and should be amended to reflect the policy intentions. For example, it should be clarified whether it will apply to all organisations that are covered by the new change-in-use adjustment rules as they will be making both taxable and non-taxable supplies, or is it only intended to apply when residential rental income is derived by a business that mainly makes taxable supplies? (KPMG) As drafted, new section 21D applies to all entities that make both taxable and non- taxable supplies. However, it is understood that the policy is that it applies only to when rental income is derived. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Section 21D is intended to assist taxpayers in identifying the extent of their taxable use in respect of land that is used concurrently for taxable and non-taxable purposes. The “concurrent” application of the land will happen when the land is simultaneously used for both a taxable function and a non-taxable function. This situation will most commonly arise in property developer situations, that is, when a developer derives rental income (exempt use) from a property while simultaneously advertising it for sale (taxable use). Officials are not aware of a vast number of other situations in which concurrent use arises. We therefore consider that limiting the formula to land only (as the proposed section 21D currently does) provides sufficient certainty to taxpayers regarding its application. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 54 Issue: Formula – application Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) In the formula in section 21D, the rental should only be the GST-exempt rental. Similarly, if the land is not rented, the “total consideration for supply” should not include the market value of the land upon which rental income would have been derived if the land had been rented. The only adjustment should be in relation to the GST-exempt rental actually derived, not the potential GST-exempt rental. Comment The reference to “rental income” in the bill is intended to refer to any rental income derived from the exempt activity – typically, from the supply of accommodation in a “dwelling”. Furthermore, the requirement to calculate the “market value of rental income that would have been derived if the land had been used for that purpose” is intended to apply to situations when the land is used for a non-taxable purpose that may not provide the person with any income, for example, a developer using the property as their own residential accommodation prior to the sale. Section 21D will be amended to clarify that it is only for the purposes of taking into account exempt or non-taxable supplies. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 55 Issue: Compliance costs of obtaining market value of land Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Obtaining the market value of land at the time of making the adjustment can be costly if an accurate assessment is required. For the purposes of determining the adjustment for land required when the land is also used for non-taxable purposes, the land rating valuation would provide a reasonable estimate if used on a consistent basis. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The requirement to obtain the above market valuations on an ongoing basis (when an adjustment is required) will result in material compliance costs. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials concur with the submission that if the market value of the land is not readily identifiable, the requirement should be able be satisfied by using other fair and reasonable methods that may provide a reasonable approximation of the market value of the land and the bill should be amended accordingly. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part. 56 GST TREATMENT OF GOODS AND SERVICES ON DISPOSAL Clause 14 Submission (KPMG) The legislation should clarify whether an entity that is making exempt supplies is still required to make an adjustment under section 21E. Comment If a registered person disposes of, or is treated as disposing of, goods or services, they may be able to claim an additional amount of input tax (new section 21E). The amount that can be claimed on disposal cannot exceed the total amount of input tax to which the person would be entitled if they had acquired the goods or services solely for making taxable supplies. Section 21E(1)(b) specifies that the adjustment is required only if the person disposes of the goods or services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Therefore, the adjustment will not be required if the disposal is in the course or furtherance of making exempt supplies. Officials consider that the legislation is sufficiently clear in this regard. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 57 MAKING ADJUSTMENTS IN RESPECT OF GOODS NOT YET USED Clause 13 Submission (Ernst & Young) Section 20(3C) refers to the extent to which the goods and services “are used” for making taxable supplies. The question arises whether this terminology intended to include items intended to be used for such purposes, but which are not yet applied in the taxable period in which they are acquired (such as raw materials not yet used for making goods). Comment Officials accept that taxpayers should be able to claim a full deduction in respect of goods and services “available for use” for making taxable supplies, and the proposed legislation should be amended to that effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 58 OTHER DRAFTING MATTERS Clauses 13 and 14 Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Russell McVeagh, Ernst & Young) A number of technical changes need to be made to the current draft legislation. The majority of those are minor drafting matters that are needed to ensure that the legislation works as intended. Comment Officials have considered all the changes proposed in the submission and agree that most of them are necessary. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 59 INPUT TAX DEDUCTIONS IN RESPECT OF SECOND-HAND GOODS Submission (BDO Wellington) Section 3A(3)(a)(i) of the GST Act should be amended so that the input tax is limited to the GST output tax paid by the last registered seller of those goods, if in fact there was any previous GST output tax. Comment Officials note that the submission is outside the scope of the matters in the bill. Officials will consider whether the issue should be recommended for inclusion in the Government’s policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 60 61 GST: definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” 62 63 DEFINITION OF “DWELLING” Clause 4(4) Issue: General Submission (Ernst & Young) By focusing on a recipient’s use, rather than on the nature of the premises, the proposed new definition of “dwelling” could result in anomalous differences of treatment for owners/lessors/licensors, depending on the nature of the occupant/lessee/licensee and on particular occupants’ use of premises. Comment The changes to the definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” proposed in the bill are intended to clarify the boundaries of those definitions in line with the principles set out in the 1985 White Paper on GST. The amendments will provide a narrower definition of “dwelling” with the intention that supplies of accommodation that are closely substitutable with owning a home should be exempt from GST. To achieve this goal, the amendments focus on the nature of the supply made to the recipient and the recipient’s use of the accommodation. It ensures that accommodation which is only of a temporary nature is excluded from the exemption. The proposed amendments will also rectify anomalous situations where two similar supplies of accommodation of commercial nature (for example, a hotel and a homestay) may be treated differently for GST purposes. Any boundary will naturally give rise to issues of interpretation and possibly minor distortions. However, we are not aware of any specific issues in this respect at this time. We will, however, monitor how the revised definition is applied in practice and make recommendations in the future for areas of significant concern. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 64 Issue: Definition of specific terms used Submissions (Campus Living Villages NZ, Ernst & Young, Grant Thornton New Zealand Limited, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The terms “premises”, “principal place of residence”, “exclusive possession” and “appurtenances” should be defined. Comment To ensure that the new definition of “dwelling” only applies to those supplies of accommodation that have a semblance of living in one’s own home, the supply of accommodation has to satisfy two new requirements that are characteristic of living at home – the tenant must occupy the accommodation as their principal place of residence and they must have exclusive possession of the accommodation. The “principal place of residence” is intended to refer to a place that a person uses as their main or predominant residence. Officials accept that uncertainty may arise as to what period has to be considered for identifying whether accommodation is used as a person’s principal place of residence. It is considered that the determination must be made by reference to the period for which the accommodation is supplied. For example, if an agreement stipulates that the accommodation be supplied for a period of six months, to be a “dwelling” the accommodation must be or be intended to be the recipient’s principal place of residence during that six-month period. “Exclusive possession” refers to the possession of land which enables the tenant to exclude not only strangers but also the landlord unless the landlord is exercising rights to enter the land granted under the tenancy agreement. “Exclusive possession” is an important element of a leasehold tenancy, and is one of the characteristics that distinguish a “lease” from a “licence”. However, to provide greater certainty, “exclusive possession” would be better replaced with “quiet enjoyment”, as that phrase is used in section 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. The term “premises” should also be defined by reference to the Residential Tenancies Act. Officials do not agree with defining the term “appurtenances” as it is currently the subject of interpretation by Inland Revenue. Any statutory definition of the term could therefore introduce new uncertainty. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part: • the term “principal place of residence” should be defined in the GST Act; • the term “exclusive possession” should be changed to “quiet enjoyment” as used in the Residential Tenancies Act; and • the term “premises” should also be defined by reference to the Residential Tenancies Act. 65 DEFINITION OF “COMMERCIAL DWELLING” Clause 4(3) Issue: Reference to “dwelling” in “commercial dwelling” definition Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Russell McVeagh) The commercial dwelling definition at (a)(vi) includes “premises other than a dwelling”. At (a)(v) the definition includes “premises of a similar kind to those referred to in subparagraphs (i) to (iv). It is considered that the reference in (a)(vi) to “premises other than a dwelling” is already covered by subparagraph (v), when it refers to premises of a similar kind. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Submitters also consider that paragraph (a)(vi) is unnecessary because the definition of dwelling already excludes a commercial dwelling. (KPMG, Russell McVeagh) Comment Officials agree that paragraph (a)(vi) in the definition of “commercial dwelling” is not necessary. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and paragraph (a)(vi) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” be removed. Issue: Possible conflict in “commercial dwelling” definition Submission (Ernst & Young) There may be questions as to whether serviced apartments or other accommodation in retirement villages or rest home complexes would constitute “commercial dwellings” within subparagraph (a)(ii) of the proposed definition or be excluded from the definition under subparagraph (b)(ii) of the same definition. Comment Officials do not consider that there is a conflict between paragraphs (a)(ii) and (b)(ii) in the definition of “commercial dwelling”. By adding the already existing paragraph (b)(ii) to the new definition of “commercial dwelling”, the definition maintains current practice by ensuring that dwellings situated within a retirement village or a rest home complex are governed by the same rules as other dwellings – that is, the supply of accommodation is exempt. 66 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: The definition of “serviced apartments” Submission (Russell McVeagh) The definition of commercial dwelling includes “serviced apartments”, for which services in addition to the supply of accommodation are provided, but these other services are not defined or clarified. The definition also includes accommodation managed by a third party. The submitter does not consider that third party management should be a critical element of distinguishing commercial accommodation from a “dwelling”. Comment The degree of services provided as part of a supply of accommodation in a serviced apartment may vary from minimal to much the same as that provided in a hotel or motel. For this reason, it is not proposed to define the extent or amount of services provided in the legislation as this will vary on a case-by-case basis. It is, however, important that the services that are provided relate to the occupancy of accommodation – for example, cleaning, rubbish removal, the provision of consumables, and similar types of services. On the second point raised by the submitter, officials note that the requirement for a third party manager is intended to provide a balance between the commercial provision of accommodation and what is essentially a dwelling in which only a minimal level of service is provided. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 67 GST TREATMENT OF STUDENT ACCOMMODATION Clause 4(4) Submissions (Campus Living Villages NZ, Tax Team, Grant Thornton New Zealand Limited) Student accommodation to tertiary students should be GST-exempt for the following reasons. • Student accommodation, which includes but is not limited to hostel accommodation, is substitutable for living in a flat – in both cases the accommodation is the student’s “home”. • Student accommodation is equivalent to accommodation in a retirement village which is exempt. • The proposed legislation places student accommodation in a worse GST position than currently since it would not be possible to meet the “exclusive possession” test in most cases. • The proposed legislation would provide even greater uncertainty for the sector. (Campus Living Villages NZ, Tax Team) As tertiary institutions provide a wide range of accommodation types, there may be some confusion as to whether a specific type of accommodation should be treated as a “dwelling” or a “commercial dwelling”. The submitter recommends, in order of preference: • exempting student accommodation from the definition of “commercial dwelling”; • allowing the apportionment of student accommodation if a portion relates to the supply of residential accommodation (exempt) and a portion relates to the supply of services to students (subject to GST); or • removing the words “or other accommodation” from the definition of “serviced apartments” in paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” as these could create considerable issues for providers of student accommodation in terms of the varying degrees of onsite management occurring in some student accommodation. (Grant Thornton) Comment Officials agree that the words “or other accommodation” should be removed from paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of “commercial dwelling” as there is a catch-all provision to include accommodation that is similar to the kinds specified. 68 Officials do not agree with the remaining submissions, based on the following considerations. • Both the current and proposed definitions of “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling” describe the nature of the accommodation rather than the types of occupant of the premises. This provides greater certainty, as a particular category of person – in this case, tertiary students – is likely to occupy a wide range of accommodation. Across the tertiary student sector, some forms of accommodation will be temporary in nature and at the other end of the spectrum some will provide fully catered services. Officials consider that the amendment suggested by submitters would be an undesirable departure from the current approach. In addition, following consultation with the Ministry of Education, we are concerned that it would be very difficult to adequately define in the legislation a term such as “tertiary student accommodation”. • Retirement villages are exempt only to the extent of any “dwelling” situated on the complex. The “dwelling” is the part of the complex in which the resident actually lives. The occupancy is of a permanent nature and, we understand, would provide the occupant with “exclusive possession” or “quiet enjoyment”. We do not consider the comparison between student accommodation and retirement villages in this respect to be particularly valid. We do note, however, that retirement villages have a concessionary 60 percent GST rate for the part of the complex that does not consist of a “dwelling” to provide a straightforward way of reflecting additional exempt use. This concessionary rate would also likely apply to a range of tertiary accommodation. • It may be the case that the proposed legislation does place further limitations on the extent to which student accommodation is GST-exempt because the “exclusive possession” or “quiet enjoyment” test will not be satisfied. However, this is an expected outcome in reinforcing the underlying policy of a broad-based tax with minimal exemptions. • There is always a degree of uncertainty in definitions such as those for “dwelling” and “commercial dwelling”. The bill aims to reduce this uncertainty overall. While we understand the submitters’ concerns with new definitions, it is not clear that less certainty is generated from the proposals than exists at present. Recommendation That the words “or other accommodation” should be removed from paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of “commercial dwelling”. That the submissions otherwise be declined. 69 Other GST matters 70 71 GST SPECIAL RETURNS Clause 11 Submission (Ernst & Young) That the provision should apply prospectively only or, alternatively, there should be an amnesty from use of money interest and penalties for taxpayers who pay all outstanding amounts within one month of enactment of the current bill. Comment Officials consider this is a clear case where retrospective application is justified. The amendment is simply designed to clarify a due date for payment and correct an obvious legislative oversight. As the submitter has conceded, the current provision does not remove a creditor’s liability to pay the GST – its “failing” is that it arguably does not specifically state the due date for such a payment. The practice of filing special returns and paying the appropriate GST has, so far as officials are aware, always been applied by taxpayers in a manner consistent with the policy intent of the provision – an intent that this amendment will reinforce. Given that officials are not aware of anyone actually being adversely affected by the retrospective nature of this provision, it is considered appropriate that the proposed application date be kept to provide clarity in the legislation through all tax periods. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 72 AMENDMENT TO THE REVERSE CHARGE PROVISION Clause 7 Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) That the references to “use” should be to “taxable use” if the provision is to achieve the desired outcome. Comment The provision refers to “percentage intended use” and “percentage actual use”. These terms are defined in the bill and those definitions incorporate the notion of “taxable use”. Any change would take the words in the provision outside of the defined terms and potentially cause more confusion. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 73 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GST AND INCOME TAX Clauses 25, 29 and 35 Submission (Russell McVeagh) That the clauses do not achieve their stated policy intent in every instance. Comment Officials agree that certain aspects of the clauses may make them difficult to apply in certain circumstances. Officials do not agree with all the suggested wording provided in paragraph 5.5 of the submission, but have worked with the submitter to produce revised drafting that should be universal in its application. Recommendation That the submission be accepted to the extent necessary to reflect the desired policy intent of the provisions. 74 75 Other remedial matters 76 77 FBT “ON PREMISES” EXEMPTION Clauses 28 and 89 Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA), Ernst & Young) The submissions agree that the wording change adequately reflects the policy intent of the exemption. However, they do not agree with the application date of 1 April 2005. Instead, the clauses should apply prospectively (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and Ernst & Young) or from 1 April 2010 (PricewaterhouseCoopers). NZICA also submitted that the amendment should have been referred to the Rewrite Advisory Panel. Comment Officials agree that retrospective legislation should not be introduced without strong justification, and competing considerations should always be balanced. The factors in favour of prospective application were as follows. • There is an underlying presumption that legislation should be prospective. • Taxpayers should be able to rely on the statutory language. • Inland Revenue is planning to dispute all cases where it considers abuse of the provision has taken place. If Inland Revenue were to win these disputes, this would have the same effect as retrospective legislation. The factors in favour of retrospective application were as follows. • The apparent law change was the result of a drafting error; it was not a policy change, and the Rewrite Advisory Panel did not indicate that a policy change was intended. • The policy intent behind the provision has always been well understood by taxpayers – which may be the reason that only a few taxpayers exploited the drafting change. • If Inland Revenue were to lose the disputes, there would be a fiscal cost associated with a drafting error. • A retrospective change would reduce administration and potential litigation costs. 78 • Making the change retrospective reduces incentives for taxpayers to take aggressive positions based on what they understand to be drafting errors. • Retrospective application arguably does not undermine the integrity of the tax system if it prevents taxpayers taking advantage of an obvious and unintended drafting error. With regard to the Rewrite Advisory Panel, officials do not consider this is an amendment wholly within the Panel’s terms of reference. An unrelated amendment to the relevant provision, effective from 2006, takes the provision outside of the transitional rules from that time. The known disputes on the relevant wording span periods post-2006. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 79 JOINT BANK ACCOUNTS Clauses 16, 86 and 105 Issue: Amendment should not proceed Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The ambit of section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should not be extended to joint bank accounts. Comment When a taxpayer fails to pay any income tax, interest or civil penalty, the Commissioner may issue a written notice under section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to any third party, for example a bank, requiring the third party to deduct and pay to the Commissioner funds from any amounts payable to the defaulting taxpayer. The deductions may be in the form of a lump sum or instalments. Section 157 is a critical tool in collecting unpaid tax debts. Currently, section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 does not refer to joint bank accounts. The courts have held that the Commissioner cannot issue a deduction notice to obtain funds from a joint account for an income tax debt owed by one of the joint bank account holders, because there is no authority to do so under section 157. 1 The High Court noted that the Social Security Act 1964 and the Child Support Act 1991 both contain deduction provisions that expressly refer to money held in joint bank accounts, whereas the Tax Administration Act 1994 does not. This raised an inference that a tax deduction provision like section 157 needed to contain an express reference to joint bank accounts for it to apply to such accounts. The Child Support Act 1991 allows the Commissioner to require deductions from money payable to a liable parent to meet a child support debt. This deduction power extends to money held in joint bank accounts in the name of the liable parent and one or more other persons, when the liable parent can draw from that account without the signature of the other person. The bill proposes to amend the provisions of some Inland Revenue Acts which allow deductions of tax from payments due to a defaulting taxpayer to allow the Commissioner to make deductions of tax from joint bank accounts. The amendments will allow deductions from a joint bank account if the defaulting taxpayer can make withdrawals from that account without the signature of the other person – in other words, they have unrestricted access to the funds in the account. The changes will ensure consistency of treatment for deductions from joint bank accounts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 1 ANZ Banking Group (New Zealand) Limited v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,643 80 Issue: Requiring consent of District Court Judge Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The deduction provisions contained in section 12L of the Gaming Duties Act 1971, section 43 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, and section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to require consent of a District Court Judge before the power can be exercised. Comment Since 1 July 2007 Inland Revenue has issued approximately 9000 deduction notices to banks. Requiring the consent of a District Court Judge would place a significant burden on the court system and also on Inland Revenue (in preparing the necessary documentation). It could also impede the collection of unpaid tax debts. In particular, if Inland Revenue becomes aware of a source of funds, it may need to move quickly. The funds could shift in the period it takes to get the consent of a District Court Judge. Although officials consider section 157 is crucial in collecting unpaid tax debts, it should not be used inappropriately. There are systems in place which allow for concerns to be addressed, for example, the Complaints Management Service. In the first case mentioned in the submission, the submitter informed Inland Revenue and money was refunded, allowing the issue to be addressed and preventing inappropriate consequences. These systems are preferable to adding a judicial consent requirement that is resource intensive and could unnecessarily impede the effectiveness of the provision. It is also a principle of administrative law that all public powers must be exercised in good faith. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 81 Issue: Application of provision to electronic transactions Submission (Matter raised by officials) It should be made clear that the amendments also apply to joint accounts which are accessed electronically. Comment As currently drafted, the amendments will allow deductions from a joint bank account if the defaulting taxpayer can make withdrawals from that account without the signature of the other person. Some joint accounts are accessed electronically and require two or more persons to authorise payments. The amendments should also apply to these accounts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 82 CAP ON SHORTFALL PENALTIES Clauses 84 Issue: Amendment should not proceed Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed express restriction to the $50,000 cap on certain shortfall penalties to voluntary disclosures made under section 141G of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be deleted and the $50,000 cap should expressly apply both in cases of voluntary disclosure and in cases when adequate disclosure has been made at the time of taking the tax position. (Ernst & Young) The proposal should not proceed. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment There are five shortfall penalties – not taking reasonable care (20%), unacceptable tax position (20%), gross carelessness (40%), abusive tax position (100%) and evasion or a similar act (150%). If a breach or default occurs, the relevant penalty is applied to the tax shortfall. Shortfall penalties can be reduced for different reasons. For example, under section 141G, a shortfall penalty is reduced by between 40% and 100% if the shortfall is voluntarily disclosed before the beginning of an audit. Under section 141H, a shortfall penalty for an unacceptable tax position or an abusive tax position is reduced by 75% if the taxpayer makes adequate disclosure of their tax position at the time they take that tax position. The unacceptable tax position penalty is imposed when the taxpayer’s tax position does not meet the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct”. The penalty is applied only to significant income tax shortfalls – more than $50,000 and 1% of the taxpayer’s total tax figure for the relevant period. An abusive tax position is an unacceptable tax position taken with a dominant purpose of avoiding tax. The shortfall penalty for an unacceptable tax position is intended as a signal to taxpayers who take a particular tax position in which there is a significant amount of tax at stake. It does not require that the treatment a taxpayer gives to a particular matter must be the better view, or must be more likely than not the correct treatment. Rather, it must be a position to which a court would give serious consideration but not necessarily agree with. The taxpayer’s argument should be sufficient to support a reasonable expectation that the taxpayer could succeed in court. 83 An aim of the shortfall penalty for an unacceptable tax position is to encourage taxpayers to get their tax position correct in terms of the law. This can be compared with the shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care, which applies to a more general set of actions. When looking at whether a tax position is acceptable or not, the subjective elements, such as the effort the taxpayer went to, are not considered. In relation to the penalty for not taking reasonable care, taxpayers can argue that reasonable care has been taken by simply using a tax agent. This is not the case with the penalty for an unacceptable tax position – the penalty applies if the tax position taken fails to meet the required standard, irrespective of whether the taxpayer has engaged a tax agent. The 75% reduction of the unacceptable tax position and abusive tax position shortfall penalties given for disclosures made at the time taxpayers take their tax positions reflects the complex nature of tax law, and not all taxpayers seek the certainty of a binding ruling when they are unsure of whether the position they are taking meets the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct. Under section 141JAA(1) a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care or an unacceptable tax position can be limited to $50,000 if the taxpayer voluntarily discloses their tax position, or the Commissioner determines the shortfall, no later than the date that is the later of – • the date that is three months after the due date of the return to which the shortfall relates; and • the date that follows the due date of the return to which the shortfall relates by the lesser of – – one return period; and – six months. This provision is aimed at ensuring that tax shortfalls which arise from the taxpayer not taking reasonable care or taking an unacceptable tax position and that are large in dollar terms, but which are speedily identified and corrected are not excessively penalised. For example, a business taxpayer under-calculates their GST outputs by $45 million and, because no systems were in place to identify this shortfall, the under-calculation results in unpaid GST of $5 million. When the GST return is filed, Inland Revenue quickly identifies the shortfall and determines that the shortfall arose because the taxpayer did not take reasonable care. Because Inland Revenue quickly identified the shortfall the cap applies and the penalty is $50,000. If the cap did not apply, the penalty would be $1,000,000. One of the reasons the cap was set at $50,000 was because that is the amount of the maximum criminal evasion penalty. In 2007 amendments were made to the voluntary disclosure provisions. When a taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure before being notified of an audit of a shortfall that arose from the taxpayer not taking reasonable care or taking an unacceptable tax position, the shortfall penalty is reduced by 100%. This amendment has led to an increase in voluntary disclosures being made. The number of disclosures of unacceptable tax positions made at the time the tax position is taken has fallen. 84 The cap is still relevant as it applies not only when the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure but also when the Commissioner identifies the shortfall within the time limit. It is not clear that the limit in section 141JAA applies only to voluntary disclosures (under section 141G) and not to disclosures made when the tax position is taken (under section 141H) – when taxpayers make disclosures at the time the tax position is taken they are aware that the position taken might not meet the required standard. It was never intended that the cap apply to disclosures made at the time the tax position is taken. If it applied to these disclosures, taxpayers could take tax positions that did not meet the standard of being “about as likely as not to be correct” (unacceptable tax position) knowing the maximum penalty they would face would be $50,000. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 85 AMENDMENTS TO THE PIE RULES Clauses 42, 51 and 91 Issue: Interaction between new and existing timing rules Submission (KPMG) It is not clear how the new sections HM 35B and HL 19B of the Income Tax Act 2007, introduced in the bill, are intended to interact with existing sections EG 3 (which applied prior to 1 April 2010) and HM 35(8) (which has applied since 1 April 2010). It also appears that a timing rule for tax credits that was in section EG 3 has not been transferred to the post-rewrite version of the portfolio investment entity (PIE) rules. Comment The provisions introduced in the bill, sections HL 19B and HM 35B, are designed to supplement the existing timing provisions in sections EG 3 and HM 35(8). The existing provisions stated that a PIE should allocate income and deductions to when they were reflected in its unit price (or its financial accounts, if the PIE did not calculate a unit price). However, it is unclear whether these provisions allow a PIE to allocate future income or deductions in this way. The new provisions are designed to clarify that a PIE should allocate income and deductions to when they are reflected in its unit price, even if the income or deductions have yet to be incurred or derived. The existing timing rule still applies, but the new provisions clarify that future amounts can also be taken into account. The issue of the tax credit timing rule has been raised as a rewrite amendment item and is addressed in the other remedial matters section of this report. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 86 Issue: Definition of “land investment company” Submission (KPMG) The definition of “land investment company” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to accommodate intra-group financing between land investment companies and PIEs in the same tax group. Comment This submission is not directly related to any items in the bill. The PIE rules do not prevent these intra-group financing arrangements for listed PIEs, for which these arrangements are most practical. Finally, this specific issue generally arises in international transactions involving debt-financed investment, which raises some concerns that need to be carefully considered before any amendments to the rules are made. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Investor interest requirements Submissions (AMP Capital Investors, Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Amendments are required to allow certain widely held investors to hold an unlimited investment in a listed PIE. There does not appear to be any sound policy rationale for the current distinction, whereby such investors are not allowed to hold interests of more than 40% in a listed PIE but may hold unlimited interests in unlisted PIE entities. This change should be effective from the commencement of the PIE rules on 1 October 2007. The application of the “public unit trust” rules to maximum investors’ interests in PIEs should permit non-widely held investors to hold an interest of up to 25% in a listed PIE. There is currently a five-year stand-down period that prevents an entity from becoming a PIE after losing PIE status. This stand-down period should not apply if an entity’s loss of PIE status was due to it not meeting the maximum investors’ interest requirements. Provisions should be introduced to protect the tax position of investors if their presumed investment in a PIE changes due to the loss of PIE status by the entity in which they invested. 87 Comment These submissions do not relate to the bill as introduced. Rather, they relate to the eligibility requirements under the PIE rules. As a general principle, a PIE should be widely held. Therefore, the rules state that no single investor can hold more than 20% of a PIE. • For unlisted PIEs, the 20% threshold does not apply if the investor itself is a widely held entity. This means that a PIE is able to own 100% of an unlisted PIE, allowing retail PIEs to invest in wholesale PIEs. In policy terms, it makes sense to waive the 20% threshold in these circumstances because, looking through to the ultimate investors, the PIE is still widely held. • For listed PIEs, the 20% threshold is increased to only 40% for investors that are themselves widely held. At the time the rules were introduced, it was considered unlikely that a listed PIE would act as a wholesale fund. Increasing the threshold to 40% was therefore considered sufficient. However, officials do not have any policy objection to allowing a widely held investor to hold 100% of a listed PIE. The background to these submissions is that a specific entity has been trading as a listed PIE when it fact it has failed to satisfy the eligibility criteria because the stake held in that entity by one of its investors exceeded the 40% threshold. The breach of this threshold was only recently identified by the entity in question. While the breach has no direct impact on the entity’s own tax affairs, it impacts its investors. Retail investors on higher marginal tax rates become liable to pay top-up tax on distributions, which are treated as dividends from an ordinary company as opposed to exempt PIE distributions. Certain wholesale investors become liable for tax in relation to redemptions of their interests, which for tax purposes are again treated as taxable dividends. In addition, at least one wholesale investor into the entity will itself lose PIE status as a result of the entity not being a PIE: this is because of rules that limit the investments a PIE can hold in a non-PIE entity (under section HL 10 or HM 13). The consequential loss of PIE status for this investor will, in turn, impact on its own members. The impacts for investors affect current and previous tax years. As noted above, officials agree with the first submission: that there is no strong policy rationale for allowing a widely held investor to hold only 40% of a listed PIE. It is the entity’s breach of this threshold that has caused it to lose PIE status. Accordingly, we support the proposal that a widely held investor should be able to hold up to 100% of a listed PIE. This would bring the treatment of listed PIEs into line with the treatment of unlisted PIEs in this regard. Given the real downstream consequences for investors into the entity, who acted in the belief that the entity in question was a PIE, we also support the proposal to make this change retrospective from the commencement of the PIE rules on 1 October 2007. 88 If these proposals are accepted, then the changes proposed in the three other submissions are not necessary and officials do not support them. • The decision to limit the application of the “public unit trust” concession to exclude the paragraph that would allow non-widely held investors to hold an interest of up to 25% in a listed PIE was a conscious one made at the time the PIE rules were introduced. Officials consider that neither the submissions nor the particular circumstances outlined above raise new issues that warrant that decision being revisited at this time. • Provided that the threshold for widely held investors holding interests in listed PIEs is retrospectively increased to 100% (as in the first submission), it is not necessary to provide any exemption from the five-year stand-down period in order to deal with the particular case referred to above. Officials do not consider that the submissions make the case for a general relaxation of the stand-down period, which helps to maintain the integrity of the PIE regime. • Likewise, if the first submission is accepted, then amendments to protect the tax position of investors into the entity concerned are not necessary. Officials would generally be cautious about making such changes, again because of the implications for the integrity of the PIE regime. Recommendation That the investors’ interest requirements for PIEs be amended to allow a widely held investor to hold up to 100% of a listed PIE, and that this change apply retrospectively from the commencement of the PIE rules. 89 TAXATION OF GENERAL INSURANCE BUSINESS – TREATMENT OF EXPECTED REINSURANCE AND RECOVERIES Issue: Discounting expected reinsurance and recovery amounts Submission (Insurance Council of New Zealand) Change is needed to the Income Tax Act 2007 to require amounts that insurers expect to receive from third parties, by way of reinsurance or directly from those parties, to be discounted. These amounts affect the calculation of deductions for movements in an insurer’s outstanding claims reserve (OCR) allowed under section DW 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The change should have retrospective effect so that the tax treatment of these amounts aligns with when a taxpayer adopts International Financial Reporting Standard 4: Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4). Comment The Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 clarified that movements in a general insurer’s OCR, as determined by applying IFRS 4, are deductible. The rules allow a deduction for claims paid in an income year and for the movement in the OCR between the beginning and the end of the year. The OCR is the amount an insurance company sets aside which, when invested, will provide sufficient funds to cover the liabilities for outstanding claims in the future. The value of these claims is estimated, as either they have been reported but not paid at balance date, or an insured event has occurred but the insurer has not been notified about the claim by its balance date. The amount of expected future payments is discounted to reflect present value. Estimates relating to reinsurance recoveries and non-reinsurance recoveries reduce the amount that can otherwise be deducted in connection with claims and movements in the OCR. For financial reporting purposes these amounts are treated as income and are discounted. For taxation purposes, these amounts are not discounted and therefore reduce the amount that is otherwise deductible under section DW 4. The current rules therefore create a mismatch by overstating amounts connected with reinsurance and recoveries when compared to the discounting valuation rules that apply to claims estimates. 90 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. The change should apply from the first income year in which the taxpayer adopts IFRS 4 for financial reporting purposes. Issue: Determination E12 Submission (Insurance Council of New Zealand) Paragraph (w) of Determination E12 should be removed as it is now superfluous following the enactment of section DW 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Comment While the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 clarified that movements in a general insurer’s outstanding claims reserve are deductible, the rule applies only to taxpayers that use IFRS 4. Officials note that there are taxpayers who have general insurance functions that do not use IFRS 4 as they are not required to prepare general purpose financial reports. Determination E12 deals with prepayments and provisions. Paragraph (w) is relevant for these taxpayers as it allows a deduction for provisions made for outstanding insurance claims, if the amount of the claim does not exceed $65,000 (excluding GST). Without this rule, the deduction only becomes available when the taxpayer settles (pays) the claim. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 91 TAXATION OF LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS Issue: Grandparenting reinsurance contracts sold before the start of the new taxation rules for life insurance Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers on behalf of Hanover Life Re, Munich Re, Gen Re, Swiss Re and RGA Re) The grandparenting rules, as they apply to life reinsurance treaties, need to be simplified. Comment The policy intent behind the grandparenting rules is to preserve the tax effect of the old rules for life business sold before the start of the new taxation rules for life insurance which started on 1 July 2010. However, to reduce compliance costs, life insurers were able to elect into the new rules before that date if they wanted to align the start date of the tax changes with the beginning of their financial reporting year. Reinsurance policies sold before the start of the life insurance taxation rules are intended to be grandparented to the extent that the life reinsurer can “look though” the policy to the underlying individual whose life was covered and if there is no material change to the life reinsurance policy or the amount of insurance cover. Discussions with a number of life reinsurers about the operation of the new taxation rules indicate that the current transitional rules do not reflect how life reinsurance products work, in terms of: • whether life reinsurers can in practical terms “look through” a life reinsurance policy to the underlying life policy and the individual whose life is insured; • whether life reinsurance policies can be grandparented when the underlying life policy is fully reinsured, thereby taking the seller of the underlying life policy outside the definition of “life insurer” in section EY 10; and • potential mismatches that are created. For example, a life insurer sells a life policy to an individual in March 2010. The cover under the policy is $595,000 in year one. In April 2010, the life insurer then reinsures the life risk for all policies that have a cover amount of up to $600,000. In year one, the life reinsurer has no risk exposure. In year two, the cover under the individual’s life policy rises by CPI to $601,000 and the life reinsurer becomes “on-risk” for the $1,000 above $600,000. The increase in the reinsurance cover from $0 to $1,000 would breach the grandparenting rules and the contract would not receive transitional relief. In this situation, the underlying life policy continues to be grandparented, but the reinsurance policy is not even though it was sold before 1 July 2010. 92 To deal with the problems life insurers have identified, officials consider the grandparenting rules for life reinsurance should be simplified. Transitional relief should apply to life reinsurance contracts in place before the start date of the new life insurance rules: • to the extent that the underlying life policy is: – grandparented (this assumes the life reinsurer is able to use the information provided to it by the cedant life insurer about the underlying life policy); or – would be grandparented if the seller of the life policy was a “life insurer”; and • if there are no material changes in the terms of the life reinsurance contract. This solution would allow the life reinsurer to grandparent existing reinsurance contracts to the extent that the underlying life policy is also grandparented. Representatives from the life reinsurance sector have confirmed that the proposal aligns with their current practices and systems. The changes should have effect from the date the new life insurance rules started: 1 July 2010 or an earlier income year that includes 1 July 2010. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Calculation of transitional relief under the grandparenting rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) The formula in section EY 30(8) of the Income Tax Act 2007, which is used to calculate the value of transitional relief allowed under the grandparenting rules, includes references to the rules about the outstanding claims reserve (section EY 24) and the capital guarantee reserve (section EY 27). Comment The rules for calculating the transitional relief available for grandparented life policies include references to the various rules that apply to reserves. Reference to the rules relating to the calculation of the outstanding claims reserve (OCR) and the capital guarantee reserve (CGR) are not relevant to the calculation because they are not premium-related reserves but could give rise to a higher deduction than would otherwise be available. References to the OCR and CGR rules should be removed from the calculation of transitional relief. We note that taxpayers have not yet filed their first returns and have not yet taken a tax position under the new rules. 93 The changes should have effect from the date the new life insurance rules started: 1 July 2010 or an earlier income year that includes 1 July 2010. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. References to sections EY 24 and EY 27 should be removed from section EY 30(8)(b). Issue: Definition of “profit participation policy” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The scope of the definition of “profit participation policy” should be narrowed to life insurance policies that provide a savings facility to individuals. Comment Profit participating life policies allow policyholders to participate in the distributions of profit and were once the most common product offered by life insurance companies. The current definition of “profit participation policy” in the Income Tax Act 2007 is broad and could include life reinsurance policies and group life policies with risk cover. Officials consider this outcome is inappropriate because such policies have the characteristics of pure risk policies and, unlike traditional profit participation policies, do not contain a savings component. Such life reinsurance policies and group life policies (life insurance policies that insure multiple lives under the one policy, for example, workplace policies) should be taxed under the non-participating rules (premiums less claims) with any profit participation features being treated as other income or expenditure. The changes should have effect from the date the new life insurance rules started: 1 July 2010 or an earlier income year that includes 1 July 2010. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. The definition of “profit participation policy” in section YA 1 should specifically exclude life insurance contracts that are “life reinsurance” and “multiple life polices” as defined in sections EY 12 and EY 30(14) respectively. 94 CARVE-OUT FROM “CFC ATTRIBUTABLE AMOUNT” FOR THIRD- PARTY ROYALTIES RECEIVED BY A LOWER-TIER CFC Submission (KPMG) Section EX 20B(5)(d) of the Income Tax Act 2007 needs clarification to ensure that it is consistent with the policy intention of the new CFC rules. In particular, royalty income derived by a lower-tier CFC from a non-associated third party should also be excluded from attributable CFC amount. Comment Officials have noted the issue raised by the submission and agree in principle with the point made by the submitter. Officials consider, however, that the change would be more appropriately included with other legislative amendments to be made to the international tax rules later this year, rather than put in this bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 95 APPROVED ISSUER LEVY Clauses 79, 102 and 103 Issue: Application date Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The amendments to the rules for approved issuer levy (AIL) should apply retrospectively so that taxpayers that have applied the pre-clarified law are not subject to the risk of penalisation by Inland Revenue. Alternatively, Inland Revenue could provide comfort in a future Tax Information Bulletin, or in the Officials’ Report on the bill, that it will not pursue the matter if a taxpayer has paid AIL prior to 1 August 2010 (the application date for the amendments). Comment The bill makes technical changes to the rules for approved issuer levy, to ensure a better fit between domestic and treaty laws. The amendments are intended to make existing law more transparent, rather than to substantively alter its effect. The submitter is concerned that, unless the changes apply retrospectively, a taxpayer that has paid AIL prior to 1 August 2010 in order to qualify for a treaty exemption for interest paid to a foreign bank may risk penalisation. The relevant scenario involves interest payments to a foreign bank with a branch in New Zealand. In this case, the NRWT rules do not apply and the AIL regime is therefore not relevant domestically. Provided the interest is not connected with the New Zealand branch, the interest may still qualify for an exemption under a double tax agreement. The availability of this exemption depends on the borrower paying AIL – but only if the borrower is eligible to elect to pay AIL. We consider that the borrower in this scenario is eligible, under existing law, to elect to pay AIL for the purposes of qualifying the interest for a treaty exemption. The bill clarifies this. We see no risk for a taxpayer that has relied on this interpretation of the law prior to the clarification taking effect. The treaty requires that, if a borrower is eligible to pay AIL, then the levy must be paid for the exemption to apply. This is not the same as the exemption being contingent on the borrower’s eligibility to elect to pay AIL. As long as the borrower has paid AIL and the other requirements for the exemption are satisfied, we see no basis on which the exemption would be denied. There are no penalties for paying AIL in circumstances where this is not relevant for the purposes of the domestic NRWT rules. Recommendations That the application date of 1 August 2010 not be changed and that the foregoing analysis be reflected in a subsequent Tax Information Bulletin. 96 Issue: Related proposals Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Interest paid by a New Zealand borrower to a foreign bank in respect of property situated offshore should not have a New Zealand source, provided the interest is not connected with a New Zealand branch of the foreign bank. (The result would be to exempt the interest from the NRWT/AIL rules.) Alternatively, certain practical changes should be made to the AIL regime: the non- resident bank should be able to register and pay AIL on behalf of the borrower; either the bank or the borrower should be able to register to pay AIL retrospectively; and it should be possible to pay AIL on an annual basis (rather than monthly). Comment Whereas the bill makes only limited technical changes to the AIL rules to clarify the relationship between domestic and treaty laws, these proposals would involve substantive changes to the scope of the tax base and the way the AIL regime operates. The submission notes that these proposals are outside the scope of the current bill and indicates that the submitter would be happy to discuss them separately with officials. Recommendation That officials meet with the Corporate Taxpayers Group to discuss wider policy issues related to NRWT/AIL on interest, with any further legislative changes being a matter for a later bill. 97 AUCKLAND COUNCIL RESTRUCTURING AMENDMENT Clause 106 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 106(20) of the bill should be amended to include a reference to section 19B of the Local Government (Tamaki Makaurau Reorganisation) Act 2009. Comment This amendment will ensure that the new Waterfront Development Agency which is established pursuant to an Order in Council made under section 19B of the Local Government (Tamaki Makaurau Reorganisation) Act 2009 is also covered by the proposed tax amendment. Therefore, like other new council-controlled organisations, the new Waterfront Development Agency would not be entitled to a deduction for the principal amount of the debt (that was transferred as part of the restructuring), but will still be entitled to an interest deduction. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 98 EMISSIONS TRADING PROVISIONS Clauses 22, 34 and 74(4) Issue: Conversion of New Zealand Unit to Kyoto unit Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) There is no provision which allows a deduction when a New Zealand Unit is converted to a Kyoto unit, which may result in the same unit being taxed twice. Comment The Climate Change Response Act 2002 includes provisions enabling a holder of a New Zealand Unit (NZU) to convert it to an Assigned Amount Unit (AAU), which they might want to do if they want to sell the unit outside New Zealand. The submitter points out that an Income Tax Act 2007 provision provides that, when such a conversion is made, the NZU is treated as being disposed of for market value. The submitter is concerned that no provision provides a contemporaneous deduction for the acquisition of the AAU. If this were correct, it would mean that a person who then sold that AAU would be taxed twice: once on the conversion of the NZU to the AAU and then again on the sale of the unit. Officials consider that a deduction is available for the cost of the AAU. Emissions units (which include AAUs) are included within the definition of revenue account property in section YA 1. Section DB 23 of the Income Tax Act provides that a person is allowed a deduction for expenditure they incur as the cost of revenue account property. In this instance, the expenditure incurred by the person is the transfer of the NZU to the registry, and the amount of that expenditure is defined by income tax legislation as the market value of the NZU. Officials are therefore comfortable that no double taxation can arise here. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 99 Issue: Deductibility of underlying emissions obligations when free units are awarded Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The legislation should include a specific provision stating that the amount of the deduction which arises for an ETS obligation should be calculated by reference to the assessable income arising from the surrender or valuation of those units. Comment The following two examples explain the two circumstances in which a business may have an emissions obligation and be holding units awarded by the Government. In the first situation, at the end of the income year the business has accrued a liability to surrender emissions units, which it has not yet satisfied by the transfer of units. At the end of the income year, it will need to value the liability at its best estimate, which (assuming it holds no units) will be the market value of an emissions unit on balance date. Assume the business later receives free emissions units, and uses them to meet its surrender obligation. This will be taxed as a disposal of the units at market value (in order to recognise for tax purposes the free unit awarded). However, if the market value of the units when surrendered is different from the market value of units used to work out the original deduction, an adjustment will be made. In the second situation, the end of the emissions year occurs part-way through the income year, and the liability is met by the surrender of free (zero-value) emissions units, also during the course of the income year. Income will arise on the transfer of the free units equivalent to the market value of units on that date. The deduction for the liability will also be calculated by reference to the value of units surrendered, so no mismatch will arise. If instead the surrendered units were those which had previously been valued, the deduction would be calculated by reference to that previously-calculated value. Accordingly, officials do not consider that any mismatch can arise. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 100 Issue: Application of accounting treatment for tax purposes Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) It would be desirable in the future to align the tax treatment of emissions unit transactions with the accounting treatment. The development of accounting standards should be monitored so that this alignment can be made in the future. Comment Businesses incur compliance costs in accounting for emissions units transactions for both tax and financial reporting purposes. If the tax and accounting treatments could be aligned, businesses’ compliance costs could be reduced. The submitter suggests that such alignment will need to be deferred until accounting standards relating to emissions transactions and government grants are finalised. Officials agree with this submission. It would be highly desirable from a compliance perspective to align tax treatment and accounting treatment. However, the accounting treatment is not yet sufficiently certain for officials to be confident that alignment ought to be allowed at this stage. Officials will continue to monitor the development of accounting standards, with a view to allowing businesses to apply accounting rules for tax when they are confident that this will lead to appropriate outcomes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 101 Issue: Income tax treatment of certain emissions units received by NGA parties Submission (Matter raised officials) The new rules for the recognition of income from the transfer of units by the Government to certain industrial and agricultural businesses should also be extended to emissions units transferred to Negotiated Greenhouse Agreement (NGA) participants to compensate them for the increased cost of their inputs. Comment Provisions in the bill deal with the income tax treatment of the transfers to industrial and agricultural businesses under the Climate Change Response Act 2002 (CCRA). It provides that the amount of income arising is determined by the business’ entitlement under the CCRA, and values an appropriate number of the units transferred at market value. NGAs were entered into between the Government and two industrial emitters in 2003 and 2005, prior to the introduction of the ETS. In order to meet its obligations under those original agreements, the Crown is in the process of entering into side agreements with these parties under which they will be transferred emissions units. These transfers will be on a similar basis to the transfers which are made under the CCRA to certain industrial and agricultural businesses. The income tax treatment of these transfers is governed by ordinary law, which is unclear and will certainly give a different result to the statutory rules in the bill. There is no conceptual difference between the CCRA transfers and the NGA transfers, so officials consider that the new rules in the bill which apply to the CCRA transfers should also be extended to the NGA transfers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 102 Issue: Minor technical issues The following matters are proposed by officials to deal with minor issues which have arisen in the tax legislation dealing with emissions trading. Correction of drafting error in CB 36(7) Officials submit that a drafting error in the amendments proposed to section CB 36(7) in the bill be corrected. An amendment is proposed to make it clear that the provision applies when an emissions unit is transferred to a person by the Government. Capital account treatment of units allocated to owners of fishing quota Officials submit that an amendment to section ED 1(7B) should be made to make it clear that where an emissions unit is allocated to a person who holds fishing quota on capital account, that unit has a value of zero at the end of the income year. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 103 EXTENSION OF THE RWT DEADLINE Submission (FNZ) FNZ is one of a number of firms in New Zealand that provide investment administration services for their clients. These services include withholding resident withholding tax (RWT) on interest income received on behalf of clients and performing portfolio investment entity (PIE) tax calculations for clients’ PIE investments and returning PIE tax to Inland Revenue. Firms performing these functions for clients are often known as “wrap account” providers. An important aspect of these functions is providing information to investors concerning the amount of interest and PIE income earned and the amount of tax that has been deducted. This enables investors to complete their end-of-year tax returns. It is efficient for wrap account providers to provide this information in a consolidated form to investors. Currently the Tax Administration Act requires that RWT information for a tax year is provided by the 20 th of May following the end of the relevant tax year. FNZ submits that this deadline should be extended to 15 June or, at a minimum, 31 May. This would provide more time for wrap account providers to consolidate the RWT information with PIE information – which may be provided by the PIE to the wrap account provider on or close to the current 20 May deadline for providing investors with RWT information. Comment Officials consider that the submission illustrates the need for the various legislative deadlines for providing RWT and PIE information to be reviewed in order to provide greater coherence. We do not recommend that the specific change suggested by FNZ should be made independently of such a review. Recommendation That the submission be noted and considered again when a comprehensive review of the deadlines for providing RWT and PIE information is conducted. 104 KIWISAVER Issue: Transfer from complying superannuation fund to KiwiSaver scheme Submission (Matter raised by officials) A person over the New Zealand Superannuation qualification age should not be entitled to the initial Crown contribution (the kick-start) if they transfer from a complying superannuation fund to join KiwiSaver for the first time. Comment The KiwiSaver Act 2006 contains rules that prevent persons over the age of entitlement to New Zealand Superannuation from joining KiwiSaver. They are not enrolled via the automatic enrolment rules when starting new employment, nor can they opt in directly. Thus they cannot receive the initial Crown contribution (the $1,000 kick-start payment). But members of a complying superannuation fund may choose to transfer to a KiwiSaver scheme, including those over the New Zealand superannuation age. Also, members of a complying superannuation fund may be involuntarily transferred into KiwiSaver at any age, for example if the Government Actuary revokes approval of their existing fund. To maintain equity with those who are not members of complying schemes, when a person who is over the New Zealand superannuation age transfers from a complying superannuation fund into KiwiSaver for the first time, they should not be entitled to the kick-start payment. These amendments are remedial in nature and consistent with the policy intent of KiwiSaver. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 105 Issue: Repayment of a member’s tax credits following permanent emigration to Australia by member of a complying superannuation fund Submission (Matter raised by officials) A member of a New Zealand complying superannuation fund which is not a KiwiSaver fund can apply to withdraw their funds, less any Government tax credits, following their permanent emigration to Australia. The New Zealand provider should return the amount of the member tax credit to the Government. Comment The Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 introduced new rules to allow a person who has retirement savings in both Australia and New Zealand to consolidate them in one account in their current country of residence. KiwiSaver members transferring their retirement savings to Australia will be able to transfer accumulated member tax credits. However, at present, the ability to transfer these tax credits does not apply to complying superannuation schemes in New Zealand that are not KiwiSaver schemes; instead, the provider must return the amount of the member tax credit to the Government. However, one of the amendments in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act means that the legislation governing the providers’ return of the tax credit to the Government no longer covers situations where a member of a complying superannuation fund emigrates permanently to Australia. This was an unintended change. The proposed amendment is remedial in nature, to ensure consistency with the policy intent of KiwiSaver. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 106 Issue: Use of KiwiSaver first home withdrawal facility to purchase a “leasehold estate” Submission (Matter raised by officials) A KiwiSaver member who is eligible for the first home withdrawal facility can withdraw their accumulated savings to purchase their first home. The property or “estate” they purchase should include a “leasehold estate”. Comment The Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 altered the eligibility criteria for the first home withdrawal, by removing “leasehold estate” from the definition of the word “estate” in clause 8(6) schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. The change was intended to allow a KiwiSaver member who had previously been party to a leasehold residential tenancy, to meet the eligibility criteria for the first home withdrawal facility. The member could then withdraw their accumulated savings, less the one-off $1,000 Crown contribution and any member tax credits, to use for the purchase of their first home. Officials have since noticed that the amendment means that the legislation now precludes a member who is purchasing a leasehold estate from accessing the first home withdrawal facility. This effect was not intended. The proposed amendment is remedial in nature and is consistent with the policy intent of KiwiSaver. The amendment will apply from 1 July 2010. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 107 REWRITE AMENDMENTS Clauses 76 and 93 Issue: Low-interest loans to shareholder-employees and backdating of income not subject to withholding of taxation at source Submission (BDO and New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If the policy intention of the low-interest loan backdated repayment rules is to permit shareholder-employees to retrospectively reduce the balance of low- or nil-interest loans by applying their own funds, the backdating rules should not depend on whether withholding tax is withheld from a payment of a dividend, or whether a dividend is fully imputed. Comment The amendments in clauses 76 and 93 are in response to a recommendation of the Rewrite Advisory Panel that a minor drafting change in the repayment rules for low- or nil-interest loans from the Income Tax Act 1994 to the 2004 Act (and re-enacted in the 2007 Act) should be retained, despite the drafting change being an unintended change in legislation. (The term “gross income” in the 1994 Act was replaced by the term “income” in the 2004 Act.) The amendments confirm that drafting change as an intended change. However, the submissions relate to a matter that has been raised separately with the Minister of Revenue. NZICA and officials have agreed on a process to progress this matter, which incorporates a wider set of policy issues. Officials understand that BDO are aware of this agreed process, which includes the point raised in submission. As the submissions are beyond the scope of the rewrite amendments, and relate to a wider policy problem, officials recommend that the submissions should be addressed within the agreed policy process for those issues. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 108 Issue: PIE rules Submission (Matters raised by officials) That the following rewritten provisions of the PIE rules be amended to correct minor drafting errors arising on the rewrite of these provisions, so as to correctly reflect their corresponding provisions in subpart HL of the Income Tax Act 2007. These amendments should apply from the beginning of the 2010–2011 income year. Comment These items are included on the list of minor maintenance items under the processes adopted by the Rewrite Advisory Panel. Definition of investor class Section HM 5(4) should be amended to correctly reflect the outcome in the corresponding provision, section HL 5B(3) of the 2007 Act: that both paragraphs (a) and (b) must be satisfied before an investor is entitled to the benefit of the relief under this provision. Definition of foreign PIE equivalent Section HM 3(e) should be amended to correctly reflect the outcome in the corresponding provision, section HL 5(d). The amendment is that for a foreign investment vehicle to be considered a foreign PIE equivalent, the investor size requirement of section HM 15 only needs to be met for New Zealand residents. The other requirements remain unchanged. PIE criteria – collective schemes Section HM 9 should be amended to correctly reflect the pre-rewrite position: that trustees of a group investment fund in relation to category B income can elect to be a multi-rate PIE. Recognition of tax credits Section HM 35 should be amended to correctly reflect the corresponding provisions of section EG 3, so that: • tax credits received by the PIE are taken into account in determining the amount “assessable income” in the formula in subsection (3); and • tax credits are apportioned on the same basis as the income is apportioned under subsection (8). 109 Cross reference to “portfolio tax rate entity” In section IC 3(1), the term “portfolio tax rate entity” should be replaced by the term “multi-rate PIE” consequential on the rewrite of the PIE rules. Non-resident withholding tax The cross-reference in section RF 2(2) to section CX 56C should be replaced by a cross-reference to sections CX 56B and 56C to correctly reflect the provisions of NG 1(2)(f) of the 2004 Act. Definition of “land investment company” The definition of “land investment company” in section YA 1 is the rewritten definition of portfolio land company. The following minor drafting errors in the definition of land investment company should be corrected to correctly reflect its pre-rewrite meaning. • Paragraphs (a) and (b) should be conjunctive (as per paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of portfolio land company). • In paragraph (b), the $100,000 market value threshold should be determined by whether the value is “more than or equal to” $100,000, instead of “more than” as currently drafted (as per paragraph (b) of the definition of portfolio land company). • In paragraph (b), the words “the market value” should be inserted between “90% of” and “that property” (as per paragraph (b)(ii) of the definition of portfolio land company). • The definition should be amended to clarify that a company (company A) will not be a land investment company if it invests in another land investment company which in turn invests back into company A (as per paragraph (b)(i) of the definition of portfolio land company). Tax Administration Act – portfolio investor allocated income In section 33A(1)(b)(xi) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the term “portfolio investor allocated income” should be amended to refer to “attributed PIE income” as a consequence of the rewrite of the PIE rules. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 110 Issue: Meaning of foreign income tax Submission (Matter raised by officials) That the meaning of foreign income tax for the purposes of the foreign tax credit rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 be amended to correctly reflect the corresponding provisions in the Income Tax Act 2004. This amendment should apply from the beginning of the 2008–2009 income year. Comment This item is included on the list of minor maintenance items under the processes adopted by the Rewrite Advisory Panel. Section YA 2(5) of the Income Tax Act 2007 should be amended to ensure that income tax of a foreign country includes income tax imposed by a state or local government, as well as income tax imposed by a central government. This would reinstate the explicit reference to tax imposed by a central, state or local government that was contained in section OB 6(1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 2004. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.
Regulatory Impact Statement Gift duty repeal AGENCY DISCLOSURE STATEMENT This regulatory impact statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It is relatively detailed since it deals with the potential repeal of gifi duty, which may have implications for a number of government agencies. Specifically, the statement provides an analysis of the tax and non-tax benefits and administrative and compliance costs of gift duty. It considers whether there are existing alternative measures to provide creditor protection and social assistance and whether any new measures could fulfil this role. A cross-governmental approach has been taken to the review project, including extensive consultation with a wide range of government agencies (the Treasury, the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Health, New Zealand Police, the Ministry of Social Development and Housing New Zealand Corporation). None of the agencies are opposed to gifi duty repeal, provided that the effects are monitored and any necessary supporting work is camed out. Although there has been no general public consultation on the proposal since gifi duty repeal would largely benefit the private sector, we have discussed the review with professional and private bodies, such as the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and New Zealand Trustee Services Limited. In addition, as a result of the June 2010 announcement by the Minister of Revenue that repeal of gift duty was being considered, the Minister received a number of letters from the public and significant media coverage. These have been taken into account as part of the review. We recommend that gift duty be repealed on the basis of enhanced efficiency, simplicity and administrative costs and the significant reduction of private sector compliance costs (although fiscal cost is also a relevant consideration). We believe that gift duty does not fulfil its current objectives and the risks of its repeal are low. However, it is not possible to precisely determine the extent to which gift duty alleviates issues such as income tax minimisation, social assistance targeting and defeat of creditors. Therefore, it is important that affected government agencies monitor the effects of gift duty repeal on their areas and make any necessary operational changes. None of the policy options would impose additional costs on business or impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest o~override fundamental common law principles. Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 4 October 20 10 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. The principal original purpose of gift duty was to protect the estate duty base. Estate duty was repealed in New Zealand with effect from 1992. At that time, it was decided that gift duty would be retained temporarily until concerns regarding income tax avoidance and social assistance targeting could be addressed. Since then, gift duty has also come to be viewed as providing some protection to creditors. 2. Gift duty was most recently assessed by (The McLeod) Tax Review 2001. Repeal of gift duty was recommended by the Review, but the fiscal circumstances did not permit this at that time. The current review is the first to take place since 2001. 3. The current review began in response to frequent requests for legislative exemptions from gift duty and requests for the thresholds to be raised and administration to be modernised. The review considered narrowing the scope of gift duty so that it would apply only to gifts between individuals, trusts and closely-held companies; raising the thresholds at which gift duty applies; removing the need to file non-liable gift statements and providing for electronic filing and payment options. However, as the review progressed, a strong case for the outright repeal of gift duty emerged. 4. Officials have considered the implications of gift duty repeal for income tax, creditor protection, social assistance integrity and other identified areas. Some of the concerns which existed in 1992 have been addressed or reduced by the strengthening of existing legislative provisions. Remaining areas of concern have been scrutinised in consultation with the Ministry of Economic Development (MED), the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Health, New Zealand Police, the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and Housing New Zealand Corporation. None of these departments are opposed to gift duty repeal. 5. Treasury supports the repeal of gift duty as it is an inefficient instrument to provide limited creditor and means-testing protection, but considers that the relevant agencies should be required by Ministers to undertake any recommended work to support the repeal or to monitor whether additional measures might be needed following repeal. 6. Gift duty no longer raises any significant revenue and imposes a high level of compliance costs on the private sector. The protections offered by gift duty in the areas of income tax, creditors and social assistance have only ever been incidental rather than intended policy goals. The analysis undertaken has shown that the protection gift duty offers is indirect, inefficient and very limited. 7. Ultimately, the limited protection that gift duty offers does not outweigh the significant compliance costs that it imposes on the private sector. Officials therefore recommend that gift duty be repealed and the necessary legislation be included in the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill, planned for introduction in November 2010. To provide certainty for the private sector, it is recommended that repeal be effective from 1 October 2011. 8. Gift duty repeal is expected to reduce government revenue by $1 million a year and will provide administrative savings of $430,000 annually (this amount will be returned to the 3 Crown). The repeal is estimated to reduce compliance costs imposed on the private sector by $70 million each year. 9. Other projects are underway that seek to address some of the concerns associated with gift duty repeal. These include Inland Revenue’s debt project, Treasury and Inland Revenue’s social assistance integrity review and the Law Commission’s review of New Zealand trust law. STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM Background 10. Gift duty applies when the aggregate value of all gifts made by a person in a 12-month period exceeds $27,000. There are a number of exceptions, including for gifts to charitable organisations and small gifts to family members which are part of normal expenditure. 11. Gift duty has applied in New Zealand since 1885. The original purposes of gift duty were to protect the estate duty base (by discouraging the gifting of assets prior to death) and to raise revenue. When estate duty was abolished with effect from 1992, gift duty was retained as an interim measure to protect against income tax avoidance and social assistance targeting (T95/1991 refers). Since then, gift duty has also come to be viewed as providing some protection to creditors. 12. Gift duty was reviewed in 1996 and at that time officials recommended that gift duty be retained until work could be undertaken to limit tax avoidance opportunities (PAD 96/389, T96/3294 refers). 13. Subsequent to that report, the government-established but independent (McLeod) Tax Review 2001 recommended that gift duty be repealed on the basis that: - the original rationale of gift duty – to buttress estate duty – was no longer relevant; - gift duty raised only $1.6 million a year but involved significant compliance costs; and - the use of gifting programmes reduced gift duty’s effectiveness in preventing income splitting and avoidance of asset testing regimes. 14. The report stated that “it would seem more logical to... \[bring\] into welfare asset tests any assets transferred over the last half dozen years. This would seem to have the same effect as gift duty but with much lower compliance costs.” It also stated that it would be preferable to re-examine the trustee and top personal tax rates rather than retain gift duty due to income splitting concerns. The effectiveness of gift duty in protecting creditors would need to be assessed and alternative protection measures could be considered. 15. In response to the (McLeod) Tax Review 2001 recommendations, Ministers agreed that gift duty repeal would be considered when fiscal circumstances permitted (T2001/2075, PAD2001/334 refers). 16. The current review of gift duty is the first that has been undertaken since the (McLeod) Tax Review 2001. 4 Reasons for the review and decisions taken to date 17. In 2008–2009, a number of letters were received by Ministers and officials requesting legislative exemptions from gift duty. These requests were considered on a case-by-case basis and new exemptions contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Trans-Tasman Savings Portability, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 resulted. The ad-hoc approach with which these exemptions were granted led to concerns that the lack of a coherent framework for considering exemptions might give rise to undesirable inconsistencies and a lack of certainty for donors. 18. Instead of continuing to determine exemptions as requests arose, a review of gift duty was undertaken to consider whether there were general areas where gift duty was not performing a useful function and therefore could be removed from the gift duty scope. 19. There were (and are) frequent requests from the public to review the gift duty thresholds. The thresholds of $27,000 for non-dutiable gifts and $12,000 for the filing of gift statements were set in 1984 and have not been revised since. 20. In addition, administration of gift duty has become antiquated, with no provision for the electronic filing of gift statements or any form of payment other than by cheque. Further, the valuation of annuities for the purposes of gifts under the Estate and Gift Duties Act is set according to life expectancy data which is more than 25 years out of date. 21. In September 2009, officials commenced work on a review of gift duty, focusing on targeting its application (PAD2009/157 refers). At the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants Tax Conference on 16 October 2009, the Minister of Revenue announced that the Government would review gift duty and that consideration would be given to narrowing its scope. The gift duty thresholds and administration procedures were to be considered as part of this review. 22. As work on this review progressed, a strong case for repeal emerged. On 24 May 2010, Cabinet noted that a review of gift duty was underway, that a strong case for its repeal was emerging and that repeal and any necessary protection measures could be included in the November 2010 tax bill (CAB Min (10) 18/15 refers). With Cabinet’s approval, the Minister of Revenue announced on 10 June 2010 that consideration was being given to the repeal of gift duty, provided that concerns regarding creditor protection and social assistance targeting could be addressed. The Minister indicated that if gift duty were to be repealed, this change would be included in the November 2010 tax bill. The policy problem 23. In addition to the problems described above, which gave rise to the gift duty review, work done since the review began has revealed further policy concerns. 24. Gift duty no longer fulfils its original purpose of protecting the estate duty base and has raised minimal revenue, which has decreased in recent years, as shown in the following table. Year Amount of gift duty collected (revenue basis) 2009/10 $1,621,000 2008/09 $1,486,000 2007/08 $2,620,000 5 2006/07 $2,008,000 2005/06 $2,960,000 2004/05 $2,325,000 2003/04 $2,348,000 25. Gift duty is easy to avoid through the use of gifting programmes. Under a gifting programme, an asset is sold at market-value in exchange for an interest-free, on-demand loan for the value of the asset. Legal title to the asset instantly transfers, but no payment is made. The interest-free, on demand debt that the recipient of the asset owes to the donor is then progressively forgiven by the donor at a rate of $27,000 every twelve months. The forgiveness of the debt constitutes annual gifts; however they are within the accepted level so as not to attract gift duty. Until it is completely forgiven, the debt owed is legally an asset of the donor and the donor can demand that it be repaid. 26. These gifting programmes are widely used to transfer large assets without attracting gift duty. The fact that just 0.4% of gift statements received by Inland Revenue result in liability for payment of gift duty is clear evidence of the widespread use of these programmes. They are most often used by individuals to transfer ownership of their assets to a family trust. 27. The direct cost to Inland Revenue for administering gift duty is approximately $430,000 each year. The total cost is likely to be significantly higher. Inland Revenue is treated as a repository for gifting information by some 4,600 taxpayers who request their information each year. This data must be manually retrieved from hard-copy files held by Inland Revenue. 28. The cost to the private sector in complying with gift duty requirements is substantial. 225,000 compulsory gift duty statements are filed each year and it has been noted that just 0.4% of these statements correspond with liability to pay gift duty. Letters to Inland Revenue and Ministers indicate that gift duty liability is often the result of timing mistakes (where the $27,000 threshold for gifts is accidentally exceeded in any 12-month period). 29. Under standard gifting programmes to family trusts, a number of deeds are required that must be filed with Inland Revenue in addition to gift statements. Initially a deed of sale is required when the asset is transferred to a trust. Then a deed of acknowledgement of debt is drawn up, and annual deeds of forgiveness are required to reduce the outstanding debt. The average cost quoted by practitioners is $285 +GST to draw up the annual deed of forgiveness and to file this along with a gift statement. If this cost is grossed up to reflect the 225,000 gift statements filed each year, this reveals more than $70 million in annual costs to the private sector, excluding the initial costs of setting up the gifting programme (deed of sale and deed of acknowledgement of debt). 30. This is a high cost to retain a tax which no longer generates any significant revenue. In addition to raising minimal revenue, gift duty also appears to have little effect in reducing erosion of the tax base in other areas (this is discussed in greater detail below). Hence it appears that the principal arguments for gift duty retention are connected with altering non- tax related behaviours in the areas of social policy and debt repayment (although there is a question whether the tax system should address non-tax issues in this way). 31. By retaining gift duty for non-tax purposes, it has come to be perceived by some as a key way of protecting social assistance integrity and creditors. However, the protection offered by gift duty has only ever been incidental rather than an intended policy goal. The 6 analysis undertaken has shown that the protection gift duty offers is indirect, inefficient and very limited. The actual protection it offers should justify the extent of gift duty’s administrative and compliance costs. 32. Gift duty was retained after the repeal of estate duty as an interim measure to allow time for concerns to be addressed more directly. Changes have since been made that address some of the concerns, including abolition of income-testing for New Zealand Superannuation, alignment of the top personal and trustee income tax rates from 1 October 2010 and the strengthening of legislative provisions in other areas. 33. It could be argued that gift duty should be retained until all of the concerns that gift duty may mitigate are resolved. However, they might never be completely eliminated. The level of protection offered by gift duty has been overestimated and there is possibly less motivation for the core concerns to be addressed across government while gift duty is thought to be providing comfort. OBJECTIVES 34. The objectives of the gift duty review were to: - improve and reduce the extent of regulation; - minimise compliance costs for the private sector; - minimise administration costs for Inland Revenue; - ensure that the benefits of the gift duty rules outweigh the associated compliance and administration costs; - eliminate/reduce the need for exemptions; - provide certainty; and - ensure that the gift duty rules are up to date (including gift duty thresholds and life expectancy data used to value annuities). REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 35. A number of different options have been considered to address the objectives of the review. Option 1: Narrow the scope of gift duty 36. The Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (the EGDA) applies to all gifts which are not specifically exempted. This means that gift duty may impose compliance costs where there is no need for protection. One approach which has been considered is to narrow the ambit of gift duty so that it applies only to transfers of property between entities where gift duty performs a useful function. 37. Concerns regarding income tax minimisation, social assistance targeting and defeating creditors largely relate to gifts between individuals and family trusts, and sometimes also involve closely-held companies. Therefore, the application of gift duty could be narrowed so that it only applies to gifts between these entity types. This approach would reduce the need for exemptions, provide greater certainty and would maintain gift duty’s existing role in preventing income tax reduction, social assistance targeting and defeating creditors. Life 7 expectancy tables and gift duty thresholds could be updated at the same time as changes to narrow the gift duty scope. 38. Closer analysis of this option revealed that the majority of gifts are made between individuals and family trusts, with some also involving closely-held companies. Therefore narrowing the scope of gift duty to apply exclusively to these entity types could not be expected to make a significant difference to existing compliance and administration costs. Only gifts between widely-held companies (which are generally not considered to be subject to gift duty because they tend to involve commercial benefit) and any other kind of gift with a charitable nature that has not been accounted for in the existing exemptions would be removed from the gift duty net. Given that the gift duty basis would remain much the same; this option would have insignificant fiscal implications and no real impact on the economic efficiency of the gift duty regime. 39. Further consideration of this option also began to reveal that the extent to which gift duty actually offers protection against general tax avoidance, social assistance targeting and defeat of creditors had been over-estimated. If gift duty is no longer performing any significant function, or if better or more efficient protection could be provided through alternative measures, then repeal should be considered in preference to targeting of the existing rules, given the significant compliance costs gift duty imposes. Option 2: Raise the threshold at which gift duty applies 40. The current threshold of $27,000 per annum was fixed in 1984 and has not been revised since. Ministers and officials receive frequent requests for the threshold to be reviewed on the basis that it has not kept pace with inflation. 41. Any increase in the level at which gift duty becomes payable would also require consideration of the other thresholds at which the rate of gift duty increases. In order to circumvent the need to regularly amend the law to keep pace with inflation, the gift duty thresholds could be inflation-indexed. 42. If the gift duty threshold of $27,000 in 1984 is adjusted in accordance with inflation, in today’s terms it would be $78,291. Raising the gift duty threshold to this level would reduce compliance and administrative costs because a smaller number of individual gifts would be required to transfer assets and therefore fewer deeds and gift statements would be required. However, the fiscal implications (compared to repeal) are likely to be insignificant given that a significant proportion of the revenue from gift duty is thought to result from timing mistakes. This option could be combined with option 1, updating life expectancy tables and removing the need to file non-liable gift statements in order to also meet some of the other objectives of the gift duty review. 43. In 1968, the gift duty threshold was $4,000. It was raised to $8,000 in 1976 (roughly matching inflation). However, it was subsequently raised to $15,000 in 1979 and to $27,000 in 1984 – faster than it if it had been inflation-indexed. The threshold in 1984 was therefore considered to be high. 44. Most significantly, in 1984 the objective of gift duty was to protect against the circumvention of the estate duty rules, not to prevent mischief in relation to income tax, social assistance or creditors. Raising the threshold to $78,291 would significantly dilute gift duty’s protective effect against these forms of targeted gifting by speeding up the rate at which assets may be transferred. For example, a couple with a property valued at $300,000 could sell it to their family trust for the full market rate and then each could forgive $78,291 of this debt 8 annually – therefore it would take just two years instead of six to transfer the asset. If the key benefit of gift duty – the slowing down of gifting – is diluted to such an extent, it is questionable whether there is any point in retaining it. Further, this option does not address the underlying policy problem of gift duty’s relative ineffectiveness at protecting against income- tax minimisation, defeat of creditors and social assistance targeting. Option 3: Remove the need to file gift statements for non-liable gifts 45. Another option (which could also be considered in addition to one or more of options 1, 2 and 4), is to remove the requirement to file gift statements for non-liable gifts. Under the current rules, any gifts over the value of $12,000 require the donor to deliver a gift duty statement to Inland Revenue along with any associated trust deeds within three months. 46. It has been mentioned already that of the 225,000 compulsory gift duty statements which are filed each year, just 0.4% of these correspond with liability to pay gift duty. Removing the need to file statements for gifts valued between $12,000 and $27,000 would therefore reduce annual gift statements by 99.6%. This would reduce administrative costs and also compliance costs associated with preparing gift statements. Any fiscal implications would be insignificant as the gift duty base would not change. 47. The most significant part of compliance costs is not completion of gift statements – rather, it is the annual drawing up of deeds of forgiveness which require engagement of a legal practitioner. If gift duty continues to apply to gifts over a particular threshold, gifting programmes including annual deeds will still be required in order to gift large assets without becoming liable for gift duty. This option does not address the core policy concern that gift duty is no longer performing a significant, useful function, therefore it goes just a small way towards meeting the objectives of the gift duty review. Option 4: Moving to electronic systems 48. Currently, Inland Revenue systems only allow for the payment of gift duty by cheque. If an electronic or cash payment is received, it must be manually converted to a cheque and re-banked. Aside from the compliance costs of requiring cheques from taxpayers, it is clearly administratively inefficient for Inland Revenue. Therefore work by Inland Revenue to facilitate electronic payments would reduce compliance and administrative costs. 49. Gift duty statements must also be filed with and stored by Inland Revenue in hard- copy format. Inland Revenue is treated as a repository for gifting information by some 4,600 taxpayers who request the manual retrieval of their information each year. Compliance and administrative costs could therefore be further reduced by moving to electronic filing and storage of gift duty statements. Because the EGDA requires that the original deed is filed along with the gift duty statement (which is then photocopied and returned by post), a legislative change may be required in order to permit electronic copies. 50. Reduced compliance costs resulting from electronic systems may have a positive impact on overall compliance levels. The fiscal impacts of this option are likely to be insignificant, because letters to Ministers and Inland Revenue and advice from practitioners indicate that gift duty liability generally occurs as a result of timing mistakes or when finalising a gifting programme. 51. The financial outlay required to upgrade systems is expected to cost within the range of $1–7 million. This estimate is based on maintaining the current gift duty thresholds. This significant cost would only be justified if gift duty is assessed as fulfilling a useful function 9 and is likely to be retained for the foreseeable future. Once again, this option does not meet the review’s key objective of ensuring that the benefits of the gift duty rules outweigh the associated compliance and administration costs, because the protection provided by gift duty to the income tax base, creditors and social assistance targeting has been assessed as very low. Option 5: Repeal gift duty Fiscal implications 52. Gift duty repeal would be expected to reduce government revenue by $1 million a year as per the following table: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 & out years Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue - (0.750) (1) (1) (1) 53. In addition to the above cost, the repeal of gift duty is likely to have insignificant fiscal implications for tax collections, benefits entitlements, recovery of the proceeds from crime and state housing. The repeal of gift duty will not have any fiscal implications for the Residential Care Subsidy because the eligibility means-test already takes into account gifted assets. 54. Gift duty repeal would lead to anticipated administrative savings of $430,000 each year. This figure relates to the direct costs that Inland Revenue incurs in administering gift duty and is the amount that will be returned to the Crown in a subsequent baseline update. It does not reflect indirect costs such as infrequent work by staff who are not directly responsible for administering gift duty (for example, policy advice and debt collection staff) in recognition of the fact that these staff will continue to be required to perform their core roles. Inland Revenue has assessed the cost of implementing gift duty repeal and it is expected to be minimal and can be met from within existing baselines. 55. Gift duty repeal is expected to reduce compliance costs imposed on the private sector by $70 million each year. This figure is based on the average cost quoted by practitioners of $285 (plus GST) to draw up an annual deed of forgiveness and to file this along with a gift statement to Inland Revenue. There are roughly 225,000 gift statements filed each year and this number was used to determine the aggregate cost of $70 million. The cost excludes the initial setting up of the gifting programme. 56. Repealing gift duty would meet all the objectives of the review, including removing all compliance and administrative costs, provided that full repeal does not also remove essential protections for the income tax base, social assistance means-testing and creditors. Therefore, analysis of the extent to which gift duty currently offers protection to each of these areas, as well as other areas, and consideration of whether other measures exist or could be established to offer more efficient protection, has been undertaken. 10 Income tax concerns 57. The number one concern related to the repeal of gift duty from an income tax perspective has, until very recently, been the ability of individuals to reduce their taxable income by transferring their income-generating assets to a trust. High-earning individuals could transfer assets such as shares or interest-bearing savings to a trust so that the associated income accrues to the trustee. This would allow the income to be taxed at the trustee tax rate instead of at the top marginal personal tax rate. Up until 1 October 2010, this would offer a tax saving of 5%. However, alignment of the trustee and top personal tax rate from 1 October 2010 will remove this tax advantage. 58. An associated concern is that high-earning individuals could transfer income-earning assets to a trust in order that the associated income could be distributed to a low-earning beneficiary and consequently taxed at the beneficiary’s low marginal rate. The changes announced as part of Budget 2010 will not address this concern, as different marginal personal tax rates remain a feature of the tax system. 59. However, the extent to which gift duty offers protection against this behaviour may have been overestimated. Under a common gifting programme, income-generating assets may already be instantly settled on a trust in exchange for an interest-free, on-demand loan that is progressively forgiven without attracting gift duty. The income associated with the transferred asset immediately ceases to belong to the person who has transferred it (the settlor) and it instead becomes trustee or beneficiary income. 60. In family trust situations (including discretionary family trusts), the fact that the trustee owes the settlor the value of the asset has no effect on the income tax liability of either the trustee or the settlor. Generally, debt forgiveness may be taxed under the financial arrangement rules as remission income of the debtor. However, an exception exists for debts forgiven in family situations, in which case the amounts forgiven will not give rise to remission income. This is commonly known as the natural love and affection exception. The effect of this is that the tax advantages of transferring income from a high-earning settlor to a low-earning beneficiary via a family trust are available straight away. Gift duty does not slow down or prevent this activity. 61. There is an argument that the compliance costs associated with gift duty act as a deterrent against such practices. However, the potential tax savings from these kinds of arrangements often significantly outweigh the compliance costs. 62. Another concern is that high-earning individuals may directly transfer income-earning assets to low-earning family members for income tax purposes without the use of a trust. This can already be achieved without incurring gift duty through the use of a gifting programme. Further, it may constitute a tax avoidance arrangement which is void against the Commissioner in accordance with section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 63. Further protection is provided by specific provisions within existing tax laws. For example, under section GC 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, disposal of trading stock for less than fully adequate consideration is taxed as if an amount equal to the market value was received at the time. 11 64. Concerns about the potential for income tax reduction as a direct result of gift duty repeal are not possible to quantify, particularly because the extent of protection currently offered by gift duty is speculative. In addition, the impact of the alignment of the top personal tax rate with the trustee tax rate from 1 October 2010 (which will significantly reduce the motivation to reduce tax obligations through the use of trusts) is yet to be seen. Creditor protection concerns 65. Gift duty is thought to provide some protection to creditors because defaulting debtors are unable to transfer assets out of their name without either becoming liable for gift duty or entering into a gifting programme. 66. The result of gifting programmes is that the person who is transferring an asset receives a corresponding debt asset by virtue of the interest-free, on-demand loan that is exchanged with the recipient in satisfaction of a market-value sale. A diminishing amount of outstanding debt remains because it can only be forgiven at a rate of $27,000 every 12 months in order to avoid gift duty. For a high-value asset, this can take a number of years. For example, a debt asset valued at $1 million would take an individual 38 years to completely forgive if gift duty is to be avoided. 67. The unforgiven portion of a debt under gifting programmes can be demanded in order to satisfy creditor claims against the transferor. If gift duty is repealed, gifting programmes will no longer be necessary because the value of allowable gifts would be unlimited. Therefore when a person transfers a large asset, there will no longer be any portion of its value which is immediately available to be clawed back. 68. The debt asset described above is thought to be of value to creditors because of the Official Assignee’s ability to demand its repayment on behalf of the bankrupt. Even before insolvency, creditors including Inland Revenue may use the fact that the Official Assignee could call on this debt if bankruptcy were to occur as leverage in order to bring about early settlement of debt. 69. During initial consultation, it was revealed that the debt asset was perceived to be of significant value to creditors. However, closer analysis revealed that this perception was theoretical and based on very limited anecdotal evidence. When quantitative work was done to consider the frequency with which the debt asset is used in practice to successfully recover value for creditors and the value of the debt recovered in this manner, it was revealed that the debt asset is only of very minor significance. 70. Inland Revenue records show that of 430,000 IRD numbers for which gift statements were filed between 1 July 2001 and 28 May 2010, less than 0.003% have gone into bankruptcy. MED has advised that the Official Assignee has recovered a total of $1.5 million from trusts in the past two years. Some of this may have been through insolvent gifting provisions. However, in the same period, an overall total of $500,000 was recovered from all entities using the insolvent transactions provisions under the Insolvency Act 2006 and “virtually none” of this has been related to book debts under gifting programmes. 12 71. Although creditors may be capable of using the debt asset as leverage in negotiations for settlement of debt, there are less than a handful of case examples that Inland Revenue staff are aware of where this has been used to negotiate a higher figure in full and final settlement of defaulting taxpayer debt. In the few known case examples, the value that was able to be recovered has been in the vicinity of $100,000. 72. This quantitative evidence suggests that gift duty is of little benefit in recovering debt from creditors, particularly when it is considered in the context of the estimated $70 million that the private sector spends each year complying with gift duty. 73. Creditor protection is a wider issue that must be addressed by specifically targeted measures. There are a number of such targeted measures under existing law which offer some safeguards for creditors: • Sections 204 and 205 of the Insolvency Act 2006 allow the Official Assignee to automatically cancel gifts made within two years before adjudication (insolvency is presumed during this period), and five years before adjudication if the bankrupt cannot demonstrate solvency at the time the gift was made; • Section 292 of the Companies Act 1993 gives the Official Assignee similar powers but over shorter timeframes (6 months and 2 years); and • Subpart 6 of the Property Law Act 2007 empowers the Courts to set aside property dispositions where there was an intention to prejudice the interests of a creditor- applicant. 74. There are concerns that the time periods under the Insolvency Act 2006 and the Companies Act 1993 may be insufficient to recover assets that may have been disposed of well in advance of bankruptcy or liquidation. These provisions act to claw back portions of the debt asset under gifting programmes that have been forgiven within the relevant time period. Therefore without gift duty and gifting programmes, there is less likely to be gifting that has occurred within the specified periods. 75. There is no time limit for making an application under the disposition provisions of the Property Law Act 2007. However, there is a lack of clarity surrounding the legal interpretation of the “intention to prejudice” wording of the provision. This wording replaced the previous requirement of an “intention to defraud” and the new wording has not yet been applied directly by the New Zealand Courts. There is a lack of clarity as to whether the change of wording has in fact changed the legal test for applying the provision. In the past, the “intention to defraud” has been difficult for applicants to establish. Equally, the further back in time a gift was made, the greater the difficulty and cost of obtaining accurate financial records. However, it must be noted that gift duty is not providing a significant backstop to any inadequacy in these existing provisions. 76. There is concern that gift duty repeal will lead to a higher level of gifting activity due to the removal of compliance costs. In turn, it could be expected that these provisions would be utilised more frequently. Given the time limits under the Insolvency and Companies Acts, there may be more Court action taken under the Property Law Act 2007. Whether or not this provision will offer sufficient protection to creditors is yet to be seen. Therefore, future cases 13 would need to be carefully monitored and if the legislative provisions are inadequate, they could be addressed directly. 77. Debt collection is an area of concern that Inland Revenue is already focusing on independently of the gift duty review. A debt project is underway, which is considering a range of new front-end measures to collect tax debts. Outbound calling and awareness campaigns are being trialled and new forms of leverage are being explored. Such measures are intended to directly address the level of tax debt in New Zealand, while gift duty has played a very indirect, minor role in debt collection. 78. Additional creditor concerns relate to the fact that gift duty repeal would abolish the requirement to file gift duty statements. These provide the Official Assignee with independent verification of gifting by an individual. 79. During consultation, MED expressed the view that without gift statements, debtors would be able to present falsified documents in order to try to show that gifting has occurred when in fact it has not. This concern stems from the fact that under gifting programmes, the deed of forgiveness and corresponding gift statement are usually the only forms of evidence that establish the extent to which the outstanding debt asset has been forgiven. In practice, there are cases where people have set up gifting programmes but have forgotten to forgive the debt asset by $27,000 in each of the subsequent years. In such cases, it may be claimed that gifting in the form of debt forgiveness has occurred, but unless the deeds and gift statements have been filed with Inland Revenue, it is treated as not having taken place. 80. If gift duty is repealed, there will no longer be any need for gifting programmes and by extension there will be no need to forgive debt each year. Clearly in this case, gift statements and deeds will no longer be required to establish whether there is any outstanding debt if there is no gifting programme. Instead, the whole asset would be transferred as a single gift and no deed or gift statement would be required. 81. In the absence of gift statements, evidence of the transfer would continue to exist in the form of land transfer records for real property, registration details for motor vehicles and banking records for cash transfers. If these records show a transfer of an asset where there is no supporting evidence of fully adequate consideration, a gift can be assumed. Each of these independent records could be expected to show both the donor and the recipient of the gift, just as gift statements do. 82. It should also be noted that strict secrecy requirements prevent Inland Revenue from providing copies of gift statements to anyone except the Official Assignee (who takes on the legal rights and responsibilities of the bankrupt) and Police (under the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009). They cannot be accessed by private creditors. Social assistance concerns 83. Gift duty is thought to prevent personal asset-stripping in order to meet income-testing or asset-testing requirements for various forms of social assistance. The areas of social assistance which could potentially be affected by the repeal of gift duty are discussed below. 14 Ministry of Social Development benefits 84. The removal of compliance costs associated with gift duty may lead to an increase in asset transfers including income-generating assets. Such transfers would enable people to qualify for both income-tested and asset-tested benefits where they otherwise would not. 85. In consultation, MSD noted that gift duty does not prevent the instant transfer of income associated with an asset. Therefore gifting programmes may already be used in order to meet income-testing requirements for social assistance. Repeal of gift duty will only affect income-testing for social assistance to the extent that a greater level of gifting activity occurs as a result of reduced compliance costs. 86. MSD is of the opinion that gift duty repeal could be expected to have a limited impact on its ability to effectively target social assistance. To address this concern, benefit application forms could ask key questions to identify asset transfers. The ability to identify asset transfers already relies largely on client honesty. However, the increased risk posed by the removal of gift duty does not appear to MSD to merit the significant level of operational change and additional front-line resources or policy work that would be required to reduce this risk, at this time. Residential Care Subsidy 87. Entitlement to the Residential Care Subsidy is determined in accordance with the Social Security Act 1964 and the Social Security (Long-term Residential Care) Regulations 2005. Part 8 of the Regulations define a gifting period that commences five years before the date of the means assessment. Any gifting above $27,500 during this five-year period ($5,500 per year) will be added back into means-testing. This five-year period has received wide publicity and general recognition among private advisors and the public. 88. However, there is less awareness of the fact that regulation 9B lists instances that qualify as deprivation of assets in accordance with section 147A of the Social Security Act 1964. There is no time limit on the Ministry of Social Development’s discretion to consider adding back assets that applicants have divested prior to commencement of the five-year gifting period. This provision is applied regularly in practice. 89. Because the Regulations focus on deprivation of assets by the applicant, it does not matter that these assets have changed legal ownership. There is no need to look behind a trust or to show that the applicant has retained the effective control or enjoyment of the transferred assets. Simply the fact that the applicant has transferred their assets allows them to be brought back into means testing. 90. The Ministry of Health advises on Residential Care Subsidy policy. They are confident that the existing legislation and policy provides adequate protection to prevent access to the Residential Care Subsidy where applicants have deprived themselves of assets prior to requiring residential care. Because the means-test for the Residential Care Subsidy provides for adding back gifts and dispositions of property for inadequate consideration, no changes will be required to the means-test if gift duty is repealed. 15 91. However, if gift duty is repealed, people will be able to transfer all their assets into a trust instantly. It could therefore be expected that a greater number of people would have completely gifted away their assets prior to the five years leading up to their application for the Residential Care Subsidy. As a result, MSD, which is responsible for administering the financial means assessment for the Residential Care Subsidy, would need to apply Regulation 9B more frequently to ensure that people do not receive the Subsidy where they have deprived themselves of assets. 92. If gift duty is repealed, MSD would need to review its administration of the financial means assessment to ensure the right financial information is collected from applicants, including details of historic, lump-sum gifting. This would include making amendments to the information requested at initial application, particularly to better capture gifting that transpired prior to the five-year look-back period. All communication materials including the website, brochures and training materials would need to be revised to reflect the broader application both within and outside of the five years prior to application. There would be a greater dependence on compliance by applicants in providing information and by staff in requesting and verifying this information. Staff training would therefore be required around the operational impacts of the changes. There would also be a greater need to complete land title searches for properties where applicants have spent significant amounts of time living to determine whether it has been gifted by the applicant. MSD has noted that this will lead to increased operational costs; however it has indicated that it is able to absorb such costs within existing baselines. 93. MSD is already working to better-educate financial advisors, solicitors and accountants of the deprivation of assets provisions that apply to the Residential Care Subsidy. More work would be required in this area to ensure that, in the absence of gift duty, people are aware that assets transferred outside the five-year period can be caught within means testing as is intended under the Regulations. Working for Families tax credits and Student Allowances 94. Entitlement to Working for Families tax credits is based on the adjusted taxable income of the eligible family (family scheme income). Entitlement to the Student Allowance is based on the income of the eligible student (and their partner) if they are over the age of 24, and also on the taxable income of the student’s parents if the student is under the age of 24 and does not have a supported child in their care. 95. There is the potential for applicants to transfer income-earning assets out of their name in order to remove income associated with the asset from their taxable income. However, as discussed above, gift duty does not prevent the instant transfer of income associated with an asset. Therefore gifting programmes may already be used in order to meet taxable income thresholds. Gift duty only offers protection to the extent that the associated compliance costs deter some people from establishing gifting programmes. 96. Income that is not included in family scheme income is being considered as part of the social assistance integrity review currently underway by Inland Revenue and the Treasury and announced as part of Budget 2010. The review aims to widen the definition of income for Working for Families tax credits and Student Allowances by including, for example, tax-paid trustee income, some fringe benefits and other periodic payments such as regular cash gifts. 16 These changes aim to capture income from legal arrangements that have the effect of increasing entitlement to social assistance, such as divesting income-earning assets to a trust. State Housing 97. Gift duty repeal may lead to an increase in the number of people who gift away assets in order to satisfy means testing for state housing, or to avoid being investigated for fraudulent behaviour for not declaring income or assets when applying for assistance. 98. Once again, gift duty does not prevent the transfer of assets under gifting programmes. Further, Housing New Zealand Corporation has assessed the risk of asset-stripping through gifting in the absence of gift duty as small, because it is very uncommon for people with significant assets to apply for state housing. 99. If gift duty is repealed and a substantial risk of gifting to obtain state housing becomes evident, Housing New Zealand Corporation has identified several ways this could be addressed, such as changing the definition of assets in current legislation to include gifted assets or by adding additional eligibility requirements for state housing. 100. Once state housing has been allocated, the tenant may apply to have their rent payments determined in relation to their income (known as Income Related Rent or IRR). The number of tenants currently paying IRR who have declared assets is small. The number of market renters with significant assets who would gift away assets in the absence of gift duty in order to qualify for IRR is unknown, but likely to be insignificant. 101. Cash gifts are not currently included in calculations of IRR. If removal of gift duty led to a significant increase in cash gifts received by tenants paying IRR, Housing New Zealand Corporation would consider new operational policy to include cash gifts as income. However, this also seems unlikely. 102. Housing New Zealand Corporation also acts as an insurer for Welcome Home Loans. Therefore, it may be affected by gift duty repeal from a creditor protection perspective. If borrowers are more likely to gift away assets in the absence of gift duty, this may increase the difficulty of recovering any shortfall owing following a mortgagee sale. In order to take advantage of existing creditor protection mechanisms under the Insolvency Act 2006, lenders would have to bankrupt the borrower. Alternatively, the Property Law Act 2007 provisions could be utilised. 103. In a practical sense, the effect of gift duty repeal on Welcome Home Loans is not expected to be significant. Housing New Zealand Corporation would consider changes to its credit policy and to each lender’s application form in order to address any risks. Legal Aid 104. The removal of gift duty may affect the rate of asset transfers by applicants for legal aid in order to satisfy asset testing. However, the Legal Services Agency has estimated that less than 1% of all applicants disclose the existence of a trust which could be affected by the gift duty changes. 17 105. Irrespective of gift duty repeal, the wider financial circumstances of any applicant for legal aid are considered on a case-by-case basis. Copies of all trust documents must be presented prior to financial eligibility assessments. As such, gift duty repeal is not anticipated to alter the number of persons eligible for legal aid. Other concerns Child Support 106. Repeal of gift duty may affect child support to the extent that a liable parent may be more likely to gift away income-earning assets in order to reduce their income and liability for child support. 107. Once again, gift duty does not prevent parents from transferring income-earning assets out of their name under a gifting programme in order to reduce the income on which their child support liability is calculated. 108. There are existing provisions under the Child Support Act 1991 to protect against such behaviour. Any assets transferred to a family trust may be taken into account under an administrative review. In addition, the Commissioner may make an application to the Court under section 201 of the Child Support Act 1991 to set aside any disposition of property that has been made, whether for value or not, in order to defeat the claim or rights of any person. Relationship property disputes 109. Increased gifting activity in response to gift duty repeal may have the effect of defeating the claim of one partner in a relationship property dispute. However, the Ministry of Justice advises that the principles underlying the statutory regimes in the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 and the Family Protection Act 1955 are not affected by the existence of gift duty and consequential gifting arrangements. The Property (Relationships) Act is based on the principle that an individual should be able to deal with their property as they wish until a relevant event, such as a separation, occurs. Similarly, the Family Protection Act does not restrict what a person may do with their property, including gifting that property to a trust or another person. 110. The Ministry of Justice is satisfied that adequate protection already exists under the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 and the Family Protection Act 1955 to prevent or remedy the disposal of property where this is intended to defeat the interests of another party. The Property (Relationships) Act 1976 gives the Court power to make financial adjustments if relationship property has been transferred to a trust or company which has the effect of defeating the interests of one of the parties. Enduring powers of attorney 111. Gift duty repeal might lead to an increase in relatives seeking to dispose assets when acting under an enduring power of attorney for another relative. However, the Ministry of Justice is of the view that the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 contains sufficient protection to address this risk. 18 Sentencing 112. The Ministry of Justice considers that gift duty repeal may, in isolated cases, increase the risk of gifting by individuals seeking to avoid enforcement of payment of fines in accordance with sentencing. However, it has assessed this risk as immaterial. Proceeds of crime 113. There have been cases where criminals have attempted to transfer their assets into other names in order to circumvent asset recovery legislation. New Zealand Police expect that introduction of the Criminal Proceeds (Recovery) Act 2009 (CPRA) will lead to more asset transfers to related parties in an attempt to avoid the confiscation regime. 114. The Ministry of Justice considers that gift duty is unlikely to be a major impediment to gifting intended to avoid the confiscation of proceeds of crime and Police note that assets are already transferred outright from criminals to associates despite the gift duty rules. Few criminals have a good knowledge of taxation regimes and virtually none pay tax on criminal gains. In any case, the CPRA provides the ability to look behind legal title and to seize property based on beneficial interest and effective control. 115. New Zealand Police note that where the beneficial interest and effective control of a transferred asset cannot be shown in Court, an alternative way for the Crown to recover some of the value of the transferred assets is for Inland Revenue to enforce payment of gift duty along with interest and penalties for failure to comply with the gift duty rules. There are currently very few cases where this is known to have happened, however Police are concerned that in the context of the new CPRA, asset transfers may become more common. 116. There is concern that without the deterrence of gift duty, criminals may be more likely to transfer assets before proceedings can be brought when they become aware of proposed action under the CPRA. However, it is unlikely that criminals are currently aware of or are compliant with the gift duty rules. 117. Police also note that the CPRA allows information sharing between Inland Revenue and Police. Therefore gift duty statements may be accessed to verify gifts and to demonstrate that an individual has an interest in a particular asset during financial crime investigations. However, most criminals are unlikely to file gift duty statements and transfers can usually be verified through other records such as land title, car registration and bank records. Trust law concerns 118. The removal of gift duty and its associated compliance costs could be expected to lead to more instances of gifting to trusts, which may in turn lead to an increase in the number of trusts established in New Zealand. There are broad concerns across government and the private sector regarding the uses of trusts and their lack of regulation. These concerns go well beyond the scope of the gift duty project. 119. The Law Commission is currently undertaking a review of trust law in New Zealand and is expected to release an issues paper shortly. Officials have met with the Law 19 Commission to discuss concerns and will continue to follow the Commission’s progress. The review will broadly consider the various uses of trusts where legal ownership of property is transferred to a trust but control and enjoyment of that property is retained. New forms of regulation such as a central trust register and the compulsory filing of annual trust accounts are among the ideas that have been raised for reform. Such reforms would help deal with information concerns that may arise as a result of the repeal of gift duty. The Law Commission’s work is ongoing and may continue for some time. CONSULTATION 120. The wider implications of gift duty repeal required consideration across government to determine the extent to which gift duty offers protection to the tax base, creditors and social assistance integrity. To the extent that repeal of gift duty poses risks to these areas, there should be adequate alternative protections in place. 121. In June, the Minister of Revenue wrote to the Ministers of Commerce, Justice, Health, Social Development and Employment, and Housing advising them of his announcement and seeking to ensure that if gift duty is repealed, due consideration has been given to alternative mechanisms to protect against the defeat of creditors and social assistance targeting. The Minister of Revenue requested for this letter to be passed on to Chief Executives. 122. Formal consultation was undertaken with MED, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Health, New Zealand Police, MSD and Housing New Zealand Corporation. None of these agencies are opposed to repeal. The majority considered that either adequate protection was already in place or that work on additional protection measures was not justified by the low level of risk. 123. Formal questionnaires were sent to each of the above-named agencies seeking responses with formal departmental sign-off. The questionnaires asked them to identify: • where gift duty currently offers their agency protection; • any risks associated with gift duty repeal; • any alternative measures which could be taken to alleviate these risks; • when and how such measures could be implemented; • whether there were any significant remaining risks which could not be addressed by alternative measures; and • whether gift duty repeal would offer any benefits for their agency. 124. Responses were received from all six agencies and, as noted, none are opposed to repeal. The key feedback received has been incorporated into the analysis above and a summary of areas of risk and work recommended by each agency is contained in the Appendix. 125. The Treasury supports the repeal of gift duty as it is an inefficient instrument to provide limited creditor and means-testing protection, but considers that relevant agencies should be required by Ministers to undertake any recommended work to support the repeal or to monitor whether additional measures might be needed following repeal (see Appendix). 20 126. In September, the Minister of Revenue wrote again to the Ministers of Commerce, Justice, Health, Police, Social Development and Employment, and Housing, advising them of his intention to repeal gift duty and noting any associated work recommended by their officials. 127. The Australian Treasury has also been consulted regarding their experience of gift duty repeal. Gift duty and estate duty were repealed together in Australia in the late 1970s. Aside from the capital gains tax, Australia does not appear to have any significant form of creditor protection which does not also exist in substance in New Zealand. 128. Limited private sector consultation has taken place. The Minister of Revenue and officials met with New Zealand Trustee Services Limited, which raised concerns regarding gift duty repeal in the context of a general lack of trust regulation in New Zealand. These concerns have been referred to the Ministry of Justice and to the Law Commission to consider as part of the trust law review. Informal discussions have taken place with the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and no real concerns were raised. In addition, the Minister of Revenue received a number of letters from the public, including from the New Zealand Law Society, as a result of his announcement. The Law Society raised concerns regarding the potential impact on relationship property disputes and these have been responded to in consultation with the Ministry of Justice. Views expressed by the general public were largely supportive of repeal. Media coverage following the Minister’s announcement has also been predominantly positive. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 129. Officials have fully considered the implications of gift duty repeal for income tax, creditor protection, social assistance integrity and other identified areas in consultation with MED, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Health, New Zealand Police, MSD and Housing New Zealand Corporation. None of these agencies are opposed to gift duty repeal. 130. Gift duty no longer raises any significant revenue and imposes a high level of compliance costs on the private sector. The protections offered by gift duty in the areas of income tax, creditors and social assistance have only ever been incidental rather than intended policy goals. The analysis undertaken has shown that the protection gift duty offers is indirect, inefficient and very limited. 131. Ultimately, the limited protection that gift duty offers does not outweigh the significant compliance costs that it imposes on the private sector. Officials therefore recommend that gift duty be repealed. IMPLEMENTATION 132. Abolishing gift duty would require full repeal of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and any consequential provisions in other legislation. Repeal would be included in the Taxation (Tax Administration and Remedial Matters) Bill, planned for introduction in 21 November 2010. To provide certainty for the private sector, it is recommended that repeal be effective from 1 October 2011. 133. Low-level implementation risks have been identified and will be addressed where appropriate through administrative changes or monitoring. The areas of risk and proposed mitigation measures are outlined in the Appendix. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 134. In general, Inland Revenue monitoring, evaluation and review of gift duty repeal would take place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary following repeal would be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 135. MED, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Health, New Zealand Police, MSD and Housing New Zealand Corporation have indicated that they will monitor any impacts of gift duty repeal on their areas of responsibility. APPENDIX: Summary of recommended work to accompany/follow gift duty repeal Area affected Level of risk Agency Potential alternative measures Recommendation IRD debt recovery Very low – there are very few cases in the memory of IRD staff where the debt asset created under gifting programmes has led to a greater level of debt recovery for IRD. Inland Revenue New powers for IRD to claw back gifts or to register a charge over gifted assets in tax debt situations. This would go well beyond the level of protection offered by gift duty. It is likely to be controversial as this would give IRD a superior ability to recover debt than private creditors. Debt collection concerns extend well beyond those related to gifting and IRD’s debt project is currently developing direct, front-end measures to address this. Any new measures to facilitate debt recovery would need to be considered as part of the wider work programme. Documentation/ verification of gifts and/or the existence of trusts Low – IRD gift statements are protected by secrecy rules and are only available to the Official Assignee and Police. The information they contain can be verified through alternative means such as bank records or land titles. Inland Revenue New record-keeping requirements could be imposed under the Tax Administration Act 1994 or a box could be added to income tax returns requesting gifting information. The proposals are problematic. It would be difficult to enforce the private recording of gifts. Collecting information on tax returns would impose further compliance costs on the private sector for little real benefit and would be difficult to enforce. In addition, a significant number of trusts do not generate income and therefore are not required to file income tax returns. The Law Commission is considering the creation of a central trust register as part of its trust law review. Any further work by IRD would depend on the outcome of that review. 23 Debt recovery by the Official Assignee Very low – IRD records show that 0.003% of people who have filed gift statements since 2001 have gone into bankruptcy. MED advises that the Official Assignee has recovered a total of $1.5 million from trusts in the past two years. Some of this may have been through insolvent gifting provisions. However, in the same period, an overall total of $500,000 was recovered from all entities using the insolvent transactions provisions under the Insolvency Act 2006 and “virtually none” of this has been related to book debts under gifting programmes. Ministry of Economic Development (MED) None proposed. The Law Commission is considering creditor protection with respect to trusts as part of their review and MED will contribute to that discussion. MED will monitor the impact of gift duty repeal on creditors going forward. Access to MSD-administered benefits Low –MSD has assessed gift duty repeal as potentially affecting its ability to effectively target social assistance, but only to a limited extent. Ministry of Social Development (MSD) MSD to ensure benefit application forms ask key questions to identify asset transfers. MSD advises that the removal of gift duty does not appear to merit the significant level of operational or policy work which would be required to reduce any associated risk. Access to the Residential Care Subsidy Low – the Ministry of Health is confident that the existing legislation and policy provides adequate protection to prevent access to the Residential Care Subsidy where applicants have deprived themselves of assets prior to requiring residential care. Because the means-test for the Residential Care Subsidy provides for adding back gifts and dispositions of property for inadequate consideration, no changes will be required to the means-test if gift duty is Ministry of Health (policy) and MSD (administration) MSD to review its administration of the means assessment to ensure the right financial information is collected, including details of historic, lump-sum gifting. MSD work would need to include amendments to the information requested at initial application, particularly to better capture gifting that transpired prior to the five-year look-back period. MSD staff training would be required around the operational impacts of the changes. There would also be a greater need to complete land title searches for properties where applicants have spent significant amounts of time living to 24 repealed. MSD notes that the low level of risk depends on the availability of adequate resources and time to address the operational impacts of gift duty repeal. Repeal is expected to make identification of deprivation less visible, therefore MSD would be required to obtain more information and verification from clients at initial application. determine whether it has been gifted by the applicant. MSD would need to revise all client communications, forms and brochures to clarify verification requirements. This would lead to increased operational costs for MSD; however they could be met from within existing baselines . An effective repeal date of 1 October 2011 is expected to provide sufficient time for the work described to be undertaken. Access to state housing Low – Housing New Zealand Corporation advises that it is very rare for people with assets to apply for state housing, although isolated cases exist. Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) HNZC could change the definition of assets in current legislation to include gifted assets. A legal opinion on whether this is possible would be required. Alternatively, an additional eligibility requirement for state housing could be added (so that no person who has gifted assets in excess of a certain limit within a defined period is able to access state housing). This would require Cabinet approval. An additional eligibility requirement for state housing is HNZC’s preferred option to address housing allocation as this would require Cabinet approval rather than legislative change. Assessment of Income-Related Rent (IRR) for state housing Very low – HNZC advises that the number of tenants paying IRR that have declared assets is small. The number of market renters with significant assets Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) None proposed. N/A 25 that would apply for IRR if they had the ability to gift these assets without limit is unknown, but would be insignificant as any income from assets does not significantly impact the rent tenants pay. Recovery of outstanding Welcome Home Loans following a mortgagee sale Very low – this concern is no more significant than the Official Assignee or IRD’s ability to recover debt. HNZC has assessed the risk as “not significant”. Housing New Zealand Corporation (HNZC) Changes to HNZC’s credit policy and to each lender’s application form. Following gift duty repeal, the extent to which the suggested changes are required would be assessed. Access to legal aid Very low – the Legal Services Agency advises that providers already require copies of all trust documents prior to completing financial eligibility assessments. It is estimated that less than 1% of all applicants disclose the existence of a trust which could be affected by the gift duty changes. Legal Services Agency/Ministry of Justice None proposed. The Legal Services Agency advises that if difficulties were encountered in relation to administration, instructions could be issued with one month’s advance notice, but it considers that this is highly unlikely to be required. Defeat of a party’s interests in a relationship property dispute Low – The Ministry of Justice considers that adequate protection already exists under the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 to prevent or remedy the disposal of property where this is intended to defeat the interests of another party. Ministry of Justice None proposed. Monitor any impact of gift duty repeal. Gifting by relatives under enduring powers of attorney Low – The Ministry of Justice considers that the Protection of Personal and Property Rights Act 1988 contains sufficient protection to address any risks associated with gift duty repeal. Ministry of Justice None proposed. Monitor any impact of gift duty repeal. 26 Sentencing (enforcement of payment of fines) Very low – there is a risk of evading debt enforcement in isolated cases but the Ministry of Justice has assessed this risk as having no overall material impact. Ministry of Justice None proposed. Due to expected low numbers, the Ministry of Justice considers that efforts to prevent evasion of debt enforcement would be of little benefit considering the work required to mitigate this risk. Recovery of proceeds of crime Very low – Gift duty is unlikely to be a major impediment to confiscation of proceeds of crime. Existing proceeds of crime laws provide the ability to look behind legal title and to forfeit property based on beneficial interest and effective control. Ministry of Justice and New Zealand Police None proposed. Monitor any impact of gift duty repeal.
Regulatory Impact Statement GST: change in use adjustments, supply of accommodation, transactions involving nominations, and application of section 19D to non-profit bodies Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options relating to the goods and services tax (GST) treatment of change in use adjustments, supply of accommodation, transactions involving nominees, and application of section 19D of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) to non- profit bodies. These areas have been identified as problematic to both taxpayers and the Government, and as affecting the integrity of the GST system. The analysis of different options was subject to extensive consultation under the Generic Tax Policy Process. Different options for dealing with the GST concerns have been considered in the light of submissions on the 2008 issues paper Options for strengthening GST neutrality in business-to-business transactions and 2009 discussion document GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets, and are discussed in greater detail in the main body of the regulatory impact statement. The submissions on those consultation documents agreed that there is a need to address the issues discussed in this regulatory impact statement. We have also consulted with the Treasury who agree with our analysis of the options considered in this regulatory impact statement. Inland Revenue is of the view that there are no significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning this regulatory analysis. We consider that the options will not impose significant additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights or market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. The proposals are not expected to have any significant revenue impact, although the revenue impact of the proposed amendments to the change in use adjustment rules is difficult to estimate with any degree of certainty. Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 21 June 2010 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. A number of areas of GST have been identified as not sufficiently clear or comprehensive. These areas of GST cause difficulties for both taxpayers and the Government, and affect the integrity of the GST system. 2. The issues are: A. It is difficult to account for change in use of goods and services. B. The boundary of the definitions of "dwelling" and "commercial dwelling" is not clear. C. The treatment of transactions involving nominees is not clear. D. Non-profit bodies' operation may be affected by the requirement to change their accounting basis. 3. The Government indicated its intention to deal with the first three areas as part of the 2009 discussion document GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets. The final area was raised by a submission to the discussion document. A. Accounting for changes in the use of goods and services 4. The amount of an input tax deduction that can be claimed by a GST-registered purchaser in respect of acquired goods and services should relate to the taxable use of the goods and services. This is currently achieved by a set of complex adjustment rules. 5. Under the current regime, GST-registered persons may claim a full input tax deduction for GST paid on goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 6. If the goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies are used partly or entirely for another purpose, such as for private and exempt purposes (non- taxable purposes), the GST Act treats the non-taxable use of goods and services as a taxable supply by the registered person, and output tax is charged accordingly. In this way, goods and services that are "self-supplied" are treated in the same manner as other supplies. 7. Conversely, goods and services acquired principally for a non-taxable purpose (for which the GST-registered person is not entitled to an input tax deduction) may be partly or entirely used to make taxable supplies. In these circumstances, the GST Act allows a deduction to reflect that taxable use. 8. This approach of taxing the "self supply" of goods and services has often been criticised by commentators and tax practitioners as conceptually complex and confusing. It ignores the original input tax deduction claimed by the GST-registered person as the change in use adjustments do not relate to the amount of the deduction claimed on acquisitions. This is because the use of goods and services for a non-principal purpose is deemed to be a supply which is separate from the purchase transaction. 2 9. Another problem is that the GST Act does not provide a statutory limit to the maximum number of adjustments that have to be made. Therefore, since change in use adjustments do not relate to the amount of the initial input tax deduction, the value of adjustments that a person is required to make may potentially amount to more than the original GST paid on the purchase. It also means that in some cases, the value of the deduction received by means of change in use adjustments could exceed the amount of GST originally paid. 10. Other issues concerning this approach have been raised by the Court of Appeal decision in the Lundy (2005) 22 NZTC 19 at 637) case, which involved land being used concurrently for taxable (advertised for sale) and non-taxable (generating rental income) purposes. 11. Overall, because of the current detachment between the initial input tax claimed on acquisition and the subsequent change in use adjustments, the concepts behind imposing GST on mixed use assets are not sufficiently clear for many taxpayers. Coupled with the absence of any limits as to the maximum number of adjustments, the current regime may result in over or under taxation. B. Supplies of accommodation 12. In October 2006, Inland Revenue released a draft interpretation statement about the exemption from GST for accommodation provided in a dwelling. Inland Revenue received a number of comprehensive submissions on the exposure draft, many of which requested that the policy underlying the GST treatment of accommodation be reviewed. Most submissions were concerned that the current legislative framework did not give taxpayers enough certainty about when the supply of accommodation should be treated as a taxable or exempt supply. 13. Accommodation provided by GST-registered persons in a "commercial dwelling" is a taxable supply, whereas the supply of accommodation in a "dwelling" is exempt. Supplies of "dwelling" were not included in the GST base because of concerns that if GST applied to rents, it would give owner-occupiers of residential accommodation a tax preference over tenants who reside in rental properties. Arguably, this goal is not currently achieved due to the wide interpretation of the definition of "dwelling". 14. The current uncertainty around the boundary between the definitions of "dwelling" and "commercial dwelling" may create difficulties for suppliers of accommodation in identifying whether they are making taxable or exempt supplies. The current situation may cause different suppliers of essentially the same type of accommodation to treat their supplies differently for GST purposes owing to the suppliers' differing interpretations of what constitutes a "dwelling" and "commercial dwelling". This uncertainty may result in compliance costs to taxpayers and revenue loss to the Government (as a result of some commercially provided accommodation being treated as exempt from GST). C. Transactions involving nominees 15. GST is often described as a tax on transactions. Most transactions involve only two parties - that is a contractual vendor and a purchaser - and much of the GST Act operates on that assumption. The GST Act is not generally designed to cater for tripartite arrangements - 3 that is arrangements where three parties are involved. A tripartite arrangement would ordinarily involve a purchaser nominating another person (a nominee) to receive the goods and/or settle the transaction. 16. In the absence of appropriate guidance, taxpayers have been experiencing uncertainty as to the GST treatment of nominee transactions, especially in relation to claiming input tax deductions. Such confusion and uncertainty undermines the design of GST. D. Application of section 19D to non-profit bodies 17. Owing to differences in the accounting practices of different businesses, the GST Act allows differing accounting bases. Since parties to a transaction may not be using the same accounting basis, a GST-registered person accounting for GST using the payments basis may make a supply to a GST-registered person who accounts for GST using the invoice basis. In these situations, the payments-basis supplier accounts for GST when payment is received, while the purchaser may claim an input tax deduction following receipt of the tax invoice. These differences in accounting basis may be deliberately used in a small number of cases to obtain a tax benefit by deferring the payment of output tax for a significant period of time or even indefinitely. 18. The aim of section 19D of the GST Act is to limit taxpayers' choices of accounting bases when the application of GST accounting principles could give rise to such tax-base risks. Specifically, section 19D requires GST-registered suppliers accounting for GST using the payments basis to use the invoice basis when the consideration payable for a supply of goods and services is $225,000 or more (including GST) and payment by the customer is deferred. 19. Section 19D applies to all taxpayers. The universal application of section 19D may have an unintended detrimental effect on some non-profit bodies. For example, a non-profit body may agree to supply an asset, such as a house, to an individual in need. Often the agreement will stipulate that the recipient of the asset will make a number of payments over a period of time and will receive the title in the asset when the asset has been paid for in full. These types of arrangements may trigger section 19D, and require the non-profit body to account for GST on an invoice basis. This would result in the non-profit body having to account for the GST on the entire purchase price at the outset, therefore creating a significant cost to the non-profit body. Consequently, the operation of the rule may discourage non- profit bodies from providing goods and services over a certain value. OBJECTIVES 20. Since 1995 tax policy has been developed in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process, a process designed to produce better, more effective tax policy. Among other things, the process involves the post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. 21. The review of the areas of GST described above and contained in the 2008 issues paper Options for strengthening GST neutrality in business-to-business transactions and the 2009 discussion document GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets indicated that in 4 certain areas there is a lack of simplicity or certainty regarding the underlying rules. The objective of the proposals outlined in this regulatory impact statement is to correct those deficiencies and therefore improve the GST system as a whole. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS A. Input tax and change in use adjustments 22. We propose to replace the existing complex and confusing adjustment approach with an approach that would apportion input tax deductions in line with the actual use of the goods and services. It is proposed that the current framework be replaced with the following rules: • On acquisition, unless an exclusion applies, the portion of a deduction that a registered person can claim must correspond with the portion of the asset that is intended to be used for taxable purposes. • In subsequent years, a person may be required to adjust the deduction claimed if the extent to which the asset is used for taxable purposes is different from the intended taxable use of the asset. A number of exemptions will be introduced to relieve a person from the requirement to make adjustments if the amount of revenue from the adjustments is low. • A maximum number of adjustments that a person may be required to make will vary according to the asset's value or estimated useful life of the asset. • Special "wash-up" rules will be introduced to deal with situations when goods are sold or a person deregisters. • Legislative clarification of the treatment of assets used concurrently for taxable and non-taxable purposes will also be provided. 23. Transitional rules will be provided to allow taxpayers to use the new apportionment rules in respect of assets that have already been subject to the current change in use adjustment rules. 24. Submitters on the 2009 discussion document GST: Accounting for land and other high- value assets supported the proposed changes. It is considered that the proposed rules will be easier to use and understand than the current rules. Moreover, the proposals should reduce compliance costs for some taxpayers as, unlike the current rules, the requirement to make change in use adjustments in relation to assets other than land will be limited to a maximum of ten adjustments. 25. As Inland Revenue does not collect complete information about change in use adjustments, it is not possible to identify how much of the output tax paid or input tax received relates to change in use adjustments. Therefore, it is not possible calculate with certainty the revenue impact of the proposed changes. 26. The proposed changes will not have any social or environment impacts. 5 B. Supplies of accommodation 27. Supplies of accommodation in a "dwelling" are not included in the GST base because if GST applied to rents, it would give owner-occupiers of residential dwellings a tax preference over tenants who reside in rental properties. Thus, the definition of "dwelling" is intended to apply to situations where there is a reasonable level of substitutability between renting and owning a home. This goal is not currently achieved owing to the potentially wide interpretation of the term "dwelling". Moreover, the boundary between what constitutes a "dwelling" and a "commercial dwelling" is not always clear and may not recognise more current types of accommodation. 28. It is proposed that the definitions of "dwelling" and "commercial dwelling" be amended to clarify the boundaries of those definitions and to ensure the GST treatment of equivalent types of accommodation are better aligned. The amendment will provide a narrower definition of what constitutes a "dwelling", therefore, ensuring that the exemption from GST applies only in situations where there is a reasonable level of substitutability between renting and owning a house. 29. The amendments will also include a revised list of "commercial dwellings", such as homestays, farmstays, and serviced apartments. 30. The proposed changes should give suppliers more certainty as to whether they supply accommodation in a "dwelling" or a "commercial dwelling", by reducing their compliance costs. Since the changes involve narrowing the definition of "dwelling", some supplies that are currently treated as supplies of a "dwelling" may be treated as supplies of a "commercial dwelling" under the proposed rales. This may result in more persons being required to register for GST - thereby having to account for the output tax and claim input tax deductions. 31. Again, officials have not been able to estimate the revenue impact of the changes. Owing to the narrower definition of "dwelling", the changes are not expected to result in a revenue loss. 32. The proposed changes will not have any social or environment impacts. Other options considered 33. In addition to the option proposed above, the 2008 issues paper Options for strengthening GST neutrality in business-to-business transactions considered another option for dealing with the issues. 34. This option would involve replacing the current legislative framework with terms that are more descriptive of the normal use of the premises. For example, the term "commercial dwelling" would be replaced with the term "guest accommodation". Accommodation provided in a hospice, rest home or similar - but not including a hospital or a dwelling in a retirement village - would be defined as "care accommodation". Both supply of "guest accommodation" and "care accommodation" would be taxable. 6 35. The majority of submissions on the issues paper supported the former option for resolving the concerns regarding supplies of accommodation. It was considered that the alternative option did not have enough advantages over the current approach to justify such a drastic change to the GST Act. C. Transactions involving nominees 36. It is proposed to clarify the rules to provide that in transactions involving nominations the GST treatment should be determined on the basis of the transaction's economic substance. This is done by: • In transactions involving a "bare" nomination, in which the transaction is settled by the purchaser, there will be only one supply which will be to the purchaser. The purchaser will be the only party entitled to an input tax deduction. • Where a vendor agrees to sell goods or services to a purchaser, and the purchaser nominates a nominee to settle the transaction by paying the purchase price to the vendor, the rules would treat the arrangement as involving one transaction - from the vendor to the nominee. The contractual purchaser would essentially be treated as acting as an agent for the nominee and "ignored" for GST purposes. • Where a purchaser pays a deposit or contributes to the purchase price on settlement (but does not pay the whole amount of the purchase price), the rules will treat the transaction as involving a single supply between the vendor and the purchaser, with the purchaser being entitled to the input tax deduction. However, the purchaser and the nominee would be able to override this default rule by explicitly agreeing that the supply of the property be treated as a supply by the vendor to the nominee. 37. The proposed rules will also affect the tax invoice requirements. In normal circumstances, a taxpayer must have a tax invoice in order to claim an input tax deduction. In transactions involving nominations, a nominee may not have the tax invoice as it may have been issued to the purchaser. The absence of a tax invoice will not prevent the nominee from being able to claim a deduction as long as there is sufficient other documentation to establish the nominee's claim, based on the agreement between the purchaser and the nominee. 38. It is considered that this codification of the effect of nominations will provide more certainty to taxpayers as to their respective status in a transaction. As a consequence of this greater certainty, there should be a reduction of compliance costs to taxpayers involved in nominee transactions. Other options considered 39. An alternative approach is to treat each nomination as a separate transaction for GST purposes and apply the current GST rules on this basis. For example, if a vendor agrees to sell goods or services to a purchaser, and the purchaser nominates a nominee to settle the transaction, the rules would treat the goods and services as being supplied twice for GST purposes - from the vendor to the purchaser under the original contract, and from the purchaser to the nominee under the nomination agreement. 7 40. This approach would also achieve the objective of clarifying the respective positions of parties in a nominee transaction, and, therefore, would provide more certainty than there is currently. 41. This "transactional" approach is not, however, supported by officials as it does not reflect the economic reality that there is ultimately only one transaction in which the goods and services are supplied by the vendor. This approach would require the identification of each party's registration status and the GST consequences of the transaction may bear no resemblance to the economic substance of the transaction. 42. Most submitters on the 2009 discussion document GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets supported the first option for dealing with transactions involving nomination. 43. Neither option would have any revenue, social or environment impacts. D. Application of section 19D to non-profit bodies 44. To ensure that section 19D does not adversely affect the provision of supplies by non- profit bodies, it is proposed to exclude non-profit bodies from the application of the section in circumstances where the avoidance risk is low. Thus, a non-profit body that accounts for GST on a payments basis will not be subject to section 19D if the non-profit body determines that the recipient is a non-registered person who does not intend to use the asset in a taxable activity at the relevant time. 45. The proposed change would relieve the burden of section 19D from non-profit bodies, therefore allowing them to operate without the additional cost of having to fund the full cost of GST upfront. 46. There should be no revenue impact from the proposal as the risk of non-profit bodies seeking timing mismatches in relation to private consumer transactions is minimal. CONSULTATION 47. In June 2008, officials released an issues paper, Options for strengthening GST neutrality in business-to-business transactions, which suggested a number of options to help resolve GST neutrality concerns and improve the operation of GST in general. Submissions on the issues paper led to further refinement of the options. These proposals were subject to further consultation in November 2009, as part of the government discussion document GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets. 48. Submissions on the discussion document confirmed that there are good reasons to change certain aspects of the way GST operates. Specifically and as already noted, submitters generally supported the proposed rules in relation to change in use adjustments, nominations and accommodation. These submissions have been taken into account when assessing the options to address the problem. 8 49. The Treasury has been consulted on the topics considered in this regulatory impact statement and agrees with the chosen options. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 50. The changes proposed in this regulatory impact statement have been subject to extensive analysis and consultation. It is considered that each proposed option is well-suited for achieving the objective of clarifying the GST treatment of the transactions concerned. A. Input tax and change in use adjustments 51. The amount of an input tax deduction a GST registered purchaser may claim in respect of an acquired asset should relate to the taxable use of the asset. 52. The current approach does not achieve this objective owing to the lack of connection between the initial input tax deductions and the adjustments for change in use. Coupled with the absence of any limits as to the maximum number of adjustments, the current regime may result in over or under taxation. 53. The proposed regime deals with these concerns by establishing a clear link between the taxable use of the asset, the initial input tax claimed on acquisition and the subsequent change in use adjustments. The proposed regime will also establish a maximum limit on the number of adjustments that have to be made in respect of assets other than land, thereby, providing more certainty to taxpayers regarding the extent of their obligations and reducing compliance costs for some taxpayers. 54. The changes are not expected to have social or environment impacts. It is not possible calculate with certainty the revenue impact of the proposed changes. B. Supplies of accommodation 55. The current definitions of "dwelling" and "commercial dwelling" do not provide sufficient certainty about when the supply of accommodation should be treated as a taxable or exempt supply. Therefore, it is proposed that a number of changes to the current terms "dwelling" and "commercial dwelling" be made to provide a clearer indication of the boundary between exempt and taxable accommodation. 56. This option is preferred over the other option considered in the 2008 issues paper that would involve replacing the current legislative terms with terms that are more descriptive of the normal use of the premises. Most submitters considered that the alternative option did not have enough advantages over the current approach to justify such a drastic change to the GST Act. 57. The proposed changes are not expected to have social or environment impacts. The revenue impact of the changes is not possible to calculate with certainty. 9 C. Transactions involving nominees 58. Since the GST Act does not specify the GST treatment of transactions that involve nominations, to avoid uncertainty a codification of this area of law is considered desirable. 59. Officials recommend that, in transactions involving nominations, the GST treatment should be determined on the basis of the economic substance of the transaction. It is considered that this approach is best-suited to ensuring that the GST consequences follow the economic substance of the transaction. 60. Although an alternative approach that would treat each nomination as a separate transaction for GST purposes would achieve the objective of clarifying the respective positions of parties, it would not reflect the economic reality that there is ultimately only one transaction in which the goods and services are supplied by the vendor to the nominee. 61. The codification of this area of law should give taxpayers more certainty about the GST consequences of transactions involving nominees, thereby reducing taxpayers' compliance costs. The changes are not expected to have revenue, social or environment impacts. D. Application of section 19D to non-profit bodies 62. Section 19D is an anti-avoidance provision aimed to prevent the deliberate manipulation of accounting bases rules with the view to obtaining a timing advantage. The provision may, however, apply to certain supplies made by non-profit bodies, thereby increasing their costs and discouraging them to make those supplies. 63. It is proposed that non-profit bodies be excluded from the application of section 19D when they can determine that the supply is to a non-registered person who is not using asset in a taxable activity at the relevant time. 64. The changes are not expected to have revenue, social or environment impacts. IMPLEMENTATION 65. The proposed changes will require legislative changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The changes are intended to be made as part of the next available tax bill. 66. The amendments in relation to input tax deductions and change in use adjustments, the definitions of "dwelling" and "commercial dwelling", and transactions involving nominees will apply from 1 April 2011 to give taxpayers more time to familiarise themselves with the new rules and, if necessary, change their systems. The proposed rules will apply prospectively. The current change in use adjustment rules would remain in force for goods and services that have been subject to adjustments prior to 1 April 2011, but transitional rules will allow taxpayers to transition those assets to the new rules. 67. The amendment in relation to the application of section 19D to non-profit bodies will apply from the date of enactment. 10 68. We cannot identify any significant implementation risks associated with the proposals. It is, however, important to ensure that taxpayers are aware of and are able to understand the proposed changes. Inland Revenue will prepare a Tax Information Bulletin item and update the GST Guide to communicate the effect of the proposed changes to taxpayers. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 69. The proposed amendments will be monitored, evaluated and reviewed as part of the normal post-implementation phase of the generic tax policy process. 11
Regulatory Impact Statement PIE Credit Impairment Provisions Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by the Treasury and Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to clarify the current uncertainty around the ability of portfolio investment entities (PIEs) to claim a tax deduction for credit impairment provisions. It answers the question of whether PIEs should be able to claim a tax deduction for their credit impairment or doubtful debt provisions. As this issue impacts on the daily unit pricing of managed funds and it is understood that the majority of managed funds have been using the PIE timing rules as the authority to claim tax deductions for credit impairment provisions, there is a pressing need to provide operational certainty for the industry. As a result, this issue has not been subject to the full generic tax policy process. However, analysis on this issue has applied the framework of principles outlined in the Government Statement on Regulation and the Tax Review 2001. The key focus of tax policy is to enhance the overall economic well-being of New Zealanders by seeking ways to reduce the costs of imposing taxes while promoting fairness and continuing to raise sufficient revenue. As part of this analysis, we have consulted with the Investment Savings and Insurance Association, Trustee Corporations Association of New Zealand Inc, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, KPMG and Ernst & Young. This consultation highlighted the compliance costs of disallowing a deduction for PIE credit impairment provisions and led to the recommendation of option two (deduction for credit impairment provisions), which was a change from the initial policy position. The analysis undertaken has considered whether options for resolving the current uncertainty around the treatment of credit impairment provisions would impose additional costs on business. In particular, one of the policy options (i.e. option one that denies deductions for credit impairments) is seen as giving rise to transitional issues (both from a compliance and administration cost perspective). This is because the majority of PIEs have effectively taken their deductions as if they were dealers in financial arrangements. As such, restricting tax deductions would be seen as an unfavourable retrospective change to the legislation. Doing so would require most PIEs to amend tax positions already taken and also create significant compliance costs with respect to unit pricing and investor equity issues where investors have changed over time. Steve Mack Principal Advisor The Treasury Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Advice Inland Revenue 12 March 2010 12 March 2010 Regulatory Impact Statement - PIE credit impairments | 1 Context The portfolio investor entity (PIE) rules have their own timing rule for income and tax deductions which allocates PIE income and deductions to the period when these amounts are reflected in the PIE's unit price, usually on a daily basis. The purpose of this rule is to maintain investor equity over time by ensuring that investors exiting the fund are attributed their correct share of the fund's tax. This prevents the fund from being required to make complex (and often inaccurate) provisions for future tax liabilities and deductions in the fund's unit price. The Income Tax Act 2007 currently contains differing timing provisions for income tax deductions. PIEs have been using a special timing provision within that regime (section EG 3) as authority to claim deductions for credit impairment provisions at the time these are reflected in the unit price. However, this approach differs from the general tax treatment of credit impairment provisions for individual investors and is technically incorrect. It was never intended that section EG 3 would authorise deductions. Rather it was intended that section EG 3 would set the timing for claiming deductions authorised elsewhere in the legislation. An amount is only deductible for tax puiposes if permitted under Part D of the Income Tax Act 2007. Under Part D, an amount is generally only deductible for tax purposes if it has been incurred. This is unlikely to be the case for credit impairment provisions. The exception is for dealers in financial instruments who are allowed a deduction under the financial arrangement rules. However, even where a PIE meets the definition of a dealer, there is a lack of clarity as to whether the PIE timing rule or financial arrangement rules take precedence. Disallowing deductions for these provisions (which would occur if no government action is taken) would give rise to significant transitional issues (both from a compliance and administration cost perspective). This is because, from consultation, we understand that the majority of PIEs have followed the scheme of the PIE rules and the treatment under the financial arrangement rules for dealers and claimed a deduction for their credit impairment provisions. However, disallowing deductions for credit impairment provisions would be consistent with the treatment of individual investors (a core objective of the PIE rules) and other lenders (such as banks and finance companies). Adopting a consistent treatment between PIE lenders and other lenders avoids creating pressure from other lenders to allow them tax deductions for credit impairment (and other accounting) provisions. Question and objectives The question addressed is whether PIEs should be able to obtain a tax deduction for their credit impairment or doubtful debt provisions. Since 1995, tax policy in New Zealand has been developed in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process. Regulatory Impact Statement - PIE credit impairments | 2 Analysis of this issue has applied the framework of tax policy principles outlined in the Tax Review 2001. These are that the key focus of tax policy is to enhance the overall economic well-being of New Zealanders by seeking ways to reduce the costs of imposing taxes - or making the tax system more efficient - while promoting fairness and continuing to raise sufficient revenue. Tax design should be guided by generally accepted principles of fairness, namely that people in the same position should be treated similarly, that people should contribute in accordance with their ability to pay, and that tax reform should be transparent and prospective. Taxes will generally impose economic costs, because they induce individuals to make decisions that they would not have made in the absence of the tax. At its broadest, excess burden includes the costs of misallocating scarce economic resources, tax administration by government and tax compliance by taxpayers. Regulatory impact analysis Two options for resolving the uncertainty around tax deductions for PIE credit impairment provisions were identified: • Amend the PIE timing rules to prevent tax deductions for credit impairment provisions and bad debts to the extent that individual capital account investors would not qualify for deductions. » Amend the PIE timing rules to allow a deduction for credit impairment provisions where the underlying loss would eventually be tax deductible. The option of allowing a deduction for bad debts was discounted because PIEs are unable to deal with timing differences as a result of their daily unit pricing obligations and multiple investor tax rates. This was confirmed during consultation. Option one: Disallowing a deduction for credit impairment provisions and bad debts Option one involves amending the PIE rules to prevent a tax deduction for credit impairment provisions and bad debts. Economic and compliance impacts Option one ensures a more consistent treatment with individual investors (a core objective of the PIE rules), as summarised in the following table. Lender on capital account (individual investor) Lender on revenue account (business lender) Dealer in financial arrangements Credit impairment provision No deduction No deduction Deduction under financial arrangement rules Bad debts Generally, no deduction for capital Deduction for both interest and capital When debt written off Deduction for both interest and capital if credit impairment deduction has not already been claimed Regulatory Impact Statement - PIE credit impairments | 3 Fiscal impacts An amendment to prevent PIEs from claiming a tax deduction for credit impairments and bad debts is potentially tightening the existing rules. We have been unable to quantify the exact fiscal impact of this option. However, this is unlikely to involve significant revenue as from consultation we understand that the majority of PIEs have already claimed tax deductions for their credit impairment provisions. Aligning the PIE treatment with that already available to individual investors also avoids pressure from other lenders (such as banks and finance companies) to allow them tax deductions for credit impairment (and other accounting) provisions. Extending tax deductions for credit impairment or other accounting provisions generally would have a significant fiscal cost. For example, allowing a tax deduction for credit impairment provisions held by banks would have an estimated one-off fiscal cost of $250 million 1 . This option also avoids the risk of taxpayers manipulating the level of deductions. By disallowing a deduction for both doubtful and bad debts, option one also avoids creating a deferred tax problem for PIEs. Social, cultural and environmental impacts No impacts identified. Option two: Allowing a deduction for credit impairment provisions Option two involves amending the PIE rules to allow a deduction for credit impairment provisions at the point that these are reflected in the unit price. Economic and compliance impacts This treatment is consistent with the scheme of the PIE rules. The PIE timing provision is intended to avoid timing differences and ensure investor equity over time. Because of their flow through treatment, the changing mix of investors and multiple tax rates, timing differences create significant compliance and investor equity issues for PIEs. This is because PIEs are unable to estimate which taxpayers (at which tax rates) will be investors at the time that tax timing adjustments reverse. Amending the PIE rules to allow a deduction for credit impairment provisions at the point that these are reflected in the unit price would be consistent with New Zealand's comprehensive income tax which aims to tax the economic definition of income (excluding capital gains) as closely as possible. Credit impairment provisions are an estimate of the economic loss that investors will suffer. These provisions flow into the unit price and can result in an actual fiscal loss where investors leave the fund. 1 This was the estimated fiscal cost, in 2007 and is now likely to be significantly higher due to the impact of the global financial crisis. Regulatory Impact Statement - PIE credit impairments | 4 For example, a fund has one investor who invests $100. The unit price is $100. Due to deteriorating economic conditions, the fund expects a 50% loss. A $50 credit impairment provision is created, which reduces the unit price to $50. If the investor leaves the fund, they will have suffered a $50 economic loss. As such, there is an argument to support a tax deduction for the impairment provision. Option two is also consistent with the approach for dealers under the financial arrangement rules. Dealers in financial instruments are able to adopt a market value option whereby financial arrangement income or expenditure is calculated as the change in the market value in the course of an income year. This effectively allows a deduction for credit impairments which impact on the market price. This treatment is consistent with the fact that taxpayers who adopt this option pay tax on an accruals basis where their financial arrangements increase in value over an income year. In order to adopt the market valuation method, the Commissioner must have approved the market and the source of information used to determine market values or the taxpayer must demonstrate that market prices are available. While amending the PIE rules to allow a deduction for credit impairment provisions at the point that these are reflected in the unit price, does offer advantages in terms of consistency of treatment with scheme of the PIE regime, economic definition of income and treatment under the financial arrangement rules, it does have some disadvantages. This option would be inconsistent with the treatment of individual investors, and would open up a tax deduction for credit impairment provisions to a wider group of taxpayers, creating a differential treatment between PIE lenders and other lenders, for example trading banks. While there are arguments to support a differential treatment (for example, the compliance costs associated with daily unit pricing and multiple tax rates), it may be difficult to maintain a boundary between PIEs and other lenders. Due to its wider application, option two also has a greater risk of taxpayers manipulating the level of deductions. This risk is increased under the PIE rules due to the fact that tax losses and excess tax credits are cashed-out to investors. Investors receive an actual cash rebate which increases the incentives to claim greater deductions by inflating the level of the credit impairment provision. There are some natural restrictions on the manipulation of PIE credit impairment provisions: • The majority of PIEs consider that they meet the definition of a dealer under the financial arrangement rules. As such, the valuation of these provisions would be subject to the same controls that exist for an approved market under the financial arrangement rules. The exception is mortgage investment funds. These PIEs do not trade their financial arrangements. As such, they would currently not be eligible for a credit impairment deduction under the financial arrangement rules. Amending the PIE rules to allow a deduction for credit impairment provisions would therefore be an extension of the current treatment for these funds. There is also unlikely to be an Regulatory Impact Statement - PIE credit impairments | 5 approved market value for these investments, which increases the fiscal risk regarding valuation of provisions. • Credit impairment provisions impact on the unit price which is detrimental to retaining and attracting investors. The protection offered by the unit price may be less effective where a fund has deteriorated to the point where it has been closed to new investors. However, even where a fund is closed, trustees still have fiduciary duties to ensure a correct unit price. • Credit impairment provisions form part of audited IFRS accounts. • The PIE rules also contain the 20% single investor ownership restriction which should prevent a single investor from controlling PIE decisions on provisioning. Fiscal impacts As the majority of managed funds have been using the PIE timing rule as the authority to claim tax deductions for credit impairment provisions, a technical change to ensure sufficient authority for the underlying tax deductions should be revenue neutral as these costs are already within baselines. Fiscal concerns around those PIEs that have not already claimed a tax deduction for their credit impairment provisions could be addressed through transitional rules. There is precedent for retrospective tax changes which confirm the tax position already taken by taxpayers, but would not allow other PIEs to retrospectively claim tax deductions for these provisions. This treatment is also consistent with the fact that PIEs, due to their daily unit pricing and multiple investor tax rates, would have difficultly retrospectively claiming a tax deduction. It is also a timing issue, as these PIEs will be able to claim a tax deduction at the point that the law is changed. Social, cultural and environmental impacts No impacts identified. Consultation As this issue impacts on the daily unit pricing of managed funds and it is understood that the majority of managed funds have been using the PIE timing rules as the authority to claim tax deductions for credit impairment provisions, there is a pressing need to provide operational certainty for the industry. As a result, this issue has not been subject to the full generic tax policy process. However, analysis on this issue has applied the framework of principles outlined in the Government Statement of Regulation and Tax Review 2001. The key focus of tax policy is to enhance the overall economic well-being of New Zealanders by seeking ways to reduce the costs of imposing taxes while promoting fairness and continuing to raise sufficient revenue. As part of this analysis, officials consulted with the Investment Savings and Insurance Association, Trustee Coiporations Association of New Zealand Inc, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Regulatory Impact Statement - PIE credit impairments | 6 Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte, KPMG and Ernst & Young. Consultation took the form of meetings. The majority of the industry supported option two. It did not support amending the tax treatment to align with individual investors as this framework is not applied consistently. While PIEs have been granted a capital account treatment for their Australasian equity investments, financial arrangement investments are taxed on an accrual basis. This treatment was also seen as giving rise to significant transitional issues (both from a compliance and administration cost perspective) as the majority of PIEs have followed the scheme of the PIE rules and the treatment under the financial arrangement rules for dealers. As such, restricting tax deductions would be seen as a taxpayer unfavourable retrospective change to the legislation. It would require most PIEs to amend tax positions already taken and also create significant compliance costs with respect to unit pricing and investor equity issues where investors have changed over time. The industry therefore supports amending the PIE rules to provide a tax deduction under option two. The industry considers that concerns around fiscal cost and valuation of provisions are addressed by the fiduciary duties placed on trustees, protection provided by the unit price and normal commercial practices followed to calculate the level of any credit impairment. This consultation highlighted the compliance costs of disallowing a deduction for PIE credit impairment provisions and led to the recommendation of option two, which was a change from the initial policy position. Conclusions and recommendations Option one involves amending the PIE rules to prevent a tax deduction for credit impairment provisions and bad debts. This would ensure a more consistent treatment with individual investors (a core objective of the PIE rules) and avoid pressure from other lenders (such as banks and finance companies) to also allow them tax deductions for credit impairment (and other accounting) provisions. Option one also avoids the risk of taxpayers manipulating the level of deductions. Option two involves amending the PIE rules to allow a deduction for credit impairment provisions at the point that these are reflected in the unit price. This treatment is consistent with the scheme of the PIE rules and New Zealand's comprehensive income tax which aims to tax the economic definition of income (excluding capital gains) as closely as possible. It is also consistent with the approach for dealers under the financial arrangement rules who can adopt a market value option, which effectively allows a deduction for credit impairments which impact on the market price. Option two would provide a tax deduction for credit impairment provisions to a wider group of taxpayers, creating a differential treatment between PIE lenders and other lenders, for example trading banks. It also carries a greater risk of taxpayers manipulating the level of deductions. Regulatory Impact Statement - PIE credit impairments | 7 In general, the industry does not support amending the tax treatment of credit impairment provisions to align with individual investors as this framework is not applied consistently. Disallowing deductions for these provisions is seen as giving rise to significant transitional issues (both from a compliance and administration cost perspective) as the majority of PIEs have followed the scheme of the PIE rules and the treatment under the financial arrangement rules for dealers. The industry considers that concerns around fiscal cost and valuation of provisions under option two are addressed by the fiduciary duties placed on trustees, protection provided by the unit price and normal commercial practices followed to calculate the level of any credit impairment. On the basis of this consultation and the reasoning set out above, officials recommend a change to allow PIEs a tax deduction for credit impairment provisions where they apply a market valuation basis under the financial arrangement rules (i.e. option 2). Implementation Implementing the amendments will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. These amendments could be included in the taxation bill intended to be introduced in July 2010. It is recommended that the change is retrospective to the start of the PIE regime. However, to ensure the clarification is fair to PIEs and investors, transitional rules should confirm tax positions already taken without allowing PIEs to retrospectively claim tax deductions for these provisions. There is precedent for retrospective tax changes which confirm the tax position already taken by taxpayers. This treatment is also consistent with the fact that PIEs, due to their daily unit pricing and multiple investor tax rates, would have difficultly retrospectively claiming a tax deduction. It is also a timing issue, as these PIEs will be able to claim a tax deduction at the point that the debts are written off. The proposed option would minimise compliance costs for taxpayers by confirming the tax positions already taken. Officials would also publish further information on the changes in the Inland Revenue's Taxation Information Bulletin to assist taxpayer's in confirming their tax positions. Officials would consult with the managed funds industry in developing the necessary changes to the legislation to ensure that the changes result in certainty of treatment for credit impairment provisions. Any amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 would also be subject to the normal select committee process. As a result, the managed funds industry would have an opportunity to submit on the proposed clarification to ensure that this achieves the necessary certainty of treatment for credit impairment provisions. The Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue liaises closely with Inland Revenue's Large Enterprises assurance team responsible for auditing PIE returns. As part of this ongoing relationship, confirmation would be sought that the proposed change results in certainty of treatment for credit impairment provisions.

3 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM 1. This statement considers detailed design options for implementing legislation to provide for an “income-sharing tax credit” for couples with dependent children in New Zealand. 2. Couples are currently taxed as individuals, rather than on a family basis. There are a number of social assistance measures for families, such as Working for Families (WFF) tax credits, childcare assistance, and paid parental leave. WFF tax credits and income-tested benefits are calculated on the basis of the couples combined income. Further information on current support for families with children in New Zealand is set out in Chapter 2 of the April 2008 discussion document Income splitting for families with children. 3. Couples with children often face a choice between both parents working full- time, employing others to care for their children, and one parent working full-time and the other staying at home to care for the children, possibly on a part-time basis. For most people, financial considerations play a large role in the decision. 4. Introducing some form of income-splitting for tax purposes would enable some parents to have a greater choice in their work and caring roles. It may also help to alleviate the financial constraints on parents being able to stay at home, and give parents more choice around their work and home life balance. Decisions already taken and process to date 5. Two current forms of financial assistance – paid parental leave and the parental tax credit – have similar objectives to the proposal. However, these are only available for the first few months of a child’s life. 6. The proposal reflects a key part of UnitedFuture’s tax policy, which is intended to assist couples with dependent children. National agreed “to support appropriate income splitting legislation to First Reading in Parliament” in the confidence and supply agreement between National and UnitedFuture. Therefore, this statement focuses on the design and delivery of an appropriate form of income splitting that best achieves the desired objectives, having regard to principles of good tax policy. 7. The final design of the income-sharing tax credit closely mirrors the proposal in the December 2009 issues paper An income splitting tax credit for families with children. Submissions received on the issues paper helped to inform our final recommendations on the design of the tax credit. The issues paper was informed by submissions on the April 2008 discussion document. The discussion document considered the extent to which income splitting would provide choice to families with children. It also assessed income splitting against generally accepted tax policy criteria. 8. There are four key design choices to be made and this statement addresses each of these in turn. 4 OBJECTIVES 9. The objectives of the proposed income-sharing tax credit, indicated in UnitedFuture’s income splitting policy, are to: • give parents greater choice in their work and caring roles; • acknowledge the contributions of those who forego paid work to care for children; and • give families with children additional financial support. 10. The income-sharing tax credit is not intended to duplicate other social assistance measures which focus on ensuring the adequacy of family income from week to week. 11. While meeting the specified objectives, appropriate legislation should, as far as possible, take account of the tax policy design criteria of fairness, efficiency, simplicity and administrative costs. The April 2008 discussion document provides a detailed assessment of income splitting against these criteria. 12. In order to achieve the desired objectives of the tax credit we have drawn heavily on the rules for delivering the WFF tax credits. This would help to keep administrative and compliance costs down and reduce overall complexity. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 13. The final design of the income-sharing tax credit closely reflects the proposal in the December 2009 issues paper. The amount of the tax credit would be the difference between the tax that is payable by the couple and the tax they would pay if each partner derived half of the couple’s combined income (50:50 income-sharing). 14. The income-sharing tax credit would give some couples greater freedom to make decisions to work fewer or more flexible hours of paid work in order to care for children, by increasing their combined after-tax income. For eligible couples, the credit would provide up to $9,080 per year. Approximately half of the credits paid would exceed $1,000, while the mean credit value would be nearer to $2,000. The moderate size of the credit limits any incentives for unwanted behaviour, such as “gaming”. A table showing the value of the credit for various combinations of incomes is shown in the Appendix. The number of couples who would benefit is shown in the analysis of the options for the age limit for eligibility, below. 15. The credit would not be available to all families with children and in particular would not assist sole parents. The most significant gains would go to higher single income households with the lowest gains going to low-income families. We estimate that 78% of the value of credits paid will go to couples with joint income of $70,000 or more. No credit would be payable to partners with the same marginal tax rate. For these reasons, a number of agencies have questioned whether it is the best-targeted method of achieving the policy objectives. 5 16. The likely effects on labour participation and gender equity have also raised concern. Secondary earners, who are mostly women, would have weaker incentives to participate in the labour market, and to invest in their careers. The credit could encourage partners to take specialised roles and increase the pay gap between men and women. 17. The proposed legislation may result in discrimination on the grounds of marital status that may be inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. It may be difficult to justify some of the discrimination identified. 18. The four key design choices and their impacts are outlined below. Age limit for eligibility of the “dependent child” 19. We considered two options with respect to the age limit for eligibility of a couple’s dependent child: under six years of age, or under 18 years of age. Option 1: Age limit for eligibility of six years 20. Parents of pre-school children are more likely to sacrifice paid work to care for children, and to need additional financial support. The lower age limit would also be consistent with the Future Focus policy of work-testing domestic purposes benefit recipients whose youngest child has turned six. Option 2: Age limit for eligibility of 18 years 21. Setting the age limit at 18 is consistent with the eligibility rules for WFF tax credits and with parents’ legal responsibilities under the Care of Children Act 2004. The majority of submissions in response to the issues paper supported this option. Impacts Option 1 Under 6 years Option 2 Under 18 years Impact: how many couples are expected to benefit? 150,000 310,000 Revenue cost: (for the 2012-13 tax year) $240 million $460 million Administrative costs for Inland Revenue for the first 5 years: Capital cost Annual operating costs $2 to $3 million $2 to $3 million $2 to $3 million $3 to $4 million 22. In relation to option 2, the WFF definition of a “child” excludes a person in a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship. This exclusion is likely to be seen as discriminatory against younger teenagers who are legally married (possibly at a young age in another country) but remain dependent on a parent or guardian. 6 23. On balance, and particularly given the difference in revenue cost, our preferred option is to limit the credit to couples with a dependent child’s age limit for eligibility of six years. Principal caregiver 24. Rules are needed to identify whether a couple is in fact responsible for the care of that dependent child. To achieve this, it is proposed that a partner in the couple must be the “principal caregiver” of the dependent child. Two options are considered for determining who that person is. Option 1: WFF definition of “principal caregiver” 25. For WFF purposes a principal caregiver is the person, whether or not a parent of the child, with the primary responsibility for the day-to-day care of a dependent child, other than on a temporary basis. Option 2: restrictive definition of “principal caregiver” 26. This option would restrict the definition of “principal caregiver” to more- narrowly target those persons who personally care for the child – for example, the child could be required to live in the same household throughout the year and couples where both partners work fulltime could be excluded. This definition would exclude those arrangements where the person is not personally caring for the child – for example, when the child is at boarding school. Impacts 27. The fiscal cost of option 2 would be lower than that calculated for option 1, as fewer couples would be eligible for the tax credit, and it may be better targeted in terms of the objectives that relate to parents balancing their work and caring roles. However, option 2 would also be more complex, inconsistent with WFF, and might be seen as unfair, particularly when compared with the proposed shared care rules. It would also disadvantage some couples, such as those whose children attend boarding school, compared to other couples in otherwise similar circumstances. 28. We support option 1 for reasons of fairness, administrative ease and simplicity. Administration of the income-sharing tax credit 29. We considered two options for when the tax credit could be paid out. Option 1: interim payments 30. This option involves estimating a couple’s taxable incomes in advance in order to pay interim instalments during the year. 7 Option 2: annual tax credit 31. This option involves the calculation and payment of the credit at the end of the year, based on the couple’s assessed taxable incomes for the tax year. Impacts 32. WFF tax credit rules provide for both of these payment options, with most recipients preferring interim instalments. Option 1 would give families a cashflow benefit by providing a payment during their first year of eligibility, but it would increase administration and compliance costs by requiring estimates of income, many more individual payments, an end-of-year square-up, and recovery of any overpaid amounts. 33. The administrative and compliance costs of option 2 would be much lower. We support option 2. Departures from WFF 34. The income-sharing tax credit rules have drawn heavily from the WFF rules in order to keep administrative and compliance costs down. We expect that approximately 60% of recipients would be WFF customers, already providing the information needed to determine their eligibility for the tax credit at the end of each year. In some cases, however, it has been necessary to consider different rules to reflect the different objectives underpinning the different types of assistance. The three key areas where we have recommended departing from the WFF rules are: • the principal caregiver test in “share care” situations; • whether the tax credit should be apportioned in certain circumstances; and • the residency rules for couples. Principal caregiver test in “shared care” situations 35. We considered two options for determining an appropriate test for “principal caregiver” in shared care situations. 36. The first option is to use the WFF “principal caregiver” test for determining a couple’s eligibility for the credit in shared care situations (when a child has, on the face of it, two or more principal caregivers, living apart). This test treats a person as a principal caregiver if a dependent child is in their exclusive care for at least one-third of a four-month period, the tax year, or an “entitlement period”. Adopting this option would add significant complexity particularly for people that do not currently receive WFF tax credits. We are not convinced that this complexity is justified given the relatively low value of the tax credit and the fact that its objectives do not include WFF’s strong focus on the “adequacy” of family income in the short-term. 8 37. The second option, which we prefer, is to use a modified version of the WFF “principal caregiver” test. This option simply requires exclusive care for at least one- third of the relevant tax year. Full or partial entitlement in shared care situations 38. The tax credit could be apportioned based on the proportion of the tax year when a couple has a dependent child in their exclusive care. For example, if a couple cares for a child for 40% of the year they would be eligible for 40% of the credit they would receive if they had exclusive care of the child throughout the tax year. This is the rule that applies for the purposes of the WFF family tax credit. Alternatively, if two couples satisfy the one-third of the tax year test both couples could be given the full entitlement. 39. Apportioning the tax credit would reflect the amount of time a parent is likely to be caring for a child in the home. However, the impact of shared care arrangements on a parent’s capacity for paid work may exceed the period of exclusive care. By one measure, apportionment could reduce the annual revenue cost of the proposal by up to $12 million, with an age limit for eligibility of 18, or up to $6 million with an age limit for eligibility of six. However, these estimates are likely to significantly overstate the potential saving because they do not take into account, for example, other children in the couple’s care. 40. On balance, we do not favour apportionment. This approach would be difficult to administer and would lead to complexity and uncertainty for those seeking to obtain a tax credit. It could also encourage couples to seek or report a higher percentage of shared care to obtain a greater credit. While the apportionment approach is used for WFF’s “family tax credit”, it is not used for the “in-work tax credit”. In this regard, the in-work tax credit and income-sharing tax credit are both focussed more on questions of work-home choices rather than income adequacy. Residency of the couple 41. The issues paper proposed a multi-layered residency test for both partners, as used for principal caregivers in WFF in situations where the dependent child is not resident and present in New Zealand. These WFF tests cover specific policy concerns in the WFF area and are more complex than the residency tests for income tax purposes. Consequently, for the income-sharing tax credit we now favour using a simpler test – that is, both partners must be resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes for the whole of the relevant tax year. Again, the “whole year” requirement reduces the potential for manipulation and would minimise compliance and administrative costs. It would also be straightforward to apply at the end of the tax year when the couple’s claim for the tax credit is assessed. 9 CONSULTATION 42. There were 205 submissions in response to the April 2008 discussion document. Of these, 90%, mostly from individuals, supported some form of income splitting for tax purposes on the grounds that it recognises the contribution of full-time parents in their homes and communities, strengthens the family unit, balances assistance to parents in the workforce, reduces emigration incentives, or reduces the impact of fiscal drag. Most submissions supported limiting eligibility to married couples, civil union partners and de facto couples with a dependent child up to 18 years of age. The majority of submitters also considered that income splitting should be optional and based on a 50/50 split. 43. There were 55 submissions received in response to the December 2009 issues paper. Sixty-nine percent supported the annual tax credit proposal, with 20% opposing it and the remainder neither supporting nor opposing. Supporters argued that parents taking a greater role in the care of their children would be beneficial for children and society, or that the tax credit would provide financial relief for the family. Opponents believed the scheme was not well targeted, would have a high revenue cost and could discourage secondary earners from taking paid work. Comments on the specific design features of the proposal were mostly supportive of the proposed approach. 44. In addition to considering public submissions on the issues paper, a number of other agencies have been consulted on the proposal. Their comments are summarised below. 45. The Department of Labour highlighted the policy’s potential to reduce the incentives for secondary earners, in particular, to participate in the labour force and to invest in their own training and development. In some cases, primary earners’ labour market incentives could also be reduced by the income effect of receiving a “windfall” tax credit. 46. The Ministry of Women’s Affairs pointed out that women and the economy benefit from women being in the labour force through higher lifetime earnings, protection against poverty, and provision of a much-needed resource given New Zealand’s aging population and shortage of skilled workers. By increasing effective marginal tax rates for secondary earners, who are mostly women, the proposal would encourage partners to have specialised roles, discouraging women’s participation in the workforce and increasing their share of unpaid work. This, the Ministry says, appears inconsistent with the government’s policy on labour force participation and the growing desire among younger people to more equally share work and the care of children. The Ministry also considered the proposal to be unfair to sole parent families, because they cannot receive the tax credit, and to low income families where there are two earners with similar income levels. The Ministry preferred other ways of supporting the ability of families to choose to stay at home and look after their children, such as extending paid parental leave. 10 47. The Ministry of Social Development commented that the income splitting proposal would provide additional income for a limited population, with the most significant gains being for higher single-income households and lowest gains for low- income families. Couples who have similar working hours (and arguably therefore are likely to share child minding responsibilities) would receive minimal, if any, gains, given that couples on the same marginal tax rate would not gain from the proposal. The proposal would be unlikely to greatly improve incentives to enter work for low-income unemployed families. Further, it would not target assistance to those who most need it. 48. The Treasury has not been involved with the detailed policy design of the proposed income-sharing tax credit. This is largely due to their other commitments and priorities in delivering the government’s tax policy work programme. However, the Treasury has provided the following comment: The Treasury considers that the credit is poorly targeted and has negative distributional impacts, as 78 percent of the benefits are expected to accrue to families earning over $70,000 per annum. In addition, the fiscal cost of the proposal, estimated to be $502 million per annum by the end of the Budget 2011 forecast period, will be more than 45% of new spending in Budget 2011 if progressed. Given the substantial fiscal cost, and the minor economic benefits, Treasury does not recommend introducing an income-sharing tax credit. 49. The Ministry of Justice was consulted on the human rights implications of the proposal. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 50. Our preferred approach to implementation of UnitedFuture’s income splitting policy involves an annual “income-sharing tax credit” payable to eligible families with dependent children up to 6 years of age. 51. A couple would be eligible to apply for a tax credit if they satisfy all the following criteria for the relevant year: • the couple must be married or in a de facto or civil union relationship for the whole of the relevant tax year; • both partners must be tax-resident for the whole of the relevant tax year; and • at least one of the partners must be a “principal caregiver” of a dependent child. 52. In a shared care situation, a person may be a “principal caregiver” if they have exclusive care of a dependent child for at least one-third of the tax year and may receive a full tax credit. 53. The credit would be calculated as the difference between the tax that is payable by the couple and the tax they would pay if each partner derived half of the couple’s combined income. 11 54. In keeping with WFF rules, there would be a pro rata adjustment to the full year credit when a couple’s dependent child is eligible for less than a full tax year. 55. The credit would be administered by Inland Revenue and paid through the WFF system at the end of the relevant tax year. 56. The value of the credit would be unaffected by other entitlements or obligations of the partners. 57. To be consistent with the treatment of other social policy payments, a partner in a couple receiving the credit would not be eligible to receive the independent earner tax credit. 12 IMPLEMENTATION Legislation 58. Implementing the income-sharing tax credit rules would require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. These amendments will be included in a tax bill planned for introduction in July 2010. In addition, if the legislation is passed, amendments will be needed to take account of the effect of the credit on after-tax income for certain social assistance purposes. 59. Eligible couples would be able to apply for the tax credit for the tax year starting from 1 April 2012. Implementation risks 60. The proposed rules would add a new task for Inland Revenue, but taking an end- of-year credit approach and aligning much of the design with WFF, where appropriate, would help to keep administration and compliance costs down. Interactions with existing legislation 61. The assumption of income sharing between partners would not be used as the basis for determining other tax obligations or for determining child support liabilities or student loan repayments. Social assistance benefits are already income-tested based on a couple’s joint income. However, some changes to the rules for other assistance payments are needed to take account of the income-sharing tax credit. 62. A couple who receives an income-sharing tax credit for a tax year should be excluded from receiving an independent earner tax credit during that year. This is consistent with the treatment of not allowing an independent earner tax credit where a person is in receipt of other social policy payments, such as WFF tax credits, income- tested benefits and superannuation. This exclusion also reduces the overall cost of the proposal. We estimate that, if the age limit for eligibility is 18, excluding income- sharing tax credit recipients from receiving the independent earner tax credit would reduce independent earner tax credits by up to $19 million. If the age limit for eligibility is six, the savings would be up to $10 million. These revenue savings are uncertain due to behavioural factors, and are not taken into account in the revenue costings provided in this statement. 63. There are several instances where social assistance regulations may need to be amended, as a result of the income-sharing tax credit on couples’ after-tax income. For example, we will be reporting to the Minister of Revenue on the level of the minimum family tax credit for the 2012–13 and later tax years. Setting this level is an annual process. 64. WFF tax credits are treated as “chargeable income” for hardship assistance (such as Temporary Additional Support). The income-sharing tax credit should be treated in the same manner as lump sum WFF tax credits for social assistance 13 purposes. If the proposed legislation is passed, the Ministry of Social Development will seek approval for consequential amendments to incorporate the income-sharing tax credit as chargeable income for supplementary assistance purposes, in the same manner that WFF tax credits are treated. Enforcement strategy to ensure that the preferred option achieves its public policy objectives 65. Drawing, where appropriate, on systems developed for WFF purposes would help to achieve the desired policy objectives. 66. Information provided for one purpose under the Tax Acts would assist in verifying information provided for purposes of the income-sharing tax credit. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 67. Inland Revenue monitors its administration of the tax system through a range of periodic indicators, such as a regular Customer Satisfaction Survey, and through its Complaints Management System. 68. Inland Revenue has internal processes for staff to bring policy issues to the attention of Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division, and has regular meetings with tax professionals and specific industry groups. 69. Social policy initiatives, in particular, are subject to considerable public and academic interest and scrutiny. Inland Revenue would take note of any external evaluations of the impacts of the policy, and bring them to the attention of the Minister of Revenue when appropriate. Significant concerns identified, internally or externally, regarding the impacts of the legislation would be considered for review as part of the Tax Policy Work Programme. Appendix Amount of the income-sharing tax credit The annual payment to couples with various combinations of incomes is set out in the table below. For example, if partner A’s income is $40,000 and the partner B’s is $10,000, the amount of the income-sharing tax credit would be $280. The figures in the table are based on the tax rates that will apply from 1 October 2010, as a result of the recent Budget.

1 Regulatory Impact Statement E XECUTIVE SUMMARY Changes are proposed to Inland Revenue’s administration of the student loan scheme to improve the overall integrity of the scheme, and reduce compliance costs and administrative pressures. The social policy programmes administered by Inland Revenue have, over recent years, greatly increased Inland Revenue’s customer base: for example, there were 58,000 new student loan borrowers in the 2007 –08 tax year. The current student loan system is complex, unwieldy, expensive to maintain, and has limited ability to accommodate further changes. Each policy change made has exposed underlying system issues, which require corrective action and have the potential to destabilise both the student loan and core tax collection systems. The student loan scheme represents a significant asset to the government , which needs to be managed effectively to protect the value of this asset, and better manage the cost of the student loan scheme to the Crown. The policy changes proposed include a move towards treating different forms of income differently, both in terms of repayment obligations and administrative process. This proposal requires an emphasis on “close enough is good enough” over accuracy. The proposed reforms aim to improve the rate and timeliness of repayments, improve Inland Revenue’s ability to handle growth in customer numbers and enable the department to deliver new government initiatives more efficiently. The proposals will have an impact on borrowers. Most borrowers will benefit from the changes, but some will be disadvantaged. Proposals to reduce borrower debt, such as applying overpaid repayment deductions to the loan balance will disadvantage some borrowers. Although this may be seen as having a negative impact on borrowers in the short term, it will ultimately benefit borrowers by reducing their debt level thereby shortening their repayment times. The policy changes proposed will increase student loan receipts – growing from $5 million in the 2010/11 year to $18 million in the 2012/13 and subsequent years. Ministers have previously agreed to redesign the student loan computer system and therefore the proposed changes will be implemented at the same time with no further administrative costs. ADEQUACY STATEMENT Inland Revenue has reviewed this Regulatory Impact Statement, and considers that the statement is adequate according to the Regulatory Impact Analysis adequacy criteria. STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM Since 1992, when the student loan scheme was introduced, borrowers have been required to square up their loan repayments made during the tax year. Salary and wage earners have student loan repayments deducted from their income each pay day. Borrowers with other income (who have residual repayment obligations over $1,000) have to make interim instalments three times a year. This is the process for collecting income tax. The process ensures accuracy but generates small over or under payments, with the majority of overpayments being applied to the loan and 2 underpayments being collected by Inland Revenue. This results in both compliance and administrative costs. The current system is based on a tax system where accuracy is important and timeliness and cost effectiveness is less so. This is appropriate where money is being transferred from an individual to the state. However, for student loan repayments, accuracy has an impact on the time required to repay the loan, and any money applied to the loan is to the benefit of the borrower. In order for some borrowers to access a consolidated loan balance they have to interact with two agencies, increasing compliance costs. They contact StudyLink for the balance of amounts drawn down in the current year, and Inland Revenue for amounts drawn down in past years. There are costs for both borrowers and Inland Revenue in undertaking the end-of-year square-up process. This is currently a paper-based process which is similar to income tax and ensures accuracy. This system is costly to administer and its growing borrower base reduces Inland Revenue’s ability to handle this growth in the future. Also, the end-of-year filing for student loans can conflict with other policies, such as the non- filing concept, which aims to remove the requirement for taxpayers to square up their income tax affairs at year-end. Requiring student loan borrowers to file brings them back into the income tax return process. The administration of the interest free policy requires StudyLink to impose interest, which for domestic borrowers is written off by Inland Revenue. This imposes excessive administration costs. There is a significant number of overseas-based borrowers who are not complying with their obligations. Inland Revenue’s main channels for communicating with borrowers are by mail or by telephone. For overseas-based borrowers, these two methods are either not timely or convenient. As these borrowers move around a lot, it is difficult to keep track of their addresses. Where a borrower fails to make their student loan repayments, they are subject to a compounding late payment penalty of 1.5 percent per month, which equates to 19.56 percent per annum, and can escalate outstanding debt to a point where the amount cannot be repaid, and either it remains unpaid or hardship relief is provided. There are currently over 530,000 student loan borrowers and the nominal value of the scheme is $9.573 billion. The student loan portfolio is growing rapidly and is forecast to grow to $14.5 billion by 2014–15. Currently, lending exceeds repayments with the total amount borrowed in 2007–08 being $1.2 billion, and the total repayments of approximately $550 million. A large and growing student loan debt is likely to have an impact on the decisions of overseas-based borrowers on whether to return to New Zealand. The penalties imposed on student loans is outdated and can provide an incentive to pay other outstanding taxes, with higher penalties, ahead of student loans. OBJECTIVE The main objectives are to: • Increase administrative efficiency by redeploying resources from the end of year square up to higher value activities such as debt collection and enhanced services to borrowers; 3 • Reduce the growth in outstanding debt; • Enable borrowers to self-manage their loan through online services; and • Reduce overall compliance costs for borrowers. ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS Retaining the status quo and retaining the end-of-year square-up was considered as an option, but discarded as the current compliance and administrative costs will remain for the majority of borrowers (salary and wage earners) and will retain the current risks to Inland Revenue. Also considered was the option of relying on the changes to the student loan scheme computer system and retaining the end-of-year square-up for salary and wage earners with higher thresholds. Although moving to a new computer system will produce administrative gains and reduce the problems in the short term, the underlying problems of a growing borrower population and increasing student loan debt will remain. Addressing these problems requires a fundamental review of the administrative legislation, focussing on reforming the basis of assessment by moving to a more frequent assessment period. PREFERRED OPTION The preferred option is to move towards a pay-period basis of assessment for salary and wage earners. The key features of this option are as follows: • Removing the end-of-year square-up for salary and wage earners with student loan liabilities being based on the amount deducted each pay. This will reduce administration and compliance costs. • For salary and wage earners, significant underpayments will be collected from future pays, reducing the extent of outstanding debt. • Salary and wage earners who have interest, dividend and Māori Authority income below a combined threshold of $1,500 will not be subject to a repayment obligation on this income. • Borrowers with other income will continue to have an end-of-year square-up, and one- third of their liability will be due on each of three interim repayment dates during the year. • The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be given a wide discretion to set the thresholds for taking corrective action in relation to under-deducted repayments from salary and wages. This will enable the Commissioner to allocate resources to higher value activities, especially with a growing borrower base. • The vast majority of interactions between borrowers and Inland Revenue will be electronic to reduce compliance costs for borrowers and enable Inland Revenue to cope with a growing borrower base. • The charging of interest will be the sole responsibility of Inland Revenue. This will address the current problem where interest is charged by StudyLink on student loans and then for most borrowers is written off by Inland Revenue. • StudyLink will share information with Inland Revenue on loans drawn down in order to provide borrowers with a consolidated loan balance in one place. 4 • Reducing borrowers exposure to penalties by replacing late payment penalties with a more moderate interest charge, but otherwise align incentives to pay the correct amount on time with those for payment of income tax. • All borrowers will be able to undertake a wider range of activities in a new portal environment and ability to see a consolidated loan balance in one place. This will increase the extent to which borrowers can self-manage their affairs and will reduce the growing administrative pressure on Inland Revenue. Benefits The proposals will be a significant step in enabling Inland Revenue to: • protect government revenue and improve the integrity of the tax system. • focus its resources on higher value tasks rather than manual processing, to cope more efficiently with an expanding borrower base, reduce compliance costs, and deliver better services to borrowers. • respond to, and deliver, new government initiatives more efficiently than now. Borrowers will benefit from the proposals and have reduced compliance costs in the following circumstances: • Borrowers who have an underpayment below the level set by the Commissioner. These borrowers will not be required to repay the underpayment in the current year. • Borrowers who have an outstanding liability. The interest rate charged will be lower than the current late payment penalty rate. • Borrowers with interest and dividend income and Māori Authority distributions below $1,500 will not be required to make repayments on this income. • All overseas-based borrowers will be able to contact Inland Revenue 24/7 from anywhere in the world. • All borrowers will be able to access a greater amount of information on their loan, have a consolidated view of their loan balance in one place, and be able to self-manage their loan. • All borrowers whose sole earnings are from salary and wages will not be required to undergo an end-of-year square-up. • Borrowers will no longer face automatic late payment penalties equivalent to 19.56 percent per annum, but will pay a smaller interest charge on underpayments. • penalties for borrowers will be the same or similar to those for tax, reducing the number of rules borrowers need to understand • The remission and instalment options in the Tax Administration Act will be available to borrowers. Freeing up resources from the end-of-year square-up will enable Inland Revenue to concentrate on higher-value activities, such as ensuring the accuracy of pay-period deductions, which will benefit borrowers and provide enhanced services to borrowers. Costs/risks Ministers have previously agreed to increase funding to redesign the student loan computer system. The proposals outlined in this statement relate to policy changes, which will be implemented at the same time as the redesign of the computer system and will therefore have no additional administrative costs. 5 The proposed changes will increase student loan receipts by approximately $5 million in the 2010/11 year growing to approximately $18 million in the 2012/13 and subsequent years. The proposals represent a fundamental change in the student loan scheme and its administration. The scale of change will affect existing frameworks and processes in different ways. It needs to be recognised that it is not possible to replicate current outcomes in the proposed new structure without undermining the overall intention of the reforms. Those facing higher repayments under the proposals Borrowers who may face higher repayment costs are those: • who currently have a refund and who do not apply this refund to the loan (approximately 20% of cases as approximately 80% of borrowers currently have their refund applied to the loan); • who work part-time or for part of the year and are under the current annual repayment threshold but are above the new pay-period threshold will be required to make repayments; • Borrowers with other income will pay interest on underpayments from the first instalment date, in the same way as provisional tax, whereas the current “underestimation penalty” effectively allows deferral to the third instalment; and • who are non compliant will potentially face higher penalties. Borrowers who are currently studying If Ministers agree to impose repayment obligations on students who earn under the current annual repayment threshold but above the new pay-period repayment threshold these students will face higher repayment costs. However, all borrowers who face higher repayments in the short term will also benefit by having a reduced level of debt and repaying their loan sooner. There is a risk that repayment obligations will increase for some borrowers compared with the current annual assessment system. It does not matter what period of assessment is adopted, there will be inconsistencies between borrowers. However, a pay-period basis is considered to be a better indicator of ability to pay than other longer periods such as a tax year. All borrowers who earn solely salary and wage income and who earn the same income in a pay period are treated equally. Student loans are income contingent for New Zealand-based borrowers and therefore it is not inconsistent to base repayments on the same basis as benefits which have a real-time basis of assessment to reflect current needs rather than an annual assessment basis. The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) has advised that, while removing the year-end square-up makes the scheme more affordable for some borrowers, it may increase cashflow difficulties for others, who may call on MSD for additional financial assistance. This could happen regardless of the relief that will continue to be available for borrowers who face financial hardship. Ministers are asked to decide whether or not to impose repayment obligations on borrowers who are full-time students. If Ministers decide to impose repayment obligations on full-time students, 6 Inland Revenue will include students in its communication campaign, advising borrowers of the changes from an annual to a pay-period basis of assessment. If Ministers decide to make an exception for full-time students there is an incentive for students to incorrectly claim full-time status and their level of expected earnings to avoid making repayments. To mitigate this risk, Inland Revenue will adopt a risk based assessment approach that will identify anomalies in the information it receives (as opposed to a full data match) in order to detect misuse of the declaration system for students. Exempting full-time students will reduce the gains in student loan receipts and the resulting revenue gains will be approximately $1.6 million in the 2010/11 year growing to approximately $11.6 million in the 2012/13 and subsequent years. Also, the proposal to specifically override the credit contracts legislation could be perceived as unfair by some borrowers, especially those not aware of the changes. To address this, Inland Revenue will endeavour to contact borrowers at their last known address to inform them of the changes. The proposed online services may also provide an opportunity for borrowers, who were previously not contactable, to re-establish contact. How the changes will impact on the stock of regulations The stock of regulations will remain the same, as the proposals will involve changes to the existing Student Loan Scheme Act. The Act will be rewritten to make it easier to understand, remove redundant provisions, and to re-order and renumber the Act. CONSULTATION The government consulted on the proposals with interested parties by way of a discussion document and an online forum. The discussion document attracted 26 written submissions and the online forum attracted 75 submitters. Submitters were generally borrowers, although written submissions were also received from Business New Zealand, universities and student associations, and the New Zealand Federation of Business and Professional Women Inc. Submitters saw the move to a pay-period assessment as a positive step for borrowers who have completed their study. However, most submitters were strongly opposed to students having to make repayments while studying and, to a lesser extent, the impact on borrowers who work part- time, casually, or experience large fluctuations in income. Requiring these people to make repayments could increase the financial strain on them. A number of submissions suggested that borrowers should be able to opt out of making repayments if they felt they will earn less in a year than the equivalent annual repayment threshold. Ministers are asked to decide whether to retain the status quo of not imposing repayment obligations on students or agree with the proposals to impose repayment obligations on them. Submissions supported the proposal to ignore minor overpayments and underpayments. However, they agreed that refunds should be available for large overpayments resulting from employer errors. A few submissions thought that all overpayments should be refunded as they lacked confidence in employers’ or Inland Revenue’s ability to ensure repayment deductions will be made correctly. Inland Revenue considers that over time the accuracy of the student loan deductions will increase and the department intends to monitor employer deductions to ensure accuracy. 7 Submissions were generally supportive of the proposals to replace the late payment penalty with interest, and for borrowers with income other than salary or wages to have their underpayments collected over the next three instalments. There was also significant support for enhanced online services and the ability to communicate with Inland Revenue electronically, which was especially supported by overseas-based borrowers. Inland Revenue has consulted with the following departments in the development of these proposals and in the preparation of the Cabinet paper: the Ministry of Education, the Treasury, the Ministry of Social Development (including StudyLink), the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the Commerce Commission, and the Privacy Commissioner. Their views have been incorporated into the paper. The consultation with departments raised three areas of concern, namely: the impacts on credit contracts law, the requirement to impose repayment obligations on borrowers who work part-time or part-year, including students and what payments qualify for the repayment bonus. Credit contracts issues Three credit contract issues arise. First, the move to electronic communication requires the consent of borrowers. Second, all overpayments are required to be refunded. Third, the changes proposed to existing contracts are not within the scope of variations permitted under the student loan contracts. Essentially, a trade-off is required between on the one hand, increasing the integrity of the student loan scheme, improving services to borrowers, improving administration, and maintaining open access to the scheme and on the other hand potentially confusing some borrowers and disadvantaging some borrowers. Consent to electronic disclosure The move to electronic administration of the scheme necessitates overriding credit contracts legislation which requires that borrowers must consent to electronic communication and disclosure. However, doing so creates a risk that borrowers may be unaware of the changes before they come into effect. Nevertheless, officials recommend an explicit departure from the credit contracts legislation to implement these proposals and consider that it is justified on the following grounds: • Inland Revenue does not have current addresses for about 10-15 percent of borrowers, many of whom in this group are overseas-based. The transient nature of borrowers at the time they enter into the student loan agreement, and subsequently seek work and travel has in the past made it difficult to maintain accurate current address information. • The student loan scheme is designed to support open access to education by providing financial support to students who might otherwise not be able to afford access. Repayments are largely income-contingent and the Ministry of Social Development has limited discretion to refuse to lend and cannot take into account the likelihood that borrowers will not meet their obligations, including providing contact information. The departure from credit contracts law is proposed to manage the resulting risk that borrowers default on their obligations, particularly given that some borrowers have little expectation of repaying their loans and avoid contact with Inland Revenue. • There is no security for the loan. This also reduces incentives for borrowers to comply with their obligations to provide current contact information. 8 • The large number of borrowers, expected to be around 580,000 at the time the changes come into effect. Significant administrative costs will be incurred to gain active consent to the changes proposed. • While there is the potential that some borrowers will be disadvantaged, the resulting improvement in services will be of benefit to the vast majority of borrowers who will be able to better manage their loan. Officials consider that the risk of borrowers not being informed of the changes could be mitigated to some extent through a programme of public communication, which Inland Revenue will undertake. Also, Inland Revenue will endeavour to contact borrowers at their last known address to inform them of the changes and conventional services will be provided to those unable to use the new on-line services. Those new on-line services should make it possible for significant numbers of borrowers who are no longer contactable by Inland Revenue to re- establish contact and access information about their loans and services provided by Inland Revenue. There is a trade-off between the risks to borrowers of not being informed of the changes with the objective of maintaining open access to student loans. The Commerce Commission points out that the primary purpose of the credit contracts legislation is consumer protection and ensuring that consumers are aware of their liabilities and obligations prior to entering a contract. In the case of student loans, in all likelihood this will be the borrower’s first major credit transaction, and accordingly it considers it critical that the borrower have the ability to be fully appraised and informed of the terms and conditions to which borrowers have to adhere. The Commission considers that having a different set of criteria for student loans from other domestic and personal loans significantly increases the chances of confusion amongst consumers over their rights and obligations. Refunds The credit contracts legislation also requires creditors to refund overpayments. This requirement is inconsistent with the proposal to ignore minor over-payments, which will be credited to the borrower’s loan balance. It is also recommended that an explicit student loan exception be created to the credit contracts legislation rule that all overpayments must be refunded. The Commerce Commission has expressed concern that selective exemptions from the credit contracts legislation is cause for even greater uncertainty amongst borrowers. However officials do not favour a blanket exemption as the student loan scheme should fit within the scheme of the legislation as far as possible. Amending existing contracts Variations to credit contracts are only permitted if both contracting parties agree or if the contract provides that specific obligations can be changed. Legislation implementing the proposals – moving to a pay-period basis and replacing penalties with interest – will need to prevail over contrary terms in existing contracts. This will disadvantage some borrowers, for example those who will be required to repay their loans earlier than under the current system. The Commerce Commission is concerned that unilateral variation will undermine the consumer protection afforded by the legislation. The Commission considers that students will be in the category of consumers most in need of protection given their limited access to funds and the significance of the decision to take a loan. The initial terms and conditions affect the decision to take a loan. 9 It is difficult to determine what impact these changes will have had on borrowers at the time they entered into loan contracts, had they been known – whether they will have entered into the loan agreements or not. The benefits of the proposals – the improved services to borrowers, reduction in compliance costs and improved administration – cannot be realized without amending current contracts. For example, the move to a pay-period concept allows administrative resources to be reallocated to provide better electronic services for borrowers. Overall, the benefits of the proposals will be severely limited if they applied only to future contracts. Prospective application will also increase complexity, administrative costs and inequity. Since the student loan scheme came into effect a number of changes have been made to existing contracts to the benefit of borrowers – for example, the remission of interest for New Zealand-based borrowers. The approach raised by the Commerce Commission will prevent the government from making future policy changes affecting current contracts if they disadvantage any borrower. This outcome could be a significant impediment to the policy objectives of managing the loan asset and maintaining open access to tertiary education. Officials therefore recommend that legislation to implement the proposals should prevail over current contractual terms. Voluntary repayments The impact on voluntary repayments is an area where further work is required between officials to address the concerns raised. Officials will be reporting to Ministers in the New Year on possible options.
1 Regulatory Impact Statement Transforming student loans — excess repayment bonus for student loans and other issues Agency Disclosure Statement 1. This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue and considers two student loan areas: the excess repayment bonus and operational issues. Excess repayment bonus 2. With pay-period based student loan repayments, there is an issue of how to ensure that borrowers who make voluntary repayments on their student loans continue to receive the 10% excess repayment bonus. Options focus on accurately targeting the bonus to those who make a conscious voluntary payment (currently, overpayments caused by the PAYE system are also eligible for the bonus). Operational issues 3. Several operational issues arose during the Student Loan Scheme Act rewrite project, including: • At what rate should the late payment interest rate be set? (Cabinet agreed that penalty rates should be lowered (CAB Min (09)33/12 refers).) • In what circumstances should shortfall and criminal penalties apply? • Should there be a threshold below which late payment interest is not charged? 4. We have identified and considered a range of options that are set out in the attached Statement. Any significant gaps, assumptions, dependencies, constraints or uncertainties are set out in this Disclosure Statement. 5. Key dependencies of these student loan areas include the policies: • Pay-period based student loan repayments (Cabinet has previously agreed that the amount deducted from a borrower’s salary should be their full and final repayment obligation with no annual square-up, for those borrowers whose income is largely from salary and wages (CAB Min (09) 33/12 refers)); and • The 10% excess repayment bonus (as enacted, borrowers making excess repayments receive a 10% repayment bonus). 6. Although we consulted with borrowers on the original student loan proposals, due to time constraints, we have consulted only with a number of Government departments in the development of these latest proposals: • We consulted with the Ministry of Education and the Treasury; 3 Status quo and problem definition Background 8. Cabinet has agreed to several major proposals to reform the administration of student loan repayments (CAB Min (09) 33/12 refers). The majority of the proposals centre on a change from an annual system of calculating student loan repayments for borrowers, whose income is largely from salary and wages, to a pay-period based system. 9. Under the pay-period based system, what is deducted from a borrower’s salary each pay-period will be their full and final repayment obligation. This will mean that the current system of an end-of-year “square-up” will cease. This will significantly reduce compliance costs for borrowers, and will allow Inland Revenue to redirect administrative resources to create a more efficient repayment system. It should also accord better with a borrower’s ability to pay back their loan. The proposals for reform are being incorporated into a rewrite of the Student Loan Scheme Act, which is proposed to be introduced into Parliament in July 2010. Excess repayment bonus 10. At the same time that Cabinet agreed to these policy proposals, the Student Loan Scheme (Repayment Bonus) Amendment Act 2009 was approaching its final reading. This Act carried into effect a policy whereby excess repayments of $500 or more in an income year, over and above the borrower’s repayment obligation, attracted a bonus of 10% of the excess repayment. 11. The aim of the excess repayment bonus, as originally envisaged, was to encourage borrowers to make a certain level of voluntary payments each year, in order to repay their student loans faster. However, in the interests of administrative simplicity, the bonus was also extended to payments other than voluntary payments, such as inadvertent over-deductions made from salary and wages. This was necessary to make the rules administratively practical and fair to borrowers. 12. Cabinet noted in September 2009 that officials were “working through options to ensure borrowers can still receive the voluntary repayment bonus on voluntary repayments” (CAB Min (09) 33/12 refers). This Statement and the accompanying report are the outcomes of that direction. 13. The problem to be addressed is how to apply the bonus in the pay-period system. Other operational issues 14. This Statement also covers a number of other, minor operational issues that have come to light in the preparation of the legislation. 15. Late payment interest – Cabinet has previously agreed to reduce the penalty imposed on borrowers who do not pay on time (CAB (09) 33/12). Currently, the rate of penalty is 1.5% per month compounding, which works out to almost 20% per annum. The problem to be resolved is to find an appropriate rate of interest that 4 provides an incentive for borrowers to meet their obligations on time, without being unduly harsh. 16. Imposition of shortfall and criminal penalties – Officials have previously reported to Cabinet that shortfall and criminal penalties would be imposed only in situations where a non-compliant borrower has been issued with a special assessment. The problem to be resolved is whether the issuing of a special assessment should be the trigger for these penalties, or if they should be applied to situations of serious non- compliance generally. 17. Late payment interest threshold on interim repayments – Borrowers with significant extra income derived from a source that is separate to salary and wages are required to make interim repayments during the year. This is similar in nature to provisional tax payments. Late payment interest is typically charged on short-paid amounts. The problem to be solved is whether to introduce a threshold below which this interest will not be charged, similar to that which applies to provisional tax payments. 18. Late payment interest on small amounts outstanding – Currently, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is not required to impose any late payment penalty if the penalty amount is $5 or less. The problem to be solved is whether to increase this amount to an appropriate level, given the compliance and administrative costs of collecting very small amounts of interest. Excess repayment bonus Objectives 19. The outcome that the Government is seeking is for the bonus to be amalgamated into the pay-period system in a way that is consistent with the underlying objectives of both policies, and yet is also administratively feasible and has low compliance costs. There are no risk-related objectives. 20. The basis for undertaking the analysis was the undertaking by the Minister of Revenue to report back to Cabinet on the options regarding merging these two policies (CAB Min (09) 33/12 refers). 21. The only constraint on the analysis was that time was limited, in order that the policy be incorporated into the Student Loan Scheme Bill, which will be introduced into Parliament in July 2010. The time constraint was not significant, as the requirement to meet the two policy objectives, of full and final student loans and the voluntary bonus, limited the number of possible policy options. 22. The time constraint did, however, affect the level of consultation. As there are over half a million student loan borrowers, consultation with borrowers is major work, and is generally reserved for major policy changes. Although consultation with borrowers was undertaken for the major policy reforms, it was not undertaken for the changes in this Statement, as they are relatively minor. However, consultation was undertaken with a limited number of Government departments and agencies. 5 Regulatory impact analysis Non-regulatory options 23. Non-regulatory options are not capable of achieving the above objectives. This is because taxation (or in this case, the repayment of student loans) must have a legislative authority. Alternative regulatory options 24. There was one other regulatory measure that was considered and rejected. This was to retain the annual system of “squaring up” at the end of the income year. The initial decision to extend the bonus to involuntary over-deductions that were detected as part of the annual square-up process was made in the interests of administrative simplicity. It differed significantly from the Government’s intent to reward borrowers with a bonus when they made voluntary extra payments towards their loan. 25. This option was rejected, as it is in conflict with the new policy of pay-period based student loan repayments. Retaining the annual square-up for salary and wage earners would undermine the new policy. Preferred regulatory option 26. The preferred regulatory option is to exclude involuntary over-deductions caused by the PAYE system from the 10% excess repayment bonus. This is consistent with the Government’s original intent to reward intentional overpayments with a 10% bonus, and is also consistent with the policy to remove the annual system in favour of a pay-period based system. 27. Significant errors that result in overpayments and underpayments of student loan repayments will continue to be detected and corrected. In the case of an overpayment, if a borrower (first) chooses not to have the overpayment refunded, and (secondly) meets the $500 threshold, the excess repayment bonus will apply. However, small overpayments will not be squared-up at the end of the year, and therefore will not be counted towards the excess repayment bonus. 28. The impact of this decision is estimated to affect 6,500 (just over 1%) out of 530,000 student loan borrowers. These borrowers represent the number of borrowers who may incur over-deductions that would not otherwise be detected or prevented in some way. This group of borrowers will not receive the bonus of 10% of the excess payment, as the excess is caused by involuntary over-deductions. Conclusions and recommendations 29. The recommended option is to focus the bonus on voluntary payments made through bank accounts, employers and directly to Inland Revenue, and to exclude involuntary over-deductions caused by the PAYE system from the 10% excess repayment bonus. This option will reduce the scope of the bonus and accords more closely with Government policy. It is proposed that this option would be 6 implemented alongside improved student loan deduction monitoring, which will aim to minimise the amount and extent of over-deductions. This option is the most consistent with the policy objectives. Other operational issues Objectives 30. These issues are all relatively minor and operational in nature. The objectives for solving these issues are to balance the administration and compliance costs with other issues, such as fairness to borrowers, and keeping the student loan rules simple to apply and easy to understand. These issues also had the same time constraint as the excess repayment bonus, again in order to incorporate them into the Student Loan Scheme Bill, which is planned for introduction in July 2010. As all of these issues are minor, the time constraint was not significant. Consultation with a limited number of Government departments and agencies was conducted contemporaneously with the excess repayment bonus issue. Regulatory impact analysis Non-regulatory options 31. As tax is created by legislation, the non-regulatory options available for these issues are limited, with the only alternative option being to retain the status quo and not change the law. However, as Inland Revenue is currently preparing a rewrite of the Student Loan Scheme Act, these issues can be incorporated into the new Act. This is also in line with the general aim of the rewrite project, which is to simplify student loan legislation and make it easier to apply and understand. 32. For the late payment interest issue, the regulatory option to change the existing penalties has already been agreed to by Cabinet. This is merely a further refinement of that decision. Analysis 33. The following analysis covers the alternative regulatory options, the preferred regulatory options, and the final recommendations and conclusions, for each of the individual operational issues. Late payment interest 34. The alternative regulatory option was to leave the late payment interest rates at the rates agreed to by Cabinet. This was rejected in favour of slightly different rates, which will provide better and more appropriate incentives to borrowers. 35. The preferred option is to make the late payment interest, for the non-payment of repayment obligations, the sum of the base interest rate plus a penalty of 4%. Given the current base interest rate of 6.6%, this would make the late payment interest 10.6% for both New Zealand and overseas-based borrowers who fail to pay on time. 7 36. In addition, in order to encourage borrowers to contact Inland Revenue and enter into an instalment arrangement, the penalty rate of 4% will be halved once such an arrangement commences. This would make the penalty rate for borrowers in instalment arrangements 8.6% (the base interest of 6.6% plus the reduced 2% penalty). 37. This is the preferred option, as it manages to strike a balance between lowering the current late payment penalties, which are currently close to 20% per annum, while still providing an incentive for borrowers to meet their repayment obligations. 38. This proposal is in line with Cabinet’s intent to lower student loan penalties, but is targeted more appropriately. There are no additional risks to this proposal, beyond the initial risks involved with Cabinet’s original decision to lower penalty rates. Imposition of shortfall and criminal penalties 39. The alternative regulatory option was to retain the qualification of special assessments. This was rejected, as serious non-compliance should be the trigger for these penalties, instead of the administrative functions of Inland Revenue. 40. The preferred regulatory option is to apply these penalties in cases of serious non-compliance, regardless of whether a special assessment has been issued by Inland Revenue. Late payment interest threshold on interim repayments 41. The alternative regulatory option was to apply late payment interest on any short-paid interim instalment. This was rejected as it was deemed to be unnecessary. The rules for calculating interim student loan repayments via the standard method will be very prescriptive, and the risk of taxpayers manipulating their repayments is low, therefore a penalty on short-paid amounts is not needed. 42. The preferred regulatory option is to introduce a threshold of $16,000, below which late payment interest will not be charged on short-paid interim instalments. The threshold will only apply to interim payers who use the standard method of calculation. This threshold will bring the treatment of interim instalments into line with that of provisional tax payments. It also reflects the reduced risk of manipulation of payments for the majority of taxpayers who use the standard method. 43. The threshold of $16,000 is preferred, as the current threshold for provisional tax is $50,000, which equates to a taxable income of about $180,000. Given a student loan repayment threshold of approximately $20,000, this would work out to $160,000 of income subject to student loan repayments, which are deducted at a rate of 10 cents per dollar. Late payment interest on small amounts outstanding 8 44. The alternative regulatory option was to retain the current threshold of $5. Currently, if a penalty amount is below this, late payment interest will not be charged. This was rejected as it is too low a threshold. Imposing late payment interest on small amounts increases both compliance and administration costs, while collecting only small amounts. 45. The preferred regulatory option is to introduce a threshold of $500, below which late payment interest will not be charged. This is a more appropriate threshold than the present $5 of penalty interest, since, as noted, imposing late payment interest on very small amounts increases compliance and administration costs. The proposal is not to charge late payment interest on amounts outstanding of $500 or less, and for the outstanding amount to be added to the loan balance. Although this may have the risk that it does not provide an incentive for borrowers to make their full repayment, this risk is small, and is outweighed by gains in compliance and administrative costs. 9 Consultation 46. The following agencies have been consulted on the preferred options: 1. The Treasury was consulted and assisted in the development of these proposals. 2. The Ministry of Education did not consider that the policy required comment, beyond amendments to clarify the proposals. 3. The Ministry of Social Development was consulted on the proposals and provided feedback to clarify the proposals, which was incorporated into the final report. 4. Te Puni Kōkiri was provided with a copy of the report and did not have comment on the amendments proposed to the repayment bonus. However, Te Puni Kōkiri did note its agreement with the proposal not to charge late payment interest on amounts below $500. Te Puni Kōkiri also stated that it considered late payment penalties to be strong coercive measures in themselves, and that criminal penalties should be reserved for only very serious circumstances of non-compliance. Implementation 47. The recommended options would be incorporated into the Student Loan Scheme Bill, which will be introduced in July 2010. This Bill is a rewrite of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992. The recommended options would all apply from 1 April 2012, which is also when the new system of administering student loan repayments will take effect (pending Cabinet’s agreement to the deferral of the application date of the Student Loan Scheme Bill). These options do not give rise to any need for transitional provisions. 48. Implementation risks will be managed primarily by the new system of administering repayments, which will monitor repayments closely and identify large errors. The recommended proposal for the excess repayment bonus will significantly reduce compliance costs, as it will not require borrowers to have to undertake the year’s end “square-up” process. As this proposal will also coincide with the application of the new student loan policies, it will not interact with existing legislation. 49. Regarding late payment interest, there are no additional risks to the revised rates, beyond those identified at the time of Cabinet’s original decision to lower penalties. There are no associated risks regarding the proposal to impose shortfall and criminal penalties in cases of serious non-compliance. The proposals not to apply late payment interest on amounts less than $500 generally, carry the risk of not providing an incentive for borrowers to pay the full, correct amount of their obligation. However, the opportunity for the threshold on interim repayments to be abused is very minor, as it will only apply to borrowers who use the standard method of calculation, 10 which is very prescriptive. The risk regarding the $500 threshold for late payment interest generally is small, and is outweighed by the gains in compliance and administration costs. Monitoring, evaluation and review 50. The monitoring, evaluation and review of these proposals will take place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves a post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, this will mean that these proposals, along with the rewrite of the Student Loan Scheme Act and the other student loan policy reforms generally, will be reviewed at a time after it has had time to work. Any changes that are needed to give the legislation its intended effect will be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals will go through the GTPP.
1 Regulatory Impact Statement – Transforming student loan administration E XECUTIVE SUMMARY 1. Changes are proposed to Inland Revenue’s administration of the student loan scheme, to improve the overall integrity of the scheme, and reduce compliance costs and administrative pressures. 2. The social policy programmes administered by Inland Revenue have, over recent years, greatly increased Inland Revenue’s customer base: for example, there were 58,000 new student loan borrowers in the 2007 –08 tax year. The current student loan system is complex, unwieldy, expensive to maintain, and has limited ability to accommodate further changes. Each policy change made has exposed underlying system issues, which require corrective action and have the potential to destabilise both the student loan and core tax collection systems. The student loan scheme represents a significant asset to the Government , which needs to be managed effectively to protect the value of this asset, and better manage the cost of the student loan scheme to the Crown. 3. The policy changes proposed include a move towards treating different forms of income differently, both in terms of repayment obligations and administrative process. This proposal requires an emphasis on “close enough is good enough” over accuracy. 4. The proposed reforms aim to improve the rate and timeliness of repayments, improve Inland Revenue’s ability to handle growth in customer numbers, and enable the department to deliver new Government initiatives more efficiently. 5. The proposals will have an impact on borrowers. Most borrowers will benefit from the changes, but some will be disadvantaged. Proposals to reduce borrower debt, such as applying overpaid repayment deductions to the loan balance, will disadvantage some borrowers. Although this may be seen as having a negative impact on borrowers in the short term, it will ultimately benefit borrowers by reducing their debt level, thereby shortening their repayment times. 6. The policy changes proposed will increase student loan receipts – growing from $4 million in the 2012-13 year to $22 million in the 2014-15 and subsequent years 1 . Ministers have previously agreed to redesign the student loan computer system, and therefore the proposed changes will be implemented at the same time, with no further administrative costs. 1 These figures differ from the original Statement in that they have been deferred one year. They have already been netted off against other aspects of the student loan policy reforms, which are incorporated, with the deferral, into the Budget 2010 baselines. 2 ADEQUACY STATEMENT 7. Inland Revenue has reviewed this Regulatory Impact Statement, and considers that the statement is adequate according to the Regulatory Impact Analysis adequacy criteria. STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM 8. Since 1992, when the student loan scheme was introduced, borrowers have been required to square up their loan repayments made during the tax year. Salary and wage earners have student loan repayments deducted from their income each pay day. Borrowers with other income (who have residual repayment obligations over $1,000) have to make interim instalments three times a year. This is the process for collecting income tax. The process ensures accuracy but generates small over or under payments, with the majority of overpayments being applied to the loan and underpayments being collected by Inland Revenue. This results in both compliance and administrative costs. 9. The current system is based on a tax system, where accuracy is important, and timeliness and cost effectiveness are less so. This is appropriate where money is being transferred from an individual to the state. However, for student loan repayments, accuracy has an impact on the time required to repay the loan, and any money applied to the loan is to the benefit of the borrower. 10. In order for some borrowers to access a consolidated loan balance they have to interact with two agencies, increasing compliance costs. They contact StudyLink for the balance of amounts drawn down in the current year, and Inland Revenue for amounts drawn down in past years. 11. There are costs for both borrowers and Inland Revenue in undertaking the end- of-year square-up process. This is currently a paper-based process, which is similar to income tax and ensures accuracy. This system is costly to administer, and its growing borrower base reduces Inland Revenue’s ability to handle this growth in the future. 12. Also, the end-of-year filing for student loans can conflict with other policies, such as the non-filing concept, which aims to remove the requirement for taxpayers to square up their income tax affairs at the year’s end. Requiring student loan borrowers to file brings them back into the income tax return process. 13. The administration of the interest-free policy requires StudyLink to impose interest, which, for domestic borrowers, is written off by Inland Revenue. This imposes excessive administration costs. 14. There is a significant number of overseas-based borrowers who are not complying with their obligations. Inland Revenue’s main channels for communicating with borrowers are by mail or by telephone. For overseas-based borrowers, these two methods are either not timely or convenient. As these borrowers move around a lot, it is difficult to keep track of their addresses. 3 15. Where a borrower fails to make their student loan repayments, they are subject to a compounding late payment penalty of 1.5 percent per month, which equates to 19.56 percent per annum, and can escalate outstanding debt to a point where the amount cannot be repaid, and either it remains unpaid or hardship relief is provided. 16. There are currently over 530,000 student loan borrowers, and the nominal value of the scheme is $9.573 billion. The student loan portfolio is growing rapidly and is forecast to grow to $14.5 billion by 2014–15. Currently, lending exceeds repayments, with the total amount borrowed in 2007–08 being $1.2 billion, and total repayments of approximately $550 million. A large and growing student loan debt is likely to have an impact on the decisions of overseas-based borrowers on whether to return to New Zealand. 17. The penalties imposed on student loans are outdated, and can provide an incentive to pay other outstanding taxes, with higher penalties, ahead of student loans. OBJECTIVE 18. The main objectives are to: • Increase administrative efficiency by redeploying resources from the end-of- year square-up to higher value activities, such as debt collection and enhanced services to borrowers. • Reduce the growth in outstanding debt. • Enable borrowers to self-manage their loan through online services. • Reduce overall compliance costs for borrowers. ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS 19. Retaining the status quo and retaining the end-of-year square-up was considered as an option, but discarded as the current compliance and administrative costs will remain for the majority of borrowers (salary and wage earners) and will retain the current risks to Inland Revenue. 20. Also considered was the option of relying on the changes to the student loan scheme computer system and retaining the end-of-year square-up for salary and wage earners with higher thresholds. Although moving to a new computer system will produce administrative gains and reduce the problems in the short term, the underlying problems of a growing borrower population and increasing student loan debt will remain. Addressing these problems requires a fundamental review of the administrative legislation, focusing on reforming the basis of assessment by moving to a more frequent assessment period. PREFERRED OPTION 21. The preferred option is to move towards a pay-period basis of assessment for salary and wage earners. The key features of this option are as follows: 4 • Removing the end-of-year square-up for salary and wage earners, with student loan liabilities being based on the amount deducted each pay. This will reduce administration and compliance costs. • For salary and wage earners, significant underpayments will be collected from future pays, reducing the extent of outstanding debt. • Salary and wage earners who have interest, dividend and Māori Authority income below a combined threshold of $1,500 will not be subject to a repayment obligation on this income. • Borrowers with other income will continue to have an end-of-year square-up, and one- third of their liability will be due on each of three interim repayment dates during the year. • The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be given a wide discretion to set the thresholds for taking corrective action in relation to under-deducted repayments from salary and wages. This will enable the Commissioner to allocate resources to higher value activities, especially with a growing borrower base. • The vast majority of interactions between borrowers and Inland Revenue will be electronic, to reduce compliance costs for borrowers and enable Inland Revenue to cope with a growing borrower base. • The charging of interest will be the sole responsibility of Inland Revenue. This will address the current problem where interest is charged by StudyLink on student loans and then, for most borrowers, is written off by Inland Revenue. • StudyLink will share information with Inland Revenue on loans drawn down, in order to provide borrowers with a consolidated loan balance in one place. • Reducing borrowers’ exposure to penalties by replacing late payment penalties with a more moderate interest charge, but otherwise aligning incentives to pay the correct amount on time with those for the payment of income tax. • All borrowers will be able to undertake a wider range of activities in a new portal environment, and will have the ability to see a consolidated loan balance in one place. This will increase the extent to which borrowers can self-manage their affairs, and will reduce the growing administrative pressure on Inland Revenue. Benefits 22. The proposals will be a significant step in enabling Inland Revenue to: • Protect Government revenue and improve the integrity of the tax system. • Focus its resources on higher value tasks rather than manual processing, to cope more efficiently with an expanding borrower base, reduce compliance costs, and deliver better services to borrowers. • Respond to, and deliver, new Government initiatives more efficiently than now. 23. Borrowers will benefit from the proposals and will have reduced compliance costs in the following circumstances: 5 • Borrowers, who have an underpayment below the level set by the Commissioner, will not be required to repay the underpayment in the current year. • For borrowers who have an outstanding liability, the interest rate charged will be lower than the current late payment penalty rate. • Borrowers with interest, dividend income and Māori Authority distributions below $1,500 will not be required to make repayments on this income. • All overseas-based borrowers will be able to contact Inland Revenue 24/7 from anywhere in the world. • All borrowers will be able to access a greater amount of information on their loan, have a consolidated view of their loan balance in one place, and be able to self-manage their loan. • Borrowers whose sole earnings are from salary and wages will not be required to undergo an end-of-year square-up. • Borrowers will no longer face automatic late payment penalties equivalent to 19.56% per annum, but will pay a smaller interest charge on underpayments. • Penalties for borrowers will be the same or similar to those for tax, reducing the number of rules borrowers need to understand. • The remission and instalment options in the Tax Administration Act will be available to borrowers. 24. Freeing up resources from the end-of-year square-up will enable Inland Revenue to concentrate on higher value activities, such as ensuring the accuracy of pay-period deductions, which will benefit borrowers and provide enhanced services to borrowers. Costs/risks 25. Ministers have previously agreed to increase funding to redesign the student loan computer system. The proposals outlined in this statement relate to policy changes, which will be implemented at the same time as the redesign of the computer system, and will therefore have no additional administrative costs. 26. The proposed changes will increase student loan repayments by approximately $4 million in the 2012-13 year, growing to approximately $22 million in the 2014-15 and subsequent years 2 . 27. The proposals represent a fundamental change in the student loan scheme and its administration. The scale of change will affect existing frameworks and processes in different ways. It needs to be recognised that it is not possible to replicate current outcomes in the proposed new structure without undermining the overall intention of the reforms. 2 These figures differ from the original Statement in that they incorporate further policy refinements and a deferral until the 2012 income year. The policies were all incorporated into the Budget 2010 baselines. 6 Those facing higher repayments under the proposals 28. Borrowers who may face higher repayment costs are those: • who currently have a refund and who do not apply this refund to the loan (approximately 20% of cases as approximately 80% of borrowers currently have their refund applied to the loan); • who work part-time or for part of the year and are under the current annual repayment threshold but are above the new pay-period threshold will be required to make repayments; • Borrowers with other income will pay interest on underpayments from the first instalment date, in the same way as provisional tax, whereas the current “underestimation penalty” effectively allows deferral to the third instalment; and • who are non compliant will potentially face higher penalties. Borrowers who are currently studying 29. If Ministers agree to impose repayment obligations on students who earn under the current annual repayment threshold but above the new pay-period repayment threshold these students will face higher repayment costs. 30. However, all borrowers who face higher repayments in the short term will also benefit, by having a reduced level of debt and repaying their loan sooner. 31. There is a risk that repayment obligations will increase for some borrowers compared with the current annual assessment system. It does not matter what period of assessment is adopted, there will be inconsistencies between borrowers. However, a pay-period basis is considered to be a better indicator of ability to pay than other longer periods such as a tax year. All borrowers who earn solely salary and wage income and who earn the same income in a pay period are treated equally. 32. Student loans are income contingent for New Zealand-based borrowers and therefore it is not inconsistent to base repayments on the same basis as benefits which have a real-time basis of assessment to reflect current needs rather than an annual assessment basis. 33. The Ministry of Social Development (MSD) has advised that, while removing the year-end square-up makes the scheme more affordable for some borrowers, it may increase cash flow difficulties for others, who may call on MSD for additional financial assistance. This could happen regardless of the relief that will continue to be available for borrowers who face financial hardship. 34. Ministers are asked to decide whether or not to impose repayment obligations on borrowers who are full-time students. If Ministers decide to impose repayment obligations on full-time students, Inland Revenue will include students in its communication campaign, advising borrowers of the changes from an annual to a pay-period basis of assessment. 7 35. If Ministers decide to make an exception for full-time students there is an incentive for students to incorrectly claim full-time status and their level of expected earnings to avoid making repayments. To mitigate this risk, Inland Revenue will adopt a risk based assessment approach that will identify anomalies in the information it receives (as opposed to a full data match) in order to detect misuse of the declaration system for students. 36. Exempting full-time students will reduce the gains in student loan receipts and the resulting revenue gains will be approximately $1.6 million in the 2012/13 year growing to approximately $11.6 million in the 2014/15 and subsequent years 3 . 37. Also, the proposal to specifically override the credit contracts legislation could be perceived as unfair by some borrowers, especially those not aware of the changes. To address this, Inland Revenue will endeavour to contact borrowers at their last known address to inform them of the changes. The proposed online services may also provide an opportunity for borrowers, who were previously not contactable, to re- establish contact. How the changes will impact on the stock of regulations 38. The stock of regulations will remain the same, as the proposals will involve changes to the existing Student Loan Scheme Act. The Act will be rewritten to make it easier to understand, remove redundant provisions, and to re-order and renumber the Act. CONSULTATION 39. The Government consulted on the proposals with interested parties by way of a discussion document and an online forum. The discussion document attracted 26 written submissions and the online forum attracted 75 submitters. Submitters were generally borrowers, although written submissions were also received from Business New Zealand, universities and student associations, and the New Zealand Federation of Business and Professional Women Inc. 40. Submitters saw the move to a pay-period assessment as a positive step for borrowers who have completed their study. However, most submitters were strongly opposed to students having to make repayments while studying and, to a lesser extent, the impact on borrowers who work part-time, casually, or experience large fluctuations in income. Requiring these people to make repayments could increase the financial strain on them. A number of submissions suggested that borrowers should be able to opt out of making repayments if they felt they will earn less in a year than the equivalent annual repayment threshold. Ministers are asked to decide whether to retain the status quo of not imposing repayment obligations on students or agree with the proposals to impose repayment obligations on them. 41. Submissions supported the proposal to ignore minor overpayments and underpayments. However, they agreed that refunds should be available for large 3 These figures differ from the original Statement in that they have been deferred one year. They have already been netted off against other aspects of the student loan policy reforms, which are incorporated, with the deferral, into the Budget 2010 baselines. 8 overpayments resulting from employer errors. A few submissions thought that all overpayments should be refunded, as they lacked confidence in employers’ or Inland Revenue’s ability to ensure that repayment deductions would be made correctly. Inland Revenue considers that, over time, the accuracy of the student loan deductions will increase. The department intends to monitor employer deductions to ensure accuracy. 42. Submissions were generally supportive of the proposals to replace the late payment penalty with interest, and for borrowers with income other than salary or wages to have their underpayments collected over the next three instalments. There was also significant support for enhanced online services and the ability to communicate with Inland Revenue electronically, which was especially supported by overseas-based borrowers. 43. Inland Revenue has consulted with the following departments in the development of these proposals and in the preparation of the Cabinet paper: the Ministry of Education, the Treasury, the Ministry of Social Development (including StudyLink), the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, the Commerce Commission, and the Privacy Commissioner. 44. Their views have been incorporated into the paper. The consultation with departments raised three areas of concern, namely: the impacts on credit contracts law, the requirement to impose repayment obligations on borrowers who work part- time or part-year, including students and what payments qualify for the repayment bonus. Credit contracts issues 45. Three credit contract issues arise. First, the move to electronic communication requires the consent of borrowers. Second, all overpayments are required to be refunded. Third, the changes proposed to existing contracts are not within the scope of variations permitted under the student loan contracts. Essentially, a trade-off is required between on the one hand, increasing the integrity of the student loan scheme, improving services to borrowers, improving administration, and maintaining open access to the scheme and on the other hand potentially confusing some borrowers and disadvantaging some borrowers. Consent to electronic disclosure 46. The move to electronic administration of the scheme necessitates overriding credit contracts legislation, which requires that borrowers must consent to electronic communication and disclosure. However, doing so creates a risk that borrowers may be unaware of the changes before they come into effect. Nevertheless, officials recommend an explicit departure from the credit contracts legislation to implement these proposals, and consider that it is justified on the following grounds: • Inland Revenue does not have current addresses for about 10-15 percent of borrowers, many of whom in this group are overseas-based. The transient nature of borrowers at the time they enter into the student loan agreement, and 9 subsequently seek work and travel has, in the past, made it difficult to maintain accurate current address information. • The student loan scheme is designed to support open access to education by providing financial support to students who might otherwise not be able to afford access. Repayments are largely income-contingent and the Ministry of Social Development has limited discretion to refuse to lend and cannot take into account the likelihood that borrowers will not meet their obligations, including providing contact information. The departure from credit contracts law is proposed to manage the resulting risk that borrowers default on their obligations, particularly given that some borrowers have little expectation of repaying their loans and avoid contact with Inland Revenue. • There is no security for the loan. This also reduces incentives for borrowers to comply with their obligations to provide current contact information. • The large number of borrowers, expected to be around 580,000 at the time the changes come into effect. Significant administrative costs will be incurred to gain active consent to the changes proposed. • While there is the potential that some borrowers will be disadvantaged, the resulting improvement in services will be of benefit to the vast majority of borrowers, who will be able to better manage their loan. 47. Officials consider that the risk of borrowers not being informed of the changes could be mitigated to some extent through a programme of public communication, which Inland Revenue will undertake. Also, Inland Revenue will endeavour to contact borrowers at their last known address to inform them of the changes, and conventional services will be provided to those unable to use the new online services. The new online services should make it possible for significant numbers of borrowers who are no longer contactable by Inland Revenue to re-establish contact, and access information about their loans and the services provided by Inland Revenue. There is a trade-off between the risks to borrowers of not being informed of the changes with the objective of maintaining open access to student loans. 48. The Commerce Commission points out that the primary purpose of the credit contracts legislation is consumer protection and ensuring that consumers are aware of their liabilities and obligations prior to entering a contract. In the case of student loans, in all likelihood this will be the borrower’s first major credit transaction, and accordingly it considers it critical that the borrower have the ability to be fully appraised and informed of the terms and conditions to which borrowers have to adhere. The Commission considers that having a different set of criteria for student loans from other domestic and personal loans significantly increases the chances of confusion amongst consumers over their rights and obligations. Refunds 49. The credit contracts legislation also requires creditors to refund overpayments. This requirement is inconsistent with the proposal to ignore minor overpayments, which will be credited to the borrower’s loan balance. It is also recommended that an explicit student loan exception be created to the credit contracts legislation rule that all overpayments must be refunded. The Commerce Commission has expressed concern that selective exemptions from the credit contracts legislation is cause for even greater uncertainty among borrowers. However, officials do not favour a 10 blanket exemption, as the student loan scheme should fit within the scheme of the legislation as far as possible. Amending existing contracts 50. Variations to credit contracts are only permitted if both contracting parties agree or if the contract provides that specific obligations can be changed. Legislation implementing the proposals – moving to a pay-period basis and replacing penalties with interest – will need to prevail over contrary terms in existing contracts. This will disadvantage some borrowers, for example those who will be required to repay their loans earlier than under the current system. 51. The Commerce Commission is concerned that unilateral variation will undermine the consumer protection afforded by the legislation. The Commission considers that students will be in the category of consumers most in need of protection, given their limited access to funds and the significance of the decision to take a loan. The initial terms and conditions affect the decision to take a loan. 52. It is difficult to determine what impact these changes will have had on borrowers at the time they entered into loan contracts, had they been known – whether they will have entered into the loan agreements or not. The benefits of the proposals – the improved services to borrowers, reduction in compliance costs and improved administration – cannot be realized without amending current contracts. For example, the move to a pay-period concept allows administrative resources to be reallocated to provide better electronic services for borrowers. Overall, the benefits of the proposals will be severely limited if they applied only to future contracts. Prospective application will also increase complexity, administrative costs and inequity. Since the student loan scheme came into effect a number of changes have been made to existing contracts to the benefit of borrowers – for example, the remission of interest for New Zealand-based borrowers. The approach raised by the Commerce Commission will prevent the Government from making future policy changes affecting current contracts if they disadvantage any borrower. This outcome could be a significant impediment to the policy objectives of managing the loan asset and maintaining open access to tertiary education. Officials therefore recommend that legislation to implement the proposals should prevail over current contractual terms. Voluntary repayments 53. The impact on voluntary repayments is an area where further work is required between officials to address the concerns raised. Officials will be reporting to Ministers in the New Year on possible options.
Regulatory Impact Statement Lower the income tax rate for Maori Authorities Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to change the income tax rate applicable to entities that are Maori Authorities for tax purposes. It recommends that the income tax rate for Maori Authorities should drop from 19.5% to 17.5% as a consequence of the changes to the personal statutory tax rates of individuals included in Budget 2010. The existing Maori Authority tax regime is based on an underlying policy assumption that the tax levied at the Maori Authority level should be a proxy for the statutory tax rate that would have been imposed on the majority of Maori Authority members. No attempt has been made to reassess the validity of this assumption. Instead, analysis has focussed on whether the existing Maori Authority tax rate is set at the correct rate given its policy function and, if not, what rate would be more appropriate. Consultation was therefore focussed on transitional issues with the major stakeholders. The consultation confirmed that the transitional issues are similar to the transitional issues faced by companies with their impending tax rate change. The lowering of the income tax rate for Maori authorities to 17.5% does not impose any significant additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest or override fundamental common law principles. Peter Frawley Policy Manager Inland Revenue 1 November 2010 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. Māori Authorities may take the legal form of either a trust or a company. However, irrespective of its legal form, an eligible person may elect to be subject to the Māori Authority tax regime. The Māori Authority regime operates in a similar manner to the company imputation model. In particular, tax paid by a Māori Authority forms a credit in its Māori Authority credit account. These credits can then be attached to distributions made to its members (shareholders or beneficiaries, depending on the legal form of the Authority). Members then use the credits received to offset their individual tax liability. 2. The current Māori Authority regime was introduced in the 2004/2005 income year. One of the key drivers for the introduction of a specific rate for Māori Authorities was that the rate would be the best proxy for the tax that would be incurred by members if the income was attributed to them. This would in turn reduce compliance costs by ensuring that most distributions to Māori Authority members would be imputed at the correct ratio, minimising the need for end of year square-ups. 3. At the time that the current Māori Authority regime was introduced, the relevant statutory rates for individuals were: Income band Tax rate $0 – $38,000 19.5% $38,001 – $60,000 33% $60,001 and over 39% 4. At the time that the revised Māori authority regime was proposed in 2002, it was estimated that approximately 90% of Māori individuals earned less than $38,000 per year, meaning they had a statutory tax rate of 19.5%. The 19.5% rate was therefore the appropriate proxy for the tax rate applicable to the majority of Māori Authority members. The 19.5% rate has not changed since its introduction. 5. Subsequent changes to the individual tax rates have seen a disparity emerge between the Māori Authority tax rate and the prevailing tax rates of members. 6. The Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010 introduced the following statutory tax rates for individuals: 3 Income band Tax rate $0 – $14,000 10.5% $14,001 – $48,000 17.5% $48,001 – $70,000 30% $70,000 and over 33% 7. As a result of these changes (and previous movements in the tax rates for individuals), a rate of 19.5% is difficult to justify from a policy perspective. 8. No attempt has been made to reassess the validity of the assumption that the rate should be the best proxy for the tax that would be incurred by members if the income was attributed to them. Instead, analysis has focussed on whether the existing Māori Authority tax rate is set at the correct rate given its policy function and, if not, what rate would be more appropriate. OBJECTIVES 9. The objective is to ensure that the Māori Authority tax rate is set at the correct rate given its policy objectives and the recent changes to personal and company tax rates. The existing Māori Authority tax regime is based on an underlying policy assumption that the tax levied at the Māori Authority level should be a proxy for the statutory tax rate that would have been imposed on the majority of Māori Authority members. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 10. Assuming that no wholesale review of the policy underpinning the Māori Authority regime is desirable, there are three main options: • to retain the 19.5% rate; • to amend the rate to 17.5%; or • to amend the rate to 10.5%. Retain 19.5% rate 11. As mentioned above, it is difficult to justify this option from a policy perspective. If the Māori Authority is taxed at a rate that does not apply to any of its members, then compliance costs will arguably be increased. If the rate is retained at 19.5% (or, for that matter, any other rate that is not an individual statutory tax rate), every Māori Authority member who is required to file an individual tax return (all other things being equal) will be eligible for a refund or be required to pay additional tax. Therefore, although the rate would be lower than other entity tax rates, the administrative advantages of that particular rate will be lost. 4 12. Having a specific rate that differs from those of its members means that there will invariably be a “mismatch” between the credits that a Māori Authority attaches to its distributions and the tax payable by members. If the Māori Authority tries to attach the appropriate number of credits to distributions, it may result in an accumulation of credits at the Māori Authority level that are then difficult or impossible to distribute effectively at a later date. On the other hand, if the Māori Authority distributes as many credits as it is able, there will be a considerable number of members who, in their end of year returns, will be eligible for tax refunds of 2% of the value of these distributions (the difference between their personal 17.5% rate and the 19.5% Māori Authority rate). This would necessitate Inland Revenue incurring compliance costs processing a number of small refunds and additional compliance costs for taxpayers. 13. However, in many instances, there can be a long or indefinite delay between tax being levied at the Māori Authority level and final tax being imposed on distribution. This occurs when the Māori Authority retains the income, rather than distributing it to members. This is a feature that Māori Authority tax shares with company tax, and means that lowering the income tax rate for Māori Authorities would have a real fiscal cost. 14. Because retaining the status quo would be inconsistent with the underlying policy and create a compliance and administrative burden, this is not our favoured option. Amend the rate to 17.5% 15. No accurate data is kept on the personal tax rates of Māori Authority members. Census data can be used to track the income of Māori generally. However, not all Māori are Māori Authority members. Equally, because members who received distributions of less than $200 are not required to file an IR3, the data for those Māori who file individual tax returns is also incomplete. However, these figures can be used to draw some conclusions. 16. Census figures for 2006 suggest that approximately 80% of Māori earn less than the $48,000 upper threshold for the 17.5% marginal rate. Of individuals who filed an IR3 for the 2008/09 income year, 71% of people who returned Māori Authority income were in either the 10.5% or 17.5% brackets. Of these, the vast majority (78%) were in the 17.5% bracket. By value, distributions to M āori in the 17.5% bracket account for just under half of all distributions retuned. The IR3 data can be summarised as follows: Income range Taxpayers Taxable income 0-14,000 (10.5% rate) 15% 7% 14,001 - 48,000 (17.5% rate) 56% 48% 48,001 – 70,000 (30% rate) 16% 27% Over 70,000 (33% rate) 13% 18% IR3 total 100% 100% 17. This data suggests that a 17.5% rate is the most appropriate, both in terms of volume and money distributed. 5 18. Data from IR8J returns (the Māori Authority credit account returns) filed by Māori Authorities suggest that the bulk of income derived by Māori Authorities is retained at that level, rather than being distributed to members. As mentioned above, in these circumstances, there are fiscal costs associated with lowering the applicable income tax rate. The costs for lowering the rate from 19.5% to 17.5% are estimated as follows: Increase (decrease) in operating balance $ million 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 4-year total Impact on operating balance (3.0)m (4.0)m (4.0)m (5.0)m (16.0)m 19. Because the Māori Authority tax is designed to act as the best proxy for Māori Authority members, lowering the rate to 17.5% is the preferred option. Amend the rate to 10.5% 20. A rate of 10.5% could only be justified if the policy behind the Māori Authority tax rate was that it should be aligned with the lowest statutory tax rate for individuals. However, this is not the case. Although the existing 19.5% rate did correspond with the lowest statutory tax rate for individuals at the time it was introduced, this was only because the lowest rate was the most effective proxy rate for members (as mentioned above, census data estimated that approximately 90% of Māori individuals were subject to the 19.5% rate at the time). 21. Given the data provided above, a 10.5% rate would be an inaccurate proxy for 85% of Māori Authority members by number and 93% of members by volume. A rate that required 85% of members to square-up by paying additional tax at the end of the income year would largely defeat the purpose of having a proxy rate. 22. Māori Authority members who do have a marginal tax rate of 10.5% will also be able to take advantage of the fact that Māori Authority tax credits that represent an “over-taxation” (i.e. the difference between the 10.5% and 17.5% rates) are available as cash refunds – unlike company imputation credits, which would have to be carried forward. 23. Assuming that Māori Authorities would continue to retain the bulk of their income, a 10.5% rate would also significantly increase the fiscal costs associated with a rate decrease. This would also disadvantage businesses that directly compete with Māori Authorities. The existing 19.5% rate has been criticised for creating a two-tiered system that effectively provides a tax subsidy to certain businesses. (We note at this point that lowering the rate to 17.5% may, in itself, reopen this debate, but that rate is justified on the basis of the underlying policy). 24. For the reasons outlined above, we do not consider a 10.5% rate to be desirable. 6 CONSULTATION 25. Te Puni Kokiri have been consulted on the options outlined in this report and they agree with its recommendations. 26. Because the recommended amendment is effectively consequential on the changes to individual statutory tax rates in Budget 2010, no consultation has taken place on the rate change itself. 27. Consultation has taken place on possible transitional issues associated with the rate change. This consultation included the following core group of interested parties: • Te Ohu Kaimoana • The Māori Trustee • The Federation of Māori Authorities • Ngai Tahu Holdings • Te Runanga a Iwi o Nga Puhi   • PKW Inc • Atihau Inc • Te Arawa Iwi • Te Runanga o Ngati Porou /Porou Ariki Trust • Ernst & Young • Deloitte • BDO New Zealand. 28. Consultation took the form of email exchange, telephone calls and meetings between Inland Revenue officials and the relevant parties. Feedback has confirmed that the following transitional issues should be addressed as a consequence of any rate change: • “Grandparenting” imputation ratios – The maximum Māori Authority credit ratio is currently 19.5/80.5. If the Māori Authority tax rate decreases to 17.5%, the ratio will automatically change to 17.5/82.5. This ratio change can result in double taxation, as earnings taxed at 19.5% (prior to the any rate change) may carry a maximum imputation ratio of 17.5% if distributed after the rate change. The result is that pre-rate change credits can be “trapped” in the Māori Authority. Grandparenting the existing ratio for two years was enacted in respect of dividends paid by companies after the reduction in company tax levels in Budget 2010. Submissions suggested that a longer grandparenting period should be considered for Māori Authorities so as not to encourage rushed distributions of income. However, Māori Authorities are not materially different from many closely-held companies in this regard and we recommend that the two-year grandparenting period afforded to companies should also be used in respect of Māori Authority credit accounts. • Provisional tax adjustments – Previously, when company tax rates have been decreased, an adjustment has been made to the provisional tax rules so that the decreases are immediately reflected in the tax paid by provisional taxpayers. This recognises the fact that, all other things being equal, the tax paid by an entity is expected to be less in the year of the decrease. For taxpayers who base their provisional tax on an earlier year’s tax obligations, this is generally achieved by amending the uplift factor used to calculate 7 their current year liability. Again, we recommend that similar rules to those enacted as part of Budget 2010 should be used for Māori Authority provisional taxpayers. 29. Submissions also noted that the 10.5% rate should be considered for Māori Authorities. The main reason put forward was that the 10.5% rate better reflects the average income of Māori. We have discussed this point with submitters and they now accept that the 17.5% rate is appropriate. Our reasons for supporting the 17.5% are outlined above. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 30. We consider that lowering the income tax rate for Māori Authorities to 17.5% is the best option. We recommend that this change takes effect from the 2011-12 income year. This minimises the gap between the commencement of the revised statutory tax rates for individuals (effective on 1 October 2010) and the changes recommended in this Statement. This would also align the effective date for this change with the lowering of the income tax rate for companies. IMPLEMENTATION 31. We recommend that the rate change, and any necessary transitional amendments, be included in the Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill. 32. The rate change and consequential amendments would result in compliance costs being incurred by taxpayers for the first two years of implementation. However, we do not anticipate that these costs will be significant. Administrative costs will also be incurred by Inland Revenue in amending forms and informational material provided to Māori Authorities and their members. We anticipate these costs will be more than offset by the reduced need for end of year square-ups for individual taxpayers. 33. We have not identified any implementation risks. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 34. The realigned rate of 17.5% would need to continue to be reviewed and considered alongside any future changes to the statutory tax rates of individuals.
Regulatory I nip act Statement Social assistance integrity: defining family income Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. Budget 2010 announced the reform of the definition of income used for Working for Families (WFF) tax credits, the parental test for student allowances and the community services card (where the applicants have dependent children). These were previously dealt with in the 2010 Budget tax reform Regulatory Impact Statement. The purpose of this Regulatory Impact Statement is to consider ways to improve the integrity of social assistance programmes by, for example, countering arrangements that have the effect of inflating entitlements beyond what people's true economic circumstances justify. As part of the move to greater integrity, different types of economic income that have previously not been counted as family income, such as fringe benefits, would be included. The principal constraint was the availability of data on the size of the problem. This is because Inland Revenue does not necessarily collect information on a family's income if that income has already been taxed elsewhere. Where information is available, the evidence suggests that families are receiving income from substantial investments that are currently not included as family income. For example, there are approximately 11,400 families receiving WFF tax credits that have one or more children earning more than $500 each in passive income (interest, dividends, beneficiary income). This is equivalent to a $10,000 investment earning 5% per annum. Discussions with Inland Revenue investigators have also confirmed that families with substantial and available income are receiving WFF tax credits. A second constraint was the proposal to introduce the reforms from 1 April 2011. This time constraint meant that the preferred proposals were developed within the existing framework and targeted the more obvious integrity concerns where families had the ability to control the nature or type of income they received for social assistance purposes. Treasury, the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health all participated in the development of these proposals. An officials' issues paper Social assistance integrity: defining family income was released in August 2010 for public comment. The submissions received on consultation were taken into account and amendments were made to the proposals. Further work will be done on the most effective and efficient way to collect and verify the parental income information for student allowances in order to move from the current parental income test to the proposed income definition. StudyLink and Inland Revenue officials are to report back to Ministers on this. The preferred initiative and other approaches considered in this statement do not impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest or override fundamental common law principles. Dr Craig Latham Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 29 October 2010 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The 2010 Budget tax reform Regulatory Impact Statement (Tax Reform package for Budget 2010) highlighted a number of problems with New Zealand’s tax system. In particular, a key concern was the ability of families to artificially lower their taxable income in order to qualify for social assistance. This reflected the concerns expressed by the Tax Working Group in its report A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future about the lack of coherence, integrity and fairness in the current tax system in that different entities (such as trusts and companies) could be used to shelter income from various social taxes or enable people to receive social support. 2. Maintaining the integrity of social assistance programmes is important for New Zealand to continue to have an effectively targeted social assistance system for those in genuine need. People should not receive different levels of assistance according to how they structure their affairs or the manner in which they receive income to live on – this is inequitable and inconsistent with social assistance objectives. Providing undue social assistance also costs money which must be found through taxes and government borrowing or reduced expenditure elsewhere. How family income is defined is crucial to the proper targeting of these social assistance programmes. 3. As part of Budget 2010, as a first step to addressing integrity concerns regarding social assistance programmes, the Government excluded investment losses (such as rental losses) for the purpose of determining Working for Families (WFF) tax credit entitlements. The Government also announced further reform of the definition of family income used for WFF tax credits, the parental income test for student allowances and the community services card (only for applicants with dependent children). 4. The current definition of family income for these social assistance programmes is based broadly on “taxable income” as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. In some circumstances, taxable income is a reasonable approximation of the economic income of the family, which is the total income available for day-to-day spending and to support family members. However in some instances it is not, notably when: • Income is not taxed in the hands of the family, rather it is taxed elsewhere. Two relevant examples are distributions from trusts and fringe benefits. The income of a trust may be taxed as trustee income and then distributed to families tax-free and not included as family income. The employer pays fringe benefit tax on fringe benefits received by employees which are also not included in employee’s family income. • Income is explicitly exempt from taxation. For example, a salary from certain international organisations, such as the United Nations. 5. Therefore, to improve integrity, adjustments need to be made to taxable income when it differs from the concept of the family’s economic income available for day-to-day living needs. The key issue is what additional types of income should be included for determining eligibility to WFF tax credits, student allowances and the community services card. OBJECTIVES 6. The objectives of these proposals is to consider options to extend the definition of income used for the purposes of WFF tax credits, the parental income test for student allowances and the community services card (for those applicants with dependent children). 2 Extending the definition of family income is expected to improve integrity by reducing the ability of people to structure their affairs to inflate their social assistance and address gaps in the current definition of income. 7. As the integrity concerns are proposed to be addressed with effect from 1 April 2011, there were time constraints. This meant that the preferred proposals were developed within the existing framework and targeted the more obvious integrity concerns where families had the ability to control the nature or type of income they received for social assistance purposes. 8. This Statement considers a number of specific sources of income that are currently not included as family income. The Statement presents the reasoning behind the proposed options to include these types of income, including the implications for taxpayer compliance. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 9. The current definition of income used for WFF tax credits, the parental income test for student allowances and the community services card is based broadly on taxable income. However, taxable income aims to reflect a family’s “ability to pay” for income tax purposes. But a more comprehensive definition of income may be thought desirable to ensure social assistance is more effectively targeted to low and middle income families. If entitlements were based on day-to-day living needs, taxable income would be a reliable proxy for those families that, for example, rely predominantly on a salary or wages. However, for families receiving other types of income, using the definition of taxable income may not fully reflect their available financial resources. Conceptual approach to defining income 10. There are a number of possible conceptual approaches that could be taken to determine a household’s entitlement to social assistance. These approaches included: a cashflow approach based on a household’s ability to pay for day-to-day expenses, using the income tax definition of taxable income, and taxable income with adjustments. 11. A cashflow approach is similar to that used in the Social Security Act 1964 for welfare benefit purposes. Eligibility would be based on the proportion of a family’s economic income that is actually received and spent on day-to-day living needs. However, adopting a cashflow concept for WFF purposes would introduce an entirely new concept of income and involve significant administrative costs for Inland Revenue. Much of the information required to measure cash receipts is not currently collected by Inland Revenue. It would also impose additional compliance costs on all recipients. Moreover, the cash flow approach is likely to be an inadequate measure when substantial business or investment income is involved. 12. The taxable income approach would involve using taxable income as calculated under the income tax legislation to be the sole basis of determining income. This approach would be a reliable basis for those families that rely solely on taxable income received by them such as salary or wages. However, it would not be a reliable basis for those families that are able to structure their affairs or the manner in which they receive income to live on. This would perpetuate the integrity concerns that these proposals are intended to address. The adjusted taxable income approach starts with taxable income and then makes a number of limited adjustments so that the adjusted taxable income amount better reflects the income available to meet day-today living needs. It assumes that taxable income is a reliable proxy for the income that is available for day-today living needs in the majority of circumstances, but 3 allows other types of income to be included to better reflect income for social assistance purposes where taxable income is not a reliable proxy. 13. The adjusted taxable income approach is used currently to determine income for WFF tax credit purposes, the parental income test for student allowances and the community services card (where the applicant has dependent children and not in receipt of a main benefit). The same test applies for WFF tax credits and the community services card. Given this, the preferred approach to deal with these integrity issues is to broaden the adjustments made to taxable income. This would ensure that the existing administrative frameworks and processes are used and therefore would allow for the timely implementation of the preferred proposals. Modifying the existing adjusted income approach 14. Rejecting the cashflow and taxable income approaches, the remaining otions are provided below. 1. Retain the status quo and do not add any additional income sources to the definition of family income; or 2. Add those types of income that are either (a) currently taxable income that is not taxed in the hands of the family or (b) income that is specifically exempt for tax purposes but which is nevertheless available for the day-to-day living expenses of the family (recommended option). This option would include the following types of income: a) Trustee income; b) Fringe benefits; c) Income of children; d) Portfolio investment entity (PIE) income; e) The income of non-resident spouses; f) Tax exempt salary and wages of people who work for international organisations; g) Deposits in the main income equalisation scheme; and h) Periodical payments (i.e. regular cash payments that are not caught under any of the other categories). 15. With respect to option 2 (the recommended option), the issue to resolve is how and to what extent to include additional income sources in the definition of income. This is covered in the table below. When determining whether a particular type of income should be included as family income, the key question is whether the income is available for the day-to-day living expenses of the family. 4 Income type currently not included as family income Proposal and recommendation Comment and analysis Trustee income If a person is a settlor of a trust, include the trustee income and the net income of a company controlled by the trust as family income. - Counts trustee income as family inco me for social assistance purposes. - The objective is to attribute income from a closely-held family trust to the family member that ultimately contro ls the distribution of income. The settlor of the trust is the most appr opriate proxy for the person controlling the income of the trust. An alternative approach was considered that would only count distributions of trustee income made by cl osely held trusts. The attribution rule was preferred beca use, compared to amounts actually received, it more accurately reflects the resources available to meet a family’s living expenses. Also, it a voids the issue of how to account for trust loans. - Uses the existing definition of set tlor in the Income Tax Act 2007 with minor modification to deal with po tential overreach, limiting additional compliance cost. - Adds some complexity to the application for social assistance for settlors of family trusts. - Note that the current definition of income already includes an attribution rule for the income of a closely-held comp any directly owned by individuals. 5 Fringe benefits Include major fringe benefits of shareholder/employees as family income. A shareholder/employee is a person who is an employee in a company in which, together with associates, hold more than 50% of the voting interests or market value interests (if a market circumstance exists). - Including all fringe benefits as fam ily income would impose significant compliance costs on employers and employ ees. It would require a valuation and attribution to each employee of any be nefit they receive as part of their employment. To mitigate these concerns, the proposal only includes those fringe benefits that are attributed to individual employees under the fringe benefit tax rules. - Including only major or “attributable” benefits captures those benefits that are substitutable for cash or a majo r household expenditure (e.g. a motor vehicle). However, requir ing all employees to incl ude attributable fringe benefits could create inequities where an employee is granted private use of a motor vehicle. The value of the attributed vehicle may not reflect the actual benefit to the employee. Furthe rmore, not all fringe benefits are subject to the fringe benefit tax rules. - Limiting the inclusion of benefits in family income to only shareholder/employees targets closely he ld situations where the employee is in a position to determine the make- up of their remuneration. Employees who enter into salary sacrifice arrangements with employers also have control over the make-up of their tota l remuneration package. This would be considered as part of a wider revi ew of salary sacrifice arrangements. - Limiting the proposal to shareholder/ employees creates an inequity in relation to other employees who are not required to include benefits as family income. - There may be increased compliance co sts for shareholder/employees who apply for WFF tax credits; however the necessary information should be readily available given that the employe e is effectively the employer as well. 6 Income of children Include only passive income of children (e.g. interest, dividends, beneficiary income) as family income above a threshold of $500 per child per annum. - Prevents parents divesting income to their children to increase entitlements to social assistance. - The definition of passive income applie d would use existing definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007 to minimise compliance and administrative costs. - A $500 threshold would allow children to be entitled to so me income that may not contribute towards a fa mily’s day-to-day expenses. - Wages are not included as income beca use such income may not contribute towards a family’s day-to-day expens es and the existing tax rules protect against excessive wages being paid to children. - Increased compliance costs if families are required to report the income of children. PIE income Include income from PIEs that are not registered superannuation schemes or retirement savings schemes as family income. - Income from cash PIEs is analogous to interest income from bank deposits. This income is clearly ava ilable to support the family. - Minimal compliance costs for PIEs that may have to alter their investment statements to investors. Income of non-resident spouses Include the worldwide income of non-resident spouses as family income - Creates equity relative to resident families where the income of both spouses is included as family income. - Minimal compliance costs as it requires a statement of income to be provided by the non-resident spouse. Tax exempt salary and wages Include tax exempt income in the nature of salary and wages as family income - Income that is clearly available for day- to-day expenses is counted as family income. 7 Deposits in main income equalisation schemes Include as income deposits in main income equalisation schemes and refunds (excluding interest) would be deducted from family income. - Currently deposits in such schemes redu ce family income and increase social assistance entitlements. However, the purpose of the scheme is to smooth income for tax purposes. The income is available to the family before being deposited into the scheme. - The proposal is consistent with th e treatment before the 2002-03 income year when a deduction was not allowed for family assistance purposes for deposits into such schemes and ref unds (excluding interest) were not counted. Periodic payments Include as family income regular payments above a threshold of $5,000 per annum per family that contribute to their day-today living expenses. - Periodic payments would include regular ca sh gifts, payments of expenses or distributions from trusts (that are no t included as income under any other proposal). - Regular or periodic would mean an e xpectation that the payment is more than a one-off and could include annual payments. - A $5,000 threshold limits the proposal to significant payments. If cash payments exceed $5,000 per annum, the whole amount will be counted in family income. A $5,000 threshold is e quivalent to the amount of income a person on the domestic purpose benefit can earn before the benefit abates. This means that people can still provid e some support to each other without affecting their social assistance but any significant regular payments will be captured. - Without such a rule, trustee income th at is not captured under the settlor attribution rule above could be distribut ed from trusts without being counted as family income. 8 Further cost/benefit analysis 16. In terms of the net impact of the Government’s operating balance, the proposals are expected to reduce WFF expenditure by $1 million in 2010/11 and $17 million per annum thereafter. $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 & out years Passive income from children (1.000) (6.000) (6.000) (6.000) (6.000) Unlocked PIE income – (1.000) (1.000) (1.000) (1.000) Trustee income – (10.000) (10.000) (10.000) (10.000) Benefits and other unrequited expenses; Family tax credit and In-work tax credit (1.000) (17.000) (17.000) (17.000) (17.000) 17. The fiscal savings from including deposits in income equalisation schemes is expected to be negligible, but positive (less than $500,000). 18. The Ministry of Health expects that a small but unquantified reduction in community services card numbers is likely to result in some modest savings to District Health Boards, for example, through fewer subsidised after hours doctors visits. 19. It is difficult to estimate the number of current student allowance recipients who would no longer be eligible under the proposed new taxable income definition. Indicative estimates of the impact are as follows: 1 Potential net savings per year, including flow on increase in student loan borrowing ($m) Percentage of current recipients (parental income tested) who are likely to be no longer eligible Number of current recipients (parental income tested) who are likely to be no longer eligible 2011/12 (half year) 2012/13 & outyears 10% 4,600 (in 2012) 11.600 (high scenario) 6.000 (low scenario) 22.000 (high scenario) 11.400 (low scenario) 1 The high savings scenario assumes that current recipients will no longer be eligible for any level of student allowance. The low savings scenario assumes that recipients will still be eligible for half of the average parental income tested allowance. There are flow on implications that will increase student loan costs, as some affected recipients will choose to borrow living costs through the loan scheme instead. 9 20. Officials will include further details on the fiscal impacts of the change in the parental income test definition as part of their report back on the implementation and timing issues associated with student allowances. 21. Given that the objective of the proposals is to increase the integrity of social assistance, the proposals are expected to have an overall net social benefit. Additional types of income that are available for the family’s day-to-day living expenses would be counted when determining the level of social assistance. This would increase the equity of the WFF programme and improve its targeting to those in need. There may be a perceived inequity by those families whose entitlements decrease as a result of the proposals. However, this decrease would be due to counting income that is available to the family to live on. CONSULTATION 22. Inland Revenue and Treasury released an officials’ issues paper Social assistance integrity: defining family income in August 2010 for public comment. The paper contained a set of proposals to extend the definition of family income. The proposals were developed in consultation with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development (including StudyLink). Officials also consulted with the Australian Treasury, the Australian Tax Office and CentreLink. 23. The issues paper attracted 11 submissions from individuals as well as interest groups and businesses. The submissions generally supported the government’s policy to improve the integrity of the social assistance programmes. 24. However, there were mixed responses to the specific proposals. Some considered that the proposals did not go far enough whereas others considered that the proposals went beyond the objectives of the reform. A number of submissions suggested that, for equity reasons, the proposal relating to the inclusion of fringe benefits should be extended to apply to all employees who receive attributed fringe benefits. Also, some considered the costs of implementing the proposals could outweigh any fiscal savings. OFFICIALS’ COMMENT ON ISSUES RAISED IN CONSULTATION 25. Officials do not consider the costs of implementing the proposals would outweigh any fiscal savings from reduced WFF tax credit entitlements. The aim of the proposals is to enhance the integrity of these social assistance programmes, rather than to simply raise revenue. The improvement in integrity is a significant benefit that is not measured as part of the fiscal savings. 26. Further, the proposals have been developed with careful consideration to both the administration and compliance costs associated with extending the types of income that would be counted for WFF purposes. For example, although in principle all fringe benefits that are substitutable for cash or a major household expenditure could be included, it was considered that the costs to both employers and employees would outweigh the benefits of including them as income. The proposal was therefore limited to including only major fringe benefits where an shareholder/employee can clearly influence the make-up of their remuneration. 10 27. Submissions included some specific suggestions on income types that officials considered had merit and adapted the proposals accordingly. The specific amendments made to the proposals were: Trustee income 28. A person who provides personal services for free to a trust should not be considered a settlor of that trust and attributed income from the trust. An example would be a person who provides personal services such as repairs and maintenance of a trust property. To prevent any overreach, officials recommended excluding persons who provide personal services for free in relation to a trust’s administration or the maintenance of the trust’s property from the definition of settlor. Unlocked portfolio investment entity (PIE) income 29. Retirement savings schemes that meet the requirements of the retirement savings contribution tax rules should be excluded from the definition of an unlocked PIE. 2 Officials agreed with this proposition as such schemes are effectively retirement schemes and the income is not available for a family’s daily living expenses. Periodic payments 30. To acknowledge the potential compliance and administrative concerns with this proposal, officials recommended a threshold of $5,000 per year per family to exclude small regular payments received in a year. If cash payments exceed $5,000 per annum, the whole amount would be counted in family income. A $5,000 threshold is equivalent to the amount of income a person on the domestic purpose benefit can earn before the benefit abates. This way, people can still provide some support to each other without affecting their social assistance but any significant regular payments will be captured. In addition, we also consider the receipt of non- taxable private pensions and annuities should be included on a 50 percent basis in family income. This approach is already used in the community service card rules for superannuitants. The 50 percent adjustment recognises that some portion of these receipts is the return of the original capital investment rather than income, when the capital is returned on a periodic basis rather than as a lump sum. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 31. The preferred framework is to continue to use the adjusted taxable income approach for determining income for the WFF tax credit, the parental income test for student allowances, and the community services card. The two broad options in relation to the definition of income for social assistance purposes is to either retain the status quo or extend the definition to those sources of income currently not included. Given the concerns with the integrity of WFF tax credits, student allowances and the community services card, the recommended approach is to extend the definition of income. Doing so unambiguously improves the equity of these social assistance schemes. 2 For a retirement savings scheme to be eligible for these rules, the rules governing the scheme must restrict withdrawals before a person reaches an age of retirement. Limited withdrawals can be made for first home ownership, tertiary education and financial hardship. 11 32. It is recommended that the specific proposals outlined in the table above be adopted. These proposals have been designed to strike a balance between improving the equity of the social assistance programmes and minimising the administration and compliance costs. IMPLEMENTATION Working for Families tax credits 33. The amended definition of family income for WFF purposes would apply from 1 April 2011. 34. Inland Revenue would deliver the necessary administrative changes to support this policy in a phased approach. Phase one would focus on delivering communication messages to affected families outlining what income needs to be considered for determining WFF entitlements. 35. Phase two, which would be in the 2011/12 tax year, would involve amending the processes to collect the additional information on the income types of WFF applicants arising out of these reforms – for example, trustee income, passive income of children and fringe benefits. Inland Revenue would use this additional information to report on the outcome of the new policy, confirm family income, and assist in future compliance activity. 36. The amendments to the definition of family scheme income are expected to increase compliance costs for some families that apply for WFF tax credits because they will be required to report additional sources of income as part of their application. However, the increase in equity of the scheme is expected to significantly outweigh any compliance costs. Community services card 37. The amended definition of family income for community services card purposes would apply from 1 April 2011. 38. For the community services card, there is already an existing authority for sharing family income information with the Ministry of Social Development. Therefore, we consider there will be very little operational impact unless there are any changes proposed to the information matching agreement with Inland Revenue to reflect these changes. 39. Most community services card holders would continue to be assessed under the old definition of family income as at 31 March 2011. Families whose applications for WFF tax credits are completed before 1 April 2011 will not be assessed for the community services card using the amended definition of income until the tax year commencing 1 April 2012. 40. It is not known exactly how many families would be affected by the proposed changes. Therefore it is difficult to assess the number of clients who may no longer be eligible for community services cards. It is anticipated that some families would have income that places them over the allowable income thresholds for community services cards as a result of the change to the definition of family income. This reduction may result in a decrease in the number of community services cards issued to families claiming WFF tax credits. There may also be an increase in call centre activity if affected cardholders query the way their income is circulated. 12 41. Since the majority of families in receipt of a community services card earn wages and salaries, it is expected that the number of cardholders affected by the change to the definition of family income is likely to be very low. Student allowances 42. Cabinet, as part of Budget 2010, agreed that the changes to the family income definition would also apply to the parental income test for student allowances. A significant number of these parents would not be collecting WFF tax credits as their children are over 18 years. However, not all their family income details will be held by Inland Revenue. Further work is required on the most effective and efficient way to collect and verify the parental income information for student allowances to allow the change to be implemented. Discussions between the Ministry of Education, StudyLink and Inland Revenue continue on how to progress this work. 43. Implementing the change for student allowances could require changes by StudyLink to its information technology systems. One option to simplify administration and improve accuracy would be for Inland Revenue to provide information on family income of parents to StudyLink. There may be a need to amend the secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to share information on parents’ family income for student allowance purposes. Currently the definition of beneficiary for social welfare purposes includes the spouse of a person applying for a student allowance and allows Inland Revenue to provide income information on the student and their spouse. There may be a need to extend this to include the nominated parent(s). Any legislative change could be included in the tax bill scheduled to be introduced in November this year, which already contains a number of amendments to secrecy rules as part of the Transform Inland Revenue work. 44. For student allowances, the amended definition for parental income of a student could potentially apply to all student allowance applications received for study commencing after 1 January 2012. This will depend on further work by StudyLink and Inland Revenue on the most efficient and effective means of obtaining and assessing the additional income information. Officials will report back on the implementation issues and costs associated with student allowances. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 45. Phase two of Inland Revenue’s implementation includes the collection of specific data on the additional income types to be included in family income for social assistance purposes. The collection of this information would allow an analysis for auditing and compliance purposes by Inland Revenue. It would also allow an assessment of the impact of each of these proposals on WFF entitlements. This analysis is part of Inland Revenue’s ongoing risk assurance relating to WFF tax credits. 46. While the proposals improve the integrity of social assistance programmes, Inland Revenue would continue to monitor other areas that are not included as part of this reform. This would include fringe benefits received as a part of salary sacrifice arrangements and the extent to which remuneration is received by children working in family businesses. If any concerns arise, they will be raised with Government in the future.
Regulatory Impact Statement Non-resident seasonal workers' tax rate AGENCY DISCLOSURE STATEMENT This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue and provides an analysis of the tax rate that should be applied to non-resident seasonal workers under the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme. The RSE scheme allows for the temporary entry of overseas workers to work in the horticulture and viticulture industries in New Zealand. Generally, the rate of tax that currently applies to these workers is a flat rate of 15%. This rate is intended to reflect an average rate of tax faced by the workers on their New Zealand sourced income without the need to apply the marginal tax rate system and file an annual tax return. The need to review the rate of tax arises as a result of the recent changes to the personal tax rates, particularly from Budget 2010. An analysis of relevant data has lead to the policy proposal that the rate be reduced from 15% to 10.5% from 1 April 2011. The Department of Labour, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury were consulted on the proposal and are supportive of the change. Officials from Pacific Island nations had previously raised concerns with the Department of Labour requesting that the tax rate for non-resident seasonal workers be reduced. These concerns were taken into account in recommending the revised rate. Given the time constraints, the horticulture and viticulture industries were not consulted. The revision of the rate does not impose any significant additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest or override fundamental common law principles. Group Manager, Policy Inland Revenue 29 October 2010 1 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. The Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) scheme was introduced by the Department of Labour in April 2007. The RSE scheme allows for the temporary entry of overseas workers into New Zealand to work in the horticulture and viticulture industries. In 2008, a policy decision was made that a flat rate of tax would apply to workers under this scheme. This was done primarily to minimise compliance costs. It also addresses the fact that non-resident seasonal workers only work part of the tax year and are usually earning low hourly wages and, therefore, setting the flat rate of tax at a rate equal to the lowest marginal rate is an appropriate result. 2. Inland Revenue introduced the NSW (non-resident seasonal worker) tax code in the Taxation (International Taxation, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Act 2009 to apply to non-resident seasonal workers. The rate of tax that currently applies to this tax code is a flat rate of 15%. The flat rate aims to reflect the average rate of tax faced by non-resident seasonal workers on their New Zealand sourced income. The flat tax rate policy was developed in conjunction with the removal of the legislative requirement for non-resident seasonal workers to file an end-of-year tax return. 3. Some of the non-resident seasonal workers under the RSE scheme are still using the STC (special tax code) code, which was the code used prior to the introduction of the NSW code and which can still be used by the workers until they leave New Zealand. For the purposes of recommending a rate applicable to the NSW tax code, we have assumed that 70% of non-resident seasonal workers are currently using the NSW tax code and that 30% of non- resident seasonal workers are still using the STC tax code. 4. The reduction in personal tax rates was a key element of the Budget 2010 tax package. The 2010 Budget tax reform Regulatory Impact Statement (Tax Reform package for Budget 2010) discussed the importance of shifting the tax mix away from personal taxation towards GST. The NSW tax rate is intended to reflect an average rate of tax faced by non-resident seasonal workers on their New Zealand sourced income. The reduction in personal tax rates in Budget 2010 and previous years has led to a misalignment of the lowest personal tax rate and the rate applicable to non-resident seasonal workers. As a result, the current rate of 15% is no longer the correct rate for the majority of non-resident seasonal workers and this has led to the need to review the rate. OBJECTIVES 5. In the past, the Government has relied on three key principles when deciding how to treat non-resident seasonal workers. These principles do not form an exclusive list and are just some of the factors that are taken into consideration: • Accuracy - One objective of the NSW tax code is to withhold tax from non-resident seasonal workers at a rate that reflects, as closely as possible, their correct average tax rate. As the NSW rate is a flat rate, there will always be some people who have tax under- withheld and, if the flat rate is set above the lowest personal tax rate, some people will have tax over-withheld. However, the aim is to minimise the amount of tax over-withheld and the tax under-withheld for the largest number of people. If the rate is set at the lowest personal tax rate, given that non-resident seasonal workers are generally on low wages 3 and only work part of the year, the risk of under-withholding tax for them is perceived to be low, and the risk of over-withholding is nil. • Low compliance costs – One of the key components of the non-resident seasonal workers tax regime is that the workers do not have to file an end of year tax return. This is desirable because often English is the workers’ second language and this can make it complex to file a tax return in New Zealand. In addition, the workers are only employed for a part year (seasonal work) and therefore may have left New Zealand by the required filing time and without easy access to the internet, it can be costly and complicated getting in contact with Inland Revenue to confirm details or file a tax return. • Similar treatment for New Zealand employees - Non-resident seasonal workers should not be put in an advantageous position when compared to New Zealand workers. Under the RSE scheme employers can only offer employment opportunities to non-resident seasonal workers if they cannot find New Zealand citizens or residents to perform the same job. Further, a non-resident seasonal worker should face a rate of tax that is approximately equal to what a New Zealand worker in a similar situation would pay. 6. There is no statutory requirement for the rate of tax applicable to the NSW code to be reviewed, however, as noted in paragraph 10 below, if the rate is not changed this will encourage non-resident seasonal workers to file an end-of-year tax return. OPTIONS 7. There are two options. The first option is to retain the status quo and leave the NSW rate at 15%. The second option is to lower the NSW rate from 15% to 10.5% (which is considered to be the average rate of tax that would otherwise apply under the marginal tax rate system). 8. Reducing the rate of tax that applies to the NSW tax code to 10.5% will cost $3.8 million per year. This cost was included in the costings for the personal tax rate reductions in Budget 2010. Discussion of option one 9. If no change was made to the NSW tax code and the status quo was retained non- resident seasonal workers could still be taxed at the correct rate of tax but only if they filed an end-of- year tax return. 10. The large proportion of non-resident seasonal workers who have annual New Zealand income of up to $14,000 would be subject to a higher rate of tax than appropriate under the progressive tax scale. This would encourage those workers to file an end-of-year tax return. This would be contrary to one of the original drivers of the special tax regime, which was to minimise compliance costs. 11. If the status quo was retained, the small proportion of non-resident seasonal workers who have annual New Zealand income of more than $14,000 would be taxed closer to their correct rate. Discussion of option two 12. The proposed new rate of 10.5% was chosen after analysing industry data. The Department of Labour provided a sample of data obtained from employers in the Hawkes Bay, Waikato and the Bay of Plenty. The Department of Labour data relates to 638 workers 4 under the last two seasons of the RSE scheme and the average annual wage of this sample was $10,490. Of the Department of Labour data, 80% of the workers had an annual income of less than $14,000. 13. In addition, data has been extracted from Inland Revenue’s database. The Inland Revenue data relates to workers who elected to apply the NSW tax code in the tax year from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010. The NSW tax code could only be elected from 1 April 2009. The Inland Revenue sample consisted of 6,655 people with an average annual wage of $7,638. Of these non-resident seasonal workers, 85% had an annual income of less than $14,000. The analysis of the Inland Revenue data also supports the proposed new rate of 10.5%. 14. Although the average tax rate of some non-resident seasonal workers will be higher than 10.5%, it is expected that given the nature of seasonal work and the wage rates of the workers, this rate will be closer to the average tax rate faced by these workers. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 15. Analysis of the tax rate that should be applied to non-resident seasonal workers under the RSE scheme, after the Budget 2010 reductions to personal tax rates, shows that the only practicable option is to legislate for a new flat tax rate to apply to non-resident seasonal workers. This outcome supports the original 2008 policy of a flat tax rate for non-resident seasonal workers based on the principles of accuracy, low compliance costs and, comparability of tax treatment, outlined in paragraph 5 above 16. There are no practical non-regulatory options. CONSULTATION 17. The Department of Labour were consulted and support the proposed change. Inland Revenue originally became aware of workers’ discontent with the current NSW rate from Department of Labour intelligence. Following the reductions in personal tax rates, officials from Pacific Island nations had requested that the tax rate for non-resident seasonal workers also be reduced. This request was made at various forums and through different New Zealand government departments. Reasons that were given to the Department of Labour for this request included:  Most non-resident seasonal workers have no history of paying income tax in their home countries and do not necessarily understand or accept the concept of universal taxation to fund central government services. From a perspective of fairness, it is difficult for the workers to come to terms with the imposition of a tax that is used to fund government services that, in many instances, they are not eligible for (such as health, education, and social services). This is especially the case when personal tax rates in New Zealand are reducing.  Non-resident seasonal workers are keen to maximise their earnings while they are in New Zealand, and are thus very conscious of the various deductions that are made from their gross earnings (including airfares, food, accommodation, transport and health insurance, as well as PAYE). 5 18. The Department of Labour also advised Inland Revenue that tax issues and the possibility of reducing tax liability are regularly raised in official and ministerial level discussions with Pacific country representatives. 19. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been informed and are supportive of the proposed 10.5% rate changed. Their support is based on their view that, from an equity perspective, non-resident seasonal workers should face a rate of tax that reflects the taxpayer funded services they are likely to receive. 20. The Treasury was also consulted on this proposal and agrees with the decrease to the NSW tax rate from 15% to 10.5%. 21. Given time constraints, members of the horticulture and viticulture industry have not been consulted. From a tax policy perspective this is seen to be acceptable as the change of rate proposed is simply consequential to the tax rate changes. There is no change in policy and the rate change is taxpayer-friendly. We consider that employers will be supportive of the change as employers have stated that non-resident seasonal workers often query them about perceived excessive withholding of tax. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 22. As a result of the changes to the personal tax rates, there are two options to be considered in regard to the flat tax rate for non-resident seasonal workers. The first is to retain the status quo and the second is to change the rate of tax that applies to the NSW tax code from 15% to 10.5%. 23. Under the first option, the majority of non-resident seasonal workers would have too much tax withheld. However, they would be able to square-up their tax obligations and receive a refund if necessary by filing an end-of-year tax return. 24. Under the second option, the majority of non-resident seasonal workers would be taxed at the correct rate. Some workers would have too little tax withheld. These workers are unlikely to square-up their tax obligations at the end of the year, because this would result in them having to pay additional tax. 25. On balance, we recommend that the second option be adopted. 6 IMPLEMENTATION 26. Tax is calculated on an annual basis according to the tax year that runs from 1 April to 31 March. As the proposed change to the NSW rate would apply from 1 April 2011, the beginning of a new tax year, there will be no transitional issues arising. For the tax year ending 31 March 2011, workers would have tax withheld at the current rate of 15%. For the tax year ending 31 March 2012, if the legislative change is made, workers would have tax withheld at the rate of 10.5%. Non-resident seasonal workers would retain the ability to file a return. 27. A communications strategy will be developed in conjunction with the Department of Labour for the new tax rate. The primary focus would be on the employers of non-resident seasonal workers. At this stage communications with the Pacific Island Governments have not been fully considered, however opportunities to inform the Pacific Island Governments could be explored. 28. Under the proposed change, compliance costs are reduced for taxpayers as they are more likely to have tax withheld at the correct rate and are less likely to file an end-of-year tax return. 29. However, it should be noted that for the 2010-11 tax year (the year ending 31 March 2011) non-resident seasonal workers are more likely to have tax over-withheld and, therefore, are more likely to file a tax return. This will occur because of the reduction in personal tax rates from Budget 2010 applying from 1 October 2010. Due to the relatively small number of people on the NSW tax rate and the fact that this particular anomaly is only for one year, we consider that it would not be worthwhile implementing measures to reduce compliance costs from 1 October 2010. 30. The legislative amendment changing the rate applicable to the NSW tax code means that all non-resident seasonal workers electing the NSW tax code will, from 1 April 2011, have tax withheld at the new rate of 10.5%. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 31. If there are significant changes to the personal tax rate scale, or if it is found that the data on which the current review was based was not a representative sample of the industry, this may prompt another review of the NSW tax rate to take place. A review would involve examining the appropriate average tax rate for non-resident seasonal workers based on recent data from the industry, in accordance with the principles of accuracy, low compliance costs and, comparability of tax treatment, outlined in paragraph 5 above. 32. Through regular audits, the Department of Labour will continue to collect and analyse data on RSE workers’ wages. In addition, the Department of Labour will continue to engage with Pacific Island Governments on RSE policy matters and discuss any issues or concerns that are raised with Inland Revenue.
Regulatory Impact Statement Legislative changes to assist in the recovery of student loan debt Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides analysis of proposed legislative support for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to recall student loans when loan repayments are in arrears. The problem is that although all student loan contracts have a clause that allows for recall of debt, the contracts differ in respect of which agency may recall the amount and whether it is only the amount in default or whether the whole loan (including amounts not currently in default) may be recalled. Our recommended approach to this problem is a legislative change to provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the ability to recall an entire student loan that could be exercised in cases of serious non-compliance. This is intended to encourage compliance, both from those borrowers in relation to whom the recall power is exercised, and from the wider borrower population who would become aware of the recall power. Initially, this power is intended to be used in respect of the recovery of debt from borrowers based in Australia. We have consulted with the Treasury, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Education Lead Official, the Offices of the Privacy Commissioner in New Zealand and Australia and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs who agree with this approach. We also contacted the New Zealand Embassy in Australia, via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to create awareness of Inland Revenue's planned activities in Australia. The legislative change proposed in this statement would not impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest or override fundamental common law principles. Group Manager Inland Revenue 3 November 2010 BACKGROUND Previous Intermediate Regulatory Impact Statement 1. As set out in our last Intermediate Regulatory Impact Statement, Collection of overdue student loan repayments from overseas-based borrowers (11 August 2010), the Student Loans Scheme is subject to much higher levels of potential loan default than would be accepted by a commercial lender. Despite the introduction of an amnesty and the three-year repayment holiday, overseas-based borrower debt is still growing. 2. The problem arises due to the unsecured nature of the loans, which are provided to a population of relatively mobile borrowers without regard to their ability to repay their loan. The lack of security becomes a particular problem with borrowers who move overseas. 3. In focusing debt-collection activities to maximise revenue for the Crown, the Commissioner makes trade-offs regarding the level and nature of debt pursued as a result of the finite resources available. Given the resource cost of pursuing offshore debt, the ability to collect overdue student loan repayments from borrowers based overseas is thereby impeded. 4. Further, the Student Loans Scheme is not well suited to simple or cost effective recovery of overseas-based borrower debt (including from those borrowers who are based in Australia). Issues arise in relation to integration with the tax system, the lack of legislative authority for the lender to recall and assign loans, payment costs and locating borrowers. 5. Therefore, the objective of our previous Intermediate Regulatory Impact Statement was to investigate ways to improve overdue student loan repayment collection, including by: (i) legally pursuing overseas-based borrowers with significant overdue debt; (ii) using private-sector firms to collect debt; and (iii) preventing non-compliant student loan borrowers from travelling overseas. 6. Approaches (i) and (ii) are consistent with commercial debt recovery practices and have been progressed by Inland Revenue. However, approach (iii) gives rise to human rights issues and requires further work to gauge its viability. It will be reported on to the Minister of Revenue and Minister for Tertiary Education in December this year. 7. A more commercial approach to student loan debt recovery may be achieved through changes in the policy framework and the administrative approach to loan collection. Inland Revenue plans to operate a risk-based debt recovery model applied by a specialist debt recovery team focusing on borrowers with overdue student loan repayments who are based in Australia. If the initiative is successful it could be extended to collect student loan debt from borrowers in other jurisdictions. This Regulatory Impact Statement 8. To assist Inland Revenue in its debt collection efforts, a legislative change is sought to provide the Commissioner with the ability to recall an entire student loan transferred to him (including amounts not yet in arrears) that may be exercised in cases of serious non- compliance. This is intended to encourage compliance from both the borrowers in relation to whom the recall power is exercised and the wider borrower population through awareness of collection activity. STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 9. As already noted, there are a number of difficulties in the current system that impair Inland Revenue's ability to collect student loans. This Regulatory Impact Statement focuses on whether legislation should be introduced so that student loans can be recalled. 10. The problem is that although all student loan contracts have a clause that allows for recall of debt, the contracts differ in respect of which agency may recall the amount and whether it is only the amount in default or whether the whole loan (including amounts not currently in default) may be recalled. 11. In circumstances where recall is limited to arrear amounts, a successful enforcement action may mean that debt is paid at the time of the enforcement, but the borrower defaults on future repayment obligations. OBJECTIVE 12. The overall objective is to reduce the growth of student loan debt and support the Government's approach to reducing the permanent loss of skills to New Zealand by removing an incentive for individuals to leave New Zealand to obtain a student loan advantage. 13. This Statement assesses potential changes to the legislative framework needed to support the recovery of overdue repayments from student loan borrowers, in particular the recalling of student loans that may be exercised in cases of serious non-compliance. 1 The Ministry of Social Development annually transfers loans to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in order that repayments can be made by borrowers when due. POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE OPTIONS 14. Potential legislative options in respect of the recall of student loans are set out below. Options Description Disadvantages Benefits Implementation risks No legislative authority providing the lender with the ability to recall student loan (status quo) Not preferred The current student loan contracts are unclear as to whether student loans can be recalled in cases of serious non-compliance. This is because from year to year the lenders differ so it is unclear who can recall the loan and how much they can recall. The lack of clarity means that it is unclear whether the Commissioner can recall student loans. The ability to recall the entire student loan is unclear. This means that this method is not available to the Commissioner to assist in the recovery of student loan debt and improve compliance. Less efficient and effective methods would continue to be used. If the legislation is not changed to allow for the recall of student loans then the expected cost is a continued high level of non- compliance. Nil. None since no legislative change would occur. Legislative ability for Inland Revenue to recall outstanding amount of student loan Not preferred Legislative authority for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to recall only the outstanding amount of a student loan. Recalling only overdue amounts is unlikely to improve compliance. There may still be a cost of subsequent legal action in respect of arrear amounts. Legal costs of enforcing the recall of the arrear amounts in cases of serious non- compliance are expected to be between $5,000-$ 10,000 per case for personnel and court costs. These are estimated costs as the Commissioner has not enforced a recall of a student loan before. The cost associated with communications on recalling student loan arrears and the expected compliance gained from this cannot be determined at this stage. Recovery of the debt. Legislative ability to recall may encourage compliance even if ability not exercised. Where successful action for enforcement of an arrear amount is taken against the overseas-based debtor, they may still default on their future loan repayment obligations (almost immediately). Further work will need to be undertaken on administrative processes. Legislative ability for Inland Revenue to recall the entire student loan Preferred Legislative authority for Commissioner of Inland Revenue to recall the entire student loan. Cost of legal action in loan being recalled, personnel and court costs are expected to be between $5,000-$10,000 per case. These are estimated costs only as the Commissioner has not recalled a student loan. The cost associated with communications on recalling a student loan and the expected compliance gained from this cannot be determined at this early stage. Encourages compliance in respect of the recall and impact on other borrowers. Consistent with commercial debt collection practices. Provides certainty in respect of which agency can recall student loans (some loans are currently unclear on this point) Further work will need to be undertaken on administrative processes. CONSULTATION 15. We have consulted with the Treasury, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Education Lead Official, the Offices of the Privacy Commissioner in New Zealand and Australia and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs. These agencies agree with the approach that we are proposing initially for application in Australia. The Ministry of Consumer Affairs also made the point that the legislation in relation to recalling student loans needs to be consistent with the substance of the contract. 16. We also contacted the New Zealand Embassy in Australia, via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to create awareness of Inland Revenue's planned activities in Australia. RECOMMENDATION 17. For certainty and clarification of the student loan contracts, we recommend an amendment to the Student Loan Scheme Act allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to recall the entire loan balance of loans that have been transferred to him. The recall of a loan is intended to be undertaken in cases of serious non-compliance and after other recovery actions have been attempted. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 18. The Student Loan Scheme Act, which would contain the Commissioner's ability to recall a student loan, is subject to regular review. If issues are raised by borrowers in respect of the recall provision then officials would consider whether procedures are required to determine whether there are substantive grounds for review. 19. Integration of further elements into the Student Loans Scheme to improve the management of overseas-based borrower debt (including the assignment of student loans and the restriction on foreign travel) will be reported on to Ministers in December this year.
1 Standard Practice Statement ED 0126 Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue This item also appears in Tax Information Bulletin xxxx \[yet to be determined\] Introduction 1. This Standard Practice Statement (“SPS”) sets out the Commissioner’s rights and responsibilities with a taxpayer in respect of an adjustment to an assessment when the Commissioner commences the disputes resolution process. 2. Where a taxpayer commences the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner’s practice is set out in SPS XX/XX Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer. \[See ED 0127 under consultation\] 3. The Commissioner regards this SPS as a reference guide for taxpayers and Inland Revenue officers. Where possible, Inland Revenue officers must follow the practices outlined in this SPS. 4. The disputes resolution process is designed to ensure that there is a full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process. 5. The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an “all cards on the table” approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed before a case proceeds to a court or hearing authority. 6. In accordance with the objectives of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner (unless a statutory exception applies under section 89C or 89N(1)(c)) must go through the disputes resolution process before the Commissioner can issue an assessment. Application 7. This SPS applies from \[date to be determined following completion of consultation\]. 8. It replaces SPS 08/01: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 2 Background 9. The tax disputes resolution procedures were introduced in accordance with the recommendations of the Richardson Committee in the Report of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department (April 1994) and were designed to reduce the number of disputes by: (a) promoting full disclosure, and (b) encouraging the prompt and efficient resolution of tax disputes, and (c) promoting the early identification of issues, and (d) improving the accuracy of decisions. 10. The disputes resolution process ensures that there is a full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process. 11. The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an “all cards on the table” approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed before a case proceeds to a court or hearing authority. 12. In accordance with the objectives of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner (unless a statutory exception applies under section 89C or 89N(1)(c)) must go through the disputes resolution process before the Commissioner can issue an assessment. 13. The early resolution of a dispute is intended to be achieved through a series of steps specified in the TAA. The main elements of those steps are: (a) a notice of proposed adjustment (“NOPA”): this is a notice that either the Commissioner or taxpayer issues to the other advising that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer’s assessment, the Commissioner’s assessment or other disputable decision (the requisite form is the IR 770 Notice of proposed adjustment). (b) a notice of response (“NOR”): this must be issued by the recipient of a NOPA if they disagree with it (the preferred form is the IR 771 Notice of response). (c) a disclosure notice and statement of position (“SOP”): the issue of a disclosure notice by the Commissioner triggers the issue of a SOP. Each SOP must provide an outline of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law with sufficient details to support the position taken. Each party must issue a SOP (the requisite form is the IR 773 Statement of position). The SOP is an important document because it limits the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that either party can rely on if the case 3 proceeds to court to what is included in the SOP (unless a hearing authority makes an order that allows a party to raise new facts or evidence under section 138G(2)). 14. There are also two administrative phases in the process – the conference and adjudication phases. If the dispute has not been already resolved after the NOR phase, the Commissioner’s practice will be to hold a conference. A conference can be a formal or informal discussion between the parties to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues. 15. If the dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase, the Commissioner will prepare a SOP and refer the dispute to adjudication, except in certain circumstances. One of the circumstances where the Commissioner will not refer a dispute to adjudication is where the Commissioner and the taxpayer have agreed in writing not to complete the disputes process (referred to as “opt-out”). 16. Adjudication involves an independent review of the dispute by Inland Revenue’s Adjudication Unit, which was formed to provide an internal but impartial review of unresolved disputes. Adjudication is the final phase in the process before the taxpayer’s assessment is amended (if it is to be amended) following the exchange of the SOPs. 17. Timely progression of disputes through the disputes process may require the use of the Commissioner’s information gathering powers (particularly section 17) before and/or during the disputes process. 18. Inland Revenue has a quality assurance review process known as Core Task Assurance (“CTA”) which is designed to ensure that key pieces of work (including NOPAs and SOPs) are subject to an independent review by Legal & Technical Services (LTS) before being issued. Given the importance of the disputes process to the Commissioner and to taxpayers, Inland Revenue officers are required to get CTA approval of disputes documents prior to issue. Glossary 19.

Set out below is a summary of the key actions and administrative time frames where the disputes process is commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 22. These actions and time frames are intended to be administrative guide lines for Inland Revenue officers. Any failure to meet these administrative time frames will not invalidate subsequent actions of the Commissioner or prevent the case from going through the disputes process. Paragraph in the SPS Key actions Indicative time frames The Commissioner’s NOPA 95 The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer that a NOPA will be issued. Usually within five working days before the date that the Commissioner issues a NOPA, but this may happen earlier. 100 The Commissioner will confirm whether the taxpayer has received the Commissioner’s NOPA (either by telephone or in writing). Within 10 working days from the date that the Commissioner’s NOPA is issued, where practicable. Taxpayer’s NOR 193 The taxpayer issues a NOR in response to the Commissioner’s NOPA within the applicable response period. Within two months from the date that the Commissioner’s NOPA is issued, unless any of the “exceptional circumstances” under section 89K applies. 194 The Commissioner will confirm whether the taxpayer will issue a NOR. Usually two weeks before the response period for the Commissioner’s NOPA expires. 214 The Commissioner will forward the taxpayer’s NOR to the responsible officer. Usually within one week after the taxpayer’s NOR is received. 215 The Commissioner will acknowledge the receipt of the taxpayer’s NOR. Usually within two weeks after the taxpayer’s NOR is received. 221 The Commissioner will advise that the taxpayer’s NOR is deficient, but the two-month response period has not expired. Inland Revenue officers will advise the taxpayer or their agent immediately after they become aware of the deficiency. 211 The Commissioner will consider the application of “exceptional circumstances” under section 89K, where a taxpayer’s NOR has been issued outside the applicable Usually within three weeks after the taxpayer’s application is received. 8 response period. 200 The taxpayer is deemed to accept the Commissioner’s NOPA, because they failed to issue a NOR within the applicable response period and none of the “exceptional circumstances” apply in the case of a late NOR. Usually two weeks after the response period to the Commissioner’s NOPA has expired. 216 The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer whether their NOR is being considered, has been accepted or rejected in full or part. Usually within one month after the taxpayer’s NOR is received. 217 If the taxpayer’s NOR has been accepted in full, the dispute finishes and Inland Revenue will take appropriate actions (for example, issue an amended assessment). Usually within one month after the advice of acceptance of the NOR is issued. Conference phase 234 The Commissioner will contact the taxpayer to initiate the conference phase and to offer a facilitated conference. A conference usually commences within one month after the Commissioner rejects the taxpayer’s NOR. The conference letter marks the start of the conference phase. The suggested average time frame of the conference phase is three months, subject to the facts and complexity of the dispute. Opt out 266 The taxpayer may request to opt out of the disputes resolution process Within two weeks from the end of the conference phase. 266 Inland Revenue officer will advise the taxpayer whether the request to opt out has been agreed to. Usually within two weeks from the date of the taxpayer’s request to opt out. Disclosure notice and the Commissioner’s SOP 300 The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer that a disclosure notice and the Commissioner’s SOP will be issued. Usually within two weeks before the date that the Commissioner’s disclosure notice and SOP are issued. The Commissioner will issue a disclosure notice and the Commissioner’s SOP. Usually within three months from the end of the conference phase or within three months from the date when the Commissioner advises that the taxpayer’s opt-out request has 9 been declined. Taxpayer’s SOP The taxpayer must issue a SOP within the response period for the disclosure notice. Within two months after the date that the disclosure notice is issued, unless any of the “exceptional circumstances” under section 89K apply. 334 The Commissioner will confirm whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP. Usually two weeks before the response period for the Commissioner’s disclosure notice expires. 334 The taxpayer’s SOP is forwarded to the responsible officer. Usually within one week after the taxpayer’s SOP is received. 336 The Commissioner will acknowledge the receipt of the taxpayer’s SOP. Usually within two weeks after the taxpayer’s SOP is received. 336 The Commissioner will advise that the taxpayer’s SOP is deficient, but the two-month response period has not expired. Inland Revenue officers will advise the taxpayer or their agent as soon as they become aware of the deficiency. 337 The Commissioner will consider the application of “exceptional circumstances” under section 89K, where the taxpayer’s SOP has been issued outside the applicable response period. Usually within three weeks after the taxpayer’s application is received. 338 The taxpayer is deemed to accept the Commissioner’s SOP, because they failed to issue a SOP within the applicable response period and none of the “exceptional circumstances” apply. Usually two weeks after the response period for the disclosure notice expires. Addendum to the Commissioner’s SOP 340 The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer whether the Commissioner will provide additional information via an addendum under section 89M(8) to the Commissioner’s SOP. Usually within two weeks after the taxpayer’s SOP is received, subject to the facts and complexity of the dispute and the available response period. 339 The Commissioner can provide additional information via an addendum to the Commissioner’s SOP under section 89M(8) within the response period for the taxpayer’s SOP. Within two months after the taxpayer’s SOP is issued. 10 344 The Commissioner will consider the taxpayer’s request to include additional information in their SOP under section 89M(13). Usually within one month after the date that the Commissioner’s addendum is issued. Adjudication 357 The Commissioner will prepare a cover sheet and issue a letter (including a copy of the cover sheet) to the taxpayer to seek their concurrence of the materials to be sent to the adjudicator. Usually within one month after the date that the Commissioner’s addendum (if any) is issued or within one month from the date that the response period for the taxpayer’s SOP to expire. 358 The taxpayer must respond to the Commissioner’s letter. Within two weeks after the date that the Commissioner’s letter is issued. 359 The Commissioner will forward materials relevant to the dispute to the Adjudication Unit. Usually after the taxpayer has concurred on the materials to be sent to the Adjudication Unit or within 10 working days after the date that the Commissioner’s letter is issued if no response is received. 363 Adjudication of the disputes case Usually within 3 months after the date that the Adjudication Unit receives the dispute files depending on the number of disputes that are before the Adjudication Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. Standard Practice and Analysis THE COMMISSIONER MUST ISSUE A NOPA BEFORE MAKING AN ASSESSMENT 23. The Commissioner must issue a NOPA before making an assessment (including an assessment of shortfall penalties but excluding other civil penalties and interest), unless an exception to the requirement that a NOPA be issued applies under section 89C. 24. Nevertheless, even if the Commissioner, in a very unlikely event, made an assessment in breach of section 89C, the assessment would be regarded as being valid under section 114(a). 25. Each exception under section 89C can apply independently or together depending on the circumstances. However, the Commissioner can also choose to issue a NOPA before making an assessment notwithstanding that an exception under section 89C applies. 11 A disputable decision 26. Pursuant to the definition in section 3(1), a disputable decision is: (a) an assessment, or (b) a decision that the Commissioner makes under a tax law, except for a decision: (i) to decline to issue a binding ruling, or (ii) that cannot be the subject of an objection or challenge, or (iii) that is left to the Commissioner’s discretion under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8), (10) and 89N(3). 27. The Commissioner will generally issue a NOPA before issuing an assessment that takes into account a disputable decision. 28. For example, the Commissioner issues a notice of disputable decision to a taxpayer who is a director and shareholder of a company advising that the company’s loss attributing qualifying company election for the 2007 tax year is invalid because it is received late. However, the company’s loss calculation and assessment for the 2007 tax year are not affected. The Commissioner intends to issue an assessment to the taxpayer that takes into account the notice of disputable decision by disallowing the company’s losses that the taxpayer has claimed. The Commissioner will issue a NOPA to the taxpayer before making the assessment. EXCEPTIONS Exception 1: The assessment corresponds with a tax return 29. Section 89C(a) reads: The assessment corresponds with a tax return that has been provided by the taxpayer. 30. The application of section 89C(a) is limited under the self-assessment rules. Generally, a taxpayer makes an assessment and files a tax return that includes that assessment. If the taxpayer’s assessment is supported by the information in the tax return and any underlying source documents that the taxpayer has provided and the Commissioner agrees with the taxpayer’s return and assessment there is no need for the Commissioner to invoke the disputes process. 31. In these circumstances, instead of issuing a notice of assessment the Commissioner will issue a statement of account that confirms the taxpayer’s assessment. The statutory response period for the purposes of the disputes process will commence from the date that Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer’s assessment. 12 32. Sometimes, if there is a deficiency in the taxpayer’s tax return, the Commissioner will issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer because section 89C(a) applies. For example, the Commissioner can issue an assessment, where the taxpayer has provided all their income details but omitted to calculate their income tax liability in the tax return. Exception 2: Simple or obvious mistake or oversight 33. Section 89C(b) reads: The taxpayer has provided a tax return which, in the Commissioner's opinion, appears to contain a simple or obvious mistake or oversight, and the assessment merely corrects the mistake or oversight. 34. This exception is intended to apply to a simple calculation error or oversight that Inland Revenue’s Processing Centres generally discover with computer edits and simple return checks. This maintains the status quo for the many assessments arising in this situation. 35. The Commissioner will generally treat the following as a simple mistake or oversight: (a) an arithmetical error, and (b) an error in transposing numbers from one box to another in a tax return, and (c) double counting, such as inadvertently including in the taxpayer’s income the same item twice, and (d) not claiming a rebate to which the taxpayer is entitled or that was incorrectly calculated, for example, the low income rebate for a taxpayer. 36. A “simple or obvious mistake or oversight” can be determined on a case-by-case basis with no dollar limit. The Commissioner may consider whether this exception applies irrespective of whether the taxpayer has requested that the Commissioner makes an amendment under section 113 or applies the exception under section 89C(b). 37. Where the Commissioner issues an assessment to correct a taxpayer’s simple or obvious mistake or oversight, the Commissioner may consider imposing shortfall penalties on the taxpayer, if there is a tax shortfall and the taxpayer has committed one of the culpable acts, for example, lack of reasonable care and not relied on the action or advice of their tax advisor for the purposes of section 141A(2B). 13 Exception 3: Agreement to amend previous tax position 38. Section 89C(c) reads: The assessment corrects a tax position previously taken by the taxpayer in a way or manner agreed by the Commissioner and the taxpayer. 39. This situation can occur if the issue is raised by either the Commissioner or the taxpayer. There is no need to issue a NOPA because no dispute arises. 40. If the Commissioner proposes the adjustment, this exception cannot apply unless the taxpayer accepts the adjustment. For the purpose of section 89C(c), the agreement between the parties can be oral, although, generally, the Commissioner’s practice will be to seek written agreement. Section 89C(c) applies if Inland Revenue officers can demonstrate that the Commissioner and taxpayer have agreed on the proposed adjustment. 41. However, if the parties agree on only one adjustment and dispute others in respect of the same assessment, the Commissioner cannot issue an assessment on the basis of the agreed adjustment because the tax position is not necessarily correct. 42. Where a taxpayer proposes an adjustment outside the disputes process and the Commissioner agrees, for example a taxpayer makes a request to amend an assessment, the particulars must be recorded in writing and state that the assessment is made in accordance with the Commissioner’s practice on exercising the discretion under section 113. (See SPS 07/03: Requests to amend assessments.) The Commissioner must also consider if shortfall penalties are applicable. Exception 4: The assessment otherwise reflects an agreement 43. Section 89C(d) reads: The assessment reflects an agreement reached between the Commissioner and the taxpayer. 44. The same procedures apply for section 89C(c) and (d). However, the agreement that the parties reach does not have to relate to a tax position that the taxpayer has previously taken. 45. For example, the taxpayer has disputed but now agrees that they are a “taxpayer” for the purpose of the definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA 2007”) and has not provided a tax return. The Commissioner will issue an assessment to the taxpayer under section 89C(d) to reflect this agreement. The Commissioner must also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable. 46. An example is where, pursuant to section 6A, the Commissioner settles a tax case and disputes process. In such cases, the Commissioner will usually enter into an individual settlement deed and agreed adjustment in writing with the taxpayer to confirm the settlement. 14 47. The Commissioner will then give effect to that settlement deed and agreed adjustment by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer under section 89C(d) without first issuing a NOPA. 48. This is notwithstanding that the assessment does not necessarily reflect the Commissioner’s own view of the correct tax position. (The Commissioner can also issue an assessment under section 89C(c).) Exception 5: Material facts and law identical to court proceeding 49. Section 89C(db) reads: The assessment is made in relation to a matter for which the material facts and relevant law are identical to those for an assessment of the taxpayer for another period that is at the time the subject of court proceedings. 50. Pursuant to section 89C(db), the Commissioner can issue an assessment to the taxpayer in relation to the other period that is the subject of court proceedings, without first issuing a NOPA. The Commissioner does not have to follow the disputes process for the same issue in the other period because the matter is before the court to resolve. A dual process towards resolution does not need to be adopted. The Commissioner will also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable. 51. However, a taxpayer who has been issued with an assessment in relation to another period under section 89C(db), can dispute that assessment by issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner under section 89D within the applicable response period. 52. Section 89C(db) is intended to reduce compliance costs. Notwithstanding this provision, the Commissioner can elect to issue a NOPA in respect of the other period in order to resolve the dispute through the disputes process. Exception 6: Revenue protection 53. Section 89C(e) reads: The Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe a notice may cause the taxpayer or an associated person – (i) To leave New Zealand; or (ii) To take steps, in relation to the existence or location of the taxpayer’s assets, making it harder for the Commissioner to collect the tax from the taxpayer. 54. This exception is intended to ensure that the revenue is protected in the relevant circumstances. Section 89C(e) does not require that the taxpayer has physical possession of their assets. 55. If Inland Revenue officers apply the exception under section 89C(e), this should be supported by evidence of the “reasonable grounds” relied on (for example, the 15 taxpayer’s correspondence with third parties, application to emigrate overseas and any transcripts of interviews with the taxpayer, etc.) Exception 7: Fraudulent activity 56. Section 89C(eb) reads: The Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer has been involved in fraudulent activity. 57. Pursuant to section 89C(eb), a taxpayer has been involved in a fraudulent activity if they have: (a) engaged or participated in, or has been connected with, any fraudulent activity that would have tax consequences for them, and (b) acted deliberately with the knowledge that they were acting in breach of their legal obligations and did so without an honest belief that they were so entitled to act. 58. If the taxpayer has not been convicted of an offence relating to a fraudulent activity section 89C(eb) can still apply provided that the Commissioner believes on reasonable grounds that the taxpayer has been involved in a fraudulent activity. 59. If Inland Revenue officers apply the exception under section 89C(eb), this should be supported by sufficient evidence of the “reasonable grounds” relied on. The evidence does not have to be absolute proof but, merely sufficient to verify the “reasonable grounds”. Exception 8: Vexatious or frivolous 60. Section 89C(f) reads: The assessment corrects a tax position previously taken by a taxpayer that, in the opinion of the Commissioner is, or is the result of, a vexatious or frivolous act of, or vexatious or frivolous failure to act by, the taxpayer. 61. If Inland Revenue officers apply this exception, this should be supported by documentation that evidences: (a) the action or inaction giving rise to the tax positions previously taken, and (b) why that action is considered to be vexatious or frivolous and any shortfall penalties/prosecution consideration. Examples of a tax position taken as result of a vexatious or frivolous act are a tax position that is: (i) clearly lacking in substance, for example, where the taxpayer continues to take the same position that has previously been finalised, or (ii) motivated by the sole purpose of delay. 16 62. Where this exception applies, the Commissioner must also consider the imposition of shortfall penalties in respect of the taxpayer’s tax position resulting from a vexatious or frivolous act. Exception 9: Taxation Review Authority or court determination 63. Section 89C(g) reads: The assessment is made as a result of a direction or determination of a court or the Taxation Review Authority. 64. For the purpose of section 89C(g), a direction or determination includes any court or Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) decision that affects the particular taxpayer in relation to a specific tax period and a court decision on a “test case” that applies to the taxpayer irrespective of whether they were a party to the test case. 65. The Commissioner must retain a copy of the direction or determination to support the application of this exception. In these circumstances, the Commissioner will endeavour to make an assessment including imposing shortfall penalties, within two weeks after receiving the written direction or determination. However, if the direction or determination relates to a test case the Commissioner can issue an assessment within the period specified under section 89O(5). Exception 10: “Default assessment” 66. Section 89C(h) reads: The taxpayer has not provided a tax return when and as required by a tax law. 67. If section 89C(h) applies because the taxpayer has failed to provide a tax return the Commissioner can make an assessment or amended assessment pursuant to section 106(1) (commonly known as a “default assessment”). 68. Where a taxpayer seeks to dispute a default assessment through the disputes process, the taxpayer must, within the applicable response period (that is, four months from the date that the default assessment is issued): (a) provide a tax return in the prescribed form for the period to which the default assessment relates (pursuant to section 89D(2C) for GST and section 89D(2) for all other tax types) notwithstanding that the tax return will not include the taxpayer’s assessment, and (b) issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the default assessment. 69. The requirement to provide a tax return in respect of a default assessment made under section 106(1) before issuing a NOPA is an additional requirement of the disputes process. This ensures that the taxpayer has provided the information that is required by the tax law before they are entitled to dispute the assessment. 17 70. If the Commissioner agrees with the taxpayer’s NOPA and tax return, the Commissioner will generally amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113 subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 and any other relevant limitations. However, if the Commissioner does not agree with the taxpayer’s tax return and NOPA the Commissioner can decide to not amend the default assessment and issue a NOR instead. 71. If a taxpayer cannot provide a NOPA because they are outside the applicable response period to dispute a default assessment or do not want to enter into the disputes process, they must still provide a tax return. 72. Although the Commissioner does not have to amend the initial assessment on receipt of the tax return from a defaulting taxpayer, the Commissioner can exercise the discretion to amend under section 113 subject to the time bar in section 108 or 108A and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion. 73. If the Commissioner decides not to exercise the discretion under section 113 to amend the default assessment on the basis of the tax return provided, the Commissioner can issue a NOPA in respect of the default assessment under section 89B(1) where, for example, new information received from the taxpayer suggests that the default assessment is incorrect. Any NOPA must be issued within two months after the date that the default assessment was issued. 74. The Commissioner is not precluded from further investigating an amended assessment issued on the basis of the taxpayer’s tax return and, if necessary, issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer. Exception 11: Failure to make or account for tax deductions 75. Section 89C(i) reads : The assessment is made following the failure by a taxpayer to withhold or deduct an amount required to be withheld or deducted by a tax law or to account for an amount withheld or deducted in the manner required by a tax law. 76. This exception is intended to address a taxpayer’s failure to withhold, deduct or account to the Commissioner for an amount of tax including PAYE, schedular payments to non-resident contractors (formerly withholding payments) and resident withholding tax (“RWT”). The Commissioner must also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable. 77. The Commissioner may not apply this exception if there is a dispute that involves statutory interpretation (for example, whether a particular item attracts liability for RWT) and/or shortfall penalties. 18 Exception 12: Non-assessed tax return 78. Section 89C(j) reads: The taxpayer is entitled to issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of a tax return provided by the taxpayer, and has done so. 79. If a taxpayer proposes an adjustment in a NOPA with which the Commissioner agrees, the Commissioner can issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA. This exception only applies to an adjustment that the taxpayer has proposed in their NOPA under section 89DA(1) within the applicable response period. Exception 13: Consequential adjustment 80. Section 89C(k) reads: The assessment corrects a tax position taken by the taxpayer or an associated person as a consequence or result of an incorrect tax position taken by another taxpayer, and, at the time the Commissioner makes the assessment, the Commissioner has made, or is able to make, an assessment for that other taxpayer for the correct amount of tax payable by that other taxpayer... 81. If transactions affect multiple taxpayers, whether in the same way or in related but opposite ways, the Commissioner can reassess any consequentially affected taxpayers under section 89C(k), if an assessment is, or could be issued to some of the taxpayers for the correct amount of tax payable. This is notwithstanding that the consequentially affected taxpayers have not agreed to the amended assessments. 82. However, those taxpayers subject to the amended assessments can still issue a NOPA to dispute the consequential adjustment if they are within the applicable response period. The Commissioner must also consider whether shortfall penalties are applicable. 83. Section 109(b) deems any assessment that the Commissioner makes to be correct and, therefore, the Commissioner can make any consequential amendment under section 89C(k) accordingly. However, the Commissioner must be satisfied that there is a direct consequential link between the taxpayers before making any consequential adjustment. For example: (a) Group loss offsets: if a loss company has claimed losses to which it is not entitled and the Commissioner has amended the loss company’s loss assessment to disallow those losses, pursuant to section 89C(k), the Commissioner can also make a separate assessment for the profit company that has incorrectly offset the loss company’s losses against its profits. (b) GST: the supplier and recipient of a supply have incorrectly assumed that a transaction was GST-exempt. The Commissioner later agrees that the recipient was entitled to a GST input tax credit and issues an assessment to them allowing the credit. The Commissioner can also issue an assessment 19 to the supplier under section 89C(k) in respect of the output tax on the value of the supply. 84. However, in practice, the Commissioner can issue a NOPA to all the taxpayers affected in such cases. A TAXPAYER CAN DISPUTE AN ASSESSMENT THAT IS ISSUED WITHOUT A NOPA 85. The Commissioner can issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA under section 89C in the circumstances outlined above. Although the Commissioner must always endeavour to apply the exceptions under section 89C correctly, any assessment made in breach of section 89C will still be treated as valid under section 114(a). 86. Where the Commissioner issues an assessment without first issuing a NOPA whether or not in breach of section 89C, the taxpayer can dispute the assessment through the disputes process under section 89D(1). (See SPS 08/02: Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer or any replacement SPS.) 87. However, where the Commissioner issues a NOPA to a taxpayer and they accept the proposed adjustment by written agreement or are deemed to accept the proposed adjustment, then section 89I(1) precludes the taxpayer from challenging the assessment. 88. However, section 89I cannot apply if the Commissioner and taxpayer have agreed on an adjustment before entering into the disputes process. The parties can dispute the amended assessment, notwithstanding the previous agreement. WHEN THE COMMISSIONER CAN ISSUE A NOPA 89. Section 89B specifies when the Commissioner can issue a NOPA. 90. Under section 89B(1) the Commissioner can issue one NOPA for multiple issues, tax types and periods. Alternatively, the Commissioner can issue multiple NOPAs for the same issue and period, consistent with the obligation to correctly make an assessment within the four-year statutory time period. 91. The investigation will have been substantially completed, the facts ascertained, and the proposed adjustment identified and discussed with the taxpayer before a formal NOPA is issued. The Commissioner may actively use his powers to require production of documents in order to ensure that a sustainable position can be taken in the NOPA. The NOPA will also have been quality checked by the Legal and Technical Services unit. 92. A NOPA is not an assessment. It is an initiating action that allows open and full communication between the parties. If possible, the taxpayer will be given the opportunity to settle a dispute by entering into an agreed adjustment with Inland Revenue before the Commissioner issues a NOPA. 20 93. However, the Commissioner or taxpayer is not precluded from issuing a NOPA in respect of any amended assessment that the Commissioner issues to reflect the agreed adjustment within the applicable response period. 94. A NOPA forms a basis for ensuring that the Commissioner does not issue an assessment without some formal and structured dialogue with the taxpayer in respect of the grounds upon which the Commissioner will issue any assessment or amended assessment (McIlraith v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,456). 95. Once an investigation has commenced, the intended approach must be discussed with the taxpayer. If the Commissioner decides to issue a NOPA to a taxpayer, the responsible officer must endeavour to advise the taxpayer of this proposed approach within five working days before the date that the NOPA is issued to allow the taxpayer time to consider their position and/or seek advice. However, the taxpayer can also be advised earlier. 96. The Commissioner should ensure that any issues relating to the same period and tax type are kept together in the dispute. 97. The Commissioner can also exercise certain statutory powers (for example, issuing a section 17 notice) after a dispute has commenced and will continue to investigate the facts that relate to the dispute. 98. If the parties agree upon some and dispute other proposed adjustments for the same tax period and type, the Commissioner cannot issue an assessment that reflects any agreed adjustment already accepted under section 89J(1) until all the remaining disputed issues are resolved (even if the Commissioner does not pursue the disputed issue further) or determined by the Adjudication Unit. That is, the Commissioner will not issue a “partial” or “interim” assessment under section 89J(1) if the Commissioner is not satisfied that the assessment is correct. 99. However, where the statutory time bar is about to fall due, the Commissioner can issue an assessment to reflect both the agreed and disputed adjustment, provided that the requirements of section 89N are met. (See paragraphs 150 to 193 for further discussion). 100. Where it is practicable, Inland Revenue officers will contact the taxpayer or their tax agent within 10 working days after the NOPA is issued to ensure that it has been received. Inland Revenue officers making written contact should comply with section 14. Exceptions to the statutory time bar (a) Time bar waivers 101. If it is contemplated that the disputes process cannot be completed before the statutory time bar period for amending an assessment commences, the parties can agree in writing pursuant to section 108B(1)(a) to waive the time bar by up to 12 months to enable the full disputes process to be applied. 21 102. The taxpayer can also give written notice to the Commissioner and waive the time bar for a further six months after the end of the 12-month period under section 108B(1)(b) to allow sufficient time for the dispute to progress through the adjudication process. This notice must be given to the Commissioner within the initial 12-month period. 103. If the time bar is waived, the taxpayer must be advised in writing that: (a) a NOPA will be issued, and (b) the disputes process will be followed. 104. To be effective, a statutory time bar waiver must be agreed in writing on the prescribed form (IR775 Notice of waiver of time bar) and delivered to the Commissioner before the relevant four-year period expires. 105. The statutory time bar waiver only applies to those issues that the parties have identified and understood before the initial statutory time bar. Other issues not so identified will still be subject to the original statutory time bar, unless section 108(2) or 108A(3) applies. (See paragraph 111 in this SPS.) (b) The Commissioner’s application to the High Court under section 89N(3) 106. If a NOPA has been issued and the disputes process cannot be completed before the statutory time bar period expires, the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for more time to complete the process. (See the discussion regarding section 89N(3) in paragraphs 180 to 191 of this SPS.) 107. However, where the Adjudication Unit has insufficient time (that is, before the statutory time bar arises or further time allowed under section 108B(1) to fully consider a matter submitted to it expires) the Adjudication Unit will return the matter to the responsible officer to decide whether to issue an assessment or amended assessment or accept the taxpayer’s position. Section 89N(2)(b) allows the Commissioner to amend an assessment at any time after the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer’s SOP in relation to the particular period. (See paragraphs 317 to 319 for further discussion). (c) Exceptions under section 89N(1) 108. When a NOPA has been issued, the Commissioner will follow the disputes process unless an exception under section 89N applies. (The application of section 89N is discussed in detail later in paragraphs 149 to 190 of the SPS.) The Commissioner must obtain and document administrative approval for any departure from the full disputes process. Limitations on the Commissioner issuing a NOPA 109. Under section 89B(4), the Commissioner cannot issue a NOPA: (a) if the proposed adjustment is the subject of challenge proceedings, or 22 (b) after the statutory time bar has expired. 110. The time bar that arises under sections 108 and 108A prevents the Commissioner from issuing an assessment that increases the amount assessed. The Commissioner can still issue an assessment that decreases the amount of the initial assessment subject to the limitation on refunding overpaid tax under sections RM 2(1) of the ITA 2007 and 45(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 111. However, the Commissioner is not subject to the statutory time bar that arises under sections 108 and 108A, if the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has: (a) provided a fraudulent or wilfully misleading tax return (section 108(2)(a)), or (b) omitted income for which a tax return must be provided that is of a particular nature or source (section 108(2)(b)), or (c) knowingly or fraudulently failed to make a full and true disclosure of the material facts necessary to determine their GST payable (section 108A(3)). 112. Furthermore, the Commissioner is not subject to the statutory time bar that arises under section 108 if a taxpayer has a remaining tax credit to which section LA 6(1) of the ITA 2007 applies and the Commissioner seeks to amend an assessment or determination to give effect to section LA 6(3) of the ITA 2007 (section 108(3B)). 113. When considering whether the exception under section 108(2)(b) applies, the Commissioner will disregard omissions of relatively small amounts of income by applying the principle of de minimis non curat lex (Babington v C of IR \[1957\] NZLR 861). 114. The Commissioner accepts that the time bar ensures finality in relation to assessments, is a key protection for most taxpayers and the exclusions from its protection must be only invoked if there is an adequate basis in fact and law to support their operation. Section 89B(4)(b) requires that the Commissioner initially decides whether an exception to the time bar applies, for example, whether a tax return is fraudulent or wilfully misleading, before determining whether a NOPA can be issued under section 89B(1). 115. Any opinion that the Commissioner forms regarding the application of the exceptions to the time bar must be honestly held and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the evidence available and the relevant law. The decision must be clearly documented and include reference to the grounds and reasoning on which it is based. Any decision that is made under section 108A is not, in itself, a disputable decision. 23 116. The Commissioner is generally limited to a four-year period within which a taxpayer’s assessment can be increased following an investigation or in certain other circumstances. In respect of a dispute, the assessment is amended (if necessary) after the disputes process is completed. The Commissioner will endeavour to undertake the various steps involved in the process within the four- year period. 117. Section 89B(4)(a) applies to individual proposed adjustments. Where the proposed adjustment is the subject of court proceedings, the Commissioner cannot issue a NOPA in respect of those proposed adjustments. However, the Commissioner can issue a separate NOPA to the taxpayer in relation to the same tax period provided it relates to a different adjustment. 118. For example, a taxpayer challenges the deductibility of feasibility expenditure in the 2009 tax year pursuant to section 138B. The Commissioner can also issue a NOPA to the same taxpayer in relation to the tax treatment of a bad debt in the same tax year. CONTENTS OF THE COMMISSIONER’S NOPA 119. A NOPA is the document that commences the disputes process. It is intended to identify the points of contention and explain the legal or technical aspects of the issuer’s position in relation to the proposed adjustment in a formal and understandable manner. This will ensure that information relevant to the dispute is quickly made available to the parties. Section 89F(1) and (2) specifies the content requirements for any NOPA that the Commissioner may issue. 120. Under section 89F(1)(b), the NOPA must be in the prescribed form (IR770 Notice of proposed adjustment). Any NOPA that the Commissioner issues must identify, in sufficient detail the adjustment proposed and explain concisely the facts and law that relate to the adjustment and how the law applies to the facts. When preparing a NOPA, the Commissioner should avoid repeating facts, arguments or using unnecessary detail. 121. Section 89F(2)(b) requires that the NOPA states the key facts and law concisely and in sufficient detail. The Commissioner must ensure that the document is relatively brief and simple to enable the parties to quickly progress the dispute without incurring substantial expenses or excessive preparation time but also detailed enough to explain all the issues relevant to the dispute. The Commissioner’s NOPAs should be concise, accurate, coherent and logically presented. In preparing a NOPA Inland Revenue officers should avoid unnecessarily using legalistic language. 122. The Commissioner should identify (but not reproduce in full) the relevant legislation and legal principles derived from leading cases. These references should be in sufficient detail to clarify the grounds for the proposed adjustment. However, lengthy quotations from cases should be avoided. 24 123. The Commissioner has a statutory obligation to inform a taxpayer adequately, but it is recognised that the matters relevant to the dispute will be set out in greater detail at the SOP phase if the dispute is not resolved. 124. Therefore, what is included in a NOPA or NOR is not conclusive as between the parties because they can introduce further grounds or information or adjust the quantum of the proposed adjustments later in the disputes process (CIR v Zentrum Holdings Limited (2006) 22 NZTC 19,912). However, the parties cannot propose another adjustment involving new grounds and a fresh liability at the SOP phase. 125. The Commissioner must always endeavour to issue a NOPA that has sufficient details, is of a high standard and has been considered by a legal advisor. The Commissioner must endeavour to advise the taxpayer during the conference phase of any new grounds, information or reduction in quantum that will be introduced in the SOP. 126. If the Commissioner decides to increase the quantum of any proposed adjustment after the NOPA is issued the Commissioner must issue a new NOPA to the taxpayer. 127. Although candid and complete exchanges of information are implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes process, the Commissioner’s practice will be to ensure that the NOPA is, within those limits, as brief as practicable. 128. The content of any NOPA that the Commissioner issues must satisfy all the requirements specified in section 89F(2)(a) to (c). Identify adjustments or proposed adjustments – section 89F(2)(a) 129. The Commissioner must consider in respect of each proposed adjustment: (a) the income amount or impact of the adjustment, and (b) the tax year or period to which the proposed adjustment relates, and (c) whether use of money interest will apply. 130. The Commissioner will also consider whether shortfall penalties and/or other appropriate penalties of lesser percentages apply. That is, where sufficient evidence is held to support the imposition of the penalties and this can be justified (by reference to any relevant guidelines.) Shortfall penalties 131. Shortfall penalties are separate items of adjustment that must be explained and supported in the same manner as the underlying tax shortfall. Section 94A(2) also requires that shortfall penalties must be assessed the same way as the underlying tax. However, although assessments of shortfall penalties relate to 25 the underlying tax they are not subject to the time bars that arise under section 108 or 108A. 132. Where there is sufficient evidence to suggest that shortfall penalties should be imposed, the relevant Inland Revenue officer must ensure that the shortfall penalties are proposed in the same NOPA as the substantive issues. However, the officer can dispense with this practice if any of the following exceptions apply: (a) the evidence supporting the imposition of shortfall penalties does not become available until after the Commissioner has issued the NOPA on the substantive issues. In such circumstances, a separate NOPA may be issued in respect of the shortfall penalties at a later stage. (b) before entering into the disputes process, a taxpayer has accepted the proposed adjustment in relation to the substantive issues, but not accepted the imposition of the shortfall penalties. In this circumstance, the Commissioner may still issue a NOPA to the taxpayer for the proposed penalties. (c) the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure of the substantive issues to the Commissioner and the only disputed issue relates to the imposition of the shortfall penalties. (d) prosecution action is being considered and shortfall penalties also apply because the taxpayer has committed one of the culpable acts (for example, evasion), in most instances the Commissioner must first complete any prosecution action against the taxpayer before the shortfall penalties can be imposed. Pursuant to section 149(5), if shortfall penalties have been imposed the Commissioner cannot subsequently prosecute the taxpayer for taking the incorrect tax position unless the shortfall penalties are imposed under section 141ED. Therefore, the Commissioner may omit proposing shortfall penalties in a NOPA if prosecution is being considered as an option. The Commissioner must issue a new NOPA in respect of any shortfall penalties that are to be imposed after the prosecution. 133. Furthermore, the Commissioner cannot propose shortfall penalties at the SOP phase if they were not previously proposed in the Commissioner’s NOPA. State the facts and law − section 89F(2)(b) Facts 134. To provide a concise statement of facts, the Commissioner must focus on the material factual matters relevant to the legal issues. This includes, for each proposed adjustment, the facts relevant to proving all arguments made in support of the adjustment including any facts that are inconsistent with any arguments that the taxpayer has previously raised. 26 135. The Commissioner should endeavour to state all the material facts in brief, so as to avoid irrelevant detail or repetition. For example, where the parties both know the background to the disputed issues, a summary of the facts in the NOPA will suffice. Where possible, the Commissioner will refer to and/or append any documents that have previously set out the facts on which the Commissioner relies. 136. Although the Commissioner will make every attempt to be concise in the NOPA, the Commissioner considers that the explanation of the material facts should be relative to the complexity of the issues. Law 137. Under section 89F(2)(b) the Commissioner must state the law concisely by including an outline of the relevant legislative provisions and principles derived from leading cases that affect the proposed adjustment. 138. It is sufficient that the Commissioner explains the nature of the legal arguments without providing lengthy quotations from the relevant case law. How the law applies to the facts − section 89F(2)(c) 139. The Commissioner must apply the legal arguments to the facts to ensure that the proposed adjustment is not a statement that appears out of context. The application of the law to the facts must be stated concisely and logically support the proposed adjustment. 140. The Commissioner must outline all relevant materials and arguments (including alternative arguments) on which the Commissioner intends to rely. If more than one argument supports the same or a similar outcome, the NOPA must include all the arguments. 141. The evidence exclusion rule under section 138G(1) does not apply to the issues, facts, evidence and propositions of law that are raised in the Commissioner’s NOPA. That is, the Commissioner is not restricted to raising the same issues, facts, evidence and propositions of law that are specified in the NOPA at the SOP phase or in challenge proceedings that the taxpayer has commenced where a disclosure notice has not been issued. Size and length of Commissioner’s NOPAs General guidelines 142. The length of a Commissioner’s NOPA will necessarily vary from case to case. The maximum length of a Commissioner’s NOPA is administratively capped at 30 pages. The 30-page limit excludes any discussion on shortfall penalties (if included in the same Commissioner’s NOPA as the substantive issues), the last page of instructions on “What to do next”, and schedules that show complicated 27 calculations and diagrams. The application of the 30-page limit is subject to the following further restrictions: (a) For disputes involving less than $5,000 of tax (excluding evasion and tax avoidance issues), the Commissioner’s NOPA should not exceed five pages. (b) Where the dispute concerns one issue only (for example, the imposition of shortfall penalties), the Commissioner’s NOPA should not exceed ten pages. 143. A longer Commissioner’s NOPA may be appropriate, where the dispute concerns multiple issues or the issue is very complex and involves a substantial amount of tax. 144. The Commissioner will strive to keep NOPAs as short as possible, but this will be balanced with the need to achieve the objective of issuing the NOPA, (ie sufficiently communicating to the recipient the proposed adjustments and the reasons for them). Inland Revenue officers are required to get approval before a Commissioner’s NOPA can exceed the 30-page limit. 145. Wherever practicable, all adjustments proposed for a particular taxpayer should be included in one NOPA. However, where new issues arise during the disputes process, the Commissioner is not precluded from commencing separate disputes for these new issues. If the parties are still in dispute after the conference phase, the proposed adjustments in multiple NOPAs may, subject to the taxpayer’s agreement, be combined into one SOP. Combining multiple issues into one dispute has the benefit of reducing compliance costs and should reduce the time taken in the disputes process. TIMEFRAMES TO COMPLETE THE DISPUTES PROCESS 146. If the Commissioner has commenced the disputes process by issuing a NOPA to a taxpayer and the dispute remains unresolved, where practicable, the Commissioner must negotiate a timeframe with the taxpayer to ensure that the dispute is progressed in a timely and efficient way. 147. Although not statutorily required, agreeing to a timeframe is a critical administrative requirement that requires both parties to be ready to progress the dispute in a timely manner. The parties should endeavour to meet the agreed timeframe. Where there are delays in the progress of the dispute the responsible officer will manage the delay including any relationship with internal advisers and liaise with the taxpayer. 148. If the negotiated timeframe cannot be achieved, the Commissioner must enter into a continuing discussion with the taxpayer to either arrange a new timeframe or otherwise keep them advised of when the disclosure notice and SOP will be issued. This is consistent with the purpose of the disputes process which is to promote the prompt and efficient resolution of disputes. Therefore, the failure to 28 negotiate or adhere to an agreed timeframe will not prevent a case from progressing through the disputes process in a timely manner. 149. In addition to the above administrative practice, the Commissioner is bound by section 89N(2). Under that provision, if a NOPA has been issued and the parties cannot agree on the proposed adjustment, the Commissioner cannot amend an assessment without completing the disputes process unless any of the exceptions in section 89N(1)(c) apply. These exceptions are explained in paragraphs 150 to 191 of this SPS. If any of these exceptions apply the disputes process will end and the dispute will not go through the adjudication phase. Section 89N − exceptions − when an assessment can be issued without completing the disputes process 150. If a NOPA has been issued and the dispute is unresolved, the Commissioner can issue an assessment without completing the disputes process under the following circumstances: Exception 1: In the course of the dispute, the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has had the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process (section 89N(1)(c)(i)). 151. Section 89N(1)(c)(i) reads: (i) the Commissioner notifies the disputant that, in the Commissioner’s opinion, the disputant in the course of the dispute has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has had an effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process: 152. The exception applies where the Commissioner may need to act quickly to issue an assessment because the Commissioner considers that the taxpayer has committed an offence under an Inland Revenue Act that has caused undue delay to the progress of the dispute. 153. For example, in the course of a dispute a taxpayer obstructed Inland Revenue officers in obtaining information from the taxpayer’s business premise under section 16. The Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that the Commissioner considers that they have committed an offence under section 143H. The offence has the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process meaning that the Commissioner does not have to complete that process and can amend the taxpayer’s assessment under section 113. 154. Another example of when the exception may apply is where, in the course of a dispute, a taxpayer wilfully refuses to attend an enquiry made under section 19 on the date specified in the Commissioner’s notice. In these circumstances, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer in writing that the Commissioner considers that they have committed an offence under section 143F that has had the effect of delaying the completion of the disputes process. The Commissioner can then exercise the discretion to amend the taxpayer’s assessment under section 113 without completing the disputes process. 29 155. In order to apply this exception, Inland Revenue officers must form an opinion that is honestly and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the evidence available. The Inland Revenue officer’s decision must be clearly documented and stipulate the grounds and reasoning on which it is based. Exception 2: A taxpayer involved in a dispute, or person associated to them, may take steps to shift, relocate or dispose of the taxpayer’s assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax, making the issue of an assessment urgent (section 89N(1)(c)(ii) and (iii)). 156. If the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the taxpayer or a person associated with them (“associated person”) intends to dispose of assets in order to avoid or defer the payment of an outstanding or pending tax liability, the Commissioner can urgently issue an assessment to the taxpayer. Section 89N(1)(c)(ii) & (iii) reads: (ii) The Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that the disputant may take steps in relation to the existence or location of the disputant’s assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax from the disputant: (iii) The Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that a person who is an associated person of the disputant may take steps in relation to the existence or location of the disputant’s assets to avoid or delay the collection of tax from the disputant: 157. In order to issue an assessment on the basis of either of the above exceptions, Inland Revenue officers must record any relevant correspondence and evidence (for example, the directors’ written instructions to shift the company’s assets overseas, evidence of electronic wiring of funds to overseas countries, transcripts of interviews with the taxpayer, etc) or other grounds for the reasonable belief. Exception 3: The taxpayer involved in a dispute or a person associated with them involved in another dispute involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v)). 158. Section 89N(1)(c)(iv) and (v) reads: (iv) The disputant has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the dispute: (v) a person who is an associated person of the disputant and is involved in another dispute with the Commissioner involving similar issues has begun judicial review proceedings in relation to the other dispute: 159. These exceptions apply to any judicial review proceedings that are brought against the Commissioner. In judicial review proceedings, the parties’ resources are likely to be directed away from advancing the dispute through the disputes process. 160. For the purpose of section 89N(1)(c)(v), an associated person of a taxpayer may be involved in a similar issue to the taxpayer even if the issue relates to a different revenue type. In other circumstances, the revenue type may be the same. For example, if the dispute between the Commissioner and taxpayer 30 relates to PAYE issues, but the dispute between the Commissioner and person associated with the taxpayer relates to income tax the taxpayer may still be involved in similar issues to the person associated with them. 161. Even if the two disputes relate to the same revenue type, section 89N(1)(c)(v) will not apply in some circumstances. For example, the dispute with the taxpayer relates to the tax treatment of entertainment expenditure, whereas the dispute with the person associated with the taxpayer relates to the capital and revenue distinction of merger expenditure. The Commissioner would not regard these two disputes as involving similar issues. Exception 4: The taxpayer fails to comply with a statutory requirement for information relating to the dispute (section 89N(1)(c)(vi)). 162. Section 89N(1)(c)(vi) reads: (vi) During the disputes process, the disputant receives from the Commissioner a requirement under a statute for information relating to the dispute and fails to comply with the requirement within a period that is specified in the requirement: 163. Generally, a taxpayer provides information to Inland Revenue voluntarily. However, when this does not occur the Commissioner can seek information from the taxpayer under a statutory provision, for example section 17 or 19. (The Commissioner’s practice regarding section 17 is currently set out in SPS 05/08: Section 17 Notices.) The requirement for statutory information will specify the period within which the information must be provided. This period will allow the taxpayer reasonable and sufficient time to comply. 164. Where the taxpayer does not comply with a formal requirement for information that relates to the dispute (for example, as a tactic to delay the progress of the disputes process), the Commissioner can issue an assessment to the taxpayer without first completing the disputes process. Exception 5: The taxpayer elects to have the dispute heard by the TRA acting in its small claims jurisdiction (section 89N(1)(c)(vii)). 165. Section 89N(1)(c)(vii) reads: (vii) the disputant elects under section 89E to have the dispute heard by a Taxation Review Authority acting in its small claims jurisdiction: 166. A taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner under section 89D or 89DA or a NOR rejecting the Commissioner’s NOPA under section 89B (See SPS 08/02: Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer and any replacement SPS). 167. At the same time, under section 89E(1)(a) the taxpayer can elect in their NOPA or NOR that the TRA acting in its small claims jurisdiction should hear any unresolved dispute arising from the NOPA (whether issued by the Commissioner or taxpayer), if the amount in dispute is $30,000 or less. Any such election is 31 irrevocable, final and binding on the taxpayer. In this case, the full disputes process does not have to be followed. Exception 6: The parties agree in writing that the dispute should be resolved by the court or TRA without completing the disputes process (section 89N(1)(c)(viii)). 168. Section 89N(1)(c)(viii) reads: (viii) the disputant and the Commissioner agree in writing that they have reached a position in which the dispute would be resolved more efficiently by being submitted to the court or Taxation Review Authority without completion of the disputes process: 169. Under this exception, where the Commissioner or taxpayer commences the disputes process, the parties can make such an agreement in writing before either party issues their SOP. This would occur, for example, if the parties could incur excessive compliance and administrative costs in completing the full disputes process relative to the amount in dispute. 170. This exception allows the taxpayer to bring challenge proceedings against the Commissioner. The parties must have exchanged a NOPA and NOR before the taxpayer can bring challenge proceedings under section 138B(1). 171. The circumstances under which the Commissioner will enter into such an agreement are discussed in detail from paragraph 259 to 285. This SPS refers to this exception as opting out of the disputes process or “opt out”. Exception 7: The parties agree in writing to suspend the disputes process pending the outcome of a test case (section 89N(1)(c)(ix)). 172. Section 89N(1)(c)(ix) reads: (ix) the disputant and the Commissioner agree in writing to suspend proceedings in the dispute pending a decision in a test case referred to in section 89O. 173. Section 89O(2) allows a dispute to be suspended pending the result of a test case. Pursuant to section 89O(3), the parties can agree in writing to suspend the dispute from the date of the agreement until the earliest date that: (a) the court’s decision is made, or (b) the test case is otherwise resolved, or (c) the dispute is otherwise resolved. 174. If the parties agree to suspend the disputes process, any statutory time bar affecting the dispute is stayed. The Commissioner can then make an assessment that is consistent with the test case decision. (However, the taxpayer is not precluded from challenging the Commissioner’s assessment under section 89D(1), even if it is consistent with the test case decision.) 32 175. The Commissioner must issue an amended assessment or perform an action within the time limit specified in section 89O(5). 176. Section 89O(5) reads: The Commissioner must make an amended assessment, or perform an action, that is the subject of a suspended dispute by the later of the following: (a) the day that is 60 days after the last day of the suspension: (b) the last day of the period that – (i) begins on the day following the day by which the Commissioner, in the absence of the suspension, would be required under the Inland Revenue Acts to make the amended assessment, or perform the action; and (ii) contains the same number of days as does the period of the suspension. 177. If the statutory time bar arising under section 108 or 108A is imminent, section 89O(5) allows the Commissioner more time to complete the disputes process. 178. For example, the Commissioner commences a dispute and on 1 March 2010 agrees with the taxpayer in writing to suspend the disputes proceedings pending the decision in a designated test case. The disputed issue is subject to a statutory time bar that commences after 31 March 2010 and the taxpayer does not agree to delay its application under section 108B(1)(a). A decision is reached in the test case on 31 July 2010. 179. The Commissioner must make an amended assessment or perform an action that is the subject of the suspended dispute by 29 September 2010. This date is calculated as follows: (a) The suspension period commences on the date of the agreement (1 March 2010) and ends on the date of the court’s decision in the test case (31 July 2010). This is a period of 153 days. (b) The last date that the Commissioner can make an amended assessment falls on the later of the following two dates: (i) 29 September 2010, that is 60 days after the date that the suspension period ends on 31 July 2010 pursuant to section 89O(5)(a), and (ii) 31 August 2010, that is 153 days after the period commences on 1 April 2010 pursuant to section 89O(5)(b). Exception 8: The Commissioner applies to the High Court for an order to allow more time to complete or dispense with the disputes process. 180. Section 89N(3) reads: 33 ... \[T\]he Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an order that allows more time for the completion of the disputes process, or for an order that completion of the disputes process is not required. 181. The Commissioner envisages that this exception will be used if section 89N(1)(c) does not apply and there are exceptional circumstances. 182. Any application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3) must be based on reasonable grounds. Whether there are reasonable grounds will depend on considerations such as the complexity of the issues in the dispute, whether the taxpayer has caused delays, the dispute involves large amounts of revenue or there were significant matters in the dispute that were unforeseen by either party and provided a justification for the delay. 183. For example, due to unusual circumstances the Commissioner does not learn about a proposed adjustment until late. Further delays by the taxpayer and the need for the Commissioner to obtain significant legal advice means that the Adjudication Unit cannot consider the dispute before the time bar starts. In this circumstance, the Commissioner may apply to the High Court for an order that allows more time for the disputes process to be completed under section 89N(3). (Note: This is only an example of a possible unforeseen situation and it is anticipated that there will be a wide variety of circumstances under which an application under section 89N(3) will be appropriate.) 184. The Commissioner’s application to the High Court under section 89N(3) is subject to statutory time limits. The Commissioner must apply before the four- year statutory time bar falls due. 185. The Commissioner must also issue an amended assessment within the time limit specified in section 89N(5). Section 89N(5) reads: If the Commissioner makes an application under subsection (3), the Commissioner must make an amended assessment by the last day of the period that - (a) begins on the day following the day by which the Commissioner, in the absence of the suspension, would be required under the Inland Revenue Acts to make the amended assessment; and (b) contains the total of - (i) the number of days between the date on which the Commissioner files the application in the High Court and the earliest date on which the application is decided by the High Court or the application or dispute is resolved: (ii) the number of days allowed by an order of a court as a result of the application. 186. Section 89N(5) allows the Commissioner more time to complete the disputes process where the statutory time bar under section 108 or 108A is imminent. 187. For example, the Commissioner commences the disputes process. On 1 March 2010 the Commissioner applies to the High Court under section 89N(3) for an 34 order allowing more time to complete the process. The disputed issue is subject to a statutory time bar that commences after 31 March 2010 and the taxpayer does not agree to delay its application under section 108B(1)(a). On 30 June 2010, the High Court makes an order that allows the Commissioner’s application and gives the Commissioner 30 further days to complete the disputes process. 188. Pursuant to section 89N(5), the Commissioner must make an amended assessment by 30 August 2010. This date is calculated as follows: (a) The Commissioner would have one month to make the amended assessment before the statutory time bar commences. That is, 1 March 2010 to 31 March 2010. The period during which an amended assessment must be made under section 89N(5)(a) commences on 1 April 2010. (b) The period during which the assessment must be made includes 122 days, that is the period between 1 March 2010 and 30 June 2010 (the date of the decision) under section 89N(5)(b)(i) and the 30-day period allowed by the High Court order under section 89N(5)(b)(ii). This is a total of 152 days. (c) The Commissioner must issue an amended assessment to the taxpayer on the date that is 152 days from 1 April 2010. That is, by 30 August 2010. 189. During the period from 1 March to 30 August 2010, the parties may continue to attempt to resolve the dispute. This may include exchanging SOPs and going through the adjudication process. 190. The above example indicates that the Commissioner has more time to complete the disputes process. The time bar will not commence until 30 August 2010. 191. Where the Commissioner applies to the High Court under section 89N(3) for an order to truncate the disputes process, the Commissioner must issue an assessment within the period as calculated under section 89N(5). Applying the same facts as in the above example, the Commissioner must issue an assessment to the taxpayer by 30 August 2010. Application of the exceptions in section 89N(1)(c) 192. The Commissioner’s practice is that the parties must endeavour to resolve the dispute before or via the adjudication process. If this is not possible and any of the exceptions in section 89N(1)(c) apply the Commissioner can amend an assessment without completing the whole disputes process, that is, before the parties accept a NOPA, NOR or SOP that the other has issued, or the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer’s SOP. This will conclude the disputes process and the dispute will not go through the Adjudication phase. 193. In this circumstance, the taxpayer can challenge the Commissioner’s assessment by filing proceedings in the TRA (either acting in its general or small claims jurisdiction) or the High Court within the applicable response period, that is, within two months starting on the date that the notice of assessment is issued (See paragraph 170 of this SPS). 35 TAXPAYER’S RESPONSE TO THE COMMISSIONER’S NOPA: NOR 194. If a taxpayer disagrees with the Commissioner’s proposed adjustment, then, under section 89G(1), they must advise the Commissioner that any or all of the proposed adjustments are rejected by issuing a NOR within the two-month response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner’s NOPA is issued. The Commissioner interprets this as requiring Inland Revenue’s receipt of the NOR within the response period. 195. For example, if a NOPA is issued on 9 April 2010, the taxpayer must advise the Commissioner that it is rejected by issuing a NOR to the Commissioner for receipt on or before 8 June 2010. However, taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOR to the Commissioner once they have completed it. 196. The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period expires to ascertain whether the taxpayer will issue a NOR in response to the Commissioner’s NOPA. Such contact may be made by telephone or letter. 197. Section 89G(2) specifies the content requirements of a NOR. The taxpayer must state concisely in the NOR: (a) the facts or legal arguments in the Commissioner’s NOPA that they consider are wrong, and (b) why they consider that those facts and arguments are wrong, and (c) any facts and legal arguments that they rely upon, and (d) how the legal arguments apply to the facts, and (e) the quantitative adjustments to any figure proposed in the Commissioner’s NOPA that results from the facts and legal arguments that the taxpayer relies upon. 198. In respect of the requirement under section 89G(2)(c) that the taxpayer specifies the facts and legal arguments upon which they are relying, the taxpayer can also refer to legislative provisions, case law and any legal arguments that are raised in the Commissioner’s NOPA. The taxpayer does not have to refer to different legislative provisions, case law and legal arguments. 199. Pursuant to section 89G(2)(e), the requirement for a quantitative adjustment establishes to what extent the taxpayer considers that the Commissioner’s adjustment in the NOPA is incorrect. This amount need not be exact, however, every attempt should be made to ensure that it is as accurate as possible. The amount in dispute can be altered, as the dispute progresses irrespective of whether the parties have agreed on the new figure. 36 DEEMED ACCEPTANCE 200. Under section 89H(1), if the taxpayer: (a) has not issued a NOR within the two-month response period, and (b) there are no exceptional circumstances as defined in section 89K(3), the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the adjustment that is proposed in the Commissioner’s NOPA and section 89I applies. The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer that the deemed acceptance has occurred within two weeks after the two-month response period expires. 201. Pursuant to section 89I(2), the Commissioner must include or take into account each proposed adjustment that the taxpayer accepts or is deemed to accept in a notice of assessment issued to the taxpayer. Exceptional circumstances under section 89K 202. Section 89K(3) reads: (a) an exceptional circumstance arises if— (i) an event or circumstance beyond the control of a disputant provides the disputant with a reasonable justification for not rejecting a proposed adjustment, or for not issuing a notice of proposed adjustment or statement of position, within the response period for the notice: (ii) a disputant is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period: (b) an act or omission of an agent of a disputant is not an exceptional circumstance unless— (i) it was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent that could not have been anticipated, and its effect could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or (ii) the agent is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period. 203. The legislation defines exceptional circumstances very narrowly. The cases regarding “exceptional circumstances,” such as Treasury Technology Holdings Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,752, Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005, Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 17,470 (CA), Hollis v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,570 and Balich v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,230 are also relevant. 37 204. The case law confirms that the definition of “exceptional circumstances” in sections 89K(3) and 138D should be applied consistently. The following guidelines have emerged from the case law: (a) a taxpayer’s misunderstanding or erroneous calculation of the applicable response period will usually not be regarded as an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control under section 89K(3)(a), (b) an agent’s failure to advise their client that they have received a notice of assessment or other relevant document that causes the taxpayer to respond outside the applicable response period will not generally be considered to be an exceptional circumstance under section 89K(3)(b) (Hollis v CIR), and (c) an exceptional circumstance can arise if the taxpayer has relied on misleading information regarding the applicable response period given to them by the Commissioner that has caused them to respond outside that response period (Hollis v CIR). 205. The Commissioner will only accept a late NOR on rare occasions. See Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 3 (August 1996) for some examples of situations that can be an “exceptional circumstance” beyond a taxpayer’s control. 206. The exception for lateness as a result of statutory holidays is self explanatory. The Commissioner can also accept a late NOR if the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, that is, the document was only one to two days late and the other factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion under section 89K(1) are satisfied. (See discussion in paragraph 208). 207. For example, the response period ends on Saturday and the taxpayer provides a NOR on the following Tuesday. The Commissioner treats the response period as ending on Monday on the basis of section 35(6) of the Interpretation Act 1999 and accepts that the lateness of the NOR was minimal. That is, the Commissioner has received the NOR within one to two days of Monday, the last day of the response period. If the response period ended on Friday and the taxpayer provided the NOR on the following Monday, the Commissioner would also accept that the lateness is minimal. 208. Besides the degree of lateness, the Commissioner considers that the exercise of the discretion under section 89K(1) requires that the following factors are also taken into account: (a) the date on which the NOR was issued, and (b) the response period within which the NOR should be issued, and (c) the real event, circumstance or reason why the taxpayer failed to issue the NOR within the response period, and 38 (d) the taxpayer’s compliance history in relation to the tax types under consideration (for example, has the taxpayer paid tax or filed a tax return or NOR late in the past?) 209. For example, a taxpayer issues a NOR to the Commissioner two days after the applicable “response period” has expired. The taxpayer does not provide a legitimate reason for the lateness. The taxpayer also has a history of filing late NORs within the minimal allowable lateness period (that is, up to two days outside the applicable “response period”) and has been advised on the calculation of the “response period” on more than one occasion. 210. Although the degree of lateness was minimal on each occasion, the Commissioner would not accept the taxpayer’s NOR in this circumstance. This ensures that the section 89K(3)(b)(ii) exception is not treated as an extension of the “response period” in all circumstances. 211. The Commissioner will consider a taxpayer’s application made under section 89K(1)(b) after receiving the relevant NOR or SOP. The responsible officer will document the reasons for accepting or rejecting the taxpayer’s application and advise the taxpayer of their decision in writing within 15 working days after Inland Revenue receives the application. 212. The taxpayer must provide reasons to support their claim that exceptional circumstances exist under section 89K(3). The taxpayer should address the factors referred to in paragraph 208. If the reasons provided are unclear, the Commissioner may require further information and give the taxpayer an opportunity to provide that information before determining whether section 89K applies. 213. If the Commissioner rejects a taxpayer’s application made under section 89K to treat a NOR or SOP as made within the response period, the taxpayer will be deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustment made in the Commissioner’s NOPA. (Any decision that the Commissioner makes under section 89K is not a “disputable decision”.) Receipt of a taxpayer’s notice of response 214. When Inland Revenue receives a taxpayer’s NOR, it will usually be forwarded to the responsible officer within five working days after its receipt. Upon receipt, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following: (a) the date on which the NOR was issued, and (b) whether the NOR has been issued within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner’s NOPA is issued, and (c) the salient features of the NOR including any deficiencies in its content. 39 215. Where it is practicable, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their tax agent by telephone or in writing within 10 working days that Inland Revenue has received the NOR. 216. The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to advise the taxpayer or their tax agent within one month after receiving the NOR whether the NOR is being considered or has been accepted, rejected in full or in part. 217. If the NOR is accepted in full, the Commissioner will usually issue to the taxpayer written confirmation that the NOR has been accepted in full and, if applicable, a notice of assessment within one month after advising that the NOR is accepted. 218. If the Commissioner must investigate further before deciding to accept or reject a NOR, the responsible officer will regularly update the taxpayer or their agent on the progress of the further analysis or enquiry work that is undertaken. Deficiencies in the content of the notice of response 219. Where Inland Revenue has received a NOR that it considers has deficiencies (that is, the requirements under section 89G(2) may not be met), the responsible Inland Revenue officer will take reasonable steps to have the taxpayer correct the information in the NOR before the response period expires. 220. The taxpayer will be advised as soon as practicable that the Commissioner considers that the NOR may not meet the requirements of section 89G(2) and why. They will also be advised that any additional or corrected information should be provided within the response period. 221. Taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOR immediately after they have completed it because they could have insufficient time to rectify any deficiencies if the response period is due to expire. 222. Generally where the deficiencies are not able to be remedied and it is possible to treat the NOR as sufficient, or if the NOR advances sufficient argument to allow the dispute to develop and progress, then the Commissioner will continue with the dispute. The argument that the NOR is deficient will be incorporated into the Commissioner’s SOP and the Commissioner will also fully argue the substantive issue. 223. However, if the NOR received is highly unsatisfactory the Commissioner will not continue with the dispute. This will be on the grounds that the NOR does not satisfy the requirements set out in section 89G(2). 224. A NOR is likely to be considered highly unsatisfactory only where the taxpayer's position is materially inconsistent and not capable of coherent explanation, or there is no observable explanation at all of the taxpayer's grounds for dispute. In these situations the taxpayer will be deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustment under section 89H(1), unless any of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K applies. 40 225. In considering the adequacy of the taxpayer’s NOR, the Commissioner will not base his view on the strength or weakness of the taxpayer’s argument. The Commissioner will only be concerned with whether the NOR meets its statutory requirements. 226. The approach outlined above is consistent with that taken by the Court of Appeal in CIR v Alam and Begum (2009) 24 NZTC 23,564. CONFERENCE PHASE What is the conference phase of the disputes process? 227. The conference phase of the disputes process allows the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute to exchange material information relating to the dispute (if this has not already been done prior to the conference phase). More importantly it is an opportunity for the parties to the dispute to try to resolve the differences in their understanding of facts, laws and legal arguments. 228. The word “resolve” in this context is not limited to final resolution of the dispute. Settlement is a possibility but this is not the only objective of the conference phase. The parties may “resolve” part of the dispute by agreeing on some of the facts and clarifying some of the legal arguments, while agreeing to disagree on other matters, which will become the focus in the later phases of the disputes process. 229. Generally, if a dispute remains unresolved after the NOR phase, the conference phase will follow. However, the Commissioner will have fully considered the taxpayer’s NOR including any new records, documents and information mentioned in that document before determining that the dispute remains unresolved. 230. The conference phase is an administrative process that aims to clarify and, if possible, resolve the dispute. However, the conference phase should not be used by either party for the purpose of delaying the completion of the disputes process. Legal and other advisers attending a conference 231. If a dispute is not settled earlier, the parties can obtain expert legal or other advice during the conference phase in addition to advice previously obtained. These advisers can attend any meetings in relation to the dispute. Conference facilitation 232. Conference facilitation is a new feature in the conference phase. A facilitated conference will involve an independent internal facilitator who will promote and encourage structured discussion between Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer on an informed basis and with the bona fide intention of resolving the 41 dispute. The conference facilitator will be a senior Inland Revenue officer who will not have been involved in the dispute prior to the conference phase. The facilitator will have sufficient technical knowledge to understand and lead the conference meeting. 233. The conference facilitator will not be responsible for making any decision in relation to the dispute, except for determining when the conference phase has come to an end. In particular, it is not the role of the facilitator to undertake settlement of the dispute. If this possibility arises it is the responsibility of the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute. 234. Having a conference facilitated is optional and a conference can be held without a facilitator but, conference facilitation will be offered to all taxpayers as part of the disputes process. The Commissioner’s offer to taxpayers of a facilitated conference will be made in writing (“the conference facilitation letter”) within one month from the date of issue of the taxpayer’s NOR. The conference facilitation letter marks the commencement of the conference phase. 235. The format of the conference meeting need not be limited to a face-to-face meeting. The parties to the dispute may agree to hold a telephone or video conference. (For reasons of simplicity, the SPS refers to “meetings” to include these different conference formats.) 236. The taxpayer is expected to respond within two weeks from the date of the conference facilitation letter. The taxpayer should indicate whether they will attend the conference meeting, whether they will accept the conference facilitation offer, whether there are any special needs or requirements at the meeting and who else will be attending the meeting. If the taxpayer does not respond within this timeframe, the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute will contact the taxpayer about the conference facilitation letter. Preparation for the conference meeting 237. When a taxpayer agrees to attend a conference meeting, Inland Revenue will contact the taxpayer within two weeks from the taxpayer’s agreement, will establish a timeframe, and agree on how the meeting will be conducted. 238. Prior to the conference meeting, the taxpayer should inform Inland Revenue whether their advisors will attend the conference meeting. 239. The parties to the dispute may agree to exchange information relevant to the dispute before the conference is held. A copy of that information will be provided to the facilitator where the taxpayer has accepted the conference facilitation offer. The Inland Revenue officers will provide the taxpayer a list of information that has been given to the facilitator. The taxpayer may request a copy of any information on that list if it is not already in their possession. It is also crucial for the parties to exchange the information prior to the meeting if the agreed format of the conference is a telephone or video conference. 42 240. Inland Revenue may decide not to pursue the dispute further after considering the taxpayer’s information. The whole disputes process (including the conference phase) would come to an end in these cases. 241. The conference phase will generally be expected to be completed within three months, but this will vary depending on the facts and complexities of the specific case. A longer conference phase may be justified in some disputes if the parties are engaged in meaningful discussions. 242. An agenda will be useful for both parties at the conference meeting. An agreed agenda should divide the conference meeting into two parts. The first part of the meeting should involve an exchange of material information and discussion of contentious facts and issues relating to the dispute. Any procedural matters such as the timeframe for completing the disputes process, the adjudication process, time bar waivers and the possibility of opting out of the disputes process will also be discussed. The second part of the meeting, if applicable, would involve negotiation of possible areas of resolution of the dispute. Any communication made and any materials prepared for the purpose of negotiating a settlement or resolution during this part of the meeting will be treated as being on a “without prejudice” basis. 243. Where there is no agenda the conference facilitator will, where there is a facilitated conference, guide the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to discuss the contentious facts and issues at the conference meeting. 244. Where the option of conference facilitation has been declined, the parties to the dispute should work out the appropriate structure at the conference meeting, bearing in mind that one of the aims of any conference is to reach agreement on some or all the facts and issues and thus, resolve the dispute. At the conference meeting Facilitated Conference 245. The facilitator will: (a) Explain the objectives of the conference phase on the basis of the agreed agenda. (b) Remind the parties of any rules relating to the conference (these will generally have been set out in the conference facilitation letter). (c) Clarify who the parties are at the conference meeting and the capacities they hold (e.g. whether they are the authorised tax advisors; whether they have authority to settle the dispute at the meeting, etc.) (d) Ask whether the parties agree to record the meeting discussions using audio or video technology. (Refer to SPS INV 330 Tape-Recording Inland Revenue Interviews or any replacement SPS). Interviews 43 (e) Run through the agenda. (f) Encourage the parties to present evidence in support of their perceived facts (either at the conference meeting or on a later date if the evidence cannot be provided at the time of the meeting). Where possible, encourage the parties to reach agreement on all the facts of the dispute. If no agreement can be made, encourage the parties to establish the common grounds and address the matters that they agree to disagree. These agreements will be recorded in writing. The agreements will be sent to the taxpayer to verify the correctness and sign by a specified date. (g) Promote constructive discussion of only the contentious tax issues and where possible, encourage both parties to explore the issues, resolve or settle the dispute (subject to our internal revenue delegations and guidelines on settlement). If the contentious tax issues cannot be resolved, ask both parties to do one or more of the following: • At the end of the conference meeting, ask the parties to consider whether the conference phase comes to an end. Consider whether there is need for another meeting, noting that another meeting can be justified if both parties need to exchange further information in support of their tax technical arguments but continuous meetings are discouraged if this is seen as a delaying tactic. • Where the parties agree to end the conference phase and the facilitator considers that the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved, the facilitator can clearly signal the end of the conference phase to the parties. • Agree on the timeframe for completing the disputes process and submitting the dispute to the adjudication process. This includes the timeframe for taxpayers to meet outstanding information requests and Inland Revenue officers’ undertaking to provide copies of information relevant to the disputes. The agreed timeframe will also factor in time bar waivers if given by the taxpayer and the time required for any court challenge that relates to documents, which are claimed to be protected by professional legal privilege and tax advice documents, which are claimed to be protected by the non-disclosure rights. Ask the taxpayer whether a time bar waiver will be given if the time bar applicable to the assessment in dispute is imminent. • Clearly indicate whether the communication made and/or documents prepared for the purpose of negotiating potential settlement or resolution of the dispute will be treated as being on a “without prejudice” basis. • Ask the taxpayer to consider whether the opt-out process applies and advise the taxpayer of the right to opt-out within the required timeframe, so that it is not necessary to complete the disputes 44 process as required under section 89N and that the dispute will be more efficiently resolved by a hearing authority. (h) Note that any agreement between the parties will be recorded in writing and signed either at the conference meeting by both parties or on a later date after the taxpayer has verified the correctness of the agreement. (i) Note that the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute will remain as the first point of contact. Unfacilitated conference 246. In an unfacilitated conference, the parties at the conference should agree on and perform tasks similar to those listed in paragraphs 245(a) to (h) above. 247. At the end of the conference meeting, it is important for the Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer to discuss whether they consider that the conference phase has come to an end and record any agreement in writing. After the conference meeting 248. The following is relevant only if the conference phase does not end at the meeting. Facilitated conference 249. Where a conference facilitator is involved, the facilitator will: (a) follow up on the agreed matters including the agreed timeframe and exchange of information (but does not include enforcing the agreement between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute); (b) assess any need to attend a further meeting; (c) suggest to the parties that the conference phase has ended and ask them to reach an agreement on this matter, then clearly notify the parties of the date on which the conference phase has ended. Unfacilitated conference 250. In a conference that did not have a facilitator, the Inland Revenue officers will perform these tasks. They may suggest to the taxpayer that the conference phase has ended after all the material information relating to the dispute has been exchanged and all the contentious facts and issues have been discussed. The parties will then agree in writing on the date on which the conference phase has ended. If the parties cannot agree on when to end the conference phase, the Investigations Manager will be responsible for making the decision on ending the conference phase after considering all the parties’ relevant reasons and concerns. 45 End of the conference phase 251. It is important for the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to be fully aware of when the conference phase comes to an end. The conference phase is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting. In most cases, it is expected that the parties involved in the dispute will agree on when the conference phase has ended. Such agreement will be put in writing. Facilitated conference 252. Where conference facilitation is involved, the facilitator will be responsible for clarifying the agreed end date of the conference phase with the parties. 253. If the facilitator considers that both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers have exchanged all the material information relevant to the dispute, have fully discussed the tax technical issues and have not resolved the dispute, the facilitator may suggest to the parties that the conference phase can come to its end. 254. If there is no agreement and the parties’ reasons for continuing the conference phase are considered to be insufficient, the conference facilitator can make a decision to end the conference phase and notify the parties of that decision. The following are examples of strong indicators that the conference phase has come to its end: (a) The taxpayer and/or the tax advisors stop contacting the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute for a few weeks; (b) The parties did not exchange information notwithstanding that this had been agreed on at the conference meeting, thus leading to the exercise of the Commissioner’s powers (eg section 17 notices); (c) The parties agree to disagree with each other and express interest in progressing to the SOP phase; (d) The taxpayer appears to be using delaying tactics at the conference phase when the issue in dispute is subject to an imminent time bar. 255. In rare situations, where conference facilitation is involved and the facilitator is concerned with the parties’ decision to end the conference phase before achieving the objectives of the conference meeting, the facilitator may adjourn the meeting and discuss the concerns with the responsible Inland Revenue officers. The facilitator may also contact the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s tax advisors to discuss whether the conference phase should come to its end. The facilitator will seek the parties’ agreement as to whether or not the conference phase is complete. 46 Unfacilitated conference 256. Where no conference facilitation is involved, the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers will work out when to end the conference phase. They must consider whether the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved before reaching the agreement. If no agreement can be reached, the Investigations Manager will review the conduct of the parties during the conference phase and make a decision on whether the conference phase has come to an end. After the conference phase 257. When a dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase has been completed, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice together with a SOP unless the Commissioner and the taxpayer have agreed to the taxpayer opting out of the disputes process. The disclosure notice and Commissioner’s SOP will be generally issued within three months from the end of the conference phase (see paragraphs 305 to 314 for further discussion on the timeframes for issue of the Commissioner’s disclosure notice and SOP). 258. If the taxpayer wants to request the Commissioner’s agreement to opt out of the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), they will be required to sign a declaration that all material information relating to the dispute has been provided to the Commissioner. OPT OUT OF THE DISPUTES PROCESS 259. Section 89N(1)(c)(viii) provides that the Commissioner and a taxpayer can agree in writing not to complete the disputes process if the Commissioner is satisfied that the dispute can be more efficiently resolved at a hearing authority (referred to as “opt-out”). 260. A taxpayer may request to opt out of the remainder of the disputes process. If they do, the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute will consider whether the Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer’s request to opt out. 261. Before the Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer’s request to opt out the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase. In addition, the taxpayer must have signed a declaration that all material information has been provided to the Commissioner. 262. This means that the Commissioner will not agree to opting out unless there has been a conference. 263. In addition to attending the conference, the Commissioner considers that a taxpayer will have participated meaningfully during the conference phase where: (a) The taxpayer has provided information as requested by Inland Revenue (if it has not already been provided prior to the conference phase); and 47 (b) The taxpayer has discussed the contentious facts and issues of the dispute with Inland Revenue. This discussion will have involved identifying and clarifying what the dispute turns on, seeking potential resolution of the dispute or reaching agreements to enable the dispute to move forward to the next phase if it remains unresolved. 264. If the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase and signed a declaration that all material information has been provided the Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer’s request to opt out of the disputes process in circumstances where one of the following applies: (a) the total amount of tax in dispute is $75,000 or less except where the dispute is part of a wider dispute; (b) the dispute turns on issues of fact (eg facts that are to be determined by reference to expert opinions or valuation) only; (c) the dispute concerns facts and issues that are waiting to be resolved by a court; or (d) the dispute concerns facts and issues that are similar to those considered by the Adjudication Unit of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel (“OCTC”) if similar issues have been considered in a dispute in the past. 265. Where the dispute does not fall within the criteria listed above, the Commissioner may still agree to opt out of the disputes process if it is considered that the dispute can be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority. 266. The taxpayer may request to opt out of the disputes process within two weeks from the end of the conference phase. Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer in writing as to whether it agrees to the request to opt out within two weeks from the date of the taxpayer’s request. 267. Where the opt-out request has been agreed to and the dispute remains unresolved after taking into account the information and discussion during the conference phase, the Commissioner will issue an amended assessment. 268. When it is considered that the taxpayer does not meet the criteria for opting out of the disputes process, the taxpayer will be advised of the decision in writing. (a) The $75,000 or less threshold 269. The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer opting-out of the disputes process if the total amount of core tax in dispute is $75,000 or less. This is subject to the requirement that the taxpayer must have participated meaningfully during the conference phase. The “$75,000 or less” threshold does not apply if the dispute is part of a wider dispute that involves a number of taxpayers. An example of this is a tax avoidance arrangement similar to the “Trinity forestry scheme” in Accent Management Ltd v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,323; \[2007\] NZCA 230. 48 270. The “$75,000 or less” threshold excludes: o shortfall penalties, either proposed in the same NOPA as the core tax or proposed in a separate NOPA; o use of money interest that results from the Commissioner’s proposed adjustment in the NOPA; and o late payment penalties imposed on the taxpayer, if applicable. 271. The following paragraphs illustrate how the threshold will apply. 272. In some disputes, the Commissioner may propose adjustments in respect of more than one tax type or more than one return period/income year. The “$75,000 or less” threshold applies to the net total amount of tax in the same dispute. The threshold will take into account the following: o the proposed adjustments made by the Commissioner in the same NOPA for all return periods and/or income years and tax types; o any variation of the amount of tax in dispute due to the Commissioner’s partial acceptance of the taxpayer’s NOR; and o any variation of the net total amount of tax in dispute as agreed between the participants during the conference phase. (b) The dispute turns on issues of fact only 273. The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer’s request to opt out if the dispute turns on issues of fact or evidence only. 274. The “issues of fact” requirement may apply where the disputed facts are to be determined by reference to expert opinions or valuation. 275. Disputes on tax avoidance issues will not meet the “issues of fact” requirement. In these disputes, case law requires consideration of issues such as whether the arrangement has used a specific provision in a way that cannot have been within the contemplation and purpose of Parliament when it enacted the provision. This will involve analysing mixed questions of law and fact. (c) The dispute concerns facts and issues that are waiting to be resolved by a court 276. The opt-out process is available if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those that are waiting to be resolved by a court. The Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer’s request to opt out in these cases. 277. A taxpayer may become aware of a current court case that concerns facts and issues that they consider to be similar to their dispute. The Commissioner will consider this position when deciding whether to accept the taxpayer’s opt-out 49 request. In considering a taxpayer’s request, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer of its views as to the similarity, but will not comment on the merit of the current court case or the plaintiff’s tax affairs due to the secrecy provisions of the TAA. 278. In some cases, a taxpayer may not be aware at the time of issuing the NOR or during the conference phase of the existence of similar cases that are subject to court proceedings. The taxpayer may still request to opt out of the disputes process without this knowledge. In considering the request, the Inland Revenue officers will consult with the Litigation Management Unit to determine whether there are any current court cases that concern facts and issues that are considered to be similar to the taxpayer’s dispute. (d) The dispute concerns facts and issues that are similar to those considered by the Adjudication Unit 279. The opt-out process is available if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those already considered by the Adjudication Unit. A taxpayer may request to opt out of the disputes process because a previous adjudication decision was in favour of the Commissioner and they consider it would be unlikely that the Commissioner’s view will change. In considering the taxpayer’s request, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer of its views as to the similarity, but will need to bear in mind the secrecy provisions of the TAA. 280. In some cases, a taxpayer may not be aware of similar disputes that have been considered by the Adjudication Unit when the taxpayer issues the NOR or participates at a conference meeting. The taxpayer may still request to opt out of the disputes process without this knowledge. In considering the request, the Inland Revenue officers will consult with the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel to determine whether the Adjudication Unit has considered any similar disputes. 281. Inland Revenue officers may be aware of such other similar disputes, and may choose to advise the taxpayer that, should the taxpayer request an opt-out, Inland Revenue would be very likely to agree. Grounds of assessment where the Commissioner has agreed to opt-out 282. In agreeing to the taxpayer’s request for opt-out the Commissioner will issue an amended assessment and a notice of assessment to the taxpayer. In doing so the Commissioner will have taken into account the information and legal arguments raised in the NOPA, the NOR and during the conference phase. The taxpayer can then challenge the assessment by commencing proceedings in a hearing authority within the applicable response period, ie two months of receipt of the notice of assessment. 283. As the evidence exclusion rule in section 138G does not apply, the Commissioner is not bound by the facts, evidence and propositions of law stated in the NOPA and NOR. The Commissioner is able to take into account the information and arguments raised during the conference phase. 50 284. In most opt-out cases, the Commissioner’s administrative practice is that even though the evidence exclusion rule does not apply, grounds of assessment which have not previously been referred to in the Commissioner’s NOPA and the taxpayers’ NOR will not be relied on if they have not been notified or sufficiently discussed during the conference phase. 285. For that purpose, the Commissioner will send to the taxpayer in these circumstances at or near the time of issuing the assessment, a letter confirming briefly the grounds of assessment. PROGRESSING DISPUTES THROUGH THE DISPUTES PROCESS WHERE THE DISPUTE AFFECTS MULTIPLE TAXPAYERS 286. Sometimes it is necessary for Inland Revenue to deal with a large number of taxpayers that are all affected by the same disputed matter. This can arise in situations where: • the taxpayers are all investors in a particular scheme; • the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same promoter; • the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same tax agent; • there exists a widespread but well-defined common problem involving many unrelated taxpayers (eg taxpayers moving their private residence into an LAQC, or a number of taxpayers claiming non-deductible expenses such as fines for overloading). 287. Given Inland Revenue’s limited resources, and bearing in mind taxpayer compliance costs it may not be appropriate for all the cases to proceed through the full disputes process. 288. The Commissioner’s approach to the different situations which arise where a large number of taxpayers are all affected by the same disputed matter is outlined in the following paragraphs. Situation one: The Adjudication Unit has looked at an issue a number of times and consistently taken a view supporting the Commissioner. 289. As discussed in detail previously at paragraphs 259 to 281, the Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer’s request to opt out of the remaining parts of the disputes process if the facts and issues relating to the dispute are similar to those previously considered by the Adjudication Unit. 290. Therefore, in situations where the Adjudication Unit has looked at an issue a number of times and consistently taken a view supporting the Commissioner agreement between the parties to opt-out is an option available to avoid the full disputes process. 51 291. In these circumstances the Commissioner will indicate to individual taxpayers that the dispute could be suitable for opt out but as this approach to a dispute requires the taxpayer to request opt out, they still have the choice to progress the dispute through the full disputes process. 292. It should be noted that before the Commissioner will agree to a taxpayer’s request to opt out the Commissioner must be satisfied that the taxpayer has participated meaningfully during the conference phase. In addition, the taxpayer must have signed a declaration that all material information has been provided to the Commissioner. Situation two: There are a number of cases on the same issue under dispute. One case has been referred to the Adjudication Unit, who has still to reach a conclusion on the matter. 293. In this situation it may be possible for other affected taxpayers and the Commissioner to merely agree, subject to statutory time bar issues, to place their case "on hold" while the Adjudication Unit undertakes its analysis. 294. However, care will need to be taken to ensure that the time bar will not be breached, and consideration should be given to obtaining a time bar waiver. 295. Again, as this approach requires the taxpayer to agree, the Commissioner can offer it to individual taxpayers but they still have the choice to progress the dispute through the full disputes process. Situation three: The Adjudication Unit has previously looked at an issue and taken a view supporting the taxpayer. 296. It is the Commissioner’s policy that a finding for the taxpayer in the initial dispute will usually lead to the other disputes being withdrawn, particularly if the disputes are in respect of the same transaction. 297. However, in some situations further consideration of the issue is required at a national level before the Commissioner will apply the conclusions reached in a particular adjudication report more broadly to other taxpayers. In those cases, Inland Revenue officers may be advised that a specified or contrary approach (to that adopted by the Adjudication Unit) is to be followed pending further consideration of the issue at a national level. DISCLOSURE NOTICE 298. The Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1), unless the Commissioner: (a) does not have to complete the disputes process because any of the exceptions under section 89N(1)(c) applies (see earlier discussion), or 52 (b) does not have to complete the disputes process because the High Court has made an order that the dispute resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3), or (c) has already issued to the taxpayer a notice of disputable decision that includes or takes account of the adjustment proposed in the NOPA pursuant to section 89M(2). 299. When issuing a disclosure notice the Commissioner must also provide to the taxpayer the Commissioner’s SOP (as discussed below) and include in the disclosure notice a reference to section 138G and a statement regarding the effect of the evidence exclusion rule pursuant to section 89M(3). 300. The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer two weeks before issuing the disclosure notice and SOP that these documents will be issued to them. 301. Where practicable, the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer shortly after the disclosure notice and SOP are issued to ascertain whether the taxpayer has received these documents. 302. If the taxpayer has not received the Commissioner’s disclosure notice, for example, due to a postal error or an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control, the Commissioner will issue another disclosure notice to the taxpayer. In this circumstance, the response period within which the taxpayer must respond with their SOP will commence from the date that the Commissioner issued the initial disclosure notice. 303. Where the taxpayer cannot issue a SOP within the applicable response period, they may issue a late SOP with an explanation of why it is late. The Commissioner will consider the late SOP in terms of the discretion under section 89K(1). (See paragraphs 202 to 204 for further discussion). Evidence exclusion rule 304. A disclosure notice is the document that triggers the application of the evidence exclusion rule. The Commissioner must explain the effect of the evidence exclusion rule and refer to section 138G in the disclosure notice (See paragraph 327 for further discussion). Issue of a disclosure notice 305. The Commissioner can issue a disclosure notice at any time on or after the date that either party issues their NOPA. 306. Usually, the Commissioner will issue a disclosure notice after receiving a NOR, following the conference phase and in accordance with the timeframe agreed with the taxpayer. 53 307. Where a disclosure notice is issued earlier (for example, the facts are clear, the taxpayer has agreed on the disputed issues or a conference is not required) the reasons must be documented and explained to the taxpayer. 308. When deciding whether to issue a disclosure notice before the conference phase has been completed, Inland Revenue officers must be aware that, if the taxpayer discloses any new or novel matters in their SOP, they only have two months to reply under section 89M(8) barring a High Court application before the two- month period expires. (See section 89M(10)). 309. Where a dispute commenced by the Commissioner remains unresolved after the conference phase, an Inland Revenue officer will usually issue a disclosure notice together with a SOP: • within three months from the end of the conference phase; or • within three months from the date when the Commissioner advises that the taxpayer’s opt-out request has been declined. subject to any further time allowed by an appropriate senior manager (see paragraphs 312 to 314.) 310. The three-month timeframe will exclude any statutory holidays. 311. If the last day of the three-month timeframe falls on a weekend, Inland Revenue must issue the disclosure notice and the SOP by the next working day. 312. While the Commissioner is able to extend the three-month timeframe these extensions should be very rare, because in most disputes, the timeframe is considered to be sufficient for Inland Revenue officers to complete and issue to the taxpayer a disclosure notice and the Commissioner’s SOP. 313. The ability for Inland Revenue to extend the three-month timeframe is provided for because it is recognised that even with good planning and the best endeavours of the Inland Revenue officers involved, there might be occasions on which the disclosure notice and the Commissioner’s SOP cannot be issued within the three- month timeframe. This might occur when: (a) the facts, issues, and law are complex, and/or (b) the case involves an important issue of precedent and/or the Litigation Management Unit or external advisors are involved in advising on the Commissioner’s SOP. 314. If it is considered that an extension of the timeframe is needed: o Approval will first be obtained from an appropriate senior Manager. o The taxpayer will then be advised of the estimated date for issue of the Commissioner’s SOP. Where the estimated date cannot be met, Inland 54 Revenue will use its best endeavours to keep the taxpayer informed of the progress made in the completion of the Commissioner’s SOP. STATEMENT OF POSITION 315. Pursuant to section 89M(3), when the Commissioner commences the disputes process, the Commissioner must issue a SOP to the taxpayer together with the disclosure notice. 316. When the disputed issue relates to a tax type that is subject to the statutory time bar (for example, income tax, GST, etc) that falls within the current income year, the parties will endeavour to complete the disputes process before the time bar starts. The parties can agree to a statutory time bar waiver if they have issued a SOP to each other and there is insufficient time to complete the adjudication process. 317. However, if no such agreement is reached, section 89N(2)(b) allows the Commissioner to advance to the next stage if the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer’s SOP and completed the compulsory elements of the disputes process. The Commissioner can amend the assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113. 318. Whether the Commissioner has adequately considered a SOP will depend on what is a reasonable length of time and level of analysis for that SOP given the circumstances of the case (for example, the length of the SOP and the complexity of the legal issues). 319. Thus a simple dispute could only take a couple of days to consider adequately while a complex dispute could take a few weeks. If the statutory time bar is imminent the Inland Revenue officer will consider the taxpayer’s SOP urgently. Contents of a SOP 320. Generally, the contents of a SOP are binding. This is because matters that proceed to court are subject to the “evidence exclusion rule” which limits the parties to the facts, evidence (excluding oral evidence), issues and propositions of law that either party discloses in their SOP unless a court order is made under section 138G(2) allowing new facts and evidence to be raised. 321. However, a mistaken description of facts, evidence, issues or propositions of law and submissions made in the SOP can later be amended if the parties agree to include additional information in the SOPs under section 89M(13). 322. Under section 89M(4) the SOP must be in the prescribed form (IR 773 Statement of position). The SOP must contain sufficient detail to fairly inform the taxpayer of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that the Commissioner wishes to rely on. 323. The minimum content requirements for a SOP under section 89M(4) are an outline of the relevant facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law. However, 55 to allow the Adjudication Unit to successfully reach a decision, the SOP must also contain full, complete and detailed submissions. 324. An outline that consists of a frank and complete discussion of the issues, law, arguments and evidence supporting the argument is implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes process. (In very complex cases a full explanation of the relevant evidence and summary of less relevant evidence will be accepted.) 325. The disputes process does not require that relevant documents are discovered or full briefs of evidence or exhaustive lists of documents exchanged. Rather, providing an outline of relevant evidence in the SOP will ensure that both parties appreciate the availability of evidence in respect of the factual issues in dispute. The Commissioner should ensure that an outline of any expert evidence on which they intend to rely is included in the SOP. 326. Submissions made in the NOPA phase must be sufficiently concise to enable the parties to progress the dispute without incurring substantial expense. However, at the SOP phase, if the issues are unresolved and likely to proceed to a court for resolution, then full, complete and detailed submissions should be made. 327. Subject to section 138G(2), the evidence exclusion rule prevents the court considering arguments and evidence that are not included in: (a) the SOP, or (b) any additional information that: (i) the Commissioner provides under section 89M(8), that is deemed to be part of the Commissioner’s SOP under subsection (9), and (ii) the parties provide pursuant to an agreement under section 89M(13), that is deemed to be part of the provider’s SOP under subsection (14). 328. Section 89M(6B) reads: In subsections 4(b) and 6(b), evidence refers to the available documentary evidence on which the person intends to rely, but does not include a list of potential witnesses, whether or not identified by name. 329. Pursuant to section 89M(6B), only documentary evidence and not potential witnesses must be listed in the SOP. Any witnesses’ identities will continue to be protected without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule. 330. If the SOP discusses shortfall penalties it must also state any other appropriate penalties of lesser percentages and shortfall penalty reductions (for example, voluntary disclosure or previous behaviour reductions) as alternative arguments. This ensures that the appropriate penalties are assessed in all cases. However, the Commissioner cannot propose shortfall penalties at the SOP phase that have not previously been proposed in the Commissioner’s NOPA. 56 Receipt of a taxpayer’s SOP in response 331. Where the Commissioner has issued a disclosure notice and SOP, the taxpayer must, subject to section 89M(11), issue a SOP within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the disclosure notice was issued. 332. Therefore, the Commissioner cannot consider a document that the taxpayer purports to issue as a SOP before the Commissioner has issued the disclosure notice because it will not have been issued within the response period. The taxpayer should resubmit this document after the disclosure notice is issued. 333. Pursuant to section 89M(11), the taxpayer can apply to the High Court within the response period for more time to reply to the Commissioner’s SOP. The taxpayer must show that they had not previously discussed the disputed issue with the Commissioner and, thus, it is unreasonable to reply to the Commissioner’s SOP within the response period. 334. The Commissioner will make a reasonable effort to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period expires to determine whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP in response to the disclosure notice. Such contact can be made by telephone or in writing. 335. The taxpayer’s SOP will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue receives it. Upon receipt, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following: (a) the date on which the SOP was issued, and (b) whether the SOP has been issued within the relevant response period, and (c) the SOP’s salient features including any deficiencies in its content. 336. Where it is practicable, Inland Revenue will acknowledge the taxpayer’s SOP as received within 10 working days after receiving it. However, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their agent of any deficiencies in the SOP’s content as soon as practicable. 337. A taxpayer who has issued a SOP outside the applicable response period can apply for consideration of exceptional circumstances under section 89K. The reasons for accepting or rejecting the application must be documented and the responsible officer will make reasonable efforts to advise the taxpayer of the decision in writing within 15 working days after Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer’s application. 338. A taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the Commissioner’s SOP if they do not reply to it with their own SOP within two months after the date that the disclosure notice is issued and none of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K apply. Where practicable, the Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer that deemed acceptance has occurred within two weeks after the date that the response period for the disclosure notice expires. 57 The Commissioner’s response 339. Pursuant to section 89M(8), the Commissioner can, within two months after the taxpayer’s SOP is issued, provide to the taxpayer additional information in response to matters that they have raised in their SOP. 340. The Commissioner can only provide additional information in response to new or novel information or arguments that the taxpayer has raised in their SOP or agreed to add to their SOP under section 89M(13). The Commissioner cannot add further information simply because it was omitted from the Commissioner’s SOP (for example, information that was received under a section 17 notice after the SOP was issued). 341. The additional information must be provided as far as possible in the same format as the SOP to which it relates (that is, in accordance with section 89M(4)). As mentioned above, the additional information can include documentary evidence but not lists of potential witnesses. 342. If the Commissioner intends to provide additional information to the taxpayer under section 89M(8), the Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of this within two weeks after the taxpayer’s SOP is received. However, the timing of this advice can vary depending on the facts and complexity of the dispute. The additional information provided under section 89M(8) is deemed to be part of the Commissioner’s SOP. Thus, the evidence exclusion rule under section 138G applies to the additional information. 343. The taxpayer cannot reply to the additional information that the Commissioner provides, unless the parties agree that additional information will be accepted under section 89M(13). AGREEMENT TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 344. Either party can agree to include additional information in their SOP under section 89M(13) at any time during the disputes process including after the dispute has been referred to the Adjudication Unit. Although there is no statutory time limit, the Commissioner’s practice is to allow one month (from the date that the Commissioner provides additional information under section 89M(8)) for such an agreement to be reached and information provided. 345. However, before agreeing to a request made by the taxpayer under section 89M(13) the Commissioner will consider the taxpayer’s prior conduct and whether they could have provided the information earlier through the application of due diligence. 346. The Commissioner will usually also consider the materiality and relevance of the additional information and its capacity to help resolve the dispute and may decide to take it into account in coming to an assessment. In this circumstance, both parties will be expected to cooperate in resolving the relevance and 58 accuracy of any such material. The Commissioner may wish to apply resources to verification and comment and this will be considered by the adjudicator. 347. If a taxpayer’s request to include additional information in their SOP is declined, the reasons must be documented with detailed reference to the taxpayer’s conduct, level of cooperation before the request was made and why the information was not provided earlier. The responsible officer will also advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of the reasons why their request was declined. 348. Any agreement to add further information to the SOP will be made subject to the taxpayer agreeing that the Commissioner can include a response to the additional information to the SOPs, if required, within an agreed time frame. 349. Any additional information that the parties provide under section 89M(13) will be deemed to form part of the provider’s SOP under section 89M(14). Thus, the evidence exclusion rule under section 138G applies to the additional information. PREPARATION FOR ADJUDICATION 350. The Adjudication Unit is part of Inland Revenue’s Office of the Chief Tax Counsel and represents the final step of the disputes process. The adjudicator’s role is to review unresolved disputes by taking a fresh look at a tax dispute and the application of law to the facts in an impartial and independent manner and provide a comprehensive and technically accurate decision that will ensure the correctness of the assessment. 351. Generally, the adjudicator will make such a decision within three months after the case is referred to the Adjudication Unit. However, this will depend on the number of disputes that are before the Adjudication Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. (For further information on the time frame for adjudication of disputes see the article titled “Adjudication Unit – Its role in the dispute resolution process” that was published in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 19, No 10 (November 2007).) 352. The adjudication process is an administrative (rather than a legislative) one. Judicial comments have been made in C of IR v Zentrum Holdings Limited and Another, Ch’elle Properties (NZ) Limited v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 and ANZ National Bank Ltd and others v C of IR (No. 2) (2006) 22 NZTC 19,835 indicating that, as a matter of law, it is not strictly necessary for Inland Revenue officers to send all disputes to the Adjudication Unit for review and Inland Revenue officers are not necessarily bound by the Adjudication Unit’s decisions. 353. Notwithstanding the above judicial comments, if the parties have not agreed on all the issues at the end of the conference and disclosure phases or to opting out under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), it is the Commissioner’s policy and practice that all disputes are to be sent to the Adjudication Unit for review, irrespective of the complexity or type of issues or amount of tax involved unless any of the following exceptions arise: 59 (a) the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer’s SOP for the purposes of section 89N(2)(b) and referred the dispute to the Adjudication Unit for their preliminary consideration and the Adjudication Unit has determined that it has insufficient time to reach a decision in respect of the dispute before a statutory time bar would prevent an assessment from being increased (see paragraphs 317 to 319 for further discussion), or (b) any of the legislative exceptions specified in section 89N(1)(c) apply (see paragraphs 150 to 193 for further discussion) so that the Commissioner can amend an assessment without first completing the disputes process, or (c) the High Court has made an order that the disputes process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3) (see paragraphs 180 to 191 for further discussion). 354. The decision not to refer the case to adjudication must be made by an Inland Revenue officer with a senior level of authority in Service Delivery (for example, at the time of writing this SPS the delegation was with Assurance Manager level or above). In respect of the first exception mentioned in paragraph 353(a) it is necessary that the parties have exchanged a SOP and it is a matter solely for the Adjudication Unit to determine whether it has insufficient time to fully consider the dispute. 355. If the dispute is to be referred to the Adjudication Unit, the Commissioner should not issue an assessment or amended assessment before the adjudication process is completed unless a time bar is imminent. In this circumstance, the responsible officer will prepare a cover sheet that will record all the documents that must be sent to the Adjudication Unit. 356. The cover sheet together with copies of the documents (NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, conference notes, both parties’ SOP, additional information, material evidence including expert opinions and a schedule of all evidence held) and any recordings of discussions held during the conference must be sent to the Adjudication Unit. 357. If the dispute is to be referred to adjudication, the responsible officer will issue a letter together with a copy of the cover sheet to the taxpayer before sending the submissions, notes and evidence to the Adjudication Unit. The cover sheet and letter are usually completed within one month after the date that the Commissioner’s reply to the taxpayer’s SOP (if any) is issued or the response period for the taxpayer’s SOP expires. 358. The purpose of this letter is to seek concurrence on the materials to be sent to the adjudicator − primarily concerning documentary evidence that has been disclosed at the SOP phase. This letter will allow no more than 10 working days for a response. 359. Once the taxpayer has concurred on the materials to be sent to the Adjudication Unit, those materials will be so forwarded. However, if no response is received 60 from the taxpayer the materials will be forwarded after the 10 working days allowed for the taxpayer’s response have elapsed. The adjudicator may also contact the parties after the initial materials have been received to obtain further information. 360. Where an investigation has covered a number of issues, the cover sheet will outline any issues that the parties have agreed upon and any issues that are still disputed. The adjudicator will only consider the disputed issues and not those issues that have been agreed upon. 361. Generally, the adjudicator only considers the materials that the parties have submitted. They do not usually seek out or consider further information, unless it is relevant. The adjudicator may consider such additional information notwithstanding that the parties have not agreed that the provider can include this information in their SOP under section 89M(13). 362. However, any additional material that the parties have not disclosed in their SOP (or agreed to include in their SOP under section 89M(13)) cannot later be raised as evidence in court because the evidence exclusion rule in section 138G(1) will apply (as discussed in paragraphs 327 to 329). ADJUDICATION DECISION 363. Once a conclusion is reached, the Adjudication Unit will advise the taxpayer and responsible officer of the decision. The responsible officer will implement any of the Adjudication Unit’s decisions and follow up procedures where required including issuing a notice of assessment to the taxpayer where applicable. 364. Where the Adjudication Unit makes a decision against the Commissioner, the Commissioner is bound by and cannot challenge that decision. The dispute will come to an end. 365. Where the Adjudication Unit makes a decision against the taxpayer, they can challenge the assessment (whether made by the Commissioner or taxpayer) or disputable decision if they are within the applicable response period. 366. If the Commissioner has commenced the disputes process, the taxpayer, if disagreeing with the adjudicator’s decision and any later notice of assessment or amended assessment that is issued, can file proceedings in the general jurisdiction of the TRA or the High Court if any of the following conditions under section 138B(1) are met: (a) the assessment includes an adjustment that the Commissioner has proposed and the taxpayer has rejected within the response period, or (b) the assessment is an amended assessment that imposes a fresh or increases an existing liability. 61 367. A taxpayer can also challenge an assessment that the Commissioner issues before the dispute goes through the adjudication process (for example, when an exception under section 89N(1)(c) applies). 368. The taxpayer must file proceedings with the TRA or High Court within the two- month response period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the notice of assessment or amended assessment. 369. If applicable, the responsible officer will implement any decision made by the hearing authority and follow up procedures where required including issuing a notice of assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer.

1 Standard Practice Statement ED 0127 Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer This item also appears in Tax Information Bulletin xxxx \[yet to be determined\] Introduction 1. This Standard Practice Statement (“SPS”) discusses a taxpayer’s rights and responsibilities in respect of an assessment or other disputable decision when the taxpayer commences the disputes resolution process. 2. Where the Commissioner commences the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner’s practice is stated in SPS xx/xx: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. \[See ED 0126 under consultation\] 3. The Commissioner regards this SPS as a reference guide for taxpayers and Inland Revenue officers. Where possible, Inland Revenue officers must follow the practices outlined in this SPS. 4. The disputes resolution process is designed to ensure that there is a full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process. 5. The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an “all cards on the table” approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts and legal arguments are canvassed before a case proceeds to a court or hearing authority. 6. In accordance with the objectives of the disputes resolution process, the Commissioner (unless a statutory exception applies under section 89C or 89N(1)(c)) must go through the disputes resolution process before the Commissioner can issue an assessment. Application 7. This SPS applies to a dispute commenced on or after \[date to be determined following completion of consultation\]. 8. It replaces SPS 08/02 Disputes resolution process commenced by a taxpayer. 2 Background 9. The tax dispute resolution procedures were introduced in accordance with the recommendations of the Richardson Committee in the Report of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department (April 1994) and were designed to reduce the number of disputes by: (a) promoting full disclosure, and (b) encouraging the prompt and efficient resolution of tax disputes, and (c) promoting the early identification of issues, and (d) improving the accuracy of decisions. 10. The disputes resolution process ensures that there is full and frank communication between the parties in a structured way within strict time limits for the legislated phases of the process. 11. The disputes resolution process is designed to encourage an “all cards on the table” approach and the resolution of issues without the need for litigation. It aims to ensure that all the relevant evidence, facts, and legal arguments are canvassed before a case goes to court. 12. The early resolution of a dispute is intended to be achieved through a series of steps specified in the TAA. The main elements of those steps are the issue of: (a) A notice of proposed adjustment (“NOPA”): this is a notice that either the Commissioner or taxpayer issues to the other advising that an adjustment is sought in relation to the taxpayer’s assessment, the Commissioner’s assessment or other disputable decision (the requisite form is the IR 770 Notice of proposed adjustment). A NOPA is the formal document which begins the disputes process. (b) A notice of response (“NOR”): this must be issued by the recipient of a NOPA if they disagree with it (the preferred form is the IR 771 Notice of response). (c) A notice rejecting the Commissioner’s NOR: this must be issued by the taxpayer if they disagree with the Commissioner’s NOR (there is no prescribed form for a notice rejecting the Commissioner’s NOR). (d) A disclosure notice and statement of position (“SOP”): the issue of a disclosure notice by the Commissioner triggers requirement for the taxpayer to provide a SOP to continue the dispute. Each SOP must provide an outline of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law with sufficient details to support the positions taken. Each party must 3 issue a SOP (the requisite form is the IR 773 Statement of position). The SOPs are important documents because they limit the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that either party can rely on if the case proceeds to court to what is included in the SOPs (unless a hearing authority makes an order that allows a party to raise new facts or evidence under section 138G(2)). 13. There are also two administrative phases in the process – the conference and adjudication phases. If the dispute has not been already resolved after the NOR phase, the Commissioner’s practice will be to hold a conference, unless the parties agree to abridge the conference phase. A conference can be a formal or informal discussion between the parties to clarify and, if possible, resolve the issues. 14. If the dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase and the exchange of SOPs, the Commissioner will usually refer the dispute to adjudication, except in limited circumstances. Adjudication involves Inland Revenue independently considering a dispute and is the final phase in the process before the taxpayer’s assessment is amended (if it is to be amended) following the exchange of the SOPs. 15. Timely progression of disputes through the disputes process may require the use of the Commissioner’s information gathering powers (particularly section 17) before and/or during the disputes process. 16. Inland Revenue has a quality assurance review process known as Core Task Assurance (“CTA”) which is designed to ensure that key pieces of work (including NORs and SOPs) are subject to an independent review by Legal & Technical Services (“LTS") before being issued. Given the importance of the disputes process to the Commissioner and to taxpayers, Inland Revenue officers are required to get CTA approval of disputes documents prior to issue. Glossary 17.

Set out below is a summary of the key actions and administrative time frames where a disputes process is commenced by a taxpayer. 20. These key actions and time frames are intended to be administrative guide lines for Inland Revenue officers. Any failure to meet these administrative time frames will not invalidate subsequent actions of the Commissioner or prevent the case from going through the disputes process. Paragraph in the SPS Key actions Indicative time frames The taxpayer’s NOPA 36, 41, 58, 70 and 74 A taxpayer’s response period for issuing a NOPA in respect of an assessment or other disputable decision Within four months from the date that the assessment or other disputable decision is issued. 106 The Commissioner forwards and assigns the taxpayer’s NOPA to the responsible officer. Usually within five working days after the taxpayer’s NOPA is received. 108 The Commissioner acknowledges the receipt of the taxpayer’s NOPA (either by telephone or in writing). Usually within 10 working days after the taxpayer’s NOPA is received. 109 The Commissioner advises that the taxpayer’s NOPA is deficient, but the applicable response period has not expired. Immediately after the Inland Revenue officer becomes aware of the deficiency. 111 The Commissioner advises the taxpayer in writing that their NOPA is deficient and they have not rectified the deficient within the applicable response period. Usually within 15 working days after the date that the response period for issuing a taxpayer’s NOPA expires. 126 The Commissioner considers the application of “exceptional circumstances” under section 89K, where a taxpayer’s NOPA has been issued outside the applicable response period. Usually within 15 working days after receiving the taxpayer’s application. The Commissioner’s NOR 133 The Commissioner advises the taxpayer (either by telephone or in writing) whether the Commissioner intends to issue a NOR. Usually within 10 working days before the response period for the taxpayer to issue a NOPA expires. 133 The Commissioner has issued and the taxpayer has received a NOR. Within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer’s NOPA is issued. The taxpayer’s written rejection 8 of the Commissioner’s NOR 152 The Commissioner confirms whether the taxpayer will reject the Commissioner’s NOR. Usually two weeks before the response period for the Commissioner’s NOR expires. 149 The taxpayer rejects the Commissioner’s NOR in writing. Within two months after the date that the Commissioner’s NOR is issued. 155 Inland Revenue forwards the taxpayer’s rejection of the Commissioner’s NOR to the responsible officer. Usually within five working days after receiving the taxpayer’s rejection. 155 The Commissioner acknowledges receipt of the taxpayer’s rejection of the Commissioner’s NOR. Usually within 10 working days after receiving the taxpayer’s rejection. 152 The taxpayer is deemed to accept the Commissioner’s NOR, because they have failed to reject it within the applicable response period and none of the “exceptional circumstances” apply. Two months after the response period for the Commissioner’s NOR has expired. Conference phase 158 The Commissioner will write to the taxpayer to initiate the conference phase and to offer a facilitated conference. Conferences usually commence within one month after the Commissioner receives the taxpayer’s rejection of the Commissioner’s NOR. The conference letter marks the start of the conference phase. The suggested average time frame of the conference phase is three months, subject to the facts and complexity of the dispute. Disclosure notice 200 The Commissioner advises the taxpayer that a disclosure notice will be issued. Usually within two weeks before the date that the disclosure notice is issued. The Commissioner issues a disclosure notice to the taxpayer. Usually within one month of the end of the conference phase. Taxpayer’s SOP 212 The taxpayer must issue a SOP within the response period for the disclosure notice. Within two months after the date that the disclosure notice is issued, unless any of the “exceptional circumstances” under section 89K applies. 9 226 The Commissioner confirms whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP. Usually 10 working days before the response period for the disclosure notice expires. 226 The Commissioner forwards the taxpayer’s SOP to the responsible officer. Usually within five working days after the taxpayer’s SOP is received. 228 The Commissioner acknowledges the receipt of the taxpayer’s SOP. Usually within 10 working days after the taxpayer’s SOP is received. 228 The Commissioner advises that the taxpayer’s SOP is deficient, but the two-month response period has not expired. Inland Revenue officers will advise the taxpayer or their agent as soon as they become aware of the deficiency. 228 The Commissioner considers whether “exceptional circumstances” under section 89K apply, where the taxpayer has issued a SOP outside the applicable response period. Usually within 15 working days after the taxpayer’s application is received. 229 The dispute is treated as if it was never commenced, if the taxpayer fails to issue a SOP within the applicable response period and none of the “exceptional circumstances” apply. Usually 10 working days after the response period for the disclosure notice expires. The Commissioner’s SOP 231 The Commissioner issues a SOP in response to the taxpayer’s SOP. Within two months after the date that the taxpayer’s SOP is issued, unless an application has been made to the High Court under section 89M(10). 240 The Commissioner considers a taxpayer’s request to include additional information in the SOP Usually within one month after the date that the Commissioner’s SOP is issued. Adjudication 255 The Commissioner prepares a cover sheet and issues a letter (with a copy of the cover sheet) to the taxpayer to seek concurrence on the materials to be sent to the adjudicator. Usually within one month after the response period for the taxpayer’s SOP expires. 256 The taxpayer responds to the Commissioner’s letter. Within 10 working days after the date that the letter is issued. 257 The Commissioner forwards materials relevant to the dispute to the Adjudication Unit. Usually when the Commissioner receives the taxpayer’s response or within 10 working days after the date that the Commissioner’s letter is issued. 10 247 Adjudication of the disputes case Usually within 3 months after the date that the Adjudication Unit receives the disputes files, depending on the number of disputes that are before the Adjudication Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. 265 The taxpayer can file challenge proceedings Within two months of the adjudication decision. 11 Standard Practice and Analysis TAXPAYER’S ASSESSMENT 21. Section 92(1) reads: A taxpayer who is required to furnish a return of income for a tax year must make an assessment of the taxpayer’s taxable income and income tax liability and, if applicable for the tax year, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due. 22. Section 92(1) applies to tax on income derived in: (a) the 2005−06 and later tax years for a taxpayer whose income year matches the tax year, and (b) the corresponding income year for a taxpayer whose income year is different from the 2005−06 and later tax years. 23. If a taxpayer has to file an income tax return they must make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability and, if applicable, the net loss, terminal tax or refund due. The definition of disputable decision in section 3(1) includes an assessment made by a taxpayer. 24. Similar requirements apply to a taxpayer who must file a GST return under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”). For a GST return period that begins on or after 1 April 2005, the taxpayer must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable. Section 92B(1) reads: A taxpayer who is required under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to provide a GST tax return for a GST return period must make an assessment of the amount of GST payable by the taxpayer for the return period. 25. Pursuant to sections 92(2) and 92B(2) the assessment date for an income tax or GST assessment made by a taxpayer is the date that Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer’s tax return. 26. When the taxpayer’s assessment is received, the Commissioner’s practice is to stamp, either electronically or manually, the tax return with the date of receipt. This date is then entered into Inland Revenue’s computerised database and a return acknowledgment form is sent to the taxpayer or agent. This practice ensures that the taxpayer will have a clear record of when their assessment was made. 27. Under section 92B(3) for a GST assessment and section 92(6) for an income tax assessment, a taxpayer cannot make an assessment of the amount of tax payable for a return period in their tax return if the Commissioner has previously made an assessment of the tax that is payable for that return period. This is commonly known as a “default assessment” and involves the Commissioner making a default determination that estimates the taxpayer’s tax liability (for example, if they have missed a return filing deadline). 12 28. For further discussion regarding how a taxpayer can dispute a default assessment see paragraphs 41 to 53. THE COMMISSIONER’S ASSESSMENT 29. Notwithstanding section 92(1) and subject to the statutory time bar in sections 108 and 108A, the Commissioner can sometimes issue a notice of assessment to a taxpayer. 30. The Commissioner cannot make an assessment without first issuing a NOPA to a taxpayer, unless an exception under section 89C to the requirement for issuing a NOPA applies. 31. The exceptions under section 89C are explained in SPS 08/01: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or any replacement SPS. The Commissioner must ensure that any assessment is made in accordance with section 89C. However, if, on a rare occasion, an assessment was made in breach of section 89C, it will still be regarded as being valid under section 114(a). 32. If the Commissioner issues an assessment without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner under section 89D(1). A TAXPAYER CAN ISSUE A NOPA TO THE COMMISSIONER 33. A taxpayer can issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in the following situations: Situation 1: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner’s assessment 34. Section 89D(1) reads: If the Commissioner– (a) Issues a notice of assessment to a taxpayer; and (b) Has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment, whether or not in breach of section 89C,– the taxpayer may, subject to subsection (2), issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the assessment. 35. When the Commissioner issues to a taxpayer a notice of assessment that does not relate to a “default assessment” (as discussed in paragraph 27) without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of the assessment. A taxpayer’s response to a default assessment is discussed in Situation 2. 36. A taxpayer’s NOPA is not an assessment. It is an initiating action that allows open and full communication between the parties. A NOPA forms a basis for ensuring that the Commissioner does not issue an assessment without some 13 formal and structured dialogue with the taxpayer in respect of the grounds upon which the Commissioner is issuing any assessment or amended assessment (McIlraith v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,456). 37. If the Commissioner has issued an assessment the taxpayer can issue a NOPA under section 89D(1) in respect of any of the considerations that were relevant to making the assessment. This could include preliminary decisions which are necessary to make the assessment, for example, a decision made by the Commissioner under section 89C (MR Forestry (No 1) Trust Ltd v CIR (2006) 22 NZTC 19,954). 38. The taxpayer must issue the NOPA within the applicable “response period” as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the assessment unless the Commissioner accepts a late NOPA under section 89K(1). However, this response period is subject to the exception discussed in Situation 6. 39. For example, if the Commissioner’s notice of assessment is issued on 7 April 2008, under section 89D(1) the taxpayer must issue a NOPA in the prescribed form in respect of the assessment on or before 6 August 2008. 40. The taxpayer’s right to issue a NOPA under section 89D(1) is unaffected, even if, in a very rare circumstance, the Commissioner made the assessment in breach of section 89C. The assessment will be deemed to be valid under section 114(a). Situation 2: NOPA in respect of the Commissioner’s default assessment 41. If a taxpayer has not filed a tax return, the Commissioner can make a default assessment under section 106(1) without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer. 42. Section 89D(2) reads: A taxpayer who has not furnished a return of income for an assessment period may dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner only by furnishing a return of income for the assessment period. 43. A taxpayer that intends to dispute a default assessment through the disputes process must: (a) pursuant to section 89D(2) provide a tax return for the period to which the default assessment relates notwithstanding that the tax return cannot include the taxpayer’s assessment (section 89D(2A)), and (b) issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the default assessment within the applicable response period. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the default assessment. 14 44. Similar rules apply to a NOPA that a taxpayer issues in respect of a GST default assessment. 45. Section 89D(2C) reads: A taxpayer who has not provided a GST tax return for a GST return period may not dispute the assessment made by the Commissioner other than by providing a GST return for the GST return period. 46. Where a taxpayer has not filed a GST return, the Commissioner can make a GST default assessment without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer. 47. If a taxpayer wants to dispute a GST default assessment through the disputes process, they must: (a) provide a GST return for the periods to which the GST default assessment relates pursuant to section 89D(2C), notwithstanding that the tax return cannot include the taxpayer’s assessment (section 89D(2D)), and (b) issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the GST default assessment, within the applicable response period. That is, within four months from the date that the default assessment is issued. 48. The legislative requirement to provide a tax return in respect of a default assessment made by the Commissioner when issuing a NOPA is an additional requirement of the disputes process. This ensures that the taxpayer has provided the requisite statutory information before they dispute the assessment. 49. If the Commissioner agrees with the taxpayer’s NOPA and tax return, the Commissioner will amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113 subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 or 108A and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion. 50. However, if the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer’s tax return and NOPA the Commissioner cannot amend the default assessment. Instead, the Commissioner must issue a NOR to the taxpayer within the relevant response period to continue the disputes process. 51. The taxpayer cannot commence a dispute or challenge proceedings in a hearing authority by simply filing the tax return to which the default assessment relates. The taxpayer must issue a NOPA with their tax return. 52. If a NOPA is not issued, the Commissioner cannot be compelled to amend the default assessment on receipt of the taxpayer’s tax return. However, the Commissioner will amend the assessment under section 113 on the basis of the information provided in the tax return subject to the statutory time bar in section 108 and any other relevant limitations on the exercise of that discretion if this would ensure that the assessment was correct. (See SPS 07/03: Requests to 15 amend assessments for further details.) Any amended assessment will be the Commissioner’s assessment in this circumstance. 53. The Commissioner can decide not to amend the default assessment by exercising the discretion under section 113 on the basis of the tax return provided. Situation 3: NOPA in respect of a deemed assessment made under section 80H 54. Section 89D(2B) reads: A taxpayer to whom section 80F applies who has not furnished an amended income statement for an assessment period may dispute a deemed assessment under section 80H only by furnishing an amended income statement for the assessment period. 55. Section 89D(2B) applies to a taxpayer who derives income solely from salary, wages, interest and dividends and who will receive an income statement from the Commissioner under section 80D(1). 56. Generally, where the taxpayer considers that the income statement is incorrect, they must advise the Commissioner of the reasons and provide the relevant information to correct the income statement under section 80F(1). This must be done within the statutory time limit. That is, the later of: (a) the taxpayer’s terminal tax date for the tax year to which the income statement relates, and (b) two months after the date that the income statement is issued. 57. If the taxpayer does not provide the relevant information within the statutory time limit, they will be treated as having filed a tax return under section 80G(2) and made an assessment under section 80H in respect of that income statement. In this case, the date of the deemed assessment under section 80H will be the date that the statutory time limit under section 80F expires. 58. Pursuant to section 89D(2B), the taxpayer cannot issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of the deemed assessment made under section 80H without first satisfying their statutory obligation to file an amended income statement for the assessment period. 59. If a taxpayer wants to dispute a deemed assessment under section 80H, they must: (a) provide an amended income statement for the assessment period, and (b) issue a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of the assessment within the applicable response period (that is, four months after the date that the deemed assessment is issued.) 16 Situation 4: NOPA in respect of a disputable decision that is not an assessment 60. Under section 89D(3) a taxpayer can issue a NOPA in respect of a disputable decision that is not an assessment. Section 89D(3) reads: If the Commissioner– (a) Issues a notice of disputable decision that is not a notice of assessment; and (b) The notice of disputable decision affects the taxpayer, – the taxpayer, or any other person who has the standing under a tax law to do so on behalf of the taxpayer, may issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of the disputable decision. 61. For the purpose of section 89D(3) a person with standing under a tax law to issue a NOPA on behalf of the taxpayer includes a tax advisor and an approved advisor group. 62. Section 3(1) defines a “disputable decision” to include: (b) A decision of the Commissioner under a tax law, except for a decision – (i) To decline to issue a binding ruling under Part VA; or (ii) That cannot be the subject of an objection under Part VIII; or (iii) That cannot be challenged under Part VIIIA; or (iv) That is left to the Commissioner’s discretion under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8) and (10) and 89N(3): 63. A “decision of the Commissioner under a tax law” generally refers to a tax law that specifically confers a discretion or power on the Commissioner. Paragraph (b)(iii) excludes from the definition of “disputable decision” any decision that cannot be challenged under Part VIIIA. 64. For example, if the Commissioner: (a) does not exercise the discretion under section 113 to amend a taxpayer’s income tax assessment, or (b) makes a decision under section 108A(3) regarding the application of the time bar, or (c) does not agree to a time bar waiver under section 108B, section 138E(1)(e)(iv) (within Part VIIIA) provides that this decision cannot be challenged and, therefore, is not a disputable decision for the purposes of section 89D(3). However, under section 89D(1), the taxpayer can issue a NOPA in respect of the initial assessment within the applicable response period if the Commissioner has not previously issued a NOPA in respect of that assessment. 17 65. A decision made by the Commissioner under section 108(2) (to increase an assessment) is not of itself, and in the absence of an assessment, a disputable decision. Any challenge to the correctness of the decision must be brought in the context of a challenge to the assessment itself (Vinelight Nominees Ltd & Anor v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (No 2) (2005) 22 NZTC 19,519). 66. Paragraph (b)(iv) of the definition of “disputable decision” in section 3(1) also excludes any decision that is left to the Commissioner’s discretion arising under sections 89K, 89L, 89M(8), (10) and 89N(3). 67. For example, the Commissioner does not exercise the discretion under section 89K(1) in respect of a NOPA that a taxpayer has issued outside the applicable response period. This decision not to exercise the discretion in the taxpayer’s favour is not a disputable decision. 68. The exceptions specified in paragraph (b) of the definition of “disputable decision” ensure that only substantive issues are disputed as disputable decisions and the procedural components of the disputes process do not, in themselves, give rise to disputes although they may be amenable to judicial review. 69. The following examples illustrate what is a disputable decision: (a) a taxpayer who is a natural person can dispute the Commissioner’s decision made under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (“ITA 2007”) that they are a New Zealand resident for taxation purposes. (b) under section RD 3(5) of the ITA 2007, the Commissioner can determine whether, and to what extent, a payment is subject to PAYE. This determination cannot be challenged by the taxpayer and, therefore, is excluded from the definition of “disputable decision” under section 3(1)(b)(iii). However, an employer or employee can dispute an assessment of tax deductions on the basis that a section RD 3(5) determination on which it is founded is wrong in fact or law. 70. The taxpayer must issue the NOPA to the Commissioner within the applicable response period. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues the notice of disputable decision or notice revoking or varying a disputable decision that is not an assessment unless the Commissioner allows a late NOPA under section 89K(1). Situation 5: NOPA in respect of a taxpayer’s assessment 71. Section 89DA(1) reads: A taxpayer may issue a notice of proposed adjustment in respect of an assessment made by the taxpayer for a tax year or a GST return period if the Commissioner has not previously issued a notice of proposed adjustment to the taxpayer in respect of the assessment. 18 72. If a taxpayer needs to file an income tax return they must also make an assessment of their taxable income and income tax liability under section 92(1) unless the Commissioner has previously made an assessment for that tax year (section 92(6)). 73. Section 89DA(1) also applies to a taxpayer’s GST assessment for a return period. A taxpayer who has to file a GST return must also make an assessment of the amount of GST payable for the return period under section 92B(1). 74. Pursuant to section 89DA(1), a taxpayer can issue to the Commissioner a NOPA in respect of their own tax assessment. 75. The taxpayer’s NOPA must be issued within the applicable response period as defined in section 89AB. Generally, this will be within the four-month period that starts on the date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer’s assessment unless the Commissioner allows a late NOPA under section 89K(1). 76. The date that the Commissioner receives the taxpayer’s assessment will be determined under section 14B. For example, under section 14B(8), the Commissioner will receive a NOPA that the taxpayer sends by post on the date that it would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post. Situation 6: NOPA that relates solely to a research and development tax credit 77. Under section 89DA, a taxpayer can also issue a NOPA that relates solely to a research and development expenditure tax credit arising from a notice of assessment that they have previously issued for the 2008−09 tax year. 78. The NOPA must be issued within the period that starts on the date on which the Commissioner receives the taxpayer’s assessment and ends two years after the latest date on which a taxpayer can provide a return of income for the 2008−09 tax year. This response period is an exception to the general response period that applies for disputing taxpayer assessments. 79. As the research and development expenditure tax credit has been repealed from the 2009-10 tax year onwards this response period has limited application it is not intended to discuss it further in this SPS. 19 CONTENTS OF A TAXPAYER’S NOPA 80. A NOPA is the document that commences the disputes process. It is intended to identify the true points of contention and explain the legal or technical aspects of the issuer’s position in relation to the proposed adjustment in a formal and understandable manner. This will ensure that information relevant to the dispute is quickly made available to the parties. Section 89F(1) and (3) specifies the content requirements for any NOPA that a taxpayer may issue. 81. Section 89F reads: (1) A notice of proposed adjustment must - (a) contain sufficient detail of the matters described in subsections (2) and (3) to identify the issues arising between the Commissioner and the disputant; and (b) be in the prescribed form. ... (3) A notice of proposed adjustment issued by a disputant must – (a) Identify the adjustment or adjustments proposed to be made to the assessment; and (b) Provide a statement of the facts and the law in sufficient detail to inform the Commissioner of the grounds for the disputant's proposed adjustment or adjustments; and (c) State how the law applies to the facts; and (d) Include copies of the documents of which the disputant is aware at the time that the notice is issued that are significantly relevant to the issues arising between the Commissioner and the disputant. 82. The prescribed form for a NOPA as required under section 89F(3)(b) is the IR770 Notice of proposed adjustment form that can be found on Inland Revenue’s website: www.ird.govt.nz. A handwritten NOPA in this form is acceptable. Additional information can also be attached to the prescribed form. 83. If the Commissioner receives a NOPA that is not in the prescribed form or has insufficient detail under section 89F(1)(a) the Commissioner’s practice will be to advise the taxpayer that the NOPA must be in the prescribed form or include sufficient information. If this occurs on the last day of the response period the Commissioner will consider any resubmitted NOPA under section 89K(1)(a)(iii) provided that the lateness is minimal (see paragraph 122). 84. If the taxpayer’s NOPA does not satisfy the content requirements under section 89F(1)(a) and (3) the Commissioner can reject the NOPA and not issue a NOR (see paragraphs 109 to 115). 85. When issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer must state the facts and law in sufficient detail, how the law applies to the facts and include copies of the documents that 20 are significantly relevant to the dispute and known to the taxpayer when they issue the NOPA. However, the taxpayer must avoid repeating facts, arguments or using unnecessary detail. The Commissioner cannot treat a tax return provided by the taxpayer as a NOPA because it will not satisfy the requirements in section 89F(1) and (3). 86. Section 89F(3)(b) requires that the taxpayer’s NOPA states the key facts and law concisely and in sufficient detail. The term “sufficient detail” means that the document must contain adequate analysis of the law and facts that are relevant to the dispute. This means sufficient discussion of the law to enable the Commissioner to clearly understand the proposed adjustment. 87. The Commissioner considers that it is necessary that the taxpayer provides “a statement of the facts and law in sufficient detail” to ensure that they have fully considered issues before they raise them in their NOPA. 88. Although it is not a requirement under section 89F(3) the taxpayer must ensure that a NOPA is relatively brief and simple to enable the parties to quickly progress the dispute without incurring substantial expenses or excessive preparation time. However, the taxpayer must also provide sufficient information to support the proposed adjustments in their NOPA and to reduce further administrative and compliance costs. Identify the proposed adjustment – section 89F(3)(a) 89. The taxpayer must identify the proposed adjustment in their NOPA. This includes for each proposed adjustment: (a) the amount or impact of the adjustment, and (b) the tax year or period to which the proposed adjustment relates. 90. The proposed adjustment should be set out as specifically as possible. For example: “increase the 2007 repairs and maintenance expenditure by $3,000”; “increase the GST input tax deduction by $4,000 in the August 2007 return period”, etc. Provide a statement of the facts and law in sufficient detail – section 89F(3)(b) Facts 91. To provide a brief and accurate statement of facts, the taxpayer must focus on the material factual matters relevant to the legal issues. The taxpayer must include the facts necessary for proving all the arguments raised in support of each adjustment, including any facts that are inconsistent with any argument that the Commissioner has previously raised. 92. The taxpayer should endeavour to disclose all the relevant material facts clearly and with adequate amounts of detail relative to the complexity of the issues. The taxpayer is best suited to do this because they are usually very familiar with 21 the background and facts that relate to the dispute. Disclosing the background and facts at the NOPA phase helps to resolve the dispute at an earlier stage. However, the taxpayer should not overstate the facts with irrelevant detail or repetition. 93. In complex cases, the Commissioner expects the taxpayer to explain the relevant facts clearly and methodically. The taxpayer should also assist the Commissioner to understand the background and facts of the dispute, so as to facilitate a speedy resolution of the case. The taxpayer should explain the facts and law in sufficient detail to inform the Commissioner of the grounds for the adjustment. It is unhelpful and can cause delays if the Commissioner has to second guess the factual bases of the taxpayer’s case. 94. For example, in a dispute that involves a complex financial arrangement, the taxpayer should explain each element of it. This includes explaining the background to the financial arrangement, identifying the parties involved, highlighting the relevant clauses in an agreement, etc. Law 95. Each proposed adjustment should stipulate the relevant section or sections that the taxpayer relies on and including, if a section has multiple independent parts, the applicable subsection(s). 96. It is important that the taxpayer includes an adequate amount of analysis of the applicable legal principles or tests in their NOPA. If possible these should be supported by case authorities with full citations. For example, in a dispute that involves the tax treatment of a trade-tie payment, the taxpayer must apply the legal principles from a leading case such as Birkdale Service Station v CIR (2000) 19 NZTC 15,981. However, it is not necessary to laboriously describe large numbers of precedent cases on the same issue or include extracts from each. How the law applies to the facts - section 89F(3)(c) 97. The taxpayer must apply the legal arguments to the facts. This ensures that the proposed adjustment is not a statement that appears out of context in relation to the rest of the document. The Commissioner considers that the application of the law to the facts must logically support the proposed adjustment and be stated clearly and in detail. 98. The taxpayer must present the materials and arguments on which they intend to rely or on which reliance will be placed. That is, if more than one argument supports the same or a similar outcome, all arguments must be made and supported by evidence. For each proposition of law, it is recommended that the NOPA makes a clear link to an outline of supporting facts. 22 Include copies of the relevant documents that support the adjustment – section 89F(3)(d) 99. The taxpayer must provide full copies of the documents that they know are significantly relevant to the dispute and in existence when they issue the NOPA. This ensures that the Commissioner has all the relevant information necessary to respond to the NOPA. 100. For example: (a) a taxpayer proposes an adjustment to GST input tax credits in their NOPA. The taxpayer must provide copies of the relevant tax invoices as documentary evidence in their NOPA. (b) a taxpayer’s dispute involves a sale of land transaction. The taxpayer must provide a copy of the sale and purchase agreement and other relevant correspondence between the vendor and the purchaser as documentary evidence in their NOPA. 101. In some cases, new documentary evidence can emerge, as the dispute progresses. For example, the documentation is quite old and may have been misplaced. The taxpayer may be unaware of these documents when the NOPA was issued. The parties should then exchange this new evidence when it becomes known or available. 102. Where a taxpayer is aware of a particular document that is significantly relevant to their dispute, but cannot obtain a copy of it, the taxpayer should include the following matters in their NOPA: (a) the nature of the document and its relevance to the dispute, and (b) the reasonable steps that the taxpayer has taken to obtain a copy of the document, and (c) the expected date that the document will be made available to the Commissioner. 103. However, this practice should not be treated as dispensing with the requirements under section 89F(3)(d). The Commissioner still expects the taxpayer will send copies of the relevant documents mentioned in their NOPA as soon as they become available. 23 ELECTION OF THE SMALL CLAIMS JURISDICTION OF THE TAXATION REVIEW AUTHORITY 104. Under section 89E(1), a taxpayer issues can elect in their NOPA that the TRA acting in its small claims jurisdiction hears any unresolved dispute that arises from the NOPA, if the following requirements are met: (a) the taxpayer’s NOPA is issued under section 89D or 89DA ( see earlier discussion), and (b) the amount in dispute is $30,000 or less. 105. A taxpayer’s election under section 89E(1), is irrevocable and is binding on them. In this circumstance, the full disputes process does not have to be followed. RECEIPT OF A TAXPAYER’S NOPA 106. Inland Revenue will usually assign a taxpayer’s NOPA to the responsible officer within five working days after it is received. 107. After receiving the NOPA, the responsible officer will determine and record the following: (a) the date on which the NOPA was issued, whether the NOPA has been issued within the applicable response period and the date by which the Commissioner’s response must be issued, and (b) the NOPA’s salient features including any deficiencies in its content. 108. Where this is practicable, Inland Revenue will advise the taxpayer or their tax agent that it has received the NOPA by telephone or in writing within 10 working days. Deficiencies in the contents of a NOPA 109. Where Inland Revenue has received a NOPA that it considers has deficiencies (that is, the requirements under section 89F(1)(a) and (3) may not be met), the responsible Inland Revenue officer will take reasonable steps to have the taxpayer correct the information in the NOPA before the response period expires. 110. The taxpayer will be advised as soon as practicable that the Commissioner considers that the NOPA may not meet the requirements of section 89F(1)(a) and (3) and why. They will also be advised that any additional or corrected information should be provided within the response period. 111. Taxpayers are encouraged to issue their NOPA immediately after they have completed it because they could have insufficient time to rectify any deficiencies if the response period is due to expire. 24 112. Generally where the deficiencies are not able to be remedied and it is possible to treat the NOPA as sufficient, or if the NOPA advances sufficient argument to allow the dispute to develop and progress, then the Commissioner will continue with the dispute. The argument that the NOPA is deficient will be incorporated into the Commissioner’s SOP and the Commissioner will also fully argue the substantive issue. 113. However, if the NOPA received is highly unsatisfactory the Commissioner will not continue with the dispute. This will be on the grounds that the NOPA does not satisfy the requirements set out in section 89F(1)(a) and (3). 114. A NOPA is likely to be considered highly unsatisfactory only where the taxpayer's position is materially inconsistent and not capable of coherent explanation, or there is no observable explanation at all of the taxpayer's grounds for dispute. In these situations the dispute will be treated as if it has never commenced (unless the taxpayer resubmits a late NOPA and the Commissioner accepts it under one of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K). 115. In considering the adequacy of the taxpayer’s NOPA, the Commissioner will not base his view on the strength or weakness of the taxpayer’s argument. The Commissioner will only be concerned with whether the NOPA meets its statutory requirements. 116. The approach outlined above is consistent with that taken by the Court of Appeal in CIR v Alam and Begum (2009) 24 NZTC 23,564. NOPA THAT A TAXPAYER HAS ISSUED OUTSIDE THE APPLICABLE RESPONSE PERIOD 117. Unless an “exceptional circumstance” arises under any of the circumstances specified in section 89K(1), the Commissioner cannot accept a NOPA that a taxpayer issues under section 89D or 89DA outside the applicable response period. Exceptional circumstances under section 89K 118. The legislation defines exceptional circumstances very narrowly. The cases on “exceptional circumstances,” such as Treasury Technology Holdings Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,752, Milburn NZ Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 14,005, Fuji Xerox NZ Ltd v CIR (2001) 17,470 (CA), Hollis v CIR (2005) 22 NZTC 19,570, and Balich v CIR (2007) 23 NZTC 21,230 are also relevant. The case law confirms that the Commissioner should apply the definition of “exceptional circumstances” in sections 89K(3) and 138D consistently. 119. The following guidelines have emerged from the case law: 25 (a) a taxpayer’s misunderstanding or erroneous calculation of the applicable response period will usually not be regarded as an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control under section 89K(3)(a); (b) an agent’s failure to advise their client that they have received a notice of assessment or other relevant documents that causes the taxpayer to respond outside the applicable response period will not generally be considered to be an exceptional circumstance under section 89K(3)(b) (Hollis v CIR); and (c) an exceptional circumstance can arise if the taxpayer has relied on misleading information that the Commissioner has given them that causes them to respond outside the applicable response period (Hollis v CIR). 120. The Commissioner will only accept a late NOPA on rare occasions. See Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 3 (August 1996) for some examples of situations that can be considered “exceptional circumstances” beyond a taxpayer’s control. 121. Section 89K(3) reads: For the purpose of subsection (1),— (a) An exceptional circumstance arises if— (i) An event or circumstance beyond the control of a disputant provides the disputant with a reasonable justification for not rejecting a proposed adjustment, or for not issuing a notice of proposed adjustment or statement of position, within the response period for the notice: (ii) A disputant is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period: (b) An act or omission of an agent of a disputant is not an exceptional circumstance unless— (i) It was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent that could not have been anticipated, and its effect could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct; or (ii) The agent is late in issuing a notice of proposed adjustment, notice of response or statement of position but the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, or results from 1 or more statutory holidays falling in the response period. 122. The statutory holiday exception is self-explanatory. The Commissioner can also accept a late NOPA if the Commissioner considers that the lateness is minimal, that is, the document was only one to two days late. 123. For example, the response period ends on a Saturday and the taxpayer provides a NOPA on the following Tuesday. The Commissioner treats the response 26 period as ending on Monday on the basis of section 35(6) of the Interpretation Act 1999 and accepts that the lateness of the NOPA was minimal. That is, the Commissioner received the NOPA within one to two days of Monday, the last day of the response period. If the response period ended on Friday and the taxpayer provided the NOR on the following Monday, the Commissioner would also accept that the lateness is minimal. 124. Besides the degree of lateness, the Commissioner will consider the following factors when exercising the discretion under section 89K(1): (a) the date on which the NOPA was issued, and (b) the response period within which the NOPA should be issued, and (c) the real event, circumstance or reason why the taxpayer did not issue the NOPA within the applicable response period, and (d) the taxpayer’s compliance history in relation to the tax types under consideration (for example, whether the taxpayer has a history of paying tax late or filing late tax returns or NOPAs in the past?) 125. For example, a taxpayer issues a NOPA to the Commissioner two days after the applicable “response period” has expired. The taxpayer does not provide a legitimate reason for the lateness. The taxpayer also has a history of filing late NOPAs within the minimal allowable lateness period (that is, up to two days outside the applicable “response period”) and has been advised on the calculation of the “response period” each time. 126. Although the degree of lateness was minimal each time, the Commissioner would not accept the taxpayer’s NOPA in this circumstance. This ensures that the section 89K(3)(b)(ii) exception is not treated as an extension of the “response period” in all circumstances. 127. The Commissioner will consider a taxpayer’s application made under section 89K(1) after receiving the relevant NOPA. The responsible officer will document the reasons for accepting or rejecting the taxpayer’s application and advise them of their decision in writing within 15 working days after Inland Revenue receives their application. 128. If the Commissioner rejects a taxpayer’s application made under section 89K(1), the Commissioner can still consider the validity of the taxpayer’s tax position in terms of the practice for applying the discretion under section 113. See SPS 07/03: Requests to amend assessments for details of this practice. However, the Commissioner’s decision to reject an application made under section 89K(1) is not a “disputable decision” for the purposes of section 89D(3). 27 TIME FRAMES TO COMPLETE THE DISPUTES PROCESS 129. If a taxpayer has issued a NOPA to the Commissioner and the dispute remains unresolved, when practicable, the parties should negotiate a time frame to ensure that the dispute is progressed in a timely and efficient way. 130. Agreeing to a time frame is not statutorily required but, rather, is a critical administrative requirement that requires both parties to be ready to progress matters. The parties should endeavour to meet the agreed time frame. If there are delays in the progress of the dispute the responsible officer must manage the delay including any relationship with internal advisers and liaise with the taxpayer. 131. If the negotiated time frame cannot be achieved, the Commissioner must enter into continuing discussions with the taxpayer, either to arrange a new time frame, or otherwise keep them advised of when the disclosure notice will be issued. Therefore, the failure to negotiate or adhere to an agreed time frame will not prevent the case from progressing through the disputes process in a timely manner. 132. In addition to the above administrative practice, the Commissioner is bound by section 89N. Under section 89N(2), if the parties cannot agree on the proposed adjustment, the Commissioner cannot amend the assessment without completing the disputes resolution process (that is, consider the taxpayer’s SOP), unless any of the exceptions in section 89N(1)(c) apply. These exceptions are explained in SPS 08/01: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or any replacement SPS. THE COMMISSIONER’S RESPONSE TO A TAXPAYER’S NOPA: NOTICE OF RESPONSE 133. If the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer’s proposed adjustment, then, under section 89G(1) the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer that any or all of their proposed adjustments are rejected by issuing a NOR within the applicable response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer’s NOPA is issued. The Commissioner interprets this to mean that the taxpayer must receive the NOR within this period. For example, if a taxpayer issues a NOPA on 9 April 2010, the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer of its rejection by issuing to them a NOR and they must receive that NOR on or before 8 June 2010. 134. Where it is practicable, the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent within 10 working days before the response period expires to advise whether the Commissioner intends to issue a NOR to them in response to their NOPA. Such contact may be made by telephone or letter. 135. The Commissioner must issue the NOR to the taxpayer (section 14(3)(a)) or a representative authorised to act on their behalf (section 14(3)(b)). In respect of the latter, it is a question of fact whether the recipient is authorised to receive 28 the NOR on the taxpayer’s behalf. The taxpayer must ensure that their NOPA stipulates the name of the person or agent that they have nominated to receive any NOR issued by the Commissioner (CIR v Thompson (2007) 23 NZTC 21,375). 136. For example, a tax agent sends a NOPA to the Commissioner. Although the tax agent would appear to have ostensible authority to receive the Commissioner’s NOR, the Commissioner’s practice will be to contact the tax agent to confirm whether the agent can accept service of the NOR. Therefore, the Commissioner must ensure that a NOR issued in accordance with section 14(3)(b) complies with any relevant instructions given by the taxpayer or the recipient’s authority to receive can otherwise be verified. 137. Section 89G(2) specifies the content requirements for a NOR. The Commissioner must state concisely in the NOR: (a) the facts or legal arguments in the taxpayer’s NOPA that the Commissioner considers are wrong, and (b) why the Commissioner considers that those facts and arguments are wrong, and (c) any facts and legal arguments that the Commissioner relies upon, and (d) how the legal arguments apply to the facts, and (e) the quantitative adjustment to any figures proposed in the taxpayer’s NOPA that results from the facts and legal arguments that the Commissioner relies upon. 138. Under section 89G(2)(e), the requirement for a quantitative adjustment establishes the extent to which the Commissioner considers that the adjustment in the taxpayer’s NOPA is incorrect. This amount need not be exact, although, every attempt should be made to ensure that it is as accurate as possible. The amount in dispute can be varied, as the dispute progresses. For example, if the parties agree on new figures at the conference phase. 139. The Commissioner considers that Inland Revenue has a statutory obligation to inform the taxpayer adequately. Therefore, any NOR that the Commissioner issues to reject the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer’s NOPA must be relatively brief but sufficiently detailed to explain all the relevant facts, quantitative adjustments, issues and law. DEEMED ACCEPTANCE 140. Section 89H(2) reads: If the Commissioner does not, within the response period for a notice of proposed adjustment issued by a disputant, reject an adjustment contained in the notice, the Commissioner is deemed to accept the proposed adjustment and section 89J applies. 29 141. If the Commissioner issues a NOR outside the two-month response period, the Commissioner is deemed to have accepted the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer’s NOPA under section 89H(2). This will finish the dispute and the Commissioner must issue an assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer pursuant to section 89J(1) (see the discussion in paragraphs 146 to 149). 142. However, the Commissioner is not precluded from later exercising the discretion under section 113 and issuing to the taxpayer an amended assessment that reflects another adjustment for a different issue to that previously accepted under section 89H(2) for the same tax period. Exception to deemed acceptance 143. Notwithstanding section 89H(2), the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for an order that a NOR can be issued outside the two-month response period under section 89L(1). Section 89L only applies if an exceptional circumstance has occurred or prevented the Commissioner from issuing a NOR to the taxpayer within the response period. The Commissioner will endeavour to apply the requirement for exceptional circumstances in section 89L(1)(a) consistently with the similar requirement in section 89K(1)(a) (see discussion in paragraphs 118 to 128). 144. Under section 89L(3), an “exceptional circumstance”: a) Is an event or circumstance beyond the control of the Commissioner or an officer of the Department that provides the Commissioner with a reasonable justification for not rejecting an adjustment proposed by a disputant within the response period; and b) Without limiting paragraph (a), includes a change to a tax law, or a new tax law, or a decision of a court in respect of a tax law, that is enacted or made within the response period. 145. For example: (a) A flood damaged an Inland Revenue office during the applicable response period for a taxpayer’s NOPA. The taxpayer’s NOPA was lost in the flood. The Inland Revenue officer could not obtain another copy of the NOPA within the applicable response period. The absence of information has prevented the Commissioner from forming a view on the subject matter in dispute. The Commissioner can apply for a High Court order under section 89L for further time to issue a NOR. (b) A taxpayer issues to the Commissioner a NOPA that claims additional tax depreciation on computer software. During the two-month response period, a High Court decision was made in respect of another taxpayer. The High Court held that a depreciation claim amounted to tax avoidance and should be disallowed. The Commissioner can apply to the High Court for further time to issue a NOR to the taxpayer, so as to consider the full effect of the High Court decision. 30 (c) The Inland Revenue officer to whom a taxpayer’s NOPA was assigned is absent on annual leave for the remainder of the response period. The Inland Revenue officer does not arrange for another officer to prepare and issue a NOR to the taxpayer within the response period. The Commissioner is deemed to accept the NOPA under section 89H(2). In this circumstance, the Commissioner does not consider that an exceptional circumstance prevented the Inland Revenue officer from rejecting the adjustment within the response period for the purpose of section 89L(1)(a). Implication of section 89J 146. Under section 89J(1), if the Commissioner accepts or is deemed to accept any adjustment that is proposed in a taxpayer’s NOPA, the Commissioner must include or take account of the adjustment in: (a) a notice of assessment, and (b) any further notice of assessment or amended assessment, that is issued to the taxpayer unless the Commissioner has applied to the High Court for an order that a notice can be issued rejecting the proposed adjustment under section 89L(1). 147. In this circumstance, the Commissioner’s practice will be not to later issue a NOPA that purports to reverse any proposed adjustment previously accepted under section 89H(2) because section 89J(1) prevents the Commissioner from issuing to the taxpayer a further amended assessment that does not include or take into account the previously accepted adjustment. 148. However, pursuant to section 89J(2) the Commissioner can issue a notice of assessment or amended assessment that does not include or take into account an adjustment that the Commissioner has, or is deemed to have accepted, if the Commissioner considers that, in relation to the adjustment, the taxpayer: (a) was fraudulent, or (b) wilfully misled the Commissioner. 149. If the Commissioner considers that section 89J(2) applies following a deemed acceptance under section 89H(2) the Commissioner cannot resume the earlier disputes process but can later issue a NOPA in respect of any of the adjustments proposed in the earlier disputes process. 150. Pursuant to section 89J(2), the Commissioner must decide whether any of the exceptions to section 89J(1) apply before an assessment or amended assessment that does not include an adjustment that the Commissioner has, or is deemed to have accepted can be issued. 31 151. Any opinion that the Commissioner forms under section 89J(2) must be honestly held, based on a correct understanding of the relevant grounds and reasonably justifiable on the basis of the facts and law available. An opinion formed by the Commissioner under section 89J(2) is a disputable decision for the purposes of section 89D(3). REJECTION OF THE COMMISSIONER’S NOTICE OF RESPONSE 152. If the Commissioner has issued a NOR under section 89G(1) that rejects the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer’s NOPA, the taxpayer must reject the Commissioner’s NOR within the applicable response period. That is, within two months starting on the date that the Commissioner issues the NOR. Otherwise, the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the Commissioner’s NOR under section 89H(3) and the dispute will finish. 153. The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent two weeks before the response period for the Commissioner’s NOR expires to determine whether the taxpayer will reject the Commissioner’s NOR in writing. Such contact can be made by telephone or in writing. 154. The taxpayer must reject the Commissioner’s NOR in writing. The written rejection must be issued within the response period and can be in any form. The taxpayer does not have to expressly reject each of the rejections of proposed adjustments that are included in the Commissioner’s NOR. The taxpayer’s written rejection must simply make it clear that the taxpayer rejects the Commissioner’s NOR. 155. For example, in certain circumstances, the Commissioner can treat a notice of proceedings and statement of claim that the taxpayer serves on the Commissioner within the response period to commence challenge proceedings as a valid rejection in writing of the Commissioner’s NOR under section 89H(3)(a). 156. Where it is practicable, the taxpayer’s written rejection will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue has received it and acknowledged as received within 10 working days. 157. If deemed acceptance occurs (that is, the taxpayer has not rejected the Commissioner’s NOR in writing), the Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to advise the taxpayer of this within two weeks after the response period to the Commissioner’s NOR has expired. 158. Under section 138B(3) a taxpayer can file challenge proceedings upon receipt of the Commissioner’s NOR. This does not automatically end the disputes process. However, the Commissioner’s practice is to treat a notice of proceedings and statement of claim that the taxpayer serves on the Commissioner within the response period commencing challenge proceedings as also being a request for the Commissioner’s agreement to opt-out of the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii). The Commissioner will agree to the taxpayer opting out in these 32 circumstances as it is considered that once a challenge is filed the dispute will be resolved more efficiently at a hearing authority. CONFERENCE PHASE What is the conference phase of the disputes process? 159. The conference phase of the disputes process allows the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute to exchange material information relating to the dispute (if this has not already been done prior to the conference phase). More importantly it is an opportunity for the parties to the dispute to try to resolve the differences in their understanding of facts, laws and legal arguments. 160. The word “resolve” in this context is not limited to final resolution of the dispute. Settlement is a possibility but this is not the only objective of the conference phase. The parties may “resolve” part of the dispute by agreeing on some of the facts and clarifying some of the legal arguments, while agreeing to disagree on other matters, which will become the focus in the later phases of the disputes process. 161. Generally, if a dispute remains unresolved after the NOR phase, the conference phase will follow. 162. A conference is an administrative process that aims to clarify and, if possible, resolve the dispute. However, the conference phase should not be used by either party for the purpose of delaying the completion of the disputes process. The conference phase can involve more than one meeting between the parties and it is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting. Legal and other advisers attending a conference 163. If a dispute is not settled earlier, the parties can obtain expert legal or other advice during the conference phase in addition to advice previously obtained. These advisers can attend any meetings in relation to the dispute. Conference facilitation 164. Conference facilitation is a new feature in the conference phase. A facilitated conference will involve an independent internal facilitator who will promote and encourage structured discussion between Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer on an informed basis and with the bona fide intention of resolving the dispute. The conference facilitator will be a senior Inland Revenue officer who will not have been involved in the dispute prior to the conference phase. The facilitator will have sufficient technical knowledge to understand and lead the conference meeting. 33 165. The conference facilitator will not be responsible for making any decision in relation to the dispute, except for determining when the conference phase has come to an end. In particular, it is not the role of the facilitator to undertake settlement of the dispute. If this possibility arises it is the responsibility of the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers involved in the dispute. 166. Having a conference facilitated is optional and a conference can be held without a facilitator but, conference facilitation will be offered to all taxpayers as part of the disputes process. The Commissioner’s offer to taxpayers of a facilitated conference will be made in writing (“the conference facilitation letter”) within one month from the date of issue of the taxpayer’s NOR. The conference facilitation letter marks the commencement of the conference phase. 167. The format of the conference meeting need not be limited to a face-to-face meeting. The parties to the dispute may agree to hold a telephone or video conference. (For reasons of simplicity, the SPS refers to “meetings” to include these different conference formats.) 168. The taxpayer is expected to respond within two weeks from the date of receiving the conference facilitation letter. The taxpayer should indicate whether they will attend the conference meeting, whether they will accept the conference facilitation offer, whether there are any special needs or requirements at the meeting and who else will be attending the meeting. If the taxpayer does not respond within this timeframe, the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute will contact the taxpayer about the conference facilitation letter. Preparation for the conference meeting 169. When a taxpayer agrees to attend a conference meeting, Inland Revenue will contact the taxpayer within two weeks from the taxpayer’s agreement, will establish a timeframe and agree on how the meeting will be conducted. 170. Prior to the conference meeting, the taxpayer should inform Inland Revenue whether their advisors will attend the conference meeting. 171. The parties to the dispute may agree to exchange information relevant to the dispute before the conference is held. A copy of that information will be provided to the facilitator where the taxpayer has accepted the conference facilitation offer. The Inland Revenue officers will provide the taxpayer a list of information that has been given to the facilitator. The taxpayer may request a copy of any information on that list if it is not already in their possession. It is also crucial for the parties to exchange the information prior to the meeting if the agreed format of the conference is a telephone or video conference. 172. Inland Revenue may decide not to pursue the dispute further after considering the taxpayer’s information. The whole disputes process (including the conference phase) would come to an end in these cases. 34 173. The conference phase will generally be expected to be completed within three months, but this will vary depending on the facts and complexities of the specific case. A longer conference phase may be justified in some disputes if the parties are engaged in meaningful discussions. 174. An agenda will be useful for both parties at the conference meeting. An agreed agenda should divide the conference meeting into two parts. The first part of the meeting should involve an exchange of material information and discussion of contentious facts and issues relating to the dispute. Any procedural matters such as the timeframe for completing the disputes process, the adjudication process, time bar waivers and the possibility of opting out of the disputes process will also be discussed. The second part of the meeting, if applicable, would involve negotiation of possible areas of resolution of the dispute. Any communication made and any materials prepared for the purpose of negotiating a settlement or resolution during this part of the meeting will be treated as being on a “without prejudice” basis. 175. Where there is no agenda in a facilitated conference, the conference facilitator will guide the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to discuss the contentious facts and issues at the conference meeting. 176. Where the option of conference facilitation has been declined, the parties to the dispute should work out the appropriate structure at the conference meeting, bearing in mind that one of the aims of any conference is to reach agreement on some or all the facts and issues and thus, resolve the dispute. At the conference meeting Facilitated Conference 177. The facilitator will: (a) Explain the objectives of the conference phase on the basis of the agreed agenda. (b) Remind the parties of any rules relating to the conference (these will generally have been set out in the conference facilitation letter). (c) Clarify who the parties are at the conference meeting and the capacities they hold (e.g. whether they are the authorised tax advisors; whether they have authority to settle the dispute at the meeting, etc.) (d) Ask whether the parties agree to record the meeting discussions using audio or video technology. (Refer to SPS INV 330 Tape-Recording Inland Revenue Interviews or any replacement SPS). (e) Run through the agenda. (f) Encourage the parties to present evidence in support of their perceived facts (either at the conference meeting or on a later date if the evidence 35 cannot be provided at the time of the meeting). Where possible, encourage the parties to reach agreement on all the facts of the dispute. If no agreement can be made, encourage the parties to establish the common grounds and address the matters that they agree to disagree. These agreements will be recorded in writing. The agreements will be sent to the taxpayer to verify the correctness and sign by a specified date. (g) Promote constructive discussion of only the contentious tax issues and where possible, encourage both parties to explore the issues, resolve or settle the dispute (subject to our internal revenue delegations and guidelines on settlement). If the contentious tax issues cannot be resolved, ask both parties to do one or more of the following: • At the end of the conference meeting, ask the parties to consider whether the conference phase comes to an end. Consider whether there is need for another meeting, noting that another meeting can be justified if both parties need to exchange further information in support of their tax technical arguments but continuous meetings are discouraged if this is seen as a delaying tactic. • Where the parties agree to end the conference phase and the facilitator considers that the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved, the facilitator can clearly signal the end of the conference phase to the parties. • Agree on the timeframe for completing the disputes process and submitting the dispute to the adjudication process. This includes the timeframe for taxpayers to meet outstanding information requests and Inland Revenue officers’ undertaking to provide copies of information relevant to the disputes. The agreed timeframe will also factor in time bar waivers if given by the taxpayer and the time required for any court challenge that relates to documents, which are claimed to be protected by professional legal privilege and tax advice documents, which are claimed to be protected by the non-disclosure rights. Ask the taxpayer whether a time bar waiver will be given if the time bar applicable to the assessment in dispute is imminent. • Clearly indicate whether the communication made and/or documents prepared for the purpose of negotiating potential settlement or resolution of the dispute will be treated as being on a “without prejudice” basis. • Ask the taxpayer to consider whether the opt-out process applies and advise the taxpayer of the right to opt-out within the required timeframe, so that it is not necessary to complete the disputes process as required under section 89N and that the dispute will be more efficiently resolved by a hearing authority. 36 (h) Note that any agreement between the parties will be recorded in writing and signed either at the conference meeting by both parties or on a later date after the taxpayer has verified the correctness of the agreement. (i) Note that the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute will remain as the first point of contact. Unfacilitated conference 178. In an unfacilitated conference, the parties at the conference should agree on and perform tasks similar to those listed in paragraphs 177(a) to (h) above. 179. At the end of the conference meeting, it is important for the Inland Revenue officers and the taxpayer to discuss whether they consider that the conference phase has come to an end and record any agreement in writing. After the conference meeting 180. The following is relevant only if the conference phase does not end at the meeting. Facilitated conference 181. Where a conference facilitator is involved, the facilitator will: (a) follow up on the agreed matters including the agreed timeframe and exchange of information (but does not include enforcing the agreement between the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute); (b) assess any need to attend a further meeting; (c) suggest to the parties that the conference phase has ended and ask them to reach an agreement on this matter, then clearly notify the parties of the date on which the conference phase has ended. Unfacilitated conference 182. In a conference that did not have a facilitator, the Inland Revenue officers will perform these tasks. They may suggest to the taxpayer that the conference phase has ended after all the material information relating to the dispute has been exchanged and all the contentious facts and issues have been discussed. The parties will then agree in writing on the date on which the conference phase has ended. If the parties cannot agree on when to end the conference phase, the Investigations Manager will be responsible for making the decision on ending the conference phase after considering all the parties’ relevant reasons and concerns. 37 End of the conference phase 183. It is important for the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers to be fully aware of when the conference phase comes to an end. The conference phase is not necessarily complete just because the parties have held the final meeting. For example, the parties may need further information or to consider further submissions made at the meeting. In most cases, it is expected that the parties involved in the dispute will agree on when the conference phase has ended. Such agreement will be put in writing. Facilitated conference 184. Where conference facilitation is involved, the facilitator will be responsible for clarifying the agreed end date of the conference phase with the parties. 185. If the facilitator considers that both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue officers have exchanged all the material information relevant to the dispute, have fully discussed the tax technical issues and have not resolved the dispute, the facilitator may suggest to the parties that the conference phase can come to its end. 186. If there is no agreement and the parties’ reasons for continuing the conference phase are considered to be insufficient, the conference facilitator can make a decision to end the conference phase and notify the parties of that decision. The following are examples of strong indicators that the conference phase has come to its end: (a) The taxpayer and/or the tax advisors stop contacting the Inland Revenue officers directly involved in the dispute for a few weeks; (b) The parties did not exchange information notwithstanding that this has been agreed on at the conference meeting, thus leading to the exercise of the Commissioner’s powers (eg section 17 notices); (c) The parties agree to disagree with each other and express interest in progressing to the SOP phase; (d) The taxpayer appears to be using delaying tactics at the conference phase when the issue in dispute is subject to an imminent time bar. 187. In rare situations, where conference facilitation is involved and the facilitator is concerned with the parties’ decision to end the conference phase before achieving the objectives of the conference meeting, the facilitator may adjourn the meeting and discuss the concerns with the responsible Inland Revenue officers. The facilitator may also contact the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s tax advisors to discuss whether the conference phase should come to its end. The facilitator will seek the parties’ agreement as to whether or not the conference phase is complete. 38 Unfacilitated conference 188. Where no conference facilitation is involved, the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers will work out when to end the conference phase. They must consider whether the objectives of the conference phase have been achieved before reaching the agreement. If no agreement can be reached, the Investigations Manager will review the conduct of the parties during the conference phase and make a decision on whether the conference phase has come to an end. 189. When a dispute remains unresolved after the conference phase has been completed, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1) without delay. PROGRESSING DISPUTES THROUGH THE DISPUTES PROCESS WHERE THE DISPUTE AFFECTS MULTIPLE TAXPAYERS 190. Sometimes it is necessary for Inland Revenue to deal with a large number of taxpayers that are all affected by the same disputed matter. This can arise in situations where: • the taxpayers are all investors in a particular scheme; • the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same promoter; • the taxpayers have entered into similar arrangements and they have the same tax agent; • there exists a widespread but well-defined common problem involving many unrelated taxpayers (eg taxpayers moving their private residence into an LAQC, or a number of taxpayers claiming non-deductible expenses such as fines for overloading). 191. Given Inland Revenue’s limited resources, and bearing in mind taxpayer compliance costs it may not be appropriate for all the cases to proceed through the full dispute process. 192. The Commissioner’s approach, in the context of taxpayer initiated disputes, to the different situations which arise where a large number of taxpayers are all affected by the same disputed matter is outlined in the following paragraphs. Situation one: There are a number of cases on the same issue under dispute. One case has been referred to the Adjudication Unit, who has still to reach a conclusion on the matter. 193. In this situation it may be possible for other affected taxpayers and the Commissioner to merely agree, subject to statutory time bar issues, to place their case "on hold" while the Adjudication Unit undertakes its analysis. 39 194. However, care will need to be taken to ensure that the time bar will not be breached, and consideration should be given to obtaining a time bar waiver. 195. Again, as this approach requires the taxpayer to agree, the Commissioner can offer it to individual taxpayers but they still have the choice to progress the dispute through the full disputes process. Situation two: The Adjudication Unit has looked at an issue before and taken a view supporting the taxpayer. 196. It is the Commissioner’s policy that a finding for the taxpayer in previous dispute(s) will usually lead to the other disputes being withdrawn, particularly if the disputes are in respect of the same transaction. 197. However, in some situations further consideration of the issue is required at a national level before the Commissioner will apply the conclusions reached in a particular adjudication report more broadly to other taxpayers. In those cases, Inland Revenue officers may be advised that a specified or contrary approach (to that adopted by the Adjudication Unit) is to be followed pending further consideration of the issue at a national level. DISCLOSURE NOTICE 198. The Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice under section 89M(1), unless the Commissioner: (a) does not have to complete the disputes process because any of the exceptions under section 89N(1)(c) apply (see the discussion in SPS 08/01: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or any replacement SPS), or (b) does not have to complete the disputes process because the High Court has made an order that the dispute resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3), or (c) has already issued to the taxpayer a notice of disputable decision that includes or takes into account the adjustment proposed in the NOPA pursuant to section 89M(2). Section 89M(1) and (2) reads: (1) Unless subsection (2) applies, and subject to section 89N, the Commissioner must issue a disclosure notice in respect of a notice of proposed adjustment to a disputant at the time or after the Commissioner or the taxpayer, as the case may be, issues the notice of proposed adjustment. (2) The Commissioner may not issue a disclosure notice in respect of a notice of proposed adjustment if the Commissioner has already issued a notice of disputable decision that includes, or takes account of, the adjustment proposed in the notice of proposed adjustment. 199. The meaning of disputable decision is discussed earlier in paragraphs 60 to 70. 40 200. The Commissioner will usually advise the taxpayer two weeks before a disclosure notice is issued that it will be issued to them. 201. Where practicable, the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer shortly after the disclosure notice and SOP are issued to ascertain whether they have received these documents. 202. If the taxpayer has not received the Commissioner’s disclosure notice, for example, due to a postal error or an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control, the Commissioner will issue another disclosure notice to the taxpayer. In this circumstance, the response period within which the taxpayer must respond with their SOP will commence from the date that the Commissioner issued the initial disclosure notice. 203. Where the taxpayer cannot issue a SOP within the applicable response period, they should issue a late SOP with an explanation of why it is late. The Commissioner will consider the late SOP in terms of the discretion under section 89K(1) (see paragraphs 118 to 128 for details). Evidence exclusion rule 204. A disclosure notice is the document that can trigger the application of the evidence exclusion rule under section 138G(1). This rule restricts the evidence that the parties can raise in court challenges to matters disclosed in their SOP. (Both parties can refer to evidence raised by either party.) 205. Any disclosure notice that the Commissioner issues will explain the effect of the evidence exclusion rule and refer to section 138G. 206. Section 89M(6B) defines “evidence” for the purposes of the evidence exclusion rule to mean the available documentary evidence and not lists of potential witnesses. Therefore, the identities of both parties’ witnesses in sensitive cases will continue to be protected, without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule. Issue of a disclosure notice 207. The Commissioner can issue a disclosure notice at any time on or after the date that the taxpayer issues a NOPA because there is no statutory time frame specifying when the notice must be issued. 208. The Commissioner does not have to issue a disclosure notice to a taxpayer when they ask for one to be issued. However, the Commissioner will usually discuss such a request with the taxpayer and advise whether a disclosure notice will be issued and, if not, the reasons why and the implications for the dispute. 209. Generally, the Commissioner’s practice is to issue a disclosure notice after the exchange of a NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, the conclusion of the conference phase and in accordance with any time frame agreed with the 41 taxpayer. The Commissioner will usually issue a disclosure notice within one month after the conference phase has been completed. 210. When possible, the responsible officer should use the relevant statutory power under the TAA to obtain any information needed to complete the conference or disclosure phases. This will ensure that the disputes process is conducted in a timely and efficient manner. If the Commissioner is waiting for information to be provided pursuant to a statutory power Commissioner will defer issuing a disclosure notice to ensure that any information provided by the taxpayer can be included in the Commissioner’s SOP. 211. If a disclosure notice is issued earlier (for example, the facts are clear, the taxpayer agrees, or a conference is not required) the reasons must be documented and explained to the taxpayer. TAXPAYER’S STATEMENT OF POSITION 212. Pursuant to section 89M(5), once the Commissioner has issued a disclosure notice, the taxpayer must issue to the Commissioner a SOP in the prescribed form (the IR 773 Statement of Position found on Inland Revenue’s website) within the two-month response period that starts on the date that the disclosure notice is issued. 213. The Commissioner cannot consider a document that the taxpayer purports to issue as a SOP before the Commissioner has issued the disclosure notice because it would have been issued outside the applicable response period. The taxpayer must submit another SOP after the disclosure notice is issued to satisfy their obligation under section 89M(5). 214. Unless an “exceptional circumstance” in section 89K applies, if the taxpayer issues a SOP to the Commissioner outside the response period, the Commissioner will treat the dispute as if it was never commenced. The Commissioner does not have to issue an assessment to include or take account of the taxpayer’s proposed adjustment. Section 89M(7)(b) reads: (7) A disputant who does not issue a statement of position in the prescribed form within the response period for the statement of position, is treated as follows: ... (b) if the disputant has proposed the adjustment to the assessment, the disputant is treated as not having issued a notice of proposed adjustment. Contents of a taxpayer’s statement of position 215. The content of a SOP is binding. If the matter proceeds to court, then pursuant to section 138G(1) the parties can only rely on the facts, evidence (excluding oral evidence), issues and propositions of law that either party discloses in their SOP barring an application by the parties to the court to include new information under section 138G(2). 216. The taxpayer’s SOP must be in the prescribed form (the IR 773 Statement of position form that can be found on Inland Revenue’s website: www.ird.govt.nz) 42 and include sufficient detail to fairly inform the Commissioner of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law on which the taxpayer wishes to rely. In particular, the taxpayer must clarify what tax laws are being relied on and advise if any of these are different to those relied on in the taxpayer’s NOPA. 217. However, if the Commissioner receives a SOP that is not in the prescribed form (as described in paragraph 216) the Commissioner’s practice will be to advise the taxpayer that the SOP must be in the prescribed form. If this occurs on the last day of the response period the Commissioner will consider the resubmitted SOP under section 89K(1)(a)(iii) provided that the lateness is minimal. 218. Section 89M(6) reads: A disputant’s statement of position in the prescribed form must, with sufficient detail to fairly inform the Commissioner,– (a) Give an outline of the facts on which the disputant intends to rely; and (b) Give an outline of the evidence on which the disputant intends to rely; and (c) Give an outline of the issues that the disputant considers will arise; and (d) Specify the propositions of law on which the disputant intends to rely. 219. The minimum content requirement for a SOP is an outline of the relevant facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law. To allow the Adjudication Unit to successfully reach a decision, the outline in the SOP must contain full, complete and detailed submissions. 220. An outline that consists of a frank and complete discussion of the issues, law, arguments and evidence supporting the arguments is implicit in the spirit and intent of the disputes process. (In very complex cases the taxpayer should provide a full explanation of the relevant evidence). 221. The disputes process does not require that relevant documents are discovered or full briefs of evidence or exhaustive lists of documents exchanged. Rather, providing an outline of relevant evidence in the SOP will ensure that both parties appreciate the availability of evidence in respect of the factual issues in dispute. The taxpayer should include an outline of any expert evidence on which they intend to rely in the SOP. 222. If the Commissioner considers that the SOP has insufficient detail to allow a correct assessment to be made the SOP can be treated as not complying with the requirements of section 89M(4). 223. Subject to any order made by the court under section 138G(2), the evidence exclusion rule found in section 138G(1) prevents a hearing authority from considering arguments and evidence that are not included in: (a) the SOP, or (b) any additional information that: 43 (i) the Commissioner provides under section 89M(8), that is deemed to be part of the Commissioner’s SOP under subsection (9), or (ii) the parties provide pursuant to an agreement under section 89M(13), that is deemed to be part of the provider’s SOP under subsection (14). 224. Section 89M(6B) reads: In subsection 4(b) and 6(b), evidence refers to the available documentary evidence on which the person intends to rely, but does not include a list of potential witnesses, whether or not identified by name. 225. Pursuant to section 89M(6B), the SOP must list any documentary evidence but cannot list potential witnesses. Any witnesses’ identities will continue to be protected without undermining the effect of the evidence exclusion rule. Receipt of a taxpayer’s statement of position 226. If a taxpayer has issued a SOP the Commissioner can accept the SOP or issue a SOP in response to the taxpayer’s SOP. Furthermore, section 89N(2) allows the Commissioner to amend an assessment under section 113 after the Commissioner has considered the SOP. (However, the Commissioner’s practice is to send the dispute through the adjudication process. See paragraphs 246 to 259 for details.) 227. The Commissioner will make reasonable efforts to contact the taxpayer or their tax agent 10 working days before the response period expires to determine whether the taxpayer will issue a SOP in response to the disclosure notice. Such contact will be made by telephone or in writing. The taxpayer’s SOP will be referred to the responsible officer within five working days after Inland Revenue receives it. Upon receipt of the SOP, the responsible officer will ascertain and record the following: (a) the date on which the SOP was issued, and (b) whether the SOP has been issued within the relevant response period, and (c) the salient features of the SOP including any deficiencies in its content. 228. Where it is practicable, the Commissioner will acknowledge that the taxpayer’s SOP is received within 10 working days after it is received. However, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or their agent of any deficiencies in the SOP’s content as soon as practicable. They will be further advised when the response period expires that those deficiencies must be rectified and whether the Commissioner intends to provide any additional information to the taxpayer. 229. Where a SOP is issued outside the applicable response period, the taxpayer can apply for consideration of exceptional circumstances under section 89K. The reasons for accepting or rejecting the application must be documented and the 44 responsible officer will make a reasonable effort to advise the taxpayer of the decision in writing within 15 working days after Inland Revenue has received the taxpayer’s application. 230. As mentioned above, if the taxpayer issues a SOP outside the applicable response period and none of the exceptional circumstances under section 89K apply, the dispute will be treated as if it was never commenced. Where practicable, the Commissioner must advise the taxpayer of this within 10 working days after the response period for the disclosure notice has expired. COMMISSIONER’S STATEMENT OF POSITION IN RESPONSE 231. When the taxpayer has issued a NOPA, section 89M(3) allows the Commissioner to issue a disclosure notice without a SOP. If the dispute remains unresolved the Commissioner’s practice is to issue a SOP that addresses and responds to the substantive items in the taxpayer’s SOP within the applicable response period (that is, within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer issued their SOP). 232. However, in very rare circumstances the Commissioner may not issue a SOP in response to the taxpayer’s SOP. For example, where an assessment must be issued because a statutory time bar is imminent, an exception arises under section 89N(1)(c) or the High Court has made an order that the disputes process can be truncated pursuant to an application made under section 89N(3). 233. If there is insufficient time to provide a SOP in response the Commissioner can apply to the High Court for further time to reply to the taxpayer’s SOP under section 89M(10) if the application is made before the response period expires and the Commissioner considers that it is unreasonable to reply within the response period because of the number, complexity or novelty of matters raised in the taxpayer’s SOP. 234. Such applications are expected to be rare but can arise if the taxpayer is less than co-operative with supplying information and/or has failed to maintain proper and adequate records. 235. The Commissioner’s SOP must be in the form that the Commissioner has prescribed under section 35(1) and include sufficient details to fairly inform the taxpayer of the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law on which the Commissioner wishes to rely. 236. Section 89M(4) reads: The Commissioner’s statement of position in the prescribed form must, with sufficient detail to fairly inform the disputant,– (a) Give an outline of the facts on which the Commissioner intends to rely; and (b) Give an outline of the evidence on which the Commissioner intends to rely; and (c) Give an outline of the issues that the Commissioner considers will arise; and 45 (d) Specify the propositions of law on which the Commissioner intends to rely. 237. If the Commissioner has issued a SOP, the Commissioner can also provide to a taxpayer additional information in response to matters raised in their SOP under section 89M(8) within two months starting on the date that the taxpayer’s SOP is issued. 238. However, the Commissioner’s practice is to issue a SOP to the taxpayer towards the end of the response period to allow sufficient time for gathering any further information in response and considering the SOP’s content. This minimises the occasions when additional information needs to be provided under section 89M(8) as the information in question will be in the SOP. In any event, as any additional information must be provided within the same response period as the Commissioner’s SOP in most case it will be unlikely that the Commissioner will be able to issue additional information within the response period. 239. The taxpayer cannot reply to the Commissioner’s SOP (or any additional information provided) unless the Commissioner agrees to accept additional information under section 89M(13). AGREEMENT TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 240. The parties can agree to include additional information in their SOP under section 89M(13) at any time during the disputes process including after the dispute has been referred to the Adjudication Unit. Although there is no statutory time limit, the Commissioner’s practice is to allow one month (from the later of the date that the Commissioner issues a SOP or provides any additional information under section 89M(8)) for such an agreement to be reached and information provided. 241. However, before agreeing to a request made by the taxpayer under section 89M(13) the Commissioner will consider the taxpayer’s prior conduct and whether they could have provided the information earlier through the application of due diligence. 242. The Commissioner will usually also consider the materiality and relevance of the additional information and its capacity to help resolve the dispute and may decide to take it into account in coming to an assessment. In this circumstance, both parties will be expected to cooperate in resolving the relevance and accuracy of any such material. The Commissioner may wish to apply resources to verification and comment and this will be considered by the adjudicator. 243. If a taxpayer’s request to add additional information to their SOP is declined, the reasons must be documented with detailed reference to the taxpayer’s conduct, level of cooperation before the request was made and why the information was not provided earlier. The responsible officer will also advise the taxpayer or their tax agent of the reasons why their request was declined. 46 244. Any agreements to add further information to the SOP will be made subject to the taxpayer agreeing that the Commissioner can also include responses to the additional information to the SOP under section 89M(13), if required. 245. Any additional information that the parties provide under section 89M(13) will be deemed to form part of the provider’s SOP under section 89M(14). Thus, the evidence exclusion rule under section 138G(1) applies to the additional information. PREPARATION FOR ADJUDICATION 246. The Adjudication Unit is part of the Office of the Chief Tax Counsel and represents the final step in the disputes process. The Adjudicator’s role is to review unresolved disputes by taking a fresh look at the tax dispute and the application of law to the facts in an impartial and independent manner and provide a comprehensive and technically accurate decision that will ensure the correctness of the assessment. 247. Generally, the adjudicator will make such a decision within three months after the case is referred to the Adjudication Unit. However, this will depend on the number of disputes that are before the Adjudication Unit, any allocation delays and the technical, legal and factual complexity of those disputes. (For further information on the time frame for adjudication of disputes see the article titled “Adjudication Unit – Its role in the dispute resolution process” that was published in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol. 19, No. 10 (November 2007).) 248. Judicial comments have been made in C of IR v Zentrum Holdings Limited and Another, Ch’elle Properties (NZ) Limited v CIR (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 and ANZ National Bank Ltd and others v C of IR (No. 2) (2006) 22 NZTC 19,835 indicating that, as a matter of law, it is not strictly necessary for Inland Revenue officers to send all disputes to the Adjudication Unit for review, and Inland Revenue officers are not necessarily bound by the Adjudication Unit’s decisions. 249. Notwithstanding the above judicial comments, if the parties have not agreed on all the issues at the end of the conference and disclosure phases or to truncate the disputes process under section 89N(1)(c)(viii), it is the Commissioner’s policy and practice that all disputes are to be sent to the Adjudication Unit for review, irrespective of the complexity or type of issues or amount of tax involved unless any of the following exceptions arise: (a) the Commissioner has considered the taxpayer’s SOP for the purposes of section 89N(2)(b) and referred the dispute to the Adjudication Unit for their preliminary consideration and the Adjudication Unit has determined that it has insufficient time to reach a decision in respect of the dispute before a statutory time bar would prevent the Commissioner from subsequently increasing the assessment (see paragraph 250 for further discussion), or 47 (b) any of the legislative exceptions specified in section 89N(1)(c) apply (see SPS 08/01: Disputes resolution process commenced by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for further discussion) so that the Commissioner can amend an assessment without first completing the disputes process, or (c) the High Court has made an order that the disputes resolution process can be truncated pursuant to an application made by the Commissioner under section 89N(3). 250. Inland Revenue officers will adequately consider the facts and legal arguments in the taxpayer’s SOP before deciding whether to amend the assessment. It is expected that this will occur only in very rare circumstances. 251. Whether the Commissioner has adequately considered a SOP will depend on what is a reasonable length of time and level of analysis for that SOP given the circumstances of the case (for example, the length of the SOP and the complexity of the legal issues). 252. Thus a simple dispute could take only a couple of days to consider adequately while a complex dispute could take a few weeks. If the statutory time bar is imminent the Inland Revenue officer will consider the taxpayer’s SOP urgently. 253. The decision not to refer the case to adjudication must be made by an Inland Revenue officer with a senior level of authority in Service Delivery (for example, at the time of writing this SPS the delegation was with Assurance Manager level or above). In respect of the first exception mentioned in paragraph 249(a) it is necessary that the parties have exchanged a SOP and it is a matter solely for the Adjudication Unit to determine whether it has insufficient time to fully consider the dispute. 254. If the dispute is to be referred to the Adjudication Unit, the Commissioner should not issue an assessment or amended assessment before the adjudication process is completed unless a time bar is imminent. The responsible officer will prepare a cover sheet that records all the documents that must be sent to the Adjudication Unit. 255. The cover sheet together with copies of the documents (NOPA, NOR, notice rejecting the NOR, conference notes, both parties’ SOP, additional information, material evidence including expert opinions and a schedule of all evidence held) and any recordings of discussions held during the conference must be sent to the Adjudication Unit. 256. When the dispute is to be referred to adjudication, the responsible officer will issue a letter and copy of the cover sheet to the taxpayer before sending the submissions, notes and evidence to the Adjudication Unit. The cover sheet and letter is usually completed within one month after the date that the Commissioner issues the SOP or provides additional information under section 89M(8). 48 257. The purpose of this letter is to seek the taxpayer’s concurrence on the materials to be sent to the adjudicator - primarily in regard to the documentary evidence that has been disclosed at the SOP phase. This letter will allow the taxpayer no more than 10 working days from when it is received to provide a response. 258. Once the taxpayer has concurred on the materials to be sent to the Adjudication Unit, those materials will usually be so forwarded. However, if the taxpayer does not provide a response the materials will be forwarded within 10 working days after the date that the letter is issued to the taxpayer advising that the materials will be sent to the Adjudication Unit. The adjudicator can also contact the parties after the initial materials have been received to obtain further information. 259. Where an investigation has covered multiple issues, the cover sheet will outline any issues that the parties have agreed upon and any issues that are still disputed. The adjudicator can then consider the disputed issues and not reconsider those issues that have been agreed upon. 260. Generally, the adjudicator only considers the materials that the parties have submitted. They do not usually seek out or consider further information, unless it is relevant. The adjudicator may consider such additional information notwithstanding that the parties have not agreed that the provider can include this information in their SOP under section 89M(13). 261. However, any additional material that the parties have not included in their SOP (or is not deemed to be included in their SOP under section 89M(14)) cannot later be raised by the parties as evidence in the TRA or a hearing authority because of the evidence exclusion rule in section 138G(1). ADJUDICATION DECISION 262. Once a conclusion is reached, the Adjudication Unit will advise the taxpayer and responsible officer of the decision. The responsible officer will implement the Adjudication Unit’s recommendations and follow up procedures where required, including issuing a notice of assessment to the taxpayer where applicable. 263. If the Adjudication Unit makes a decision that is not in the Commissioner’s favour, the Commissioner is bound by and cannot challenge that decision. The dispute will come to end. The Commissioner will issue an assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer to reflect the decision. 264. If a taxpayer commences the disputes process, they can file challenge proceedings in the general jurisdiction of the TRA, its small claims jurisdiction (if the taxpayer so elects in their NOPA under section 89E(1)) or the High Court within the applicable response period if any of the following conditions are met: (a) the Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and Commissioner 49 rejected within the applicable response period and the Commissioner has later issued an amended assessment to the taxpayer (section 138B(2)), or (b) the Commissioner or taxpayer has issued an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and the Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period by a NOR or other written disputable decision and the Commissioner has not issued an amended assessment (section 138B(3)), or (c) the Commissioner or taxpayer has issued a disputable decision that is not an assessment that was the subject of an adjustment that the taxpayer proposed and the Commissioner rejected within the applicable response period (section 138C). 265. A taxpayer must file proceedings with the TRA or High Court within the two- month response period that starts on the date that the Commissioner issues: (a) the amended assessment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138B(2), or (b) the written disputable decision rejecting the taxpayer’s proposed adjustment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138B(3), or (c) the written disputable decision rejecting the taxpayer’s proposed adjustment if the challenge proceedings are filed under section 138C. 266. If applicable, the responsible officer will implement any decision made by the hearing authority and follow up procedures where required including issuing a notice of assessment or amended assessment to the taxpayer.
