This submission covers areas of interest to retail investors as follows; 1. Appendix 2 Design Issues with a Capital Gains Tax (Share) 2. Appendix 3 Questions for Submitters Chapter 5 Tax and Business 1. Capital Gains Tax on Shares. The Association believes the current provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 regarding capital gains tax on shares are adequate to capture those whose prime purpose in buying and selling shares is for a capital profit. Retail investors in general buy and hold shares long term for the dividend income either to supplement their other income or to provide for their retirement. Any capital gain is incidental to their primary purpose. We note that successive governments and their agencies such as the Reserve Bank have exhorted citizens to invest in other than residential or commercial property. A capital gains tax on shares regardless of the holding period would be yet another disincentive for retail investors to invest in shares. We note New Zealand already has a low direct investment in capital markets. In addition, most of the 2.2 million citizens enrolled in KiwiSaver will be indirect holders of New Zealand equities. Only those invested in a solely cash fund will not be affected by a wide-ranging capital gains tax. The long-term impact on their final KiwiSaver balance would be significant and substantially reduce the capital and income they have to live on in retirement. New Zealand doesn’t produce its capital requirements internally so has to rely on capital inflows to meet its needs. Capital is an internationally mobile commodity so the New Zealand taxation regime has to be competitive if it is to attract the level of capital required to produce the standards of living for all citizens referenced by the Group at page 17 Taxes and Wellbeing. A capital gains tax could impede liquidity in the market by disrupting normal trading patterns and prevent capital being utilised for its maximum return. We note the overseas experience regarding capital gains taxes are as follows; • Capital Gains Taxes are complex and complicated. • They are difficult to administer. • They are costly to administer. • As a result, they often don’t raise the tax revenue anticipated. The Association is opposed to any further provisions regarding a capital gains tax on the purchase and sale of shares.

Chapter 5 Tax and Business (a) Company tax rate. We note and agree with the statements in the paper as follows; • Falling company tax rates around the world (page 4). • New Zealand’s company tax rate is relatively high, and the proportion of company tax revenue to GDP is high (page 5). • New Zealand has reduced its rate in recent years (in 2007 it was 33%), but other OECD countries have reduced their rates by a greater margin than New Zealand, resulting in New Zealand climbing up the OECD rankings of corporate tax rates (page 14). Company tax is a cost of doing business. Companies that export must compete against companies in lower tax environments. Those companies can deliver cheaper goods and services and/or retain more net income for research and development or to reward their shareholders with higher dividends. Capital is an internationally mobile commodity and will flow where it gets the best returns. Our company tax rate must be competitive to attract and retain the capital to grow the economy and result in the wellbeing of all citizens referred to at page 17. The Association believes the company tax rate must be reduced to a level that is internationally competitive. (b) Imputation System. We note the comments at page 28 regarding the imputation system. The Association believes it would be inequitable to disallow an imputation regarding dividend income. This would tax the distributed profit twice, once as profit to the company and again as a dividend to the shareholder. As a matter of principle, we would point to Double Tax Agreements that are designed to avoid a tax payer being taxed twice on the same income. Shareholders are in effect owners of a company so the profit the company makes are their profits and should only be taxed once as they are now at the shareholders marginal tax rate. Any diminution in the current imputation system would also impact significantly on KiwiSavers especially over the long term. It would significantly alter the current actuarial calculations regarding the amount a saver would have to accumulate from their own resources to achieve a given retirement balance. In addition, we note Figure 21 on page 40 that shows the marginal effective tax rate on savings regarding companies’ distributions at 55.7% at the highest level and point to our earlier statement that successive governments and their agencies have indicated a strong preference for citizens to invest in other than residential and commercial property. The Association believes Imputation System should continue with no changes.

(c) Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) Rules and Fair Dividend Rate (FDR) System We agree with the statement at page 39 “Foreign shares are relatively highly taxed under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules and the fair dividend rate (FDR) system, whereby income is calculated at 5% of the opening value of the shares each income year. If real returns are only 3% (as assumed), this will overtax foreign shares.” We also note Figure 21 page 40 Marginal Effective Tax Rates on Savings that shows FDR at 55% at the top of the range. The Association believes the FIF and FDR are arbitrary, inequitable, complex and complicated to the point that many tax payers don’t understand the tax and are compelled to employ expensive professionals to calculate the tax. The Association believes the FIF and FDR Systems should be scrapped and replaced with a system that taxes foreign dividends in the same way domestic dividends are taxed. (d) Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) We note and agree with the statement at page 44 “The issue of some multinational corporations paying little or no tax anywhere in the world by way of exploiting inconsistencies and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules – a practice known as BEPS – is an issue that has received significant comment and concern worldwide.” This has the effect of increasing the tax paid by domestic taxpayers to make up the desired revenue shortfall. We are aware of the mechanisms multinational companies use and suggest one way to counter this is to impose a flat rate tax based on their revenue as reported for Goods and Service Tax. This would be administratively simple and difficult for the companies to avoid. We acknowledge the work that is currently underway to address this issue and that the Terms of Reference for the Group state that the technical aspects of New Zealand’s BEPS agenda are not their focus The Association believes multinational companies must be taxed at no lesser rate than domestic companies. The Association asks the Group to carefully consider the consequences of any changes to the tax regime that could have a negative impact on the future requirements for capital to achieve the objective of improving the wellbeing of the nation’s citizens.

We acknowledge the Working Group’s mandate as set out in its Submissions Background Paper (the Paper) is to examine further improvements in the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system with reference to the impact of the likely economic environment over the next decade. Introduction to the New Zealand Superannuation Fund and focus of these submissions The New Zealand Superannuation Fund (the Fund) invests money, on behalf of the Government, to help pay for the increased cost of universal superannuation entitlements in the future. The Fund is managed by a Crown entity, the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation (the Guardians). As one of the largest taxpayers in New Zealand the Fund is a key stakeholder in the New Zealand tax system. The Guardian’s submission is mainly confined to areas we consider affect the Fund, its investment partners and the citizens of New Zealand entitled to future pension benefits. Our submission is arranged as follows:  Executive Summary  Tax profile of the Fund  Weighing up tax policy proposals  Appendix I – Response to specific queries raised by the Working Group in terms of the impact on the Fund and on taxpayers more generally; and  Appendix II - Outline of the Fund’s role in contributing to New Zealand’s savings and future well-being. 2 Given the direction in the terms of reference (TOR) for the Working Group, this submission does not discuss the adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system as these will be considered as part of a separate review. Executive Summary We are an active member of the Corporate Taxpayer Group (CTG). We acknowledge and agree with the positions adopted in CTG submission to the Working Group regarding the importance of providing certainty to taxpayers, keeping tax compliance costs for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue as low as possible and ensuring that our tax system remains competitive so as to support investment in New Zealand and economic growth benefiting all New Zealanders. General comments:  Broad-based, low-rate framework (BBLR): We support the continuation of the broad- based, low-rate tax framework.  Generic Tax Policy process (GTPP): The longstanding GTPP 1 (designed to encourage early consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals and to provide opportunities for substantial external contribution to policy formulation) is under pressure with some recent reforms appearing rushed and contrary to New Zealand’s overall national interest. We encourage a review and refresh of the current process to establish a framework whereby all the Government’s policies can be taken into account on an holistic basis when determining whether or not a tax change is in New Zealand’s overall long term interest.  High hurdle for any new taxes: There needs to be a “high hurdle” for introducing new taxes outside the current very efficient and effective big three i.e: GST, personal income tax and company income tax. If the Government requires extra revenue then it should be gathered via these taxes.  Competitiveness: Company tax needs to be responsive to changes made by other countries that compete with New Zealand in export markets and in attracting foreign capital.  A firm commitment to reducing complexity and compliance costs: New Zealand tax legislation has become more and more complex which in turn has resulted in the need for continual remedial legislation to cope with unintended consequences. To address this we recommend that Inland Revenue forms a dedicated unit within Tax Policy and Strategy to deal solely with remedial legislation. In addition, we recommend granting the Commissioner the ability to issue determinations and/or regulations (subject to checks and balances) in line with policy intent. This combination of measures would improve the health and integrity of the tax system. 1 The GTPP is an approach to developing tax policy used since 1995 that aims to ensure effective tax policy development through early consideration of key policy elements as well as revenue impact, compliance and administrative costs and economic and social objectives. Consultation and feedback are integral parts of the process. For more detail > http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/how-we-develop-tax-policy. 3  Measuring Inland Revenue performance: We recommend a change from the traditional measurement based almost entirely on tax adjustments (which drives undesirable behaviours in some) to a focus on providing certainty, educating taxpayers, reducing compliance costs by getting things right from the start with enforcement remaining as a backstop for those who wilfully or intentionally disregard the law. Fund specific comments:  Fund-specific setting – exemption: Ideally the Fund should be tax exempt in line with best practice tax treatment for sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) around the world (we are the only SWF that is not exempt from tax in its home jurisdiction). It would increase efficiency by saving costs both: - Locally:  there would be no need to liquidate assets to pay tax;  there would be no need for the Fund to pay the Government provisional tax with the Government then turning around to pay the Fund contributions; and  it would result in lower contributions being made by the Government over time; and - Internationally:  the Fund would not have to work so hard to prove its entitlement to offshore SWF exemptions; and  it would bolster current foreign withholding tax exemptions given by certain foreign governments and potentially open up others.  Settings for the Fund management industry: In relation to the fund management industry we consider the current settings i.e. the Portfolio Investment Entity Regime (PIE) (in respect of Australasian equities), the Fair Dividend Rate Regime (FDR) (in respect of non-Australasian equities) and the financial arrangement rules (in respect of bonds, deposits and derivatives) work well and should remain subject to the following: - Simplifying the current FDR and PIE foreign exchange hedging regime to remove complexity therefore enabling the industry to use it. A solution has been agreed in principle with Officials. - Revisiting the current FDR setting of 5 percent which, as noted in the Paper 2 , overtaxes foreign equities.  Industry specific tax regimes: New Zealand’s current tax system was (in the main) developed deliberately and not as a matter of ad hoc reform. There are perfectly valid reasons (such as links to wider government policy) for a number of the regimes in place that would at first glance appear to sit outside of the BBLR tax framework eg: - the forestry regime (which recognises the long-term nature of the crop). This regime will be important given the current Government’s policy to plant 100 million trees per annum over the next 10 years; and 2 Refer to page 39 of the Paper. 4 - the taxation of the retirement industry which is a rapidly growing sector having to meet huge anticipated demand caused by demographic changes. There should be a “high hurdle” before seeking to make any changes to industry specific tax regimes. Any adverse tax changes would have a direct effect on future investments and current asset values. Any proposed changes should be thoroughly considered via the GTPP.  Provisional tax improvements for large taxpayers: The current settings for provisional tax payments do not work well for large taxpayers with volatile income streams (e.g. the Fund, some of the fund management industry and large exporters) and generally result in considerable overpayment of tax, high compliance costs and unwelcome high rates of use of money interest. Officials and the corporate sector have worked on an extension of the current Accounting Income Method known as the Tax Income Method (TIM) which would allow large corporates to pay their provisional tax during the income year based upon their detailed year-to-date tax calculations. Inland Revenue could consider introducing an accreditation regime similar to the one administered by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand for assessing capital adequacy. Once accredited, participants are able to use their own in-house models. We recommend that the TIM or the Fund specific provisional tax solutions discussed in our detailed submission should be implemented.  Co-operative compliance agreement (CCA): The Fund’s enhanced relationship with Inland Revenue via a CCA works well with real-time engagement and a pre-filing tax return review by Inland Revenue. This reduces compliance costs for both the Fund and Inland Revenue and provides increased certainty for both parties. We support the continued availability of CCAs for the Fund and other large taxpayers as required.  Offset of provisional tax against contributions: It would reduce transaction costs for both the Fund (in respect of realising investments) and the Government if the Fund was able to offset the Fund’s provisional tax due to the Government against the Government contributions to the Fund. We have discussed this concept with the Treasury previously and would welcome the Working Group’s support for this measure.  Investors with differing tax profiles: There are varying tax profiles amongst taxpayers (eg the Fund, non-resident investors, charities, Māori Authorities etc) which impacts on their choice of investment vehicle. Investors with a non-standard tax profile will seek to co- invest in a way which allows income to be taxed at the investor level. The Fund believes that investment alongside other types of investors, and in particular the Māori economy, would be enhanced and simplified if a corporate flow-through vehicle such as a widely- held look-through company was available. Tax profile of the Fund The NZ Government’s income arising from the New Zealand Superannuation Fund is subject to New Zealand taxation based upon the company tax rules. The Guardians, the Crown entity that manages and administers the Fund, is exempt from income tax. The Guardians breaks even for financial accounting purposes with its net expenditure being reimbursed by the Fund. 5 The Fund stands alone amongst its SWF peers in being taxed domestically. Some of the rules applying to PIEs are available to the Fund, for example a realised gain tax exemption for New Zealand equities and certain Australian equities. As a result these investments are taxed on actual distributions received. The FDR regime is applied to the majority of the Fund’s foreign investments in shares/equities. This provides us with an exemption on realised and unrealised gains and losses and actual distributions. Instead we are taxed on a deemed distribution calculated at the rate of 5% of market value. The Fund’s tax position can be volatile depending on the performance of the fund and the contributors to that performance. This is often illustrated via our effective tax rate 3 . For example, our effective tax rate was 3% in 2015, 96% in 2016 and 20% in 2017. The main driver of this volatility is how our physical global equities are taxed under the FDR regime. In simple terms, this means that in any given year if our return on global equities exceeds 5%, then our tax rate will be lower than 28%, and if our returns are less than 5% then our tax rate will be higher than 28%. Weighing up tax policy proposals It is difficult to comment meaningfully on proposals for change at this stage without knowing a) what potential policy changes might be offered up by other submitters, b) how any such change might be integrated into the current tax system and c) what the expenditure needs are to run the country and fund the transfer system. Context and design is important as is the trade-off of tax cuts that would need to be made elsewhere in the event that a new tax was introduced that materially expanded the tax base. Thank you for the opportunity to submit a response to your consultation. Please advise if the TWG requires any further information or clarification in relation to our submission. We also welcome the opportunity to provide further comments following the publication of the interim report in September and before the final report is issued. Yours sincerely Matt Whineray Acting Chief Executive Officer John Payne Head of Tax 33 As the corporate tax rate is 28% you would generally expect an entity’s effective tax rate to be somewhere in the vicinity of 28% (give or take percentage points either way). \[1\] 6 APPENDIX I RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC QUERIES RAISED BY THE WORKING GROUP \[Note: The responses below are numbered so as to align with the Paper\] 3. Purposes and principles of a good tax system What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? In terms of assessing the performance of the tax system, we acknowledge and agree with the three main principles espoused by the CTG which is that a good tax system should be built around:  High certainty, predictability and low business risk;  Low compliance costs; and  International competitiveness. These principles have a particular corporate focus but significantly overlap with the orthodox principles for considering the cost/benefit of tax reform as described in the Paper ie: efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and administration costs and coherence. The Fund supports tax policy reform being analysed in terms of the ‘Living Standards Framework’ 4 developed by Treasury. It accords with the Fund’s Responsible Investment framework and focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters. In our view, the Living Standards Framework should drive an appropriate focus on intergenerational equity/wellbeing. However, even when applying all of these worthy principles there will often be situations where trade-offs are required. In that case, tax reform should be considered at the macro level so that it appropriately incorporates wider Government objectives and takes account of what is in the overall national interest. How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? ‘Fairness’ when applied to tax is a subjective and nebulous concept. Some commentators (aided by certain media) are prone to alleging something which does not suit them (whether in absolute terms or by comparison to others) is unfair. Often this arises on the basis of misinformation because tax is complex and the rules around taxpayer confidentiality often mean that, with the exception of Inland Revenue and the taxpayer, other people are not in possession of all the facts. Consequently it would seem difficult to reach popular agreement on what constitutes a fair tax system. 4 Refer to the Paper, Chapter 3, page 17. The four capitals are: financial & physical capital, human capital, social capital and natural capital. 7 However, there are steps which can be taken to address the perception of fairness in the tax system and that is by:  educating the general public about the role the tax system already plays in contributing to the overall well-being of New Zealand;  changing the narrative/values so that the general public is supportive of the reasons for paying tax; and  ensuring any proposed policy changes are fully consulted on via the GTPP with due time given to consider the issues. In the mind of most people, the concept of fairness will extend beyond the tax system to encompass the transfer system. Provided the New Zealand tax base settings collect the optimal amount of revenue, then it is up to the transfer system to ensure that the allocated portion of the revenue is distributed appropriately to those who need it. This dual focus increases the difficulty in demonstrating that one, amongst a number of interconnected systems, is fair. 4. The current New Zealand tax system New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? The tax system needs to be agile and efficient in delivering the revenue necessary to meet Government expenditure at the lowest overall cost to the New Zealand economy. New Zealand’s current system is based upon the BBLR tax framework which is centred around GST, personal income tax and company income tax. The BBLR tax framework has served New Zealand well and is currently delivering against the Government’s required revenue needs. We would endorse continuing with the BBLR tax framework. However, there are a number of observations we would like to make in relation to the current tax system and specific areas where it can be improved to reduce its overall cost to the New Zealand economy:  The longstanding GTPP 5 (designed to encourage early consideration of key policy elements and trade-offs of proposals and to provide opportunities for substantial external contribution to policy formulation) is under pressure with some recent reforms appearing rushed and contrary to New Zealand’s overall national interest. We encourage a review and refresh of the current process to establish a framework whereby all the Government’s policies can be taken into account on an holistic basis when determining whether or not a tax change is in New Zealand’s overall long term interest rather than being driven primarily by short term revenue gain that appears overly influenced by Inland Revenue Officials base maintenance concerns. 5 The GTPP is an approach to developing tax policy used since 1995 that aims to ensure effective tax policy development through early consideration of key policy elements as well as revenue impact, compliance and administrative costs and economic and social objectives. Consultation and feedback are integral parts of the process. For more detail > http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/how-we-develop-tax-policy. 8  There needs to be a “high hurdle” to introduce new taxes outside the current very efficient and effective big three i.e. GST, personal income tax and company income tax. If the Government requires extra revenue then it should be gathered via these taxes which need to be agile enough to cope with changes in technology, the way people work and, in relation to company tax, needs to be responsive to changes made by other countries that compete with New Zealand in export markets and in attracting foreign capital.  New Zealand’s current tax system has not developed by way of accident nor been primarily driven by ad hoc reform. Certain regimes that may at first instance appear concessionary and outside the BBLR framework were implemented for sound and considered reasons. For example: - the forestry tax regime (which allows for the immediate deductibility of planting and tendering costs) recognises the long term nature of the crop (30+ years from planting to harvesting); and - the retirement sector treatment of unrealised property revaluations and resident advances used for funding developments not being subject to tax as the properties are held for long term rental and resident advances are repayable (the sector is growing rapidly in order to meet the huge anticipated demand with demographic changes to New Zealand’s population). There should be a “high hurdle” before seeking to make any changes to industry specific tax regimes. Any adverse tax changes would have a direct effect on future investments and current asset values. Any proposed changes should be thoroughly considered via the GTPP. 5. The results of the current tax system Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? It is worthwhile acknowledging that there has been a significant amount of new legislation introduced in the last several years to curb perceived excesses around multinationals, corporates and property speculation. It will take time for the effect of those changes to filter through to become empirical data. We do not yet have the data to assess the impact of all of these policy changes which makes it difficult to ascertain whether the tax system has struck the right balance. Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? The following are our suggestions for the Working Group – some points are in support of keeping the settings as they currently are. The remainder are suggestions for improvement. We are happy to supply any further clarifications as required. 9 What works well for the Fund Co-operative Compliance Agreement The Fund has a CCA with Inland Revenue which in our view is extremely beneficial in managing our tax position and obligations. The CCA allows for real time engagement between the Fund and Inland Revenue and a pre-filing review of our income tax return. In practice, the combination of the CCA and real-time engagement allows us to explore more pragmatic solutions (because we are discussing the options for the tax treatment with Inland Revenue in advance of filing) and to achieve practical certainty. From Inland Revenue’s perspective it provides full transparency and a better understanding of our tax position. The international tax rules that apply to our investments in foreign investment funds (FIFs) and controlled foreign companies (CFCs) can be exceedingly complex. Real time engagement with the Inland Revenue regarding these complexities can assist with reducing compliance costs. Fund industry tax settings - FDR The vast majority of our investments in FIFs (i.e. foreign shares) are subject to FDR. In general terms this is a simply and low compliance cost regime. At times it creates strange results for our effective tax rate which requires on-going communication with our stakeholders but it generally works well. We have noted below some refinements which would improve the application of the FDR rules (rate reduction and functioning of FDR and FX hedging regime). - PIE Exemption for Australasian Shares The Fund’s Australasian investments in shares generally qualify for the PIE exemption for realised gains. As a result these investments are only taxed on actual distributions received. This regime is simple and results in low compliance costs so is beneficial to the Fund. - IFRS taxpayer method for financial arrangements The fund has a significant number of financial arrangements with varying levels of complexity. We generally use the IFRS taxpayer method which allows the accounting treatment to be followed for tax purposes (with a few exceptions). This is a great result and saves us a huge amount in compliance costs and complexity in our tax calculation (the Fund currently has around 25,000 financial arrangements and this will only increase especially now that contributions have restarted). Suggestions for improvement Fund-specific setting – exemption Ideally the Fund should be tax exempt in line with best practice tax treatment for SWFs around the world (we are the only SWF that is not exempt from tax in its home jurisdiction). It would increase efficiency by saving costs: 10  locally because: - there would be no need for the Fund to liquidate assets to pay tax; - there would be no need for the Fund to pay the Government provisional tax with the Government then turning around to pay the Fund contributions, thereby removing the need for practical work arounds in terms of offsetting provisional tax and contributions; and - it would result in lower contributions being made by the Government over time in terms of the funding formula in the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement income Act 2001; and  Internationally because: - the Fund would not have to work so hard to prove its entitlement to offshore SWF exemptions (a number of international tax laws provide automatic exemptions to SWFs if they have an exemption in their home country); and - It would bolster current foreign withholding tax exemptions given by certain foreign governments and potentially open up others ie if it is good enough for New Zealand to tax the fund and in effect ‘claw back’ tax exemptions given by other jurisdictions, the other jurisdictions are incentivised to tax the income themselves as New Zealand will give a credit for any foreign tax paid. Fund Industry Tax Settings In relation to the fund management industry we consider the current settings noted above (FDR, PIE exemption for Australian shares and IFRS taxpayer method for financial arrangements) work well and should remain subject to the following points: - FDR Rate Reduction We agree with the Working Group’s proposition 6 that the current FDR rate of 5% is too high. We would recommend a review of the level of the rate with the view to reducing it. - FDR and FX hedging regime We have been in ongoing discussions with Inland Revenue’s Policy and Strategy group and Treasury regarding the application of the FDR and FX hedging rules. These rules were intended to align the taxation of FDR and Australasian equity investments subject to the PIE exemption (which are subject to tax on a 5% deemed dividend or actual dividends received respectively) with the hedging of these investments (with gains being fully taxable and losses fully deductible). These rules are a good example of a regime that was supported by industry but has been poorly implemented via overly prescriptive rules. As a result, the Fund has been unable to apply the rules which would be very beneficial in terms of reducing the volatility in our effective tax rate. 6 Refer to page 39 of the Paper. 11 We have proposed a legislative change to allow us (and other taxpayers) to implement the rules which would involve including a determination making power. We hope that this change makes the tax policy work programme in the near future. We are happy to provide further details in respect of this if required. Provisional Tax The provisional tax system is unfavourable for an investment fund such as the Fund with volatile earnings. The Fund’s taxable income is extremely volatile and can change markedly both during an income year and from income year to income year. The recent changes to the uplift method are useful but do not go far enough – an uplift method is not palatable following a record year in terms of our taxable income - unless subsequent earnings happen to be in line with that. For example, the Fund’s residual income tax for 2017 (upon which future provisional tax calculations are based) was $1.1bn. It seems inequitable to be required to pay provisional tax based on an uplift of a previous (record) taxable income when our year-to-date calculations indicate that the tax payable in a future year is likely to be much lower. It is particularly disadvantageous where the Fund is required to liquidate assets to pay provisional tax. Where paying provisional tax based on the uplift method is not commercially feasible, we are forced into the estimation method which requires a forecast of future earnings which also exposes us to use of money interest if we get that forecast wrong. For the Fund, achieving an accurate forecast of taxable income would involve predicting foreign exchange and equity markets, which is impossible. We support the introduction of an equivalent to the accounting income method (AIM) for large corporates. A pay-as-you-go method based on actual results to date is preferable to a method that involves using large uplifts or estimation of volatile earnings. It could be worthwhile studying the accreditation approaches taken by other New Zealand regulators such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ). The RBNZ operates the standardised approach regime for assessing compliance with the capital adequacy framework. Potential participants go through a rigorous accreditation process and, once accredited, they are able to use their own in-house models. The Fund has systems and processes in place to provide Inland Revenue with the necessary comfort that such a regime would be used appropriately. The Fund also has a high level of engagement with Inland Revenue. Alternatively, a quarterly calculation option such as currently available for PIEs could also be a useful option for the Fund. A firm commitment to reducing complexity and compliance costs New Zealand tax legislation has become more and more complex for various reasons including the changing business environment, heightened concerns by Revenue Officials in respect of the integrity of the tax base, the apparent need for Officials to achieve absolute precision and a reluctance to use existing legislative tools (such as the land taxing rules which have been place for decades and the general anti-avoidance provision). This increased complexity has resulted in the need for continual remedial legislation to cope with unintended consequences or overreach. 12 To reduce this complexity, increase certainty in a timely manner and to reduce compliance costs we submit that Inland Revenue should form a dedicated unit within Tax Policy and Strategy to deal solely with remedial legislation. In addition, we submit that the Commissioner should have the ability to issue determinations and/or regulations (subject to checks and balances) on what is acceptable i.e. in line with policy intent. An example of where this could be useful is as we have proposed above in respect of the FDR and FX hedging rules. This combination of measures, along with a change of mindset from Revenue Officials would improve the health and integrity of the tax system. (Note there has been some discussion about providing the Commissioner with a power to make regulations as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation (BT) project. The Terms of Reference specify that the Working Group should not focus on matters that are already under review including policy changes as part of BT. However, in our view the ability to solve for unintended legislative consequences extends beyond the administrative changes which are the focus of BT. Further, it is not always apparent whether something will end up being progressed as a policy change once a review exercise has been concluded and hence we have included this important item our submission). Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? Refer to our comments made earlier under #4 ‘The Current Tax System’. 6. Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address?  It would reduce transaction costs for both the Fund (in respect of being required to realise investments) and the Government if the Fund was able to offset the Fund’s provisional tax due to the Government against the Government contributions to the Fund. We have discussed this concept with the Treasury previously and would welcome the Working Group’s support for this measure.  We understand that Inland Revenue has traditionally been measured based almost entirely on tax adjustments made following audit activity therefore driving a certain type of behaviour in terms of the pursuit of tax adjustments. We submit that key deliverables for Inland Revenue should be reset to focus primarily on providing certainty for taxpayers, reducing compliance costs (for both taxpayers and the Government) therefore giving businesses more time and resource to focus on running their businesses, getting things right from the start and educating taxpayers as to why it is important to pay tax to fund Government services. Clearly enforcement will remain for those taxpayers who intentionally disregard the tax law so as to protect the integrity of the tax system and to encourage voluntary compliance. 13  Most investors prefer to use the traditional corporate model because a company is familiar and fairly simple to use. However, a company does not accommodate varying tax profiles well (eg the Fund, non-resident investors, charities, Māori Authorities etc). Using a company can result in over-taxation relative to the tax profile of the investor. As a result investment structures can become complex where investors with differing tax profiles seek to co-invest in a way which allows income to be taxed at the investor level. The Fund believes that investment alongside other types of investors, and in particular the Māori economy 7 , would be enhanced and simplified if a corporate flow-through vehicle such as a widely-held look-through company was available. Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? We do not make comment on whether there should be new taxes introduced. However, in the event that the Government was to introduce new taxes that are not currently levied, we believe that there should be a rebalancing exercise undertaken to reduce taxes elsewhere (whether fully compensatory or partially so). 7 By way of additional background, see announcement: First steps taken towards Māori Co-Investment Fund regarding a partnership project entered into between the Fund and Ngāti Awa Group Holdings Limited. 14 APPENDIX II THE FUND’S ROLE IN CONTRIBUTING TO NEW ZEALAND’S SAVINGS AND FUTURE WELL BEING 1. Introduction The New Zealand Superannuation Fund invests money, on behalf of the Government, to help pay for the increased cost of universal superannuation entitlements (New Zealand Superannuation) in the future. By doing this the Fund adds to Crown wealth, improves the ability of future Governments to pay for superannuation, and ultimately reduces the tax burden of the cost of superannuation on future New Zealanders. The Fund is managed by a Crown entity, the Guardians. Since 2003, the Government has contributed $15.1 billion to the Fund which, as at 28 February 2018, was worth $38.4 billion. The Guardians have successfully invested the Government’s contributions in New Zealand and overseas, returning 10.45% per annum, after costs and before tax, since the inception of the Fund. This rate of return is around 6.34% per annum higher than the rate of return on Government debt. Since inception, the Fund has paid $6.25 billion in tax to the New Zealand Government. The Guardians include New Zealand tax paid in measurements of the Fund’s performance because we consider it to be a return to the Crown. 2. Why the Fund exists New Zealand Superannuation is the retirement benefit currently paid to all eligible New Zealanders aged 65 or over. New Zealand Superannuation is currently funded on a “Pay As You Go” (PAYGO) basis. This means that the cost of New Zealand Superannuation in any one year is currently paid from the taxes New Zealand workers and businesses pay in that same year. Over the next few decades, the New Zealand population will age significantly. Statistics New Zealand predicts that the population aged 65 years and over will surpass one million by the late 2020s, compared with 550,000 in 2009. The 65+ age group will also grow as a proportion of New Zealand’s total population, increasing from 13% in 2009 to more than 20% by the late 2020s. By the late 2050s, one in every four New Zealanders will be 65 years or older. As New Zealand’s population gets older, the cost of New Zealand Superannuation is going to increase. The Fund was therefore established as a “Save As You Go” (SAYGO) mechanism that will help prepare for this increase and smooth the cost of New Zealand Superannuation between today’s taxpayers and future generations. The Fund will not alter the future cost of New Zealand Superannuation, but it will improve its affordability through accumulated savings and investment returns in excess of alternative funding methods. In particular, both to date and going forward, we expect the returns from our investing activities to well exceed the nominal GDP growth rate of the NZ economy, which is the 15 “return” under a PAYGO system, given tax revenues approximately grow with the rate of nominal GDP growth (absent any changes in tax rates themselves). In addition to improving affordability of New Zealand Superannuation, the Fund reduces the risks around its funding because its investment returns are a function of global economic conditions and asset markets, rather than New Zealand conditions alone, as is the case with a pure PAYGO system. 3. A long-term investor The Government will begin to withdraw money from the Fund to help pay for New Zealand Superannuation around 2035/36. The Fund will continue to grow until it peaks in size in the 2070s. This long timeframe is reflected in the Fund’s Mission Statement: “Maximise the Fund’s returns over the long term, without undue risk, so as to reduce future New Zealanders’ tax burden.” 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 201820282038204820582068207820882098 % of Nominal GDP Year ending 30 June 4. Environmental, Social and Governance One of the Fund’s beliefs is that environmental, social and governance factors (ESG) impact investment performance over the long-term. ESG considerations are therefore integrated into all aspects of the Fund’s investment activities, from investment selection and due diligence to ownership activities such as monitoring our external investment managers, exercising our voting rights and engaging with companies to improve their ESG policies and practices. The Fund has a Responsible Investment team dedicated to managing ESG issues. Projected size of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund over time

Founded in 2013 by David Farrar and Jordan Williams, the Taxpayers’ Union is New Zealand's largest taxpayer advocacy group, with more than 35,000 subscribed members and supporters. 6. The Taxpayers' Union's vision is a prosperous New Zealand, with efficient, transparent, and accountable Government. Our mission is: Lower Taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency. 7. The Taxpayers' Union is a member of World Taxpayers Associations: the global network of more than 55 taxpayer protection groups representing more than two million supporters in some 40 countries working together for lower taxes, limited and accountable government, and taxpayer rights. 8. A copy of the submitter’s most recent Annual Review is enclosed with the hard copy of this submission. Overview and objectives of reform 9. We largely support the Government's objectives outlined in the Terms of Reference for the Working Group. These are: (a) a tax system that is efficient, fair, simple and collected (sic); (b) a system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy; (c) a system that supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating; expenditure around its historical level of 30 percent of GDP; (d) a system that treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner, having special regard to housing affordability; (e) a progressive tax and transfer system for individuals and families; and, (f) an overall tax system that operates in a simple and coherent manner. (g) The Paper encourages submitters to consider which of the principles and frameworks listed on page five 1 of the Paper are "the most important" criteria for assessing the costs and benefits of any proposed reforms. Any proposal will require trade-offs in achieving these criteria. (h) Ranking these priorities in order of preference can aid in making those trade-offs, we submit they are in order of importance: 1 We respectfully submit that it would be helpful if the Working Group's future publications included paragraph numbering, especially if the future papers pose questions within the body, in addition to listed questions submitters are asked to address. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 5 (i) Efficiency: minimise impediments to economic growth and avoid distortions to the use of resources; (ii) Compliance and administrative costs; (iii) Revenue integrity; (iv) Coherence: ensure that individual reform options make sense in the context of the entire tax system; (v) Fiscal adequacy; and finally, (vi) Equity and fairness. 2 10. Equity and fairness should be ranked last because of the inherently subjective value claims required in making assessments, while the other criteria can be judged more easily on an objective basis. 11. If the Working Group are to go wider in their assessment criteria, we would support adding one more criterion: ‘Honesty and Transparency’ as a seventh criterion. 12. ‘Honesty and Transparency’ in a tax system means that taxes should avoid being artificially increased due to factors outside taxpayers' control – specifically price and wage inflation – and similarly taxpayers should not be required to pay tax on adjustments caused solely by inflation. 13. We provide further comments on this in our submissions on fiscal drag and taxes on savings and investment in sections two and four. Objectives of the Working Group 14. In our view, based on the very broad Paper and associated communications, public calls for submissions and advertising, we think there are three broad objectives the Working Group will need to decide between three possible objectives. Possible objective one: changes to the tax system to tax New Zealanders more (raise more revenue) 15. To date, most of the public comments by the Working Group’s Chair have related to new taxes, or taxing more, particularly in relation to the anticipated increase in the burden of New Zealand Superannuation, with little identification or public discussion about what taxes could be reduced (or eliminated) to achieve fiscal neutrality. 16. With the Government's guidance in the Terms of Reference for tax revenue to remain at approximately 30% of GDP, we invite the Working Group to reject this objective. 2 We note the Paper lumps procedural fairness in the broader equity and fairness category. While procedural fairness is an essential requirement for the tax system, we think this is largely about tax administration rather than the group's work in weighing up the broad objectives. We have therefore ignored this sub-criterion. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 6 Possible objective two: make tax system "fairer" (more equitable) 17. Any proposed changes to make our tax system more equitable require a pre-determined notion of how to measure fairness. Evaluating how 'fair' our tax system is, or could be, is subjective and depends on the values of those making assessments. 18. Given different people have different values and different ideas about what constitutes fairness, we submit that as an appointed, rather than elected body, the Working Group is not well placed to make judgment calls about how the tax system could be changed to improve fairness in an income equality / redistribution sense. 19. Nevertheless, where the Working Group finds procedural unfairness; inequality between taxpayers in the same, or substantially the same position, or find that the tax system is not honest and transparent (and therefore not ‘fair’) the Working Group should not hesitate in making recommendations. 20. We recommend that objective two be secondary to objective three. Possible objective three: make tax system "better" (more efficient) We submit that the primary objective of the Working Group should be to recommend changes in the tax system that make it better – i.e. less damaging to the economy, society, and individual liberties; and more efficient. What is a "better" tax system? 21. A better tax system is one that imposes fewer distortions and puts less pressure on the fundamental levers of economic growth. When we tax incomes and investment we clamp down on the incentive structures that provide for more productive jobs and higher incomes through time. 22. Based on the Paper and issues raised, there needs to be a much stronger focus from the Working Group on being ambitious and growing the economy in a meaningful way. Some households and business sectors could be made better off through changing the way we distribute the economy ("dividing the pie"), but only in a limited way. 23. By being ambitious (aiming to "grow the pie") the Working Group could improve levels of prosperity, without making value judgments about the pre-conditions for a more equitable society. We submit that all changes considered and recommended by the Working Group identify whether they are likely to result in less dead weight loss, fewer economic distortions, and more incentives for economic, wage and income growth. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 7 24. At a minimum, the Working Group should specifically take into account how new forms of taxation could impact productivity growth. 25. It has been widely acknowledged (and is discussed at length in this submission) that New Zealand suffers from poor productivity performance, contributing to a low wage environment. 26. Introducing new taxes (especially on production, or capital investment) without reducing tax in other areas could further damage New Zealand’s ability to transition to a high-wage economy. 27. The Working Group’s Chair has made clear that the Government needs to investigate new revenue streams in order to maintain social services in the presence of an aging population. 28. Leaving entitlements unchanged, an older population pushes up superannuation and health costs and shifts household income streams away from labour and towards capital, with the effect of reducing revenue streams for the Government. 29. But the Government should not implement tax policy changes today on the basis that additional revenue will be required in several years and should carefully examine re- structuring superannuation and healthcare to limit the fiscal damage of an aging population. 30. Similarly, we urge caution on making changes on the basis of anticipated technological change. For the last decade public policy makers have feared widespread job losses due to artificial intelligence and robotic technologies. So far that fear has not materialised – in fact the United States (a jurisdiction with much higher rates of capital investment, and therefore somewhere we would expect to be a precursor to these issues in New Zealand) has recently experienced record job growth. 31. While we do not object to the Working Group considering the impact of technological changes on the tax system, we submit that the baby should not be thrown out with the bathwater for the sake of preparing for a ‘tomorrow’ which might not come, or be much further away than assumed. This is particularly so if the proposed changes impose a real economic cost now. Revenue neutrality 32. We believe that new taxes should only be introduced when there are equal decreases in other taxes - i.e. reforms should be 'fiscally neutral'. 33. Revenue neutrality should be a necessary pre-condition for the introduction of new taxation. All forms of taxation cause distortions, so the introduction of new taxes in absence of reducing existing taxes imposes an additional burden on taxpayers and introduces new economic distortions. 34. We have closely followed the public comments by the Working Group's Chair, the Minister of Finance, and the Prime Minister, in relation to whether reforms adopted by the Government from the Working Group are likely to be fiscally neutral. 35. Accepting those media comments on their face value, implicit to all of the analysis in this submission is that any proposed increase in taxation will be offset by tax cuts in other areas, such that the final change will be revenue neutral. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 8 36. Nevertheless: Where new taxes (including reforms to existing taxes which are likely to increase the overall burden of the tax system) are recommended by the Working Group, we submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. 37. This submission is consistent with the Government's third objective listed in the Working Group’s Terms of Reference. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 9 Section two: Income taxation Fiscal drag: the under-arm bowling of our tax system 38. The current failure to index income tax thresholds see tax increases every year without any discussion in Parliament or the public sphere. It is, we submit, a sneaky and pervasive rust in our tax system. It raises taxes over time. 39. Fiscal drag or "bracket creep" is the result where, because of inflation - the value of money decreasing over time - individuals' incomes increase to compensate, pushing them into higher marginal tax brackets. 40. Inflations sees taxpayers' nominal-incomes, but not real-incomes, increase. Because income tax thresholds are fixed, taxpayers face a higher proportion of their income lost to income tax, without any corresponding increase to their real income. 41. Similarly, average increases in income have the same effect: over time the average tax rate increases for every cohort. 42. We believe the current approach is dishonest - it's an underarm bowl by politicians to hike taxes without having to legislate for doing so. If the Government wishes to increase taxes, it should be forced to pass legislation in Parliament, with public consultation. 43. We note that the costs of bracket creep have been significant, even in the recent low inflation environment. If inflation increases in the future, the costs of bracket creep to households will be much larger. 44. In our 2017 report, Five Options for Tax Relief 3 , we highlighted the cost of fiscal drag/bracket creep on four 'example taxpayers': (a) an 'average worker' earning $57,000; (b) a family with two children with parents earning $70,000 and $30,000 respectively; (c) a low income working earning $35,000; and (d) A professional earning $120,000. 45. As the table below illustrates, the average income earner is paying close to $10 extra per week, or $480 per year, because the Government did not adjust tax thresholds to allow for inflation since 2010. These inflationary costs are even more significant for our couple and our professional, who lose $551 and $628 a year, respectively. 3 A copy is attached. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 10 46. Ideally, the Government should go beyond indexing to inflation, and income tax thresholds should be adjusted to the growth in average earnings. This would have the effect of keeping the marginal and average tax rates faced by average income earners constant over time. No income earner who has experienced a growth in incomes equivalent to average wage growth will be pushed into a higher tax bracket. 47. Additionally, those income earners who do not see their wages grow relative to the average wage will be fairly compensated with lower average tax rates. 48. The savings this policy would create for New Zealand households are significant. As shown below, if thresholds had been indexed annually since 2010, our average income earner would now pay $1,361 a year less in tax; our professional $2,186 a year; our couple $1,916 a year; and our low-income earner $236 a year. 49. Fiscal drag has a regressive effect. As middle- and low-income earners have their nominal incomes increase through inflation, they are pushed into higher brackets. However, those already earning above the top threshold cannot be pushed into any higher bracket. The tax system effectively 'flattens', with those on lower and middle incomes pushed into higher marginal tax brackets through time. 50. Indexing income tax thresholds to inflation would ensure households do not have their tax obligations increase year-on-year purely because of inflation. That would ensure that unless the Government chose to pass legislation to increase taxes, the average rate of income tax to households would be consistent over time. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 11 51. In addition to being fair, income tax indexation should be attractive to a centre-left government for political reasons: it avoids centre-right parties being able to offer 'tax cuts' which are illusionary i.e. no more than make up for fiscal drag. 4 Adjusting for inflation would require politicians offering true tax relief to identify cuts in services. 52. Finally, income tax threshold indexation is consistent with the Government's objective to keep tax revenue at 30% of GDP over the long term. We recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Experience in Canada: No taxation without indexation 53. In the mid-1980s the cash-strapped Mulroney Government of Canada (a Government led by the Progressive Conservative Party Government 5 ) de-indexed personal credits and tax brackets. That saw government tax revenues increase over time from 1986, without having the political difficulty of having to raise income tax rates. 54. It became a left-right issue. In 1999 a study authored by Ken Battle of the left-leaning Caledon Institute called bracket creep an "insidious virus" that had "pulled more than a million low- wage workers into the income tax net, pushed 1.9 million taxpayers from the bottom to the middle tax bracket and 600,000 taxpayers from the middle to the top bracket" and that ""eliminating bracket creep is good fiscal policy and good social policy." 6 55. The Liberals 7 under the leadership of Prime Minister Chrétien, reintroduced indexation as part of the 2000 budget 8 , and it remains in place. 9 56. We would be happy to provide the Working Group, or its support staff, with further information in relation to the workings of Canada's federal income tax indexation model. Company taxation 57. New Zealand has very high corporate taxation compared to our international competitors. As a percentage of GDP, corporate income tax revenue was the highest of any OECD country in 2015. Since 1992, corporate tax as a share of GDP has exceeded the OECD average every year. 4 Indeed, this is effectively what the Budget 2017 tax relief package was. 5 Now the Conservative Party of Canada. 6 Lanigan (2015) Fighting for taxpayers; battles fought & battles ahead.

Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 12 58. The result of high corporate taxation is a low-investment, low-productivity economy. The OECD noted in their 2017 Economic Survey of New Zealand 10 : “A higher cost of capital than in most other advanced economies contributes to low capital investment. Also, owing in part to its small size, New Zealand has thin venture capital, stock and bond markets.” “Low rates of capital investment depress wages, with negative consequences for income distribution and inclusiveness.” 59. New Zealand’s low productivity levels have been in the spotlight for the last decade. In 2008, the Government commissioned an investigation into how the per capita income levels could catch up to Australia by 2025. 60. The 2025 Taskforce highlighted low productivity levels and made a series of recommendations, including cuts to corporate taxation 11 . The recommendations were largely ignored by the Government, and low productivity growth has persisted. 61. The impact of company tax rates on business investment and productivity have been widely discussed. Earlier this year Michael Reddell, former Head of Financial Markets at the Reserve Bank, noted 12 : “And our company tax rates really matters when firms are thinking about whether or not to invest here at all. And our company tax rates are high, our company tax take is high – and our rates of business investment are low. “Tax isn’t likely to be the only factor, or probably even the most important – see my other discussions about real interest and exchange rates – but it might be worth the TWG thinking harder as to whether there is not some connection.” 62. In the rest of the world, corporate taxation is trending downwards. The OECD has recently acknowledged that there has been significant downward pressure on corporate tax rates. 13 Progressive company tax rates 63. Progressive tax rates on corporate income are being specifically floated by the Working Group. The idea is that companies would face staggered income tax rates such that as income increases their marginal tax rate would also increase, with the effect that ‘small’ businesses would face lower tax rates. 64. While the idea of taxing small businesses at a lower rate sounds desirable in purely political terms there are four major issues with the policy. (a) Firstly, New Zealand’s dividend imputation system means that for companies that are domestically held, individuals pay their effective marginal tax rate on any dividends. Any 10 OECD (2017) Economic Survey of New Zealand, Page 35 11 2025 Taskforce (2009) Answering the $64,000 Question: Closing the Income Gap with Australia: First Report and Recommendations 12 Reddell (2018) https://croakingcassandra.com/2018/03/22/so-much-company-tax-so-little-investment/ 13 OECD (2017) Tax Policy Reforms 2017; OECD (2016) Tax Policy Reforms 2016 Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 13 change in the company tax rate is unlikely to substantially change the tax profile for individuals who rely on company profit streams as their main source of income. While any retained earnings would be subject to a lower rate, note that companies typically retain earnings when the additional capital is required to grow the organisation and become larger. If any retained earnings fuels capital investment sufficient to push the business into a higher tax bracket, then that capital investment is determined subject to the higher marginal tax rate, not the lower rate. The result is that for domestic business owners, lower marginal corporate tax rates may not induce additional income streams or encourage greater capital investment from retained earnings. (b) Secondly, while international investors do not receive the benefits of dividend imputation and would therefore benefit from lower corporate taxes, it’s unlikely that international capital is flowing into small businesses. International investment is subject to transaction costs (legal costs, language and communication costs, foreign exchange costs) and in the presence of non-zero fixed transaction costs, foreign investment in larger companies makes more sense than smaller companies. To the extent that international investors might purchase smaller companies, growing those companies quickly is typically the aim. The data indicates this is true. Only two percent of firms have foreign investment, while 47 percent of firms with more than 100 employees have foreign investment. 14 Employment growth is also stronger in firms with foreign investment compared to domestically held companies. 15 The result is that international investors (who, unlike domestic investors do not receive the benefits of imputation and therefore fully pay corporate tax) are unlikely to significantly increase their New Zealand holdings in the presence of lower corporate taxation for small businesses because international investment in small firms is fundamentally undesirable. To the extent that international investors do invest capital into small business, if the goal is to grow those businesses then the investment decisions are subject to the prospective corporate tax rate, not the rate the business faces at its pre-purchase size. (c) Thirdly, if for reasons of revenue neutrality, larger businesses are subject to a higher rate of corporate tax, then we should expect to see less economic growth. As demonstrated earlier, international investors prefer investing in larger firms. Placing a higher rate of tax on those investments would reduce firms’ international 14 Doan (2012) Industry Destinations of Inward Foreign Direct Investment in New Zealand, MBIE Economic Development Group 15 Fabling, Richard and Sanderson (2013) Foreign acquisition and the performance of New Zealand firms, New Zealand Economic Papers Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 14 attractiveness (and exposure) and undermine growth. Firms with foreign investment tend to be more productive and pay higher wages 16 . 65. Finally, the existing look-through company structure already provide the benefits a two-tier company tax mechanism. We recommend that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate, rather than cutting rates just for smaller businesses Company tax cuts: international literature suggests wage earners benefit most 66. Low productivity growth has contributed to low income levels compared other countries otherwise similar to New Zealand. If the Government is able to improve productivity growth, the result would be higher income levels, reducing financial pressure on households and social services. 67. Cutting corporate taxes, would make New Zealand a more attractive destination for foreign investment. Projects and investments which previously looked undesirable with a 28 percent tax-rate would become economic when subject to a lower rate. The result would be greater foreign direct investment. 68. That’s desirable because greater access to capital lifts productivity levels and therefore grows incomes across the economy. Hassett and Mathur (2006) 17 find that "a one per cent increase in Corporation Tax rates is associated with a nearly one per cent drop in wage rates." 69. Additionally, as previously noted, exposure to foreign investor pressures drives firms to become more productive than organisations with purely domestic shareholding accountability. 70. It is also important to note the global trend of falling company tax rates. By failing to cut our headline corporate tax rate, we won’t just fail to become more competitive, but may actually become less competitive over time as investors channel projects into jurisdictions which are friendlier to investors. Full expensing of capital investment: the best idea in tax no one's heard of 71. We recognise that the Working Group may be reluctant to substantially decouple New Zealand’s company tax rate with the top personal income tax rate. 72. We submit that there are other ways to lower the effective tax rate on companies and achieve the economic gains, without creating the incentives for individual taxpayers to allocate income into a corporate structure to benefit from a lower company rate. 16 Treasury (2015) International Investment for Growth 17 Hasset and Mathur (2006) Taxes and Wages, American Enterprise Institute Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 15 73. The most obvious way to do this is to allow full capital expensing. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth being the most relevant factor in determining income growth). 74. Full capital expensing was one of the major components of the recent United States tax reform legislation where many businesses can now fully expense some purchases of equipment and capital investment in the year of purchase. 75. The literature indicates that full expensing of capital investment encourages businesses to bring forward planned investment as a result of receiving a tax advantage with substantial evidence indicating that full expensing of capital spending encourages businesses to bring forward investment. (a) Ohrn 18 finds that adoption of 100 percent bonus depreciation increased investment activity by 17.5%, and over a five-year period, increased employment by 7.7%. “These results suggest that accelerated depreciation policies had and will continue to have substantial impacts on the U.S. manufacturing sector.” (b) Maffini et al. 19 find that firms eligible for first-year depreciation allowances have an 11% increased rate of investment. 76. The fiscal impact is largely temporal. Full expensing pulls forward any existing tax benefits into a single year, rather than increasing the total value of any tax benefits. 77. The effect is that the Government simply delays some tax revenue to the future, and forgoes a small level of interest of the value of the delayed revenue. We submit that the Working Group recommend full capital expensing to increase incentives for business to invest in capital, productivity and increase wages. Thin Capitalisation rules 78. In order to maintain revenue flows, there have been a series of recent changes to how foreign investors can use debt to fund ventures in New Zealand. Using debt rather than equity can give foreign investors a tax advantage because interest payments (unlike dividends paid to holders of equity) are tax deductible. 79. Reducing the degree to which foreign investors can fund their New Zealand investments with debt has the effect of increasing investors’ tax-adjusted cost of capital, which makes investing in New Zealand look less attractive. 18 Ohrn (2017) The Effect of Tax Incentives on U.S. Manufacturing: Evidence from State Accelerated Depreciation Policies 19 Maffini et al.

Currently, overseas investors can fund their New Zealand-based investments with debt up to 60 percent of the value of gross assets of the venture. Under previous rules, overseas investors were able to fund up to 75 percent of gross assets with debt. 81. Changes being proposed include caps to interest rates on loans between non-resident investors and their New Zealand operations and changes to the eligibility of liabilities for the purpose of calculating the relevant debt ratio. 82. Increasing tax liabilities on foreign investors disincentivises investment into New Zealand for reasons previously discussed in this submission. The Working Group should be careful not to recommend any drastic changes to the thin capitalization rules before any analysis is performed on the costs of reduced investment. We submit that the Working Group recommend loosen thin capitalisation rules in order to encourage greater foreign investment into New Zealand businesses, growth in the economy and wages. Businesses owned by charities and Maori Authorities – removing the loopholes Commercial business deemed ‘tax charitable’ 83. Companies owned by charities and Maori Authorities have a tax advantage over their competitors which the Tax Working Group should recommend be closed. 84. Under the current law companies owned by registered charities are liable to pay zero income tax, even if only a portion (or none) of their income is distributed to the parent charity and the business’ activity has no connection to the charitable purpose. 85. We submit that now all businesses are able to deduct for charitable giving up to 100 percent of their taxable income, the blanket exemption applying to commercial organisations owned by charities should be abolished. 86. The competitive advantage that companies owned by charities receive is that they receive a tax exemption on all of their earnings, not just the portion distributed to the charitable cause. 87. There is a risk that charities may reinvest any distributed earnings from the companies they own and therefore avoid their tax obligations. However, rules can be created to net any capital contributions from the parent charity across the tax year, and therefore avoid these concerns. We submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction to the extent of companies profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 17 Race-based tax: Maori Authorisation 88. Maori Authorities are liable to pay 17.5% income tax, rather than the usual 28%. 89. The effect of these loopholes is that some companies (for example, Sanitarium and GoBus) are able to: (a) build large cash reserves from either un-taxed or under-taxed reinvested income streams, giving them competitive advantages over other firms in their sector; and (b) face a lower cost of capital, and therefore maintain uncompetitive prices, that other firms (who don’t receive the same regulatory benefit) cannot match. 90. Closing the loopholes would ensure a more competitive environment in the sectors where these companies operate. Every firm would be subject to the same regulatory burden, ensuring they face similar costs of capital. 91. The advantage that Maori Authorities receive is fundamentally arbitrary. No business should receive a competitive advantage on the basis of blood or race. We submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 18 Section Three: Capital taxation 92. The tax treatment of capital is raised regularly in the media, primarily by people who are concerned that wage earners pay a disproportionate level of tax compared to the owners of capital. 93. The most prominent policy proposal in this space has been a capital gains tax, although smaller political parties have proposed alternative forms of capital taxation. 94. The Working Group has been tasked with investigating the introduction of a capital gains tax. 95. This submission will consider capital taxation as a broader issue across a variety of methods of capital taxation. 96. We submit that taxing capital should be approached with great caution in the specific New Zealand context. As addressed earlier, New Zealand’s economy suffers from shallow capital markets and low productivity, contributing towards a low wage environment. A capital gains tax would likely make that worse. 97. While a redistribution of tax burden from capital owners to income earners would have an income improving effect for low wage earners in the first order, there is a danger in disincentivising the capital accumulation which will be required to sustainably improve wages over the long run. Why tax capital? 98. In Capital, Pikkety argues that capital has a tendency to snowball. As a result, the owners of capital would find their net asset position accelerate through time, with the effect of growing inequality. 99. Notwithstanding the public perceptions and political claims, historical data indicates income inequality has not grown in New Zealand since the early 1990s 20 . Most of the variation over the period has been a product of housing-related costs. 100. Capital taxation proponents argue that effective taxation can limit inequality, while providing revenue for state services. 101. To the extent that we view inequality as undesirable, tax system changes that provide an improvement in wealth distribution with zero cost in economic growth might be effective public policy. 102. However almost all policies that seek to address inequality impose economic distortions that would damage economic growth. 20 Creedy, Gemmell and Nguyen (2017) Income Inequality in New Zealand, 1935 – 2014, Victoria University of Wellington - Public Finance Working Paper 07/2017 Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 19 103. To determine whether reducing inequality would be desirable, we need to firstly consider how combatting inequality might impact economic growth, and whether that trade-off would be acceptable. Inequality as a justification 104. Inequality measures the gap in income or wealth between strata in society. Those in favour of reducing inequality often use the lens of poverty reduction, but this is incorrect. 105. While inequality is often associated with poverty, improvements in absolute levels of poverty over time are not always associated with reductions in inequality. 106. In fact, as economies grow and individuals are pulled out of poverty, inequality often increases as a product of greater profit streams to investors. 107. Moving to other justifications, those in favour of reducing inequality often argue that inequality promotes societal divisions and reduces individuals’ faith in public institutions. 108. While there might be some benefits in reduced inequality if that was the result of increases in incomes of all households through time (a "pareto" improvement), this is not the typical public policy approach. 109. Public policies to address inequality typically transfer income from wealthier households to poorer households, which because it makes some households worse off, does not represent a ‘pareto’ improvement in wellbeing. 110. These policies tend to have second order effects (economic distortions, or ‘deadweight losses’) that manifest as dampened growth and therefore comparatively lower wages for all earners through time. 111. Wilkinson and Pickett 21 makes the case for reducing inequality in order to foster improved social outcomes in The Spirit Level. They claim that inequality is a major factor in determining life expectancy and health outcomes, crime rates, and educational outcomes. 112. However, many of the claims made by the authors are attributable to unjustified data selection and cherry picking. Their conclusions are strongly rebutted by Sanandaji et al. (2010). 22 113. To the extent that inequality doesn’t create negative social outcomes, tax changes shouldn’t be assessed through the lens of effects on income inequality, but rather their impacts on income strata in absolute terms. 114. Incomes at all levels are a result of productivity growth and the labour share of national income. According to the Productivity Commission, the labour share of national income hasn’t experienced a significant decline, even in the presence of structural changes to the tax system over the last 35 years. 21 Wilkinson and Pickett (2009) The Spirit Level 22 Sanandaji et al. (2010) The Spirit Illusion Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 20 115. To the extent that tax changes don’t impact the labour share of national income, the appropriate lens for examining the effect of tax changes on incomes is productivity growth. 116. Based on that, this submission will therefore specifically consider how proposed capital tax changes impact the determinants of productivity, alongside any financial impacts on households. Capital gains tax Summary 117. Explicit capital gains taxes are typically justified as a mechanism to make the tax system more progressive. Those who own assets subject to capital gains taxes tend to be wealthier, so using any revenue gained to cut other taxes or increase spending would have the effect of reducing inequality levels. 118. But as explained above, inequality should not be the primary lens for examining substantive tax changes and we will therefore consider the effects of a capital gains tax on economic growth and any flow on financial impacts on households. 119. Capital gains taxes can either be imposed on realised gains or accrual gains. In summary, the former would impose significant productivity costs, while the latter would be administratively burdensome, and a dishonest rebuke of existing principles of tax. 120. Additionally, we believe the Working Group cannot reasonably recommend a capital gains tax, given the required primary residence exclusion. Primary Residence Exclusion 121. The terms of reference require the Working Group to exclude the family home (and land under) from proposed new taxes. 122. The exclusion of the family home would materially distort any proposed capital gains tax. Any capital gain in the primary residence would be untaxed, compared to other capital gains. That provides a comparative incentive to invest in the primary residence rather than other kinds of investment. 123. That would have two undesirable effects: (a) Firstly, it encourages households to invest disproportionate amounts of capital into their primary residence. The result would be larger and more grandiose homes with reduced investment in rental properties. (b) The result of reduced rental property supply would be increased financial pressure for renters. While the data is still unclear on this effect, Coleman has shown that the effect of a capital gains tax would, in general, increase rents. 23 23 Coleman (2009) The long term effects of capital gains taxes in New Zealand, Motu Working Paper 09-13 Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 21 (c) Secondly, tax-distorted investment into primary residences would have the effect of pushing up house prices, which may reduce the ability of first-home-buyers to purchase their first house. 124. In summary, if the objective is to increase the affordability of home ownership introducing taxes on all other capital investment except the family - and thereby creating a tax incentive for New Zealanders to stash money in housing - is the very last thing which should be recommended. Investment Effects 125. Imposing a capital gains tax also discourages investment in companies which tend to deliver value to shareholders by improving their capital value, rather than distributing consistent dividends early in the organisation’s growth cycle. 126. Those companies tend to be tech focused, or more generally, tend to have a thirst for capital. Imposing a capital gains tax would disincentivise investment in these kinds of companies compared to those that pay a reliable dividend. 127. Capital-reallocation requires a liquidation of an investor’s position. Any gain in asset value over the period it has been owned would be taxed. Effectively, capital re-allocation is now subject to transaction costs as a proportion of the previous success of the stock. 128. That disincentivises re-allocation of capital to more productive investments, reducing investor returns and economic growth. This is described in the literature as the ‘lock-in’ effect. 24 Accrual or realisation? 129. One of the key issues that the Working Group will need to grapple with, if it chooses to recommend a capital gains tax, is whether it should recommend the tax based on accrual capital gains or a tax at the time of capital gain realisation. 130. Using an accrual system largely removes the problems associated with a lock-in effect. Tax would be owed whether an investor liquidated their position or not, and therefore there exists no disincentive for the reallocation of capital from investments which are expected to be low yield through to investments which are expected to have a higher yield. 131. An accrual-based capital gains tax would also provide capital loss credits to investors in the event of a decline in asset price values even if investors wanted to hold their positions, rather than liquidate their investments. 132. Any capital gains tax provides a level of counter-cyclical smoothing; however, an accrual capital gains tax more fully smooths investor positions for the reasons illustrated above. 133. However, accrual capital gains taxes are much more complex to administer than realisation taxes. Tracking capital valuations over the financial year, often pro-rata, is viewed by many as more complicated than the simple change in value of an asset from when it is bought to when it is sold. 24 Burman and White (2009) Taxing Capital Gains in New Zealand: Assessment and Recommendations Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 22 134. While the value of publicly traded assets (stocks and bonds, for example) is easy to measure across the tax year, private equity and housing, given the lack of information on a market price in absence of sale, is more difficult to assess. 135. Some difficulty would stem from individuals having an incentive to underrepresent the true value of their assets. The result would be an ineffective system where significant resources would be required to monitor households and audit a selection of taxpayers in order to provide accountability to the system. 136. One solution would be for IRD to set up a regime where investors would have the right to buy any asset reported to the state at its listed price. Individuals then have a strong incentive to report assets at a fair valuation so that any purchase at that price would not leave them materially worse off. 137. While that would offer an efficient solution to price assessment, it would likely be extremely unpopular. People often have emotional attachments to their assets (their family home, an expensive heirloom, a boat or car) and are unlikely to view a policy that allows the State to facilitate other people seizing those assets, even with financial compensation, favourably. 138. We consider accrual capital gains taxes are not honest and transparent, as defined in section one. Until an asset is liquidated, the owner has not earned any income for any appreciation in value. Punishing taxpayers for holding on to art they may have inherited, or a family home they have lived in for many years should not be part of the tax system. Sustainable revenue base: Capital gains taxes perform poorly 139. Finally, we note that one of the reasons the New Zealand Crown accounts got through the Global Financial Crisis so well, particularly in comparison to Australia, is that our Government’s tax revenues are far less tied to asset prices. To borrow finance’s measure of volatility, the beta of capital gains taxes is much higher, and makes the tax system more vulnerable to shocks. Land tax 140. Land taxes have been floated as an option to broaden the base of tax revenue. 141. Taxes on the unimproved value of land impose very few economic distortions. As land has a fixed supply and land taxes do not scale with improvements, there would be no disincentive effect on land improvements or capital investment on land. 142. That is an important benefit of land taxes: almost all forms of taxation have distortionary economic effects. Using revenue streams that don’t distort economic outcomes in order to fund cuts to distortionary taxes would be a useful tool to improve productivity growth. 143. Some sectors of society would be hurt more than others from the imposition of a land tax. Coleman and Grimes 25 (2009) note the distributional impacts of land taxes. Households and industry sectors that own disproportionate amounts of land relative to their income (for 25 Coleman and Grimes (2009) Fiscal, Distributional and Efficiency Impacts of Land and Property Taxes, Motu Working Paper 09-14 Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 23 example, retirees, agriculture, forestry) would suffer more from the tax than other groups. Land owners facing constraints on the use of land, such as heritage buildings, are also potentially unfairly hit. Nevertheless, so long as the tax base (land valuation) is measured with an understanding that the land cannot be developed in certain ways so has reduced economic value, we believe those concerns can be addressed. 144. In general, while those purchasing land after the tax wouldn’t be any worse off as a result of the tax (land prices would adjust by the present value of future tax liabilities), current holders of land would be hit both by: (a) future tax liabilities; and (b) a fall in the value of their land equal to the present value of future tax liabilities. 145. In a technical sense, the economic value of the tax can be treated as a one-off transfer of wealth from current land owners to the Crown. This is likely to cause some short-term negative economic consequences, in particular: (a) for highly leveraged households and businesses, a fall in the value of their land pushes them into a position of negative equity; and (b) transferring substantial quantities of wealth from the private to the public sector may result in a short term economic downturn as households feel poorer and adjust their spending patterns for a period of time. 146. While that might prove politically unpopular among existing land-owners, using the revenue gains to fund cuts to distortionary taxes would have the effect of lifting incomes through time. 147. In our view, a land tax should be implemented, with the proceeds used to fund cuts to distortionary taxes, like company taxation and taxation on savings However, the Terms of Reference specifically exclude any tax imposed on an individual's primary residence, including the land on which their house sits. This imposes an artificial distortion on any proposed land tax, undermining the useful non-distortionary attributes of land taxes. Without further work, it is difficult to assess whether a land tax excluding residential property (and possibly other classes of land) would have more economically distortionary effects than it would solve, even if the revenue was used to reduce other taxes. We submit that the Working Group note in its report that had they not been constrained by the primary residence exclusion, then they would have recommended a land tax to the Government with all proceeds used to reduce more economically damaging taxes, such as that on income. Imputed income taxation 148. If the Working Group wants to broaden the base by taxing capital, an alternative to a capital gains tax would be a tax on the imputed income of home-owner equity. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 24 149. Some economists claim that owner-occupied homes provide a form of income to the owner equivalent to the amount of rent they would otherwise be required to pay to live in that home and that this 'imputed income' is not currently taxed. 150. Submitters have been asked to specifically consider how the tax system impacts housing affordability. The current failure to appropriately tax home-owner equity imposes a distortion in the housing market leading homes to become more opulent and less affordable. 151. If the Government wanted to take housing affordability seriously, they shouldn't have imposed the primary residence exclusion. The current favourable tax treatment of owner- occupied property exacerbates the problem of housing affordability. 152. While this is not an option available to the Working Group as a formal recommendation to the Government (given the primary residence exclusion), but it should nevertheless be included in the Group's reports. 153. Not taxing imputed income imposes a distortion on the tax system, encouraging individuals to invest disproportionate levels of capital into the home in which they live 26 . 154. Coleman notes that this may have contributed to a trend of ever-increasing house size, although the data is still unclear 27 . Incentivizing larger and more opulent homes distorts home quality distribution. 155. This policy was advanced by the Opportunities Party 28 at the most recent election. The Party’s argument was that capital taxation can be used to fund income tax cuts, and therefore shift the national tax burden from income earners to home owners on the margins. 156. Increased capital taxation to fund income tax cuts would likely have a progressive distributional effect: those who earn income but do not have high levels of equity would receive a tax advantage. 157. Funding cuts to more distortionary taxes would also be productivity growth improving, which would then fuel income growth through time, as demonstrated earlier in our submission. 158. Much of this effect would be temporal: young people tend to have few assets compared to their income level and so would receive an advantage from moving to this system of taxation, whereas the retired elderly tend to have very little income compared to the value of their assets. We submit that the Working Group should not recommend a capital gains tax. A capital gains tax would hurt productivity growth and discourage 26 Page 40 of the Paper demonstrates the different rates of marginal taxation on savings, and correctly notes that home owner equity is taxed at a much lower rate than other forms of savings. 27 Coleman (2017) Housing, the ‘Great Income Tax Experiment’, and the intergenerational consequences of the lease Motu Working Paper 17-09 28 Available at https://www.top.org.nz/top1 Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 25 investment, without providing a secure revenue stream to the Government. We submit that the Working Group’s Terms of Reference mean that it cannot recommend a comprehensive capital gains tax, due to the distortionary effect this would have in worsening housing affordability. If the Working Group does not accept this submission, we submit that in preference to an Australian-style complex capital gains tax, a comprehensive land tax, or failing that, a tax on the imputed income of home-owner equity, is preferable. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 26 Section four: Taxes on savings and investments for retirement 159. When savings earn interest income, that interest income is taxed at the individual’s marginal income tax rate. The tax is applied to the nominal interest income (which includes inflation) rather than their after-inflation real interest income. 160. The result is that the effective marginal tax rate on interest income is much higher than the headline statutory rate. The size of the tax distortion depends on the rate of inflation. As inflation creeps higher, the tax adjusted real return on savings falls. This has two effects: (a) those saving for retirement are required to commit a higher proportion of their income to their savings in order to ensure a comfortable standard of living when they retire; and, (b) a significant contribution to New Zealand’s low savings rate. When domestic savings are insufficient to fund investment, we borrow from abroad which increases our international debt exposure. 161. We submit that the Working Group should recommend an inflation exemption for interest income, so that only the real return to savers is taxed. 162. This change would significantly increase the returns of long term savers. For example, an individual who put $10,000 into a savings account with a nominal interest rate of 5.5 percent per annum, of which 2 percentage points is inflation (a) Over a period of ten years, if the Government chose not to tax the inflation component of any interest earned, that individual would have approximately $900 more in savings than had the Government taxed the full amount of nominal interest. (b) That represents a 22% increase on the saver’s ten-year return. (c) As inflation increases, the distortionary effect of taxing the inflation component of nominal interest income increases. Holding all other variables constant, increasing inflation to 4% would increase the difference in returns to a saver to 35.5% under the two alternative tax treatments. 163. If an individual is saving regularly for the retirement over a very long period of time, there is an even larger difference. For example, an individual who saves $10,000 a year, for 40 years, deposited monthly into a savings account. As above, they earn a nominal interest rate of 5.5 percent per annum, of which 2 percentage points. (a) After the 40-year period, the individual taxed only on their real return has approximately $1,079,000, while an individual taxed on their nominal return has $165,000 less – only $914,000. That's equivalent to a 18% difference in retirement savings after 40 years. (b) If inflation is higher at 4% over the same savings period, then the individual taxed on their real returns is better off by 42.6%. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 27 164. Taxing nominal returns can have a significant impact on long-term savings. Given that many retirees depend on long-term savings to live on when they retire, a move to taxing only real returns would improve the wellbeing of many retirees. 165. Reducing taxes on long-term savings also helps working families before they retire, as better post-tax returns mean households are able to save less while maintaining the same level of long-run savings. Families with tight budgets would have more room to meet their financial needs while continuing to save enough for a comfortable retirement. 166. The net result of this change in the tax treatment of savings is a higher domestic savings rate. Higher domestic savings rates driven by tax cuts would have the effect of lifting long-run living standards. 167. Despite typical economic models not showing increased domestic savings levels in a small open economy driving significant increases in investment 29 a Treasury review of international evidence in 2011 30 found that increased domestic savings levels would put some downward pressure on real interest rates, leading to increased levels of investment, driving economic growth. 168. Additionally, a 2012 review of possible tax changes by Inland Revenue and Treasury 31 found that reducing the tax on interest income would lift savings rates and provide modest increases to GDP. 169. Further, increases in domestic savings results in less international finance being required to fund domestic investment. That would have the effect of putting downward pressure on the foreign exchange rate and increasing net exports. 170. The Treasury review mentioned above indicates there is substantial evidence for productivity- enhancing growth and innovation as a product of increased export levels. As industries become more successful exporting internationally, there are knowledge and supply-chain development spillover effects which flow through to other businesses and sectors. 171. Additionally, as we reduce our international debt exposure, interest payments overseas will fall, leading to an effective improvement in domestic income levels. 172. The net effect of these changes according to Treasury “would most likely permanently lift MFP growth rates.” The result of higher productivity growth would be higher income growth through time. We submit that the Working Group recommend that savers should only pay tax on their real interest income – inflation doesn’t make savers better off so it should not be taxed 29 Claus et al. (2001) Saving and growth in an open economy 30 Treasury (2011) Will higher national saving lead to higher GDP growth or income levels in New Zealand?

The Working Group is investigating the effects of additional environmental taxes. The specific concerns focus on water quality and greenhouse gas emissions. 174. While reduced climate change and improved water quality would improve the wellbeing of a large number of people, policies designed to combat these problems are accompanied by significant economic costs, particularly for rural areas. 175. We submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. 176. Revenue neutrality would limit the scope of economic harm from any environmental taxation, although there would still be significant distributional impact on rural areas. If environmental taxes were accompanied with cuts to other distortionary taxes, there would likely be a shift in economic output from rural to urban areas. 177. While there are significant social and economic costs associated with climate change, the degree to which New Zealand is able to make a meaningful impact may be limited. Climate change is a globally determined phenomenon, and while domestic changes may make a small impact, the cost of doing so would rest solely on the domestic economy. 178. There are other good reasons to engage in efforts to combat climate change (purely moral considerations, or concerns for international political capital), but it should be acknowledged that the economic case suffers from international collective action problems manifesting as reduced welfare for New Zealand residents (both today and into the future). We submit that any new environmental tax or water tax proposal should be subject to disciplined and transparent cost-benefit analysis. Economic impact 179. Agriculture is exposed to risks distinct from other sectors. While water pricing and emissions pricing would damage urban commerce to some degree, the agricultural sector could face widespread financial damage. Water taxation 180. Water taxes have been proposed as a tool to reduce farming intensification and improve water quality. The aim of the policy is to impose a per/litre price on the use of water, particularly for irrigation purposes and bottling for sale. Our submission will focus on the impact of a water tax on irrigation. 181. Proponents of water taxes are concerned that the intensification of dairy farming coupled with widespread irrigation use is harming the water quality of rivers, lakes and streams. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 29 182. Irrigation can increase the scope of harms to river quality from the use of nitrogen and phosphorous based fertiliser 32 . 183. While improved water quality would have some impact on wellbeing, the Working Group should carefully consider the economic consequences of reducing the scope of irrigation in rural areas. 184. The agricultural sector heavily relies on irrigation to ensure otherwise dry land is productive. (a) A paper published by NZIER and AgFirst in November 2014 33 indicated that the total value of irrigation was approximately 2.4% of GDP, or $4.8 billion in total output per annum. The same report finds that 71.3% ($1.39 billion) of net farm gate value in Canterbury can be attributed solely to irrigation. (b) The effect of a water tax would be to reduce the scope of irrigation and dampen productivity of farm land. While advocates for water taxation have tried to downplay the financial effect of any proposed tax, it should be acknowledged that the tax would only achieve improved environmental outcomes to the extent that it reduced the scope of irrigation. (c) More productive arable land provides greater opportunities for on-farm employment and off-farm employment in adjacent service towns and communities. Correspondingly, reducing agricultural productivity would have negative flow on effects for regional communities. 185. Given any tax reform should be revenue neutral, many of the economic costs from a water tax would be recouped across the broader economy. (a) Lower personal income taxes and/or lower corporate taxes to make up for a water tax may cause a net substitutive effect from rural areas to urban areas but comparing the economic costs of reduced irrigation to the any economic benefits from tax cuts in other areas is complicated. (b) Given the complicated nature of these trade-offs, as expressed earlier, any proposed water tax should be subject to a formal cost-benefit analysis. 186. We were concerned to see during the election campaign water tax proposals focusing on specific uses of water, or industries. For example, taxing water bottling appears to us unjustified, where other often more damaging uses (such as intensive dairy farming) use much more, for less economic gain to New Zealand. We submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should refrain from 32 Ministry for the Environment (2017) Our Fresh Water 2017 33 NZIER & AgFirst (2014) Value of Irrigation in New Zealand Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 30 targeting specific industries or uses of water, unless the environmental externalities of the particular use are materially different Emissions taxation 187. In relation to emissions taxation, we submit that policies should be able to demonstrate genuine reductions in world emissions, and/or increases in productivity (in terms of output per emissions unit). New Zealand should avoid imposing economic costs on itself, if emissions are simply going to be exported and any environment gain lost. 188. The agricultural sector produces significant methane emissions, which contributes towards climate change. Climate change policy experts typically advocate for either bringing agricultural emissions into the emissions trading scheme or introducing a specific emissions tax for methane. 189. Emissions taxation is only effective if it reduces the scope of domestic agricultural emissions. This could be achieved in two ways, each of which would impose significant costs on the agricultural sector: (a) Firstly, to the extent that innovation is possible, farmers may investigate breeding programmes, vaccines, and other changes in order to reduce methane emissions without changing their herd size. (b) Secondly, to the extent that innovation isn’t available or only available in limited ways farmers may choose to exit the industry or reduce herd size if their profit margins are sufficiently thin. Households finances 190. The effect of a carbon tax would be to increase fuel costs and therefore transportation costs, both for households and the business sector. 191. Increasing transportation costs would cause regressive economic effects. (a) Low socio-economic status households tend to live further out from their workplaces, drive cars which are less fuel efficient, and tend to have a larger number of children. (b) The result is that a relatively higher proportion of their income is spent on fuel, and so a fuel tax would force a relatively higher financial burden on low income families and communities. 192. Transportation costs are a significant factor in determining the total cost of producing goods and services. Increased transportation costs would be transferred through to consumers in the form of higher prices for food, clothing, and other consumer goods. 193. Much of the damage to households could be recovered by reducing income taxation, although for low income households who pay little income tax but also consume most of their income, any tax cuts may fail to sufficiently compensate any losses. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 31 194. In a consultation document published in 2015 34 , the Ministry for the Environment calculated that the cost to an average household of achieving an emissions target of 5% below 1990 emissions levels would be approximately $1270 per annum. 195. Imposing costs on low income households may be desirable if there are sufficiently large future welfare gains related to the prevention of climate change. Again though, these costs and benefits should be assessed, and taxes not imposed for moralistic, ideological, or virtuous generalisations. Benefits of environmental action 196. It is non-trivial that all policies designed to combat climate change would result in welfare improvements for current and/or future generations of New Zealanders. 197. The typical economic justification for imposing emissions taxes is that market transactions fail to account for costs incurred by parties who are external to the transaction. In the instance of emissions, the social cost manifests as climate change induced by the emission of green-house gases. Note that the social costs of greenhouses gases should be attributed globally rather than domestically. 198. New Zealand’s emissions make up 0.17% of total global emissions, while the top five emitters contribute 54% of global emissions. 199. Even major reductions in our emissions profile would create very small wellbeing improvements, given wellbeing is determined by global emissions levels. 200. However domestic efforts may not translate into global improvements. (a) Imposing emissions costs and sanctions on local industry may shift production to other states with more relaxed environmental regulation. (b) The New Zealand regulatory environment is too small to shift global demand for agricultural products or fuel. (c) The result is that as we reduce domestic production in agriculture and fuel, foreign markets will respond to global demands and expand production. (d) This result (carbon leakage) could significantly reduce the scope of any reductions in global emissions from domestic policy settings. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, we submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. 34 Ministry for the Environment (2015) New Zealand’s Climate Change Target Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 32 Section six: Behavioural taxes 201. The Working Group has signalled an interest expanding the scope of behavioural taxes. We oppose an expansion of the use of behavioural taxes. They are generally poor in achieving their stated aims and impose significant financial costs on low income households. We submit the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. 202. Specifically: (a) We oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. (b) We oppose increases to tobacco excise. Sugar taxes 203. We submit that the Working Group should recommend against implementing a sugar tax. 204. International evidence shows that sugar taxes (specifically taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages) are not effective in achieving their stated health goals. 205. In 2015, we released a report, Fizzed Out, which demonstrated the failure of a sugary drinks tax to reduce consumption levels in Mexico. The Nielsen sales data we released showed that the sugar tax only induced a 0.2% reduction in consumption. A copy of the report is appended to this submission. 206. NZIER prepared a literature review for the Ministry of Health in 2017 which showed that “the evidence that sugar taxes improve health is weak.” The authors clearly articulate the problem in making public policy based on weak evidence in the conclusion of their report “If taxes did not have economic costs, through deadweight losses and implementation costs, then even a slight causal link between a tax and an improvement in health outcomes might be justified. That, however, is not the case.” 207. Andalon and Gibson (2017) 35 found the own-price elasticity of quantity demand for sugar sweetened beverages in Mexico was much lower (-0.2 to -0.3) than had been expected (-1.0 to -1.2) when the Mexican sugar tax was implemented. (a) A lower price elasticity of demand implies consumers respond less strongly to the imposed tax, and therefore the tax induces weaker health outcomes than expected. 35 Andalon and Gibson (2017) The ‘Soda Tax’ is Unlikely to Make Mexicans Lighter, Institute of Labour Economics Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 33 (b) The authors find that the tax would cause an average weight loss of 400 grams per person. 208. To the extent that sugar taxes don’t deliver good health outcomes, we should avoid imposing additional costs on taxpayers, especially low socio-economic status households. (a) Consumption taxes tend to be regressive because low socio-economic status families tend to consume a higher proportion of their income compared to wealthier families. (b) Additionally, low socio-economic status families tend to spend a higher proportion of their income on foodstuffs than wealthier families. (c) The result is that sugar taxes put more financial pressure on the families who are least able to afford them. Tobacco excise 209. We submit that the Working Group should recommend that the Government halts all increases to tobacco excise and instead legalise nicotine fluid for e-cigarettes and other non- smoke alternatives. These technologies provide an alternative for smokers and have far reduced negative health effects. 210. Tobacco excise imposes significant financial burdens on the communities least able to afford tax increases, while failing to achieve its principal goal of reducing smoking prevalence. 211. In our report, Up in Smoke, released on 1 January 2018, updated our earlier report, Passive Income: How the Government users smokers as cash cows. In the reports we demonstrated the significant social costs of increasing tobacco excise. Copies of both reports are attached to this submission. (a) Despite tobacco excise increasing by more than 60% since 2012, only one in ten adult smokers quit. Among Maori and Pasifika there has been no statistically significant change in smoking rates over the last decade. (b) A pack-a-day smoker is worse off by nearly $3,000 a year in real terms compared to 2010. Given smoking is more prevalent in low socio-economic communities, tobacco excise increases have the effect of hollowing out the budgets of the most vulnerable families. (c) Tobacco excise increases have been associated with significant growth in targeted robberies of dairies and convenience stores. (i) While the Police haven’t recorded statistics on any relationship between the targeting of tobacco and burglaries or robberies, robberies in general have increased 26.6% since 2014. (ii) There has been significant media coverage of the relationship between excise increases and robberies, causing the Government to fund security measures for dairy and convenience store owners concerned for their safety.

If the sale of e-cigarettes and other alternatives were legalised, addicted smokers would be able to move to an alternative that causes them far reduced negative health effects. Instead, with no alternatives available, addicted smokers suffer under the financial burden of ever- increasing tobacco excise, causing many to rely on the black market. We submit the Working Group recommend the legalisation of smokeless nicotine alternatives to cigarettes, in preference to continued tobacco tax hikes. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 35 Section seven: Varying GST 213. Just as some groups advocate for increased excise taxes and expanding behavioural taxes to sugar and fat, other groups advocate for removing or reducing GST on some goods and services. We submit the Working Group should acknowledge that our system of GST is the envy of the world and recommend against any changes to our broadly applied and uniform rate of GST. 214. There is very little justification for changing the nature of GST. (a) Our GST system is simple, and easy to collect and administer. (b) While it’s appealing to choose to tax ‘merit’ goods less, and ‘demerit’ goods more, GST is an inefficient vehicle for enacting market or social changes. (i) Varying GST for different goods would create significant administrative burdens for IRD and businesses. (ii) Removing GST on fruit and vegetables, for example, would require IRD to classify what a fruit or vegetable is (“Are frozen chips vegetables? If not, what about other frozen vegetables?”), then audit businesses according to their classifications. (iii) Businesses who sell goods with different rates of GST would be faced with increased administrative burden in calculating their tax obligations. (iv) Any change in GST classifications over time would force businesses to spend time changing their accounting systems. (c) Eric Crampton of the New Zealand Initiative notes 36 : “Under the current beautiful broad-base, low-rate system, companies gather all their receipts for everything they purchased when making things and claim the GST on them. They then charge GST on the full value of their final product. Their net GST is on the value they added to their inputs along the way, since they netted out the GST from the inputs. Nice, clean and easy.” “There are worthy causes innumerable. But if government is to fund them, it is almost always best to do it from general tax revenues. The overall tax system is already designed to balance equity and efficiency – to place the burden where it can most easily be borne.” 36 Crampton (2017) Outside the Asylum Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 36 215. While we don’t support them, even direct subsidies of goods and services would be preferable to making changes to our GST system in order to favour some goods and services over others. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 37 Section eight: Tax treatment of cryptocurrencies 216. We submit that IRD guidance on cryptocurrencies needs to be rewritten to reflect the true nature of technology and the Working Group should recommend this. Current IRD guidance incorrectly treats cryptocurrency as property. 217. The Working Group should recommend IRD conduct a review of their current tax guidance. 218. The current tax guidance of cryptocurrency is as follows: (a) IRD treats cryptocurrencies as property, not currency, for the purposes of tax. (b) If a business receives payment in a cryptocurrency, it is liable to pay tax on that income stream in equivalent NZD. (c) If an individual has bought cryptocurrency with the intent to dispose at a later date (for example, speculating on future price increases with an expectation of a future sale) then they will be liable to pay tax on any realised capital gain. 219. The major problem is related to how IRD views those who purchase cryptocurrency. IRD assumes that cryptocurrency does not provide benefits outside of its disposal, and therefore treats holders of cryptocurrency as speculators. The specific language is as follows: “Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies generally don’t produce an income stream or provide any benefits, except when they’re sold or exchanged. This strongly suggests that cryptocurrencies are generally acquired with the purpose to sell or exchange them.” 220. This is an incorrect interpretation of the use of cryptocurrencies as there are a variety of cryptocurrencies which do either produce income streams or provide other useful benefits. 221. For example, proof-of-stake currencies reward holders of coins with a form of interest. While bitcoin employs a ‘mining’ approach, where the solution of complex computational problems earns ‘miners’ additional coins, some cryptocurrencies simply reward those who hold coins with additional coins, scaled to the number of coins they hold. 222. Cryptocurrencies are increasingly used for purposes other than alternative currency use. 223. Golem 37 , a cryptocurrency founded in Poland, is a tool for allocating computing power from those who have spare computational capacity, to those who need greater computing power. An individual who purchases coins with the intention of accessing greater computing power for a project should not be assumed to be a speculator. 224. Another cryptocurrency, Augur 38 is prediction market software which employs ‘reputation tokens’ (REP, a form of cryptocurrency) in order to authenticate events. An individual who 37 https://golem.network/ 38 http://www.augur.net/ Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 38 chooses to hold REP in order to authenticate events on Augur prediction markets is not holding REP with speculative intent and should not be taxed as such. 225. We submit that the tax treatment of cryptocurrency should reflect the true nature of each cryptocurrency, rather than a one-treatment-fits -all approach. The tax treatment should be a fair reflection of the use of the assets. 226. A failure to do so may discourage uptake of cryptocurrencies as useful tools in distributed computing, prediction markets, and an array of other instances where blockchain authentication would be valuable. We submit that the Working Group should recommend IRD guidance on cryptocurrencies be rewritten to reflect the true nature of technology and avoid deeming all cryptocurrency as property.

The Working Group has asked submitters to specifically answer the following five questions: (a) What does the future of tax look like to you? (b) What is the purpose of tax? (c) Are we taxing the right things? (d) Can tax make housing more affordable? (e) What tax issues matter most to you? 2. We believe we have answered these questions in the main part of our submission, however, we will offer brief, specific remarks below. 3. “What does the future of tax look like to you?” (a) We submit that our tax system needs to be more ambitious. The future of tax is a system where our specific mix of taxes is tailored towards encouraging higher levels of growth and investment. (b) The current system overtaxes corporate earnings and investment. That makes it more difficult for businesses to invest and grow, with then inevitable result that productivity and incomes in New Zealand are much lower than other countries with similar historical experiences. (c) The future of tax includes the following specific submissions to the Working Group: (i) indexation of income tax thresholds to growth in average earnings (or at minimum, inflation); (ii) allowing full expensing of capital investment in the year of purchase; (iii) an end to the favourable tax status of companies owned by charities and Maori Authorities; (iv) no capital gains tax; (v) an inflation tax exemption on interest earnings so that savers are only taxed on their real interest income; and, (vi) an end to tobacco excise increases, and no new lifestyle taxes. 4. “What is the purpose of tax?” Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 40 (a) To raise enough revenue to provide efficient and effective public services, with as few economic distortions as possible. 5. “Are we taxing the right things?” (a) Our submission covers the major changes we would like to see to the tax system. (b) We have included these changes in our answer to the first question. 6. “Can tax make housing more affordable?” (a) Some tax changes can improve housing affordability, although some tax changes will make it more difficult to buy a house. (b) A capital gains tax would not make housing more affordable – in fact for renters, their cost of housing would likely increase with any form of capital gains tax. (i) Any capital gains tax with a primary residence exemption would distort the housing quality distribution and increase housing costs, as outlined in the main portion of our submission. (ii) We submit that the Working Group should refrain from recommending a capital gains tax. Not only would a capital gains tax worsen housing affordability, but it would damage productivity growth, and therefore income growth for all households. (c) Any tax changes that increase incomes through time will make housing more affordable by lifting the income available to families to buy a house. (d) Tax system changes that undermine future income growth will make it comparatively more difficult for families to enter the housing market. 7. “What tax issues matter to you the most?” (a) Firstly, as outlined in our main submission, our tax system should always seek to be as ‘Honest and Transparent’ as possible. (i) Fiscal drag and the inflation tax on savings and investment both have the effect of squeezing more out of the pocket of New Zealanders when they haven’t been made any better off. (ii) This is a dishonest and opaque approach to tax increases. If the Government wants to tax families more, they should have to pass legislation and consult with the public. (b) Secondly, our tax system should seek to be as efficient as possible and impose as few economic distortions as possible. (i) The Working Group should carefully consider our woeful track record in productivity growth when they recommend any changes to the Government. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 41 (ii) As outlined in our submission, there is plenty of room to make our tax system more efficient and encourage investment and growth. (iii) However, many changes being considered would also make our tax system less efficient. (iv) Capital gains taxes (especially with a primary residence exclusion), progressive business tax rates, varying rates of GST, and certain forms of environmental taxation all create significant distortions that would further undermine our productivity performance. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 42 Appendix 2: Key submissions 1. We submit that the primary objective of the Working Group should be to recommend changes in the tax system that make it better – i.e. less damaging to the economy, society, and individual liberties; and more efficient. 2. We submit that all changes considered and recommended by the Working Group identify whether they are likely to result in less dead weight loss, fewer economic distortions, and more incentives for economic, wage and income growth. 3. Where new taxes (including reforms to existing taxes which are likely to increase the overall burden of the tax system) are recommended by the Working Group, we submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. 4. We recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. 5. We recommend that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate, rather than cutting rates just for smaller businesses 6. We submit that the Working Group recommend full capital expensing to increase incentives for business to invest in capital, productivity and increase wages. 7. We submit that the Working Group recommend loosen thin capitalisation rules in order to encourage greater foreign investment into New Zealand businesses, growth in the economy and wages. 8. We submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction to the extent of companies profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. 9. We submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. 10. We submit that the Working Group note in its report that had they not been constrained by the primary residence exclusion, then they would have recommended a land tax to the Government with all proceeds used to reduce more economically damaging taxes, such as that on income. 11. We submit that the Working Group should not recommend a capital gains tax. A capital gains tax would hurt productivity growth and discourage investment, without providing a secure revenue stream to the Government. 12. We submit that the Working Group’s Terms of Reference mean that it cannot recommend a comprehensive capital gains tax, due to the distortionary effect this would have in worsening housing affordability. If the Working Group does not accept this submission, we submit that in preference to an Australian-style complex capital gains tax, a comprehensive land tax, or failing that, a tax on the imputed income of home-owner equity, is preferable. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 43 13. We submit that the Working Group recommend that savers should only pay tax on their real interest income – inflation doesn’t make savers better off so it should not be taxed 14. We submit that any new environmental tax or water tax proposal should be subject to disciplined and transparent cost-benefit analysis. 15. We submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should refrain from targeting specific industries or uses of water, unless the environmental externalities of the particular use are materially different. 16. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, we submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. 17. We submit the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. 18. We submit the Working Group recommend the legalisation of smokeless nicotine alternatives to cigarettes, in preference to continued tobacco tax hikes. 19. We submit the Working Group should acknowledge that our system of GST is the envy of the world and recommend against any changes to our broadly applied and uniform rate of GST. 20.

To engage further, please contact Colin McKinnon, Executive Director on \[1\] \[1\] Page | 3 INTRODUCTION The New Zealand Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (“NZVCA”) welcomes the Working Group’s review of the NZ tax system. The NZVCA wishes to make submissions on several areas we believe are key to a successful and internationally competitive tax system. However, it is first useful to provide the context and principle behind which this submission is made. At its simplest level, the NZVCA is here to support: the availability of capital, both monetary and human, to New Zealand’s growing businesses, to encourage confidence and increase investment. BACKGROUND Private capital is essential to the growth of New Zealand businesses both at the start-up phase and as businesses mature. The primary engines of growth in developed economies involve innovation and its successful commercialisation. Creating a positive regulatory and tax environment for private markets, especially in respect of early stage companies is critically important for the future of the New Zealand economy. Growth capital is important for growing and financing NZ’s physical capital and also for developing our human capital. Investment in NZ businesses and innovation provides opportunities for development of knowledge and skills for our people, particularly in emerging technologies and new industries. Barriers to capital flows have a disproportionate effect on growth companies, which are often unable to raise capital by other means and rely heavily on domestic and foreign private capital investment. The availability and accessibility of investment capital is vital to the expansion of innovation and technology in the New Zealand economy. As well as the importance of capital availability and accessibility, New Zealand’s tax system should also take a considered and consistent approach across the entire investment life-cycle. Tax should not artificially increase the cost of capital throughout the term of an investment or distort investment or reinvestment decisions by acting as a barrier to innovation and technology. When evaluating our tax system, we should have regard for many aspects that are currently fit for purpose. But the evaluation of our tax system cannot occur in a vacuum. Our tax system needs to be fit for purpose for New Zealand but also be competitive by international standards. The NZVCA is dedicated to improving private investment and increasing the openness to and availability of growth capital in the New Zealand market. We believe that tax should not distort or be a primary driver of investment choices, particularly in areas where new capital and expertise from investors are often the key driver of business growth. Our tax system needs to be structured to ensure that incentives to invest in New Zealand are correctly aligned which brings benefits for all aspects of NZ’s capital – physical, human, cultural and natural capital. Page | 4 KEY SUBMISSIONS The NZVCA makes the following submissions: Recommendation: Retain limited partnership vehicles and imputation credits system. • The recent introduction of limited partnership vehicles into New Zealand has been instrumental in bringing our system into line with international norms. There has been a significant uptake of limited partnerships in a wide range of circumstances and has encouraged foreign investors to engage with New Zealand businesses. • Our imputation credit system is an aspect of the tax system which New Zealand should look to retain and even expand. Removing double taxation for domestic and foreign investors is paramount to retaining more available capital for the growth of NZ business. NZVCA also supports a move toward fuller recognition of imputation and franking credits with Australia and considers that a full mutual recognition policy would enhance the move towards a Single Economic Market with Australia. Recommendation: Introduce a business continuity test to supplement loss continuity rules. • NZVCA recommends the introduction of a ‘business continuity’ test for all taxpayers which would replace or supplement the existing loss continuity rules. If this test is not adopted for all companies across the board, specific consideration should be given to adopting this type of test for start-up and growth companies. • Start-up and growth companies are particularly likely to incur losses early in their life-cycle and it discourages investors to commit to companies which may require future capital injections from outside investors if they know they will not be able to get any future benefit from tax losses arising. Recommendation: Review the taxation of intellectual property with a view to provide further incentives to develop and retain intellectual property in New Zealand. • A key concern for the NZVCA is to ensure that our tax regime is appropriate to encourage investment in intellectual property in NZ. Economic growth in the developed world is becoming increasingly reliant on IP innovators who attract capital and create highly skilled jobs in the economy. • New Zealand’s current taxation of IP is in danger of being seen as penalising IP innovators. Significant progress must be made to align our regime with international norms so at the very least New Zealand’s taxation of IP is seen as neutral rather than a negative factor. • In particular the NZVCA believes that the transfer of patents outside New Zealand should not be taxable as this encourages patent to be stripped from New Zealand before any real value has been generated, taking innovation, jobs and profits out of our ecosystem earlier than might otherwise be the case. Page | 5 Recommendation: New Zealand needs further tax incentives to invest in research and development • Investment in research and development represents a significant capital risk as costs are high and there is no guarantee of a profitable return. New Zealand’s tax regime currently does not provide enough incentives to carry out research and development in New Zealand. • The NZVCA welcomes the introduction of a new research and development tax credit but believes that the system will be fundamentally flawed if the tax credit is not refundable in a timely manner. Recommendation: If New Zealand is to adopt a capital gains tax it must be competitive internationally • If NZ is to adopt a capital gains tax (“CGT”) one of the key considerations in designing this tax should be to produce a system that is competitive internationally, and particularly with Australia. The ultimate aim and principle which the NZVCA supports is in seeking to retain and increase the availability of capital for NZ’s future leading growth businesses, not stifling that availability further. • We have outlined several features of a CGT that we believe would make it internationally competitive as well as ensuring that tax does not distort investment or reinvestment decisions over the term of an investment. These features include roll-over relief, taper relief/long-term holdings relief and concessions for certain venture capital investment. Ultimately, a key aspect to being a supporter of NZ’s future businesses and their growth, is to have consistency, simplicity and certainty as a key tenet of any regulatory policy, not just tax policy. In considering its approach to tax policy, the NZVCA reinforces to the TWG this fundamental principle to ensure that businesses are doing just that – driving NZ’s future world beating businesses forward, not caught up in complex and administrative tax compliance matters. Page | 6 Recommendation: The NZVCA would like to see limited partnerships and our imputation system retained Limited partnerships The relatively recent introduction of limited partnerships into the vehicles available for investment into New Zealand has been a significant step in aligning New Zealand’s investment system with international norms. Limited partnerships are beneficial to many investors because they allow for look-through taxation through an entity that provides a liability shield. Where there are mixed investor bases, including both domestic, foreign investors, and in some cases tax exempt investors, limited partnership vehicles bring New Zealand into line with international investment norms and flexibility. Foreign sourced income derived by non-residents through limited partnerships is ignored for NZ income tax purposes, while NZ sourced income is still captured and appropriately taxed, meaning limited partnerships are an effective investment vehicle. They also allow for domestic investors to be taxed in their own right, and at their own rate, rather than under a corporate vehicle at a fixed rate, removing complexity and inefficiency in many investment scenarios, and providing significant flexibility particularly in joint venture scenarios. While the NZVCA believes that there are a number of ways the limited partnership model could be improved in New Zealand, we believe the shift to this model has significant benefits that New Zealand is only just beginning to realise. There has been a significant uptake of limited partnerships in a wide range of circumstances and this has encouraged foreign investors to engage with New Zealand businesses. We recommend the current tax settings for limited partnerships be retained. Imputation credits New Zealand is one of the few countries in the world that has an imputation credit regime. The NZVCA believes that this is an innovative part of our tax system which we believe should be retained going forward. Our imputation credit system has a number of key benefits including; removing double taxation which creates a single layer of tax and encourages the pay-out of dividends; and reducing the cost of capital for investors. The imputation system effectively eliminates double taxation domestically, and to some extent internationally, by giving shareholders a credit for the tax which has been paid by the company. As a general principle our tax system should aim to minimise double taxation as much as possible. The NZVCA believes that the imputation regime could be improved by allowing some credits to be refundable in some situations and by improving the level of integration with the Australian franking credit system. In Australia individuals can in certain circumstances receive a refund for franking credits which exceed their taxable income. This means that imputation credits are not ‘wasted’ – i.e. no tax is paid that does not relate to taxable income received by the shareholder. Consideration should also be given to the question of refundability of imputation credits to domestic tax exempt investors. Page | 7 The level of integration with the Australian franking credit system should also be increased. While New Zealand and Australia have adopted a trans-Tasman imputation regime, this regime is unnecessarily complex, has significant compliance obligations and provides often only modest benefits to shareholders as credits cannot be streamed. This regime could be significantly improved to allow full and mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits. Recommendation: Introduce a business continuity test to supplement loss continuity rules. NZVCA recommends the introduction of a ‘business continuity’ test for all companies which would replace or supplement the existing loss continuity rules. If this test is not adopted for all companies across the board, specific consideration should be given to adopting this type of test for start-up and growth companies. Start-up and growth companies are particularly likely to incur losses early in their life-cycle and it discourages investors to commit to companies which may require future capital injections from outside investors if they know they will not be able to get any future benefit from tax losses arising. Many international jurisdictions have adopted variations of the business continuity test including Australia, Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom. The test generally focusses on whether the business of the loss company has remained the same or of a similar nature throughout a set period. A business that satisfies the test is able to carry forward tax losses throughout the period it has retained business continuity regardless of any shareholding changes. In many countries (e.g. Australia) the business continuity test is an alternative test i.e. if the company fails the shareholder continuity test then it may apply the same business test. Australia has recently modified its same business test to include a ‘similar business test.’ The similar business test does not require the loss company to carry on the same ‘type’ of business but instead focuses on: • The extent to which the assets used by the company to generate assessable income is the same, regardless of whether the assets are producing different income; • The extent to which current activities and operations are the same; • Whether the ‘identity’ of the business has changed; • The extent to which the changes to the business resulted from development or commercialisation of assets, products, processes, services, marketing or organisational methods of the business. New Zealand’s current loss continuity rules unfairly punish start-up and growth companies. These companies often accumulate early tax losses as they set up business operations and complete research and development on new products or services. These companies also generally require Page | 8 significant capital investment throughout the growth process and in order to expand into new markets or gain more market share. These capital investments may lead to a breach of the shareholder continuity threshold before the company has made any profit. Under current rules, the company’s losses are forfeited and the company obtains no value for them. Existing loss continuity rules have several negative effects for start-up and growth companies: • High compliance costs, because recording shareholding changes can be complicated, particularly for small or new businesses with little legal or administrative experience. • Investors are more likely to invest through structures such as look-through companies or limited partnerships where losses are able to be utilised immediately. These structures may not be best suited to the business needs and may not be well understood by the relevant shareholders. • Investors are more likely to invest in companies which are considered ‘safer’ investments and/or will require fewer capital injections at later stages, because this allows investors to maintain continuity and utilise accumulated losses. This results in a loss of diversity in the type and scope of investments made into the market. Investment is driven by tax considerations rather than solely by the viability and profitability of the start-up or growth company. • Investment is less likely to flow into certain areas, for example biotechnology. Developments in this area are extremely costly and often necessitate stages of development and which require increased investment in each stage. As a result, any early losses will be forfeited as the project passes through development. • Medium and smaller sized investors are discouraged from investment in start-up and growth companies as they often must invest in concert with other small and medium sized investors. This makes breaches in loss continuity more likely and medium sized businesses are less able to bear the cost of loss forfeiture. • Finally, for those founders / entrepreneurs who have started these businesses, the loss continuity rules also deter them from taking on new capital and investment into their businesses from outside investors, due to their reticence to forfeit the business losses. This impedes the growth of such businesses and results in tax being a negative factor that is considered by founders, at the very time when taking on new capital and new partners to help innovate, challenge and grow those businesses should be the only focus. We note that the current tax regime does allow for the carry forward of certain R&D expenditure and cashing out of some R&D related losses which go some small way to mitigate the problems discussed Page | 9 above. However, these regimes are restricted to specific expenditure, subject to strict caps, not well understood by taxpayers and are difficult to apply. One arguable benefit or outcome of the current loss regime is that it may encourage founders/owners/entrepreneurs to retain their business in its initial ownership structure, retaining and building more value within NZ throughout that period. Taking loss forfeiture into account, a business may be worth more to current owners on a post-tax basis than to potential purchasers. This may result in owners retaining ownership until existing losses are utilised or their business value to potential purchasers has increased substantially. NZVCA does not consider this arguable benefit sufficient justification for the continued use of the existing shareholder continuity test. As noted in the final bullet above, tax should not be a primary driver of investment choices, particularly in an area where new capital and expertise from investors are often the key drivers of business growth and development. We run the risk of becoming a conservative, rather than fast-paced innovation environment. More importantly, the NZVCA considers that our current loss continuity rules puts New Zealand at a disadvantage for attracting capital into new and developing areas. Investors are easily able to move capital particularly between New Zealand and Australia and our system means they are less likely to invest in these types of ventures in New Zealand. It also has an impact on our human capital, where entrepreneurs and innovators are encouraged to go to Australia, Asia and the US as there is greater capital available there for early stage venture capital. Recommendation: Review the taxation of intellectual property with a view to provide further incentives to develop and retain intellectual property in New Zealand Intellectual property is becoming increasingly important in developed economies around the world. The amount of value added to economies by IP is growing and the number of jobs and opportunities created by IP-based developments is expected to continue to grow. From a human capital perspective, jobs in sectors which are reliant heavily on IP (such as technology) are highly coveted and can be extremely competitive. IP innovators are key to attract capital investment to NZ businesses and creating highly skilled jobs in the economy. In certain industries, for example technology and design, intellectual property can be the primary source of a company’s business value. Even though IP is easily moved between jurisdictions, companies in these innovative industries tend to build off one another and cluster in geographic areas such as Silicon Valley. In New Zealand we have seen a similar phenomenon in the film industry with companies flocking to Miramar as a result of Peter Jackson’s leadership in the film industry and associated companies that have arisen from opportunities in this market. It is important to establish New Zealand as a place where such IP innovations can flourish, and not be behind international jurisdictions, as once these geographical clusters of innovations are established overseas it may be more difficult to entice these types of innovations to come to New Zealand or Page | 10 indeed for our own innovators to stay and develop their ideas in New Zealand. It is crucial therefore for New Zealand to position itself and build a reputation as an IP innovator. A key concern for the NZVCA therefore is to ensure that our tax regime is appropriate to encourage investment in IP in NZ. We acknowledge that tax is not the only, and in fact should not be the most influential driver of where IP innovation occurs. But that does not mean that it is not important and should not be used, in conjunction with other policy initiatives to encourage investment in IP in New Zealand. We also acknowledge that it may not be possible for New Zealand to implement a world- leading IP taxation regime, but significant progress can be made to align our regime with international norms, such that, at the very least, our regime is seen as a neutral rather than a negative factor. New Zealand’s current system runs the risk of being seen as a jurisdiction which penalises IP innovators through our tax system. This means IP will not be developed in NZ or will be moved from NZ in its infancy to other ‘innovation-friendly’ jurisdictions. This strips employment and development opportunities from NZ and draws highly skilled entrepreneurial individuals to leave home in search of opportunities overseas. The introduction of certain BEPS related initiatives has meant that it is becoming increasingly difficult for companies to move IP into jurisdictions where there is no ‘nexus’ with their other business operations or research and development expenditure. However, in many cases companies do have operations in multiple jurisdictions or may consider the benefits of establishing operations in multiple jurisdictions as they grow and expand and so companies do still retain choices as to where they base their IP. In addition, there may be limited incentives or ability for countries to enforce ‘nexus’ style rules where there is an absence of any overriding body such as the European Commission which was responsible for the decision that Apple ought to pay over back-taxes to the Irish Government. Patents Patents provide important IP protection for many valuable innovations. Across international jurisdictions patent recognition is now available for an increasing range of products and processes, providing even greater scope for investment and development. There has also been an increase in the number of tax related incentives / concessions on the treatment of patents. Approximately 18 countries around the world now have ‘patent box’ or ‘innovation box’ incentives which reduce the rate of corporate taxation levied on the income generated from certain types of IP including patents. Countries with patent box style laws include many European countries, the UK, India and China (although some of these systems are being modified in light of recent BEPS changes). The introduction of the UK patent box system was cited by multi- national company GlaxoSmithKline as a significant factor in its decision to build a new pharmaceutical factory in the UK in 2003. While having expanded operations significantly over the period GlaxoSmithKline had not built a new factory in the UK since the 1960s. It is in this global context that New Zealand should consider its’ rules around the taxation of patents. The NZVCA does not necessarily support the introduction of a patent box system in New Zealand. In Page | 11 2016 Australia’s Office of the Chief Economist investigated the option of a patent box system for Australia and was largely unconvinced that it would be beneficial. However, it is important to note that many jurisdictions around the world have significant concessions for IP innovators which we do not have in New Zealand. New Zealand Inland Revenue has taken the view that when patents are transferred outside New Zealand, a transfer of value takes place that is taxable under ordinary principles, with patents effectively being considered as revenue account property in most cases. The effects of this approach may far outweigh the benefits of any tax revenue collected to New Zealand. This is because this treatment encourages companies to shift patents offshore in their infancy in order to minimise their tax liability. In general, at this stage the patent has not yet accumulated a high value and as a result very little tax is collected overall. The other effect is that New Zealand loses the benefit of patents being developed and tested within our market, as this process will instead occur overseas. We acknowledge that, even in the absence of such a tax, patents are unlikely to remain in New Zealand indefinitely, however, they would likely remain in New Zealand for a longer period, along with the associated people and investment that will have broader economic benefits. In particular, the incentives to move to countries with patent box or low tax systems only arise when the patent is actually producing income so there is not an incentive to move the patent into those jurisdictions until the very latest stage when the patent is producing significant income. This means that there is a key development period where patents may be tested and further refined which New Zealand is missing out on because of our tax treatment. Recommendation: New Zealand needs further tax incentives to invest in research and development By international standards, investment in research and development (“R&D”) in New Zealand is low. Investment in R&D represents a significant capital risk as costs are often high and there is no guarantee of a profitable return. Even where R&D is successful, there is often a significant delay – sometimes 5 to 10 years between the investment of capital and any profitable returns. New Zealand’s tax regime provides some preferential treatment for R&D companies but this does not extend far enough. From an international perspective, our tax regime provides considerably fewer incentives to carry out R&D in New Zealand. The NZVCA believes that a system which incorporates both R&D tax credits and grant systems such as the Callaghan grants is necessary to encourage R&D investment. Two systems are beneficial because different companies have different constraints in place – for example Callaghan grants provide capital up-front which many companies may need, but they also require a certain level of specificity of the type of R&D undertaken and its’ objectives which may be unsuitable in certain other situations. In those situations, a tax credit may be more appropriate. Page | 12 The NZVCA welcomes the current Government’s announcement of its intention to introduce a R&D tax incentive in 2019 to help more businesses undertake a greater amount of R&D. The proposed incentive (discussion document released 19 April 2018) is a 12.5% tax credit on eligible business R&D expenditure occurring in NZ from 1 April 2019. The NZVCA will look to submit on this specific proposal to the relevant working group as invited by the discussion document. We are disappointed to see that the proposed credit is non-refundable meaning that its use will be extremely limited. To summarise our views on R&D incentives as they currently stand, the NZVCA believes that R&D rules are unnecessarily complex and impose onerous obligations on companies, particularly those that most need the capital but are least likely to have the formal procedures and documentation in place for the likes of Callaghan grants. This further discourages companies from engaging in R&D in New Zealand over other comparable jurisdictions. Furthermore, unless such an R&D regime can provide for timely credits and cash refunds, the long potential delays from the time of incurring such expenditure until such refunds are actually obtained means the intended benefit is far too late in many instances. Recommendation: If New Zealand is to adopt a capital gains tax it must be competitive internationally The NZVCA believes that one of the key considerations when reviewing our tax system is to ensure that our tax system is competitive internationally. NZ struggles to attract capital investment particularly in the venture capture area and while venture capital investment in NZ has been growing it is still below the OECD median. For NZ ensuring that our tax system is competitive with Australia in particular is important given how easy it is to transfer capital from NZ to Australia. If NZ were to adopt a capital gains tax, the CGT should be designed with international CGT systems in mind to ensure NZ is competitive, particularly with Australia where a number of specific investment regimes and vehicles encourage investment. Minimising the impact of any leakage of available cash to the already constraint growth capital environment through the CGT environment should be paramount to any policy. Looking internationally, we believe there are a number of features that a competitive CGT should have: Roll-over relief Most CGT systems around the world have some form of roll-over relief. The effect of a roll-over relief is essentially to defer or disregard the arising capital gain where the capital is used to purchase a replacement asset (which would ultimately still be subject to a capital gains tax). This means that the capital gain is not taxed until the point the gain is actually realised by the asset holder. These provisions encourage capital to be reinvested into business instead of paid out to shareholders which is beneficial to growth and business development. In Australia the roll-over provisions also provide Page | 13 relief in scenarios where a capital asset is legally transferred but no real change in economic ownership occurs – for example where assets owned by an individual are transferred to their wholly owned company or where shares are swapped as part of a business restructure but the shareholders underlying interest remains the same. These types of provisions are extremely important as they allow flexibility for business restructures as businesses grow and develop. Taper relief or long-term holding reliefs Gains arising from inflation are not ‘true’ capital gains and so fundamentally should not be subject to tax. Most jurisdictions with a CGT do attempt to take account of inflation in some way. Indexation (trying to calculate the effect of inflation over the period an asset was held) is very rarely used as this is extremely complex and creates uncertainty for capital holders. Australia previously had an indexation system which was replaced in 1999. Instead most countries (including the USA and Australia) apply a ‘taper relief’ system. Taper relief is a way of accounting for inflation by reducing either the tax rate applying to the taxable capital gain or reducing the amount of the gain, where an asset has been held for a certain period of time. Taper relief systems around the world have varying thresholds for the taper to apply – for example in Australia for assets held longer than a year there is a 50% reduction in the taxable gain for individuals and trusts and a 33.33% reduction for superannuation entities. Other countries with a one year taper include the United States, Turkey and Chile. The United Kingdom does not have a general taper relief but it has some specific exemptions which relate to assets held for a long period. A taper relief system is beneficial as it accounts for the effects of inflation but also encourages investors to invest on a long-term basis. Investors are most likely to consider investments where they are likely to invest over a long period of the businesses life and therefore introduce more value to that business both in terms of capital but also in terms of management or development experience.

SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP on the FUTURE OF TAX CONSULTATION 30 April 2018 2 Introduction to New Zealand Winegrowers New Zealand Winegrowers (NZW) provides strategic leadership for the wine industry and is the body that represents the interests of all of New Zealand’s grape growers and wine makers. Established in 2002, NZW has approximately 1,500 members. New Zealand is the only major wine producing country to have a single, unified industry body that represents both grape growers and winemakers. NZW welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to the Tax Working Group (TWG) in respect of its paper “Future of Tax” (Paper). We appreciate the government’s desire to consult with the public on the shape of the New Zealand tax system. We recognise that some matters are outside the TWG’s remit, and have sought to limit our comments to matters within the remit. A high quality taxation system is of great value to winegrowers At least 95% of winegrowers in New Zealand are small or medium enterprises (SMEs) – many of them family-owned businesses. For them, simplicity, transparency and ease of compliance, are high priorities in all regulatory matters, including taxation. NZW believes that New Zealand, and New Zealand businesses, have been well served by the country’s broad-based, low rate taxation system. Our tax system is largely free from the loopholes, exclusions and convolutions that feature in many other countries’ systems. As a result, compliance and administration costs are relatively low, and there is a relatively low incidence of tax considerations distorting business decisions. Our view is that retaining a broad-based, low rate taxation system should be high priority. We applaud the efforts being undertaken by Inland Revenue Department to reduce compliance costs via its Business Transformation programme. We welcome measures such as the Accounting Income Method and increasing digitisation of tax compliance. We urge IRD to continue these efforts, to carefully monitor the implementation of initiatives, and to adapt and improve them as necessary. We note that, for SMEs, stability within the taxation system is itself of considerable value, because the cost of implementing change is proportionately higher for them than for larger businesses (which can afford specialist staff to identify and manage changed obligations and compliance). New taxation measures are often posited as a panacea to any number of problems. We believe that changes to the taxation system – and particularly the introduction of any taxes directed at behaviour modification – ought not to be entertained unless a careful evidence-based analysis of the proposed policy and its likely outcomes shows clearly that the measures will result in the intended behaviour- change, and will not also have other unintended effects. Excise on wine in New Zealand Excise is a tax on locally manufactured products containing alcohol, tobacco products and fuels. It is collected by New Zealand Customs. In effect, it is a self-contained system quite separate from the mainstream of Government revenue gathering. 3 Rates of excise on alcohol are set in two tiers, a lower rate for beer and wine and a higher rate for spirits. They are based on the notion of a specific rate of excise being payable by litre of pure alcohol contained with a beverage. Because the alcohol level of standard wine is determined by natural factors and is therefore highly variable, the rate of excise is standardised on a per litre of product rather than a per litre of alcohol basis. This increases efficiency, and reduces administrative overhead both for producers and the government. NZW supports the fact that excise is levied on a volumetric basis; doing so incentivises the production of higher-value, premium product, whereas a levy imposed as a percentage of the product value would not provide that incentive. As of April 2018, excise is levied on standard wine at a rate of $2.9054 per litre of product. Excise on fortified wine (ie wine produced with the addition of distilled spirit such as Port and Sherry) is levied at the rate of $52.916 per litre of alcohol - equivalent to $9.52488 per litre of product at the typical alcohol content of 18% by vol. The rate of excise is increased annually by reference to the Consumer Price Index for all goods. So long as excise is retained, NZW supports this annual CPI increase mechanism as an administratively efficient and fair way to maintain relativities in this tax. The collection of excise requires the designation and administration of “Customs Controlled Areas” where wine is manufactured and stored under licence. Excise becomes payable by the winery in the month after the wine is removed from a Customs Controlled Area. One impact of the steady increase in excise on wine has been to exclude New Zealand wine from the domestic market at the lower price-points; it has been replaced by cheaper foreign wine. For a bottle of wine sold at a $10 retail price, a total of $3.51 goes to the government in excise, HPA levy and GST. Once retailer margin, distribution and cost of goods are taken into account, little or no margin is left for the New Zealand winery. As excise continues to rise with inflation, the price-point below which only cheap foreign wine is economical in the New Zealand retail market will also rise. The rationales for imposing excise on wine At various times different justifications have been given by successive governments for the imposition of excise on wine. (a) Collection of revenue was the historical justification given for the imposition of excise on alcohol in New Zealand. The government currently gathers around $213 million in excise per year from New Zealand wineries, plus a further $3 million as a levy to fund the Health Promotion Agency. The government takes significantly more in excise per litre of wine than is paid to the grower for growing the grapes 1 . No other agricultural or tourism industry in New Zealand is required to pay an indirect tax of this nature As a rationale for excise, revenue gathering at least has the merit of honesty. However, as a straight revenue-gathering exercise, it is difficult to justify in the context of a more modern system of taxation which includes a comprehensive income tax regime (including a PAYE deduction mechanism) and a broad-based goods and services/point of sale tax. That is at least 1 On average New Zealand grape growers receive around $1,750/tonne of grapes ($1.83/bottle). Excise and the Health Promotion Agency levy on the resulting wine is $2,118 ($2.21/bottle). In addition, GST on a $15 bottle of wine adds a further $1.96 per bottle – a total government impost of $4.17 on a $15 bottle. 4 part of the reason why the focus of policy rationales for excise has shifted towards social cost arguments in recent decades. The imposition of excise on wine inefficiently requires a separate administrative framework, and costly storage requirements for wineries. Because the majority of excise must be paid to Customs before the winery receives payment for its goods, it also imposes significant cashflow constraints and financing costs on the wine sector, which inhibit growth. Excise also works to the advantage of imported products sold in New Zealand because it is, in effect, collected from imported products at the wholesale stage, rather than production stage. We recognise the reality that no government is likely to forego this important source of revenue. However, we submit that the current system of collection is inefficient, archaic, and does not support innovation and growth. (b) Offsetting the social cost of the harmful use of alcohol is another reason cited. Ministry of Health data 2 show that around 80% of those who drink in New Zealand are light to moderate drinkers; it is the remaining 20% who drink at levels considered by the Ministry of Health to be potentially hazardous. Considerations of equity and fairness in the tax system dictate that any taxation measure directed at consumers with the intention of offsetting the social cost of harmful use of alcohol should be targeted at the 20% of consumers who consume at potentially hazardous levels and therefore potentially cause the negative externalities that need addressing. There is no persuasive rationale (other than administrative expedience) for recovering the social costs of harmful drinking off the 80% who consume only at moderate and light levels, and are therefore not causers of those social costs. In addition, we note that patterns of harm arising from alcohol consumption are complex, and are not necessarily correlated with overall consumption. This means that those being taxed the most may not be those causing social harm. • For example, binge drinkers and youth drinkers may have a pattern of drinking that is harmful and more likely to result in higher social cost; but their total annual consumption may, in fact, be lower than regular moderate consumers. • Similarly, those moderate regular consumers of wine are likely enjoy more of the health and wellbeing benefits of wine consumption; yet they may have a higher total annual consumption than problem drinkers. These moderate consumers pay more excise even though they are actually reducing negative externalities. The relationship between taxation (or price) and harm (or harm prevention) is complex, and is highly contingent on a wide range of social and economic factors. Any assumption that increasing excise on alcohol will reduce harmful consumption is not borne out by the available evidence regarding the nature of alcohol use, elasticity, and behavioural drivers. 2 Annual Update of Key Results 2016/17: New Zealand Health Survey 5 Again, we submit that it is critical that any taxation policy adopted in New Zealand ought to be justified by a rigorous analysis of the evidential basis for the policy, and its intended outcome. (c) Influencing behaviour to reduce the harmful consumption of alcohol is perhaps most commonly cited today as the primary rationale for excise on wine. Indeed, the TWG notes at page 5 of the Paper, that New Zealand has an alcohol excise tax which “is intended to discourage... drinking”. If behaviour change is the intended purpose of excise on wine in New Zealand, we strongly submit that its design is fundamentally flawed, and the tax is largely ineffective at achieving that purpose. This is because excise on wine is levied on producers, rather than on wholesalers or retailers, and in New Zealand wine producers have very little bargaining power with the two supermarket groups, which – through their supermarket stores and owned liquor retail chains – are by far the dominant force in the domestic wine market. When the excise increase is levied on the producer, the producer must seek to negotiate a higher price from the retailer to recover that additional cost. The New Zealand retail market dynamic means that increases in alcohol excise are generally not able to be passed on to consumers; rather the dominant retailers simply force producers to absorb them. In effect, the fact that excise is not passed on in the form of price increases to the consumer is a “circuit breaker”. It means that there is no opportunity for price increases from the annual CPI increase in excise to have any impact on consumer behaviour and renders this policy justification meaningless. Not only is it ineffective in communicating messages to consumers but it strongly affects the profitability of hundreds of small and medium enterprises. Note that this market situation for excise on wine is not at all comparable to the situation that exists for excise on fuels. In the fuel market, there is a very small number of market participants, and the producers/distributors are able to exercise a large degree of market power. Our submission is that if the TWG is minded to make any changes to the alcohol excise tax regime, it should be changed so that excise is levied on wholesalers or retailers – rather than producers. If excise were levied on wholesalers or retailers, the annual CPI increase would be directly payable by them; and is therefore much more likely to be passed on to consumers by way of a corresponding retail price increase. Those excise increases are therefore more likely to have a chance of influencing consumer behaviour. However, we do note that even if some or all of the increase is able to be passed on, there are still a range of factors at play in determining the relationship between taxes, or price, and consumption. Affordability is a more relevant indicator, taking into account a variety of economic indicators such as real disposable income, household income, the rates of income tax and GST, inflation/deflation and changes in the relative price of alcohol to other goods. 6 Effective tools for behaviour change Wine, by its very nature, is intended to be consumed with food, and in good company. As noted, 80% of New Zealanders who drink alcohol already do so in a moderate, responsible manner. The New Zealand wine industry is absolutely committed to spreading and reinforcing these norms of responsible drinking. In particular, the wine industry is a member of The Tomorrow Project, which through its Cheers! brand (www.cheers.org.nz ) directly targets consumers with innovative campaigns that reinforce moderation as the only appropriate way to consume alcohol, and provides a wealth of resources to help consumers make better choices about their drinking. Conclusion In this submission we have expressed our belief that retaining a broad-based low rate taxation system should be a high priority, and have touched briefly on some of the concerns the New Zealand wine sector has about excise on wine. These concerns relate to: (a) its inefficiency as a separate and somewhat archaic administrative process for gathering revenue, and the costs and brake on growth that it imposes on wineries; (b) its inequity as a tool for seeking to offset some of the social costs of harmful consumption of alcohol, and in particular the low correlation between the causers of negative externalities and the payers of the tax; and (c) the fact that excise in New Zealand fails as an instrument to incentivise behaviour change because the purported behaviour change signal – the annual CPI increase in excise – is all but silenced by the system’s design, which imposes excise on producers, who are unable to pass the increase through to consumers. We note that the nature of the relationship between price and impact on alcohol consumption is complex, and that evidence on the subject is also both complex and mixed. However, if the TWG believes the justification for excise on alcohol is to deliver a behaviour-change signal to consumers, we submit that the TWG should regard the current excise model as unsuccessful. In order for excise as a behaviour-change signal to be effective, the current system would need to be changed so that excise is levied on the wholesaler or retailer (as currently happens with respect to imported alcohol). In the absence of that change, the power dynamic in the current wine retail market will continue to ensure that any intended price signal from excise increases is muted and fails to reach the consumer. NZW has conducted extensive research into all matters discussed in this submission. We would be happy for the Secretariat to contact us to discuss any of the points raised in more details, or to appear before the TWG to be heard in support of the points we have raised. 7 Yours sincerely Jeffrey Clarke General Manager Advocacy & General Counsel \[1\]

OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS Contacts 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 Dear Sir Submission This is a submission by Olivershaw Limited to the Tax Working Group. One of the directors (Robin Oliver) of Olivershaw Limited is a member of that Tax Working Group. He was not in involved in this submission. Executive Summary This submission covers the following key topics: 1. Tax Settings 2. Capital Gain Tax 3. If taxes need to be raised, how is this best achieved 4. Policy setting process – GTPP 5. Other issues the TWG could suggest where the government undertake further work to improve the overall tax settings. 6. Other issues The TWG should not make any comment on as they are regimes that are working extremely well Overall, I believe that the fundamentals of the tax settings are about right. Theoretically before working through the detail, I see there is a case for a capital gains tax (CGT). When you consider the design issues, including the exemption for the family home, exemptions for most non-resident investment into New Zealand, and the considerable increase in compliance costs, I do not see net gains from introducing a comprehensive CGT. That said, I am concerned that with residential rental market the current supply related issues have resulted in many expected capital gains that taxpayers are taking this into account when making such investments. This capital gain is reasonably expected and, like what happened with international portfolio shares, was correctly seen as under taxation. I caution any immediate policy change as should the supply issues be corrected, the Olivershaw Limited Level 3 120 Featherston Street WELLINGTON PO Box 30 504 Lower Hutt 5040 Phone: 04 577 2700 \[1\] OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 2 commercial settings where rental income should be a market return without capital gains could occur again. If the capital gain continues to be a necessary feature of that investment, consideration should be given to whether a fair dividend type regime should be imposed on residential rental. I think this is a better result compared with a realised CGT. Also regard should be given to the loss ring-fencing rules and changes to the bright line tests that have been announced as that may correct the tax issues with these investments. 1 Tax setting New Zealand has a very good tax system, the tax settings have been reasonably stable, there are few distortions and has operated very well, especially through abnormal external events such as the global financial crisis. From a practitioner’s perspective the key aspects of NZ tax settings can be summarised as follows: • Very few distortions • Very predictable • Reasonably simple • Low compliance costs. Having a tax regime that has very few distortions and is very predictable by default means that it is simple and this keeps compliance costs low. When taxpayers undertake transactions that require tax advice, in most situations the answer can be predicted without looking up tax legislation, this is ideal from a tax advisers and taxpayers perspective. In particular, we note the following features of the NZ tax system that increases predictability and lowers compliance costs; • Having reasonably flat income tax rates and having close alignment between the corporate rate with the trustee/individual tax rates. Clearly if there was total alignment then several pressure points point would disappear. • Having the imputation regime to ensure, however a taxpayer earns income, there is simply one level of tax regardless of what commercial structure is applied by that taxpayer. Consistent with the above point, the lower corporate rate provides an incentive to use the corporate structure given the lower tax rate where income exceeds $48,000 (where the individual rate is 30%) • Not having a capital gain tax regime – these regimes add considerable complexity with considerable non-intuitive boundary lines and rules which ultimately end up in raising compliance costs. I am most concerned with the international settings and that is the focus of our submission in this section. By way of background, Olivershaw has recently assisted with taxpayers investing and residing in European countries and Australia. The tax regimes in these countries can be summarised as having many distortions, very unpredictable and therefore requiring detail advice and careful planning. This leads to considerable complexity and considerable compliance costs. Worst, given these complex regimes, it can be difficult for taxpayers to OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 3 correctly price and forecast tax when taxpayers are making investment decisions. This can lead to situations when investment, especially when bidding for assets against other investors, becomes uncompetitive. This is the worst outcome from a complex tax regime. New Zealand since the 1980s has generally changed the international tax setting to ensure lower taxes on foreign investment and increase certainty. This has obvious benefits when attracting foreign capital to invest in New Zealand. New Zealand requires foreign investment to fund investment in business to further grow GDP and create more employment. Until recently the international settings have been stable and predictable. More recently this cannot be said of our international settings. Officials have progressively made changes to existing boundaries to effectively collect more tax on foreign investment into New Zealand. This approach has the following implications: • It increases taxes on non-residents; and • It reduces certainty and predictability for non-residents. The above simply means that when non-residents invest into New Zealand, they increase the risk weighting they place on New Zealand investments. This, in the margins, will result in some foreign investors not investing in New Zealand and those that do invest requiring a higher rate of return or higher interest rates on their New Zealand investment. In my view there is a fine line between making changes that simply increase taxes and those which have solid policy foundations. This is an area of judgment, there is no objective test. The current direction is that officials keep changing the existing settings to collect more tax. Examples where officials have changed the international settings to collect more tax include: • Reducing the thin capitalisation debt to asset ratio from 75% to 60% (there was an offsetting adjustment with a lower corporate tax rate of 28%) • Micro changes to remove assets from the definition of assets, thus having the effect of requiring more equity and less debt to be invested in New Zealand • Changing the basis of gross assets to net assets (gross assets less non-interest- bearing debt) - this is a micro change but significant change to the thin capitalisation settings requiring significant more equity to be invested by non-residents to avoid non-deductible interest • Reducing the ability for foreign investors to use approved issuer levy (2% tax on interest payments) and use NRWT rates (10% plus) • The proposed hybrid tax changes • The proposed interest rate cap changes • Extending transfer pricing in relation to interest to shareholders to apply more widely than taxpayers that are associated. In my view, sophisticated foreign investors that make direct investment into New Zealand undertake a considered and comprehensive review of all the international settings. This includes the corporate tax rate, but more important is the thin capitalisation regime, transfer pricing regime and certainty of the tax settings. The corporate tax rate is not as important as the other settings. In this regard, New Zealand is more appropriately considered as a jurisdiction that is increasing taxes and complexity on non-residents. Worst, when advisers OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 4 are asked by non-resident investors on the stability of these settings, the above list demonstrate the direction of reform. I contrast the above changes with what many countries are doing to their international settings. Many countries are following the OECD BEPS reforms to reduce hybrid instruments however to offset the increased taxation from this, they are significantly reducing their corporate tax rate. New Zealand is simply doing the changes regarding hybrid instruments without any offsetting reduction. I recommend a process is implemented to take an overall review of the settings and how we compare with what other countries are doing. 2 Capital Gain tax There are three approaches to introducing a capital gains tax, namely: • A comprehensive CGT including the family home (albeit outside the terms of reference for the TWG) • A comprehensive CGT excluding the family home • Changes to the existing capital revenue boundary to address areas of concern. The first point to consider is whether New Zealand needs a CGT. Then consideration should be given whether the CGT that would be enacted will address the reasons why there should be a CGT and whether this is an improvement given the compliance costs that will arise. Do we need a CGT? Whether we need a CGT an important consideration. The TWG March 2018 report noted the following: • it has been argued that our current tax rules (and in particular the lack of tax on rental property gains) may have contributed to unaffordable housing. (page 46) • Under a broad-based, low-rate system, ideally the bars in Figure 21 would line up perfectly and there would be no difference in marginal effective tax rates between the types of investments (page 39, emphasis added – implying that a lack of a CGT distorts investment) • The Government has established the Tax Working Group (the Group) to examine further improvements to the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system (page 3) • Revenue integrity: minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage (page 4) • The Group is keen to hear public views on the overall performance of the tax system, and has a particular interest in assessments of the fairness and balance of our tax settings (page 6) In addition, over the years various comments have been made by officials and private sector for the need for a CGT. These comments can be summarised as follows: OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 5 • Dividend stripping structures where taxpayers have avoided paying tax on corporate profits that are only taxed at 28% as opposed to 33% - the proposed solution to this is a CGT • Taxpayers can restructure their affairs so they receive capital receipts as opposed to taxable receipts (excluding the dividend stripping opportunities as discussed above) • A lack off a CGT distorts taxpayers investment decisions into asset classes that produce untaxed capital gains • There are subjective rules whether a gain is a revenue gain (i.e. taxable) or a capital (non-taxable), a CGT would remove these issues. I can see from a first consideration that a comprehensive CGT will broaden our tax base and make tax fairer. The arguments for a CGT can be summarised as to; 1 increase fairness in the income tax regime; 2 to remove investment distortions; and 3 to improve the integrity of the Income Tax Act. I comment on the above issues. 1 Fairness and associated issues I appreciate the issue where taxpayers invest in a capital asset and earn an “untaxed” gains where other taxpayers only earn taxable income (horizontal equity). This is not the full story. If this were the criteria for imposing a CGT, then it would necessitate all capital gains being subject to tax including: • Gifts and inheritances (a taxpayer gifts a house or receive a house from an inheritance) • Lottery and gambling winnings • Compensation payments • Non-cash benefits such as family related interest free loans • Acquisition of assets below market value (a taxpayer sells a house to a family member below its market rate) • Provision of services for no charge (e.g. a taxpayer paints his/her house rather than employ a painter) To address this fairness all forms of capital appreciation should be included. This is not practical and would create its own fairness issues, for example subjecting a gift of post-tax earnings to a family member will be viewed as unfair by many. It is not clear what the boundary line would be of “acceptable windfall gains” and “unacceptable windfall gains”. I prefer that where capital gains are in effect revenue gains, these should be brought within the tax regime. This has occurred previously, for example receipts for restraint of trade have been historically classified as being a capital receipt. It was seen taxpayers were structuring income receipts as restraint of trade, hence these receipts were deemed to be income. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 6 The above also does not take into account the risk undertaken by the taxpayer is seeking a capital gain. A taxpayer that makes a capital investment subsequently realises that asset and receives a capital gain. If it is seen fair to tax such gains, then the taxpayer should be allowed a deduction if they make a loss. That is, to be fair, all capital losses should be tax deductible. It is highly likely that capital losses will be ring fenced. Is it fair that a taxpayer who incurs a capital loss obtains no immediate tax deduction for this loss? Consider a taxpayer who earns wages income and builds a tax paid capital base. They invest that capital and lose their funds. They have a quarantined capital loss. They then earn wages income to recover his/her capital. The capital loss provides no benefit. Is that fair? I do not believe fairness is the only aspect of a CGT regime, however many aspects of a comprehensive CGT will still be seen as unfair. 2 Removing investment distortions It is often argued that the lack of a CGT results in taxpayers distorting their investment decisions. The most commonly cited example is that of residential rental homes. As an initial comment I note that if a comprehensive CGT is implemented that exempted the owner occupied residential home of the taxpayer, then this will create an overwhelming distortion. That is, taxpayers will over invest in their residential home as that investment provides a benefit being the tax-free enjoyment of the asset and an asset that is free from any CGT. It is likely that a CGT that has the objective of removing investment distortions will likely be an own goal as everyone over invests in their own residential home. In relation to investment distortions I believe there are limited investment decisions which are distorted by the lack of a CGT. The most obvious example was international portfolio shares. The case for reform was reasonably clear. Most international companies retain a significant portion of their profits and therefore, assuming all else remains constant, international shares will increase in value resulting in tax free capital gains. The solution proposed for the was the fair dividend rate (FDR) regime. I believe this is a highly successful regime. I also believe the FDR regime is a superior solution compared to a realisation-based CGT regime. There are many examples of international shares that do not make annual dividend payments. A realisation-based CGT regime would reduce taxation for investors in such share. Simply for completeness, I do not believe it is feasible for an unrealised CGT regime to be applied to international shares as there are many examples where such shares do not have readily available market values. Except for residential rental properties, I do not believe there are consistent examples where untaxed capital gains are taken into account in investment decisions. I have many clients that invest in commercial property for long term rental yields. These decisions are based on existing rental returns, current interest rates, options to improve rental returns and the physical features regarding the property. I do not see how capital gains are built or can be built into the equation whether to buy such properties and therefore distort buying opportunities. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 7 I contrast that with residential rental income. Like international shares and unlike commercial property, I cannot see how investing in such properties is undertaken with an expectation of a known or certain capital gain. That is, unlike commercial property investment decisions, in many residential properties, the rental income does not cover the cost of funding such acquisitions. There is something else that is taken into the equation which is the expectation of capital appreciation. This is currently driven by factors of limited supply and net population growth (demand) which is obvious in certain cities. I am not sure whether this will continue over the long-term future, hence I am not sure whether the expectation of capital gains will always occur. In any event, before TWG considers a CGT regime for residential property, consideration should be given whether an FDR type regime should be applied to such investments as compared with a CGT. As mentioned above, I believe that FDR for international shares works extremely well and collects more revenue for the Government in a more consistent and fair basis. In relation to NZ equity investments, I simply see no distortion created by not having a CGT regime. Purchase decisions are based on cashflow. Where taxpayers are making the decision based on sale proceeds, I suggest they are already held on revenue account. I simply see no distortion for such investments. Finally, in this regard, New Zealand needs more capital investment in businesses. Subjecting such investment into these business to CGT will not increase the amount of investment undertaken. 3 Improving the integrity of the Income Tax Act As noted above, I have seen many comments from officials over the years how taxpayers are converting income gains into capital gains and hence the lack of a CGT creates integrity issues with the Income Tax Act. If this was true, then this is a compelling argument. More to the point, if it were true then officials would be arguing for changes to include such gains with the income tax act. This has occurred in a number of situations such as the financial arrangement rules and the restraint of trade issues discussed above. Quite simply if there were these major opportunities why is any income tax collected from businesses? What are these opportunities so that I can apply them? The other consistent concern raised by officials is the difficulty in enforcing the capital revenue boundary, especially with land sales and the intention test. To a large degree, this has been addressed by the bright-line rules that apply to residential property. As noted above, I see the current issues impacting on residential rental home investment decisions. These have been and are proposed to be subject to further reform (changes to the bright line test and ring fencing of losses). The changes made to such investments are as follows: 1 removal of tax depreciation on buildings 2 limiting what assets can be classified as fitout 3 applying the bright-line test of 2 years 4 extending the bright-line test to 5 years (proposed) 5 ring fencing losses (proposed). OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 8 It certainly seems rational that some of the above changes will address the integrity issues of the tax act with respect to residential property investments. If this is not seen as sufficient, then further reform could be considered such as an FDR type regime or a targeted CGT for residential rental accommodation. Conclusion on whether we need a CGT regime I do not believe a strong case has been made why a CGT is required. The one area where I see potential issues regarding fairness, distortions and integrity issues is in relation to residential rental investment. This only occurs given the current commercial issues of supply and demand. If these are expected to continue, I see it is reasonable to conclude that further reform should be undertaken with respect to that asset class. I question whether this is better considered post the implementation of the various reforms that have been completed or announced. Implementation issues with a CGT Implementation of CGT raises real and complex issues that will materially increase compliance costs. The implementation issues can be of such concern that it undermines or negates the benefits of the proposed CGT reform. I contrast this to the previously repealed gift duty regime which collected very little revenue. It did however raise considerable compliance costs, there was considerable non-compliance, and there was considerable distortion in that gifts were made of $27,000 each year or on the taxpayer’s death. Such a regime was rightly repealed. Implementation decisions for a CGT can end up with the same result as what occurred for gift duty, namely a complex regime that raised many compliance costs and raised little revenue. If a targeted response is made in relation to residential rental property (whether a CGT or FDR type regime) then the implementation issues are substantially reduced. Further, I understand that when you consider all investments made by New Zealanders, the clear majority is invested in owner occupied houses (exempt from CGT), bank deposits (fully taxed), kiwisaver (fully taxed), and residential rental homes (discussed above). I believe the real complexity of CGT arises with the other asset classes such as shares and business goodwill, which is not substantial when considering the abovementioned assets. Given this, I strongly recommend that if a CGT is advanced, it is a targeted measure in relation to residential rental homes (whether by a targeted CGT of FDR type regime). In the appendix I comment on the implementation issues that have been identified in the TWG initial paper. I comment below on what I see are the main issues should a comprehensive CGT be advanced. Again, I do not see that a targeted response raises these issues. Our detail additional comments are outline below. 1 Imposing a CGT on international assets a. I discuss this further in the appendix. I believe all international assets should be excluded from CGT given the measurement issues, complexity with interfacing OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 9 with foreign CGT regimes, and the limited amount so invested by New Zealand residents. b. In many cases such foreign assets will be subject to CGT in the foreign jurisdiction, hence imposing a CGT in NZ creates exposure to double tax. Officials will likely say that taxpayers can claim a credit for the tax paid in the foreign jurisdiction. The reality is that due to different calculation basis, different realisation rules, and different exchange rates, in many situations the tax credit will not be allowed. c. Capital gains will always need to be calculated in NZ currency. Therefore, the capital gain/loss made in the foreign jurisdiction will always be completely different from the gain/loss made in NZ currency. It is not clear why a taxpayer should be subject to NZ CGT when their currency is better measured in that foreign jurisdiction, for example a foreign employee who works in NZ but unfortunately realises a foreign asset why a New Zealand taxpayer. If their stay in New Zealand is not permanent, any gain that takes into account the changes with NZ currency is a fictious gain for that taxpayer. d. If foreign assets are included, officials are also likely to require all foreign assets own via foreign corporates and foreign trusts are also brought into the NZ CGT net if the ultimate shareholder(settlor) is NZ resident. This then raises a number of very complex issues such as ownership interest, costs basis, relevant FX rates on acquisition/commencement date, sale date, and then compounded for all additional purchases and partial disposals, periods when the asset was a primary home etc. e. For capital gains made in disposing foreign investments or subsidiaries, such gains can be reduced by the payment of exempt dividends. This then raises subjective and complex issues whether the dividend should be accounted for in the sale proceeds etc. Many countries including Australia, United Kingdom, and South Africa have CGT exemptions when gains are made foreign subsidiaries due to these complex issues. I strongly recommend NZ follows what these other countries have done. f. Overall, the quantum of foreign assets would be relatively small however the complexity and compliance costs will be substantial. This then rises whether this is worth doing with respect to those asserts - I recommend all foreign assets be excluded. 2 Transition into a CGT regime a. Transition into the rules is a key design features that requires careful consideration. Australia introduced its CGT regime and applied it only to assets acquired post commencement date. On balance I prefer this option should TWG recommend a comprehensive CGT. This however creates a number of complex issues such as assets which have additions post commencement date. Clearly a $100 company owned pre-commencement date that buys a $1m assets post commencement date should be caught by CGT. Likewise, a $1m company owned pre-commencement date that buys a $100 asset should remain excluded from the CGT rules. Where the boundary line should be drawn will be complex and extremely difficult to manage. On balance I think this is better than a valuation basis on the date of introduction. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 10 b. The alternative is that all assets are valued on commencement date (including providing the taxpayer the option to use cost as the valuation – see below). Obviously, valuers will be making considerable income given the vast amount of assets that could be subject to CGT and the many taxpayers that will seek valuations to arrive at the highest valuation. The valuation option is likely to result in many (most/all) assets being over-valued. It will not be possible for the Inland Revenue to manage disputes or even reviewing such valuations given the share volume of valuations that are likely to be undertaken. Worst, the correctness of the valuation may only be reviewed after a number of years from the commencement date when it is hard to seek records or justify such valuations. c. If the valuation option is adopted, its seems practical that taxpayers be given the option to use the highest of valuation or cost. If this option is not allowed, there will be taxpayers who will pay CGT even though they have made no gain. Consider a taxpayer who invests in a company for $1m which is all debt funded. The company has hard times and at commencement date of CGT the company is only worth $100,000. Good times return, and the taxpayer sells the company for $1.1m and can repay their $1m debt. If the taxpayer cannot use the cost option and must use the valuation option, then they have made $1,000,000 capital gain but with a $330,000 tax liability. Allowing only the valuation option will made some taxpayer insolvent and bankrupt. It also raises the interesting issue whether loans should also be valued for CGT purposes and how this is interfaced with the financial arrangement rules. This seems complex. d. I am also aware that there is a hybrid transitional basis where assets sold post commencement date are subject to CGT, but the taxable gain is calculated based on the time period of ownership and split between pre and post commencement of CGT on a straight-line basis. Such an approach is obviously random and certainly penalises taxpayers that hold for a long-time post commencement of CGT. This type of regime forces taxpayers to sell assets where they have made large unrealised gains before the commencement of CGT and therefore is very distortionary. 3 Double taxation and double deductions a. One of the more significant concerns is likelihood that double taxation will arise with respect to any CGT. This arises where a taxpayer invests in a company, the company makes a gain subject to CGT. Consider a farming company owned by a number of generations in the wider family. Assume the farm is ultimately sold, the gain will be subject to CGT. If the shares are sold, gains on those shares will be subject to CGT. Depending on the design of the regime, as shares move down generations on the death of a shareholder, this may also result in tax. A number of permutation arise that all result in more than one layer of tax (being tax at the shareholder level when share transfers occur and tax at the corporate level when the farm is sold). These issues need to be addressed otherwise there will be substantial distortions and all SMEs that are structured through corporates will need to restructure as trusts. b. Equally with double tax, I suspect officials will be overly concerned where taxpayers can claim double deductions therefore reducing their overall CGT OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 11 liabilities. This occurred in Australia where most corporates are forced to use the Australian tax consolidation regime. This results in extremely complex and subjective tax laws. This will immediately and materially increase tax compliance costs. c. In saying the above, clear rules will also need to be put forward so that where companies make capital gains that are not subject to CGT (i.e. gains made before introduction of any CGT), the effect of CGT is not caught when the company distributes those gains to shareholders. If tax arises on such gains, then the CGT regime will be seen as retrospective and taxing gains made before its introduction. This also adds to the complexity of the rules. 4 Compliance costs with private assets such as holiday homes a. If private assets such as holiday homes and expensive boats and planes are brought into the CGT base I note this raises a new set of complex issues. b. First, many owners of such assets may not file tax returns and have no appreciation of the tax issues they must address. Many such assets currently have no tax implications and therefore detail records are not keep. c. The compliance costs of record keeping are significant. They have to address the issues on transition. They then have to keep detailed records of any additions. For example, with a holiday home needs to consider whether the following are capital costs - new roofs, a new garage, new driveways, repainting, acquiring native trees, etc etc. d. Further complexities arise when family members change ownership interests whether by direct transfer of due to the death of an owner. e. Overlaying the above, should there be an adjustment for private consumption. Consider an expensive asset which is acquired for $1m and subsequently sold for $950,000. Assume that loss is all attributable to the private consumption by the taxpayer. Is this loss a qualifying deductible loss? What if there was a gain, but the gain would have been larger if there had been no private consumption? 5 Overall compliance costs of a CGT a. As outlined above, I see many complexities of a comprehensive CGT. I also believe there will be many behavioural changes that result. As an adviser firm I see considerable area of advice that clients will seek advice on. The key question is, are all these complexities and compliance costs are a good thing for New Zealand. Will further productive investment occur or more importantly will more productive investment (whatever this is) occur relative to other forms of investment? Will the tax system be fairer post all this complexity? Will taxpayer compliance improve. In this regard I note that officials have noted that less than 50% of taxpayers complied with the 2 year bright-line test that should have returned income from that regime. 1 I suspect the introduction of a comprehensive CGT compliance will go down however compliance costs will increase. 1 See RSS to the proposals to extend the brightline test to 5 year, Feb 2018. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 12 Implications for Government revenue As a final point I note the fiscal implications of a CGT. The first point is that the revenue raised from a comprehensive CGT does not eventuate for a number of years given the transitional events. What this means is there is no ability to reduce taxes for that time from the expected increase in CGT revenue. More importantly, should the world economy go through a market correct and economic slowdown that seems to occur every 10 years, reliance on a CGT tax base means reduced revenue for the government. That is, when the world economy went through the global financial crisis (the GFC) governments that relied on a material CGT tax base experienced a considerable reduction of revenue. This is not surprising as many asset classes reduce in value during such events. Corporates were also forced to divest assets and clearly if that result in CGT payable, they were also forced to sell loss making investments to crystallise losses. This is akin to being addicted to heroin, goods times are great, bad times are extreme poor. For this reason alone, I have real concerns making New Zealand rely on a tax base that will disappear in times when the government needs revenue the most (i.e. when benefits materially increase etc). 3 Revenue raising options An important question is if the Government requires more revenue, where should this come from? Separate to this, should the balance of our tax collected be altered from the current mix of GST and income tax so that it is more fairer. I refer to the 2010 tax working group (where the writer was a member of that group). Their conclusion was that if tax revenue should be raised, the best way to undertake that is to raise GST. I also note that should the GST rate be raised, benefits and low-income earners have benefit/taxes adjusted to ensure they are no worst off. This seems the fairest way to raise taxes. If the Government considers other revenue raising options, I recommend the following: 1 GST should be imposed on all goods (no threshold) brought into NZ across the border. This can be done through electronic means and is efficient and effective. 2 The corporate and top individual tax rates should be aligned. The key question is at what rate should they be aligned to. In this regard I note: a. The corporate rate is generally a withholding tax on NZ resident and a final tax of foreign investment. b. As noted above, for direct foreign investors, the corporate rate is not the most significant settings, rather the thin capital and interest rates are more relevant. c. High net wealth taxpayers, the relevant tax rate is the corporate rate as all marginal income is paid at that rate (whether through corporates or PIEs). d. Many high-income earners cannot access the corporate rate given the nature of their income – is this fair? e. The optimal alignment rate is the rate where corporates and high-income earners pay the same amount of tax collectively. I do not have resources to calculate that rate. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 13 3 No comprehensive CGT is implemented. Please refer to our comments regarding a CGT. If the Government requires more revenue, there are better ways to collect that revenue which are fairer, even just raise income tax rates. 4 Policy setting process GTPP is not working as originally intended. There are many examples where concerns over policy decisions seem to be ignored. Examples include the above mentioned systematic changes to the international tax settings for investment into New Zealand. Other examples have been the implementation of the AIM determinations. Concerns have been raised that the AIM determinations are unworkable and not practical, yet the submissions have not fully been taken into account. Clearly there will never be total agreement on all issues of tax policy design. That is not the concern. The concern is there are many examples where the private sector simply does not understand why changes are been made (or not made) and concerns have not been addressed by officials. We consider that this area need further consideration. 5 Other issues for the TWG to consider There are a raft of issues that are micro in nature that the TWG should get officials to consider and report back given they lower compliance costs, involve small margin revenue or the remove bias regarding investment decisions. The list that I think should be considered further are as follows: 1 Exempt immigrants from rental income earnt overseas, or at least the FX on loans funding those rental houses. a. The current setting for migrants need to be revisited, especially those that move to NZ but retained their family home in the foreign country and derive rental income from it. This commonly impacts expatriate employees who come and work in New Zealand for a short time period. If they work in New Zealand for less than 4 years, foreign income is not subject to NZ tax. If they stay longer than 4 years, or don’t qualify for the four-year transitional rule, then they have a raft of complex issues regarding any rental home in their home jurisdiction. b. The issues include returning the foreign income for NZ tax purposes which generally means undertaking a rental calculation applying NZ tax legislation and converting this into NZ currency. c. If they have net income from this, it is likely to be subject to tax in the foreign jurisdiction and therefore any tax payable may be allowed as a credit in NZ. d. The above is not simple but it is manageable and more importantly it is understandable which lowers compliance costs and improves taxpayers meeting their obligations. I might add, I am not sure there is any major revenue in this, namely either allowing losses or taxing profits with a corresponding foreign tax credit for taxes paid in the foreign jurisdiction. e. The more complex issue is the NZ tax implications of any foreign currency mortgage on these rental properties. What is more difficult is that the loan balances are converted in NZ currency each year therefore producing FX gains or losses. That is, if the NZ currency weakens against the taxpayer’s home currency there are large tax deductions and if the NZ currency strengthens, there will generally be significant amounts of income. What is OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 14 most difficult is that from the taxpayer’s perspective they have a foreign currency hedge (being the loan and asset both being in foreign currencies) and there is no economic gain or loss. As such they have difficulties understanding why this is subject to tax noting that it is outside their control. f. There are some complex rules regarding the ability to use a cash basis and defer FX gains and losses, however this has its own problems. I suggest that the income and expenses and the FX treatment on the loans are all totally ignored from a NZ tax perspective. Failing this, FX on loans should be permanently ignored. g. Just for completeness, if a CGT is imposed on such assets I see substantial compliance costs and significant non-compliance. Taxpayers who are well advised will try and place such assets in structures (i.e. foreign trusts with no NZ trustee) before they come to NZ and therefore avoid all these taxes. It seems very bad policy design that those taxpayers who seek good professional advice will correctly avoid these taxes whereas other will have high levels of compliance costs and unknown tax liabilities (which will predominately be based on FX movements which are outside their control) 2 Allow refunds of imputation credits except for charities and non-residents. a. The current tax settings do not allow excess imputation credits to be refunded. For most taxpayers, the excess imputation credit is used against other income and therefore they receive refunds of the taxes due on the other income. For example, if a superannuant has super and some fully imputed dividend income, the imputation credit is a credit of 28% and exceeds their margin tax liability, likely to be 17.5%. When they file a tax return, they get a refund of the excess of 10.5% being a refund of the PAYE deducted on their super. b. If the taxpayer has no other income, then they cannot receive a refund of the excess imputation credit, but they can obtain a refund of the 5% RWT deducted on the dividend. The excess imputation credit should also be refunded. The Government may wish to prevent imputation credits being refund when paid to charities and obviously non-residents, however the current limitations simply adds complexity and compliance costs. I suspect that the numbers are not that large. Finally in this regard, excess imputation credit still represent excess tax paid by the shareholder and should, on pure policy grounds, be refunded. 3 Allow depreciation on commercial buildings, they do depreciate however the tax act provides no relief for this. The best example of this has been the number of buildings that have been demolished around Wellington. Outside the buildings that were deemed to be inhabitable due to the earthquake, there has been a number by buildings that have been demolished given they simply are not up to acceptable levels of the new building standards. They have clearly reduced in value, some of which is simply due to the changes of the building code, i.e. a regulatory cause for their reduction in value. This would have to be one of the clearest examples of unfairness in the tax settings. This should be resolved by allow commercial and industrial building to be depreciated for tax purposes. 6 Other issues that the TWG should not consider, rather the TWG should confirm existing settings As noted above the NZ tax regime is very respected international and has a number of regimes that operate very well. These reduce compliance cost and improve certainty. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 15 Changing these regimes will fundamentally increase the stress and tension between the Inland Revenue and the SME sector. The regimes that should be endorsed by the TWG include (I include those regimes and brief comments which I can expand on if required): 1 Imputation credit regime (IC regime) a. The IC regime is a hall mark of the NZ tax system. It basically means that SMEs can operate either as sole traders, partnerships, trading trusts or corporate structures without tax being a major factor. If the IC regime was removed it would result in many SMEs that have structured as a corporate to reconsider their structure. b. The IC regime prevents the historic double regime that previously operated and that operates in a number of different countries. If it were removed, then it is likely all shareholders will want to extract profit by way of directors/shareholders/consulting fees, or interest to prevent double taxation. To combat taxpayers doing this, it will then result in a large number of anti- avoidance regimes to dictate what are essentially commercial decisions what will have to effect of placing more debt on corporate structures (even listed corporates). This is a perverse outcome. c. As noted above, I recommend that where taxpayers have excess imputation credits on dividend income, these excess credits should be refunded. 2 Statutory deduction for interest for corporates a. The statutory deduction for interest expenditure allowed to corporates materially reduces compliance costs for all large corporates and all SMEs. b. Before the statutory deduction was provided for, many large and SME corporates regularly and routinely sought advice and structured their affairs to enable interest deductions. I recall that one major corporate established a new subsidiary every time it paid a dividend as there was a statutory deduction for interest costs when borrowing funds to subscribe for equity in a company. Obviously, the borrowings were then used to fund the payment of a dividend. This was all just heavy compliance costs. Material compliance costs savings have occurred by having a statutory deduction for interest costs. c. The boundary line that is established is that all interest is tax deductible as long as there are comprehensive dividend rules that apply to cash and non- cash dividends. In our experience this is operating very well. d. Obviously, some interest costs are not fully deductible, namely interest subject to the thin capitalisation regime, the mixed-use asset regime and more recently in relation to cars which provide a fringe benefit to shareholder employees. The mixed-use asset rules are a good example how not to do tax policy. Those rules are extremely complex if there is a mixed-use asset present and I suspect has very low levels of compliance by taxpayers. For example, where a corporate group owns a mixed-use asset, the rules effectively deem that the mixed-use asset is 100% debt funded and any debt in the corporate group or any major shareholder is first used to fund the mixed-use asset. 3 Overdrawn current accounts a. I have heard several policy officials raise whether all overdrawn current accounts should be treated as a deem dividend. This will be a bad policy decision that lacks a detailed understanding how the rules in this respect operate. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 16 b. Most SMEs do not pay wages and salaries to shareholders that is subject to PAYE. This is because most do not earn regular cash flow to pay shareholders that can be subject to PAYE. In months due to clients not paying or irregular income patterns, there is simply not sufficient cash to pay shareholders that month. What happens in most such SMEs is that during the year shareholders take cash when cash is available. These are accounted for as overdrawn current accounts. At the end of the year, when the annual profit is known, a journal entry is undertaken which debits wages expense and credit the shareholder’s current account. The Tax Act deems this credit to the current account to occur at the first day of that income year, which in most cases places the current account into credit. They only have a debit balance at year end if they the annual cash drawings exceeding that year’s salary (ignoring opening balance). If they have a debit balance, interest is calculated from the date when the current account went into debit (i.e. overdrawn). This works perfectly well. The shareholder is most likely to have being paying provisional tax on the salary during the income year. To alter this will result in SMEs needing to determine their annual taxable profit before taking any cash is taken – this is simply not workable. c. Where a shareholder has an over drawn current account, the tax liabilities of this are addressed by requiring the interest to be charged to the shareholder at the FBT rate (currently 5.77%) (if interest is not charge it gives rise to an actual FBT or dividend RWT cost). This interest charged to shareholders on the overdrawn current account is taxable income to the company and is generally (i.e. almost always) non-deductible to the shareholder. This is no different from the shareholder borrowing from a bank to meet his/her living costs. There is no tax advantage of overdrawn current accounts. If officials believe there is a tax advantage I would be happy to meet with them to discuss. d. I can see an issue if the shareholder can never repay the overdrawn current account. In our experience the Inland Revenue has been successful arguing for tax on a technical debt remission. I would be happy to discuss this further if required. I am happy to provide further information on the above options. I am happy to discuss our conclusion above. Yours faithfully Olivershaw Limited Mike Shaw Director \[1\] \[1\] Capital Gains Tax (CGT) Design Issues Key Design Considerations Comment a B C 1 Should CGT be a separate tax or part of income tax? Best taxed as part of income tax. If the decision is made to tax such gains, then additional complexity will arise if a new regime is developed. If another regime is developed, questions needs to be consider whether existing capital gains that are taxed should also be taxed under this new regime. It is simplest just to deem the gain to be taxed as income. 2 Should capital gains be taxed on realisation or accrual basis? Ideally gains should be taxed as they accrue. This approach is simply not feasible or practical given the valuation difficulties and cash flow implications. This then creates several distortions such as lock in distortions and issues when taxpayers die or leave New Zealand. 3 What assets should be covered? If a CGT is to be introduced it should be comprehensive, covering not only physical assets but intangible property, rights and extinguishment of rights. This is not practical or feasible. The family home has already been excluded. Further decisions will need to be considered such as: • Lottery gains (and treatment of losses) • Gambling gains (and treatment of losses) • Cash inheritances • Treatment on death • Treatment on death of non-residents (but NZ resident beneficiary) The family home is the most material asset owned by NZ residents, but it is excluded. This will create a major distortion as taxpayers will seek to avoid CGT simply by over-investing into their residential house. For this reason, this is a material flaw in any proposal to introduce a CGT. For completeness we note the compliance costs of including the family home is substantial. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 18 Key Design Considerations Comment Consideration should be given to where “issues” arise and include such gains within the income tax net. The areas of concern seem to be the residential rental home as capital gains appear to be expected gains which are taken into account before making such investments. If this is correct, this is perhaps a reason for taxing such gains. We are unaware of any other areas of concern, namely where the tax settings create distortions. Our preferred option is simply to target areas where the existing tax settings are causing distortions and a CGT or FDR type should be introduced to address those issues (targeted response). We also provide comments should a comprehensive approach be considered 3a Should assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes be subject to tax? Targeted response – no comments required as these assets would not be subject to a CGT Comprehensive approach All assets should be taxed unless a targeted approach, such as taxing residential rental homes. Many Kiwsaver funds invest in international shares. If anything these seem to be currently overtaxed under a 5% FDR. We can see no benefit in changing the setting other than to adjust the 5% FDR rate. It seems interest income is over-taxed in such long-term investment vehicles. Consideration should be given to reducing the tax rate on such interest income in these funds. 3b Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? Comprehensive and targeted response There are a number of issues that we believe means that such assets should be EXCULDED. First what is the gain we are trying to tax. In many situations the gain should be measured relative to the foreign currency, taxing some fictitious gain relative to NZ currency is meaningless. Take for example an employee of a MNC who works in NZ for only say 5 years. Any capital gains relative to the NZ dollar are fictitious as they are really concerned with gain relative to their home jurisdiction. Second, many foreign capital gains are subject to tax in the foreign jurisdiction or will be subject to tax in the foreign jurisdiction. Why are we subjecting such gains to double tax? We appreciate that even if a with a targeted approach of taxing residential rental home, our recommendation would be that these foreign residential rental homes would be excluded from the base. When you consider the FX and foreign currency value change on both the asset and the debt, potential foreign tax credits on the foreign value change, residential home exemption (and apportionment between rental use and owner occupier use) this all becomes too complex and the compliance costs will not warrant any tax that may be collected. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 19 Key Design Considerations Comment 3c How should gifts and gambling winnings be taxed? Targeted response – no comments required as these gains would not be subject to a CGT Comprehensive approach Gifts and gambling should be excluded as these are windfall gains made without any material behaviour change/investment distortion. There is limited policy justification for include such gains in the CGT base. Gambling is more akin to a consumption item and should be taxed as such (i.e. subject to GST etc as it presently that case) Gifts and gambling should also be excluded otherwise deductions should be provided where taxpayers lose on such transactions. It would be considerable over taxation if all receipts were taxable with no relief provided for the losses. Gifts should also be excluded from CGT based on our practical grounds. If gifts were included, then it should be all gifts. However, many gifts are provided at no monetary consideration and hence impossible to measure. It is also not clear how deductions would operate if gifts were allowed as a deduction. We have previously had a gift duty applied to many gifts over $27,000. It was concluded that the compliance costs associated with this was considerably more than the tax revenue it collected. . 3d Should there be a de Minimis rule? Comprehensive and targeted response There should be a de Minimis rule to reduce compliance costs if a comprehensive CGT is pursued. The de minimis should be considerable given the compliance costs that result from such a tax. We would suggest that the assets have to exceed $500,000. If a targeted CGT is pursued as per our recommended, then no de minimis should apply. . 4 CGT events/realisation Targeted response If a targeted CGT is pursued as per our recommended, then realisation should be the events that triggers a CGT liability. Comprehensive If a comprehensive CGT regime is pursued, then complex rules need to be taken into accounts such as: OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 20 Key Design Considerations Comment • realisation (sale/assignment/gift/transfer etc) • Death/distribution • Migration • Sale by certain leases • Assignment • Resettlements • Deem sale if sale of shares needs to be considered. 4a How should matrimonial property settlements be treated? Comprehensive and targeted response Treatment should be consistent with existing rules with existing relationship property transfers. Specifically, a such transfers should be excluded for CGT purposes. 4b How should disposal of assets on death be treated? Targeted response If targeted extensions are made such as residential rental property, then the existing rules that apply to revenue account property should apply. Comprehensive response Ideally, if a comprehensive CGT is pursued, CGT should crystallise on a taxpayer’s death. This raises obvious issues resulting in taxpayers having to sell assets to fund the tax liability. This was a major issue with NZ previous estate duties tax, namely when a farmer died, the family was forced to sell the farm to fund the 40% rate of estate duty. Given these issues, there should be a roll over on death and the cost basis of the deceased should carry forward to the estate and then beneficiaries should the beneficiaries retain the asset. There should be no step up of costs at this time, if there is such a step up for political reasons, then this would undermine the entire regime, namely taxpayers are forced to hold assets until they die. Another issue that arises is where a taxpayer own shares (especially wholly owned companies) in a company that has assets subject to CGT. Consider where a farmer operates through a wholly owned company where s/he owns all the shares. The taxpayers dies. If this triggers CGT, the entire value of the farm will be crystallised in the value of the shares. Immediately post the famers death, the company sells the farm. This also triggers CGT with no offset OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 21 Key Design Considerations Comment allowed in relation to the tax paid by the farmer. This effectively doubles the rate of CGT and seems totally unwarranted. 4c How should emigration be handled? Targeted response If a target expansion occurs, no CGT event needs to occur as the land remains in New Zealand. Given this, the CGT event should be deferred until realisation occurs. Comprehensive response If a comprehensive CGT is pursued, when a taxpayer leaves NZ, assuming it is a permanent departure, then CGT triggered at that time. This is important otherwise the integrity of the CGT regime will be undermined by taxpayers avoiding CGT on non-NZ property by simply leaving NZ. In Australia, when a taxpayer ceases Australian residency, for non-land assets, we understand the taxpayer has the choice to pay CGT based on the valuation at that date, or the taxpayer can defer until the date when the taxpayer sells the asset. We understand that raises collection issues. This entire area is extremely complex and raises considerable uncertainty, compliance costs (advice and valuations) and non-compliance (especially given the inability to track ultimate sale of such assets and collect tax from non-residents with no connection with Australia). If the emigration is not permanent, then there should be no crystalisation of any CGT. 4d How should immigration be handled? Comprehensive and targeted response Like migration, this is extremely complex area. The first response is to require a valuation of assets when taxpayers first becomes resident post the transitional residency period (noting not all new taxpayers may qualify for the transitional residency period). Such taxpayers will likely have foreign assets in foreign currencies. As an initial comment, it makes little sense giving rise to a CGT liability based on NZ currency and for assets acquired without any consideration of moving to NZ. High wealth taxpayers have complex structures and many assets which do not have readily available market values which makes initial valuation difficult. Complex issues then arise how to calculate CGT liabilities when realisation is made by structures (trusts and corporates) established by such taxpayers. This is overly complex. Australia deems gains made by the foreign structure to be subject to Australian tax based on the entire gain if the structure is passive in nature. This is the entire gain, not that gain made by the person was resident in Australia. Further the taxpayer can have an Australian tax liability even in situations where the economic gain is not received by the taxpayer. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 22 Key Design Considerations Comment There are issues when the foreign jurisdiction taxes such foreign asset under a CGT regime and therefore raising double tax. This all leads us to conclude that it is best to exclude all such foreign assets, especially in the scheme of all events, this is a minor asset base and certainly not an asset based that drive any adverse behaviour change (i.e. the asset was acquired before entering into NZ). . 4e When should non- residents be subject to tax? Comprehensive and targeted response Australia only imposes CGT on land assets or land rich companies. We believe that a similar rule should be imposed in NZ if a comprehensive CGT is pursued. If a target CGT regime is applied to residential rental, then they would also be subject to CGT even if the owner is a non-resident. . 4f How should family trusts be integrated into the system? A family should be treated as a taxpayer no different from a corporate. 5 Should capital losses be ring fenced? Targeted response: • Losses should not be ring fenced and deductible against ordinary income. There is little ability to manipulate losses given it involves the sale of real property that give rise to its own compliance costs. Comprehensive response • To reduce compliance costs and complex boundary issues, losses should be immediately tax deductible and deductible against ordinary income. • That said, the ability to bring tax losses will likely pose a material revenue cost therefore resulting in such complex rules to ringfence such losses Ring fencing rules unwind all compliance costs savings of removing the capital revenue boundary, Rather, such a rule is likely to result in taxpayers arguing that capital account assets are now held on revenue account so that any losses become immediately deductible. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 23 Key Design Considerations Comment 6 Should there be roll over relief? Comprehensive response Roll-over relief will be needed otherwise a CGT will result in many unwanted incentives, for example lock in features for many assets Roll over should be allowed in the situations where the taxpayer dies. Consider a company that is wholly owned by a deceased taxpayer. It seems very bad policy design that any gains on the death of the taxpayer will be crystallised where the same gain will arise when the company disposes of the asset. Rollover would not be required if the targeted approach is pursued Corporates/SMEs require roll-over relief otherwise restructuring and M&A activity will have an unwarranted tax impediment. 7 Should any allowance be given for inflation in calculating capital gains? Comprehensive response: With a comprehensive CGT regime, assets will be taxed when that are held over considerably long time periods. Over such periods inflation is a real issue. To not recognise the effects of inflation will result in unfair outcomes. For example, if an asset is acquired for $500,000 band is disposed of in 10 years’ time for say $600,000 there would appear to be a gain of $100,000. If inflation occurred during that time that meant the $500,000 is now worth $650,000, economically the taxpayer has suffered a $50,000 loss. To now tax the $100,000 gain will be to increase the losses made by the taxpayer. The only logical solution is to remove the inflation portion of the gain. Some countries have address this by adjusting the rate of CGT by reduce the level of inclusion of capital gain subject to CGT. These approaches add considerable complexity and introduce additional boundaries which do not solve the issues with inflation. 8 What should the rate of tax on capital gains be? Comprehensive response If the decision is made to tax capital gains, then the tax rate should be the tax rate applying to ordinary income. Having a different rate simply adds complexity and boundary issues. OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 24 Key Design Considerations Comment 9 How would a CGT integrate with current tax laws? To minimise compliance costs, capital gains should simply be deemed income. Assuming this, further comments are added below. Comprehensive response The FDR rules will need to be reconsidered. The FDR regime should be repeals and replaced with a CGT. We note this is likely to reduce government revenue given the ability for long term investors to defer ultimate realisation and NZ tax. We believe there should be an active exemption for capital gains made by CFCs. This is what the Australian rules provide for. This is partly due to most capital gains are taxed in foreign jurisdictions and most dividends are tax exempt when paying dividends from foreign CFCs. That is, if a CFC is to be sold resulting in a large capital gain, this gain can be materially reduced (if not eliminated) by simply paying a large pre-sale exempt dividend. If rules are designed to prevent this, it will result in overly complex rules the have illogical boundaries. Hence, we recommend an exemption be provided for capital gains made by CFCs. The livestock regimes will need to be reconsidered. Currently many farmers apply the herd livestock regime which result in the farmers opening stock being revalued using that years closing stock figures. This produces a tax-free capital gain. If a comprehensive CGT is put in place the initial view would be that these revaluations be treated as taxable amounts however this is an unrealised capital gains tax that will result in farmers paying tax even though they have not realised any cash profits. Rules prevent double taxation will be required. For example, in a situation of a widely held family company which has material untaxed capital gains, say on farm land. In such circumstances there are commonly changes between the various shareholders. If such share changed occur which trigger capital gains, there is unlikely to be any relief for the full CGT payable if the farm is sold. This is a clear and unjustified imposition of double tax. Equally with double tax, officials are likely to require complex rules to ensure taxpayers do not double count deduction (or cost basis). OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 25 Key Design Considerations Comment 10 What administrative implications would there be from a CGT? Administrative and compliance costs will be substantial. Comprehensive response With a comprehensive CGT, there will be many taxpayers that do not file tax returns and do not have advisers that may be subject to the rules. This is obviously subject to the breath of such a CGT. It will likely include holiday homes, direct shareholdings in listed companies (many of these people who own few shares do not have to file tax returns, especially if their margin tax rate is 33%). These taxpayers will need to keep records of the original cost, capital improvements, treatment of dividend reinvestments, disposals, off-market transfers, gifts etc. Depending on design there will potentially be greater number of taxpayers that have to file returns and obtain valuations. Compliance with CGT legislative requirements would be beyond the majority of average taxpayers necessitating the use of professionals and increasing compliance costs. 11 What rules should govern the transition into a CGT? Comprehensive and targeted response The options would appear to be to apply the rules to: • Assets acquired post a set date (i.e. pre-CGT assets excluded; or • At the election of the taxpayer, the higher of market value of cost. We discussed this above. Both options have major shortcomings and substantial compliance costs. On balance we prefer the Australian approach to only apply CGT on assets acquired post CGT. 12 Other matters for consideration Other issues include: • Whether a CGT provides comfort for depreciation on buildings to now be allowed (which we argue should be addressed in any event) • How depreciation on assets subject to CGT interface OLIVERSHAW LTD TAX SPECIALISTS 26 Key Design Considerations Comment • How to prevent double taxation and double deductions (partly noted above) • What assets are subject to the regime, e.g. holiday homes, luxury/high priced cruise ships, barges, artwork, jewellery • How do interface CGT with private consumption – with holiday homes and partly private assets, a CGT (if applied) only taxes the gain post any reduction in value due to consumption – how is this adjusted for? For example, where a taxpayer buys a holiday home (or boat, plane etc) and sells it as a loss, that loss is entirely due to the cost of consumption by the taxpayer. Why is this a deductible capital loss? If the asset is sold at a gain, that gain also reflects 100% cost of the reduction due to consumption by the taxpayer? • What receipts are subject to CGT, compensation payments, civil damages, defamation receipts etc

This submission has been coordinated by Louise Delany, who welcomes discussion if required. Yo urs sincerely Professor Diana Sarfati Head of Department \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 1 Submission of the Department of Public Health, University of Otago, Wellington, to the Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 30 April 2018 PART ONE OVERVIEW The Department of Public Health, University of Otago, Wellington, welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to this taxation review. An effective and fair taxation system is fundamental to a good society. The Department bases its submission on values that underpin public health policy and concepts of social justice; evidence informing that policy; and Treaty of Waitangi provisions and principles. Structure of this submission Following this overview, we set out our recommendations in Part Two. Part Three responds in more detail to the chapters in the Tax Working Group Background Paper (BP) and its questions. Several questions elicit identical responses; to avoid duplication we have cross-referred some responses. This submission draws on material in other submissions. In particular, the section on tobacco taxation is a summary of the ASPIRE 2025 submission (ASPIRE 2025 is based in the University of Otago Wellington). We have drawn on Alcohol Healthwatch’s submission on issues relating to alcohol, and have discussed ideas on our submissions with the CTU, OXFAM, NZNO, and Equality Network. The section on housing draws in part on a submission from the New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities. While many of our recommendations focus on different areas from those other organisations, we believe there is general consistency on principles. Preliminary comments Need for measures both in the short and long term: Design of any taxation system should be evolutionary and able to respond to changing circumstances, many of which may be unforeseeable. Design also needs to take into account public and political acceptability. While most of our recommendations could be implemented in the relatively short term (ie within the next five years), we also suggest some changes that New Zealand could work towards over the medium or long term. Recognition that tax alone cannot be effective in achieving goals. We are aware that tax strategies, while very useful in achieving some social goals, are also not sufficient, and that ideally taxation measures should take effect in conjunction with other measures, regulatory and non-regulatory. Need for tax to be linked to expenditure measures: It is unfortunate that this review is not linked to other vital aspects of a taxation system: namely the use of funds generated by tax revenue. The planned and related review of the welfare/transfer system has not yet begun. It is difficult to discuss the purpose and principles of tax when some of the aims of taxation 2 require a focus on, and are justified by, what that revenue is to be used for. As acknowledged on p. 20 of the BP: “when thinking about the distribution of taxes, equity and fairness, it is best to think of the tax and transfer system overall, rather than individual taxes in isolation.” Some of our recommendations, therefore, take into account issues relating to the overall tax and transfer system, and may also need to be modified in light of outcomes of the planned transfer review. We recommend that the Draft Report of the Tax Working Group (TWG) - scheduled for September 2018 - be aligned as far as possible with the Transfer Review (whose work will hopefully be advanced at that stage). Overview What is a good tax system? A taxation system for New Zealand, including both revenue gathering and tax expenditure, constitutes the foundation of a modern society that should be based on fairness; facilitate social and economic well-being, and financial stability; in a way that is environmentally sustainable; and: • generate sufficient revenue to provides appropriate social infrastructure and services to enable attainment of social, health and other common good goals; • reduce inequalities within New Zealand between communities, over time and between generations; • eliminate child poverty; • contribute towards the lessening of global inequalities. This vision of a good taxation system provides the following criteria for assessing the performance of New Zealand’s tax system: • does the system enable economic productivity that is environmentally sustainable? • does the system contribute to achieving public goods such as improved health, enhanced environments, and minimisation of New Zealand’s contribution to climate change? • does the system generate sufficient revenue to; • provide appropriate social infrastructure and services to enable attainment of social, health and other common good goals? • reduce inequalities within New Zealand between communities and across generations? • eliminate child poverty? and • contribute towards the lessening of global inequalities? What is fairness? We identify many aspects of what contributes to ‘fairness’ that underpin this overall concept for a fair taxation system. We support the general principles and values set out in the TWG BP, but also suggest some further aspects of fairness. These elements of fairness are interrelated; they do not always align and may sometimes have different implications. 3 Together, with some compromises between different facets of fairness, they underlie a fair tax system. 1. Fairness in the New Zealand setting involves partnership and protection principles derived from the Treaty of Waitangi; 2. Fairness involves similar tax treatment of similar taxpayers (ie, ‘horizontal equity’, as referred to in the BP); 3. Fairness relates to cultural norms of ‘what is fair’, in particular a recognition that tax contributions relate to benefits received; 4. Fairness provides for contributing differently in accordance with different capacity (‘vertical equity’ as identified in the BP). This aspect of fairness implies a system of progressive taxation with redistribution of wealth and resources to reduce inequalities and poverty; 5. Fairness in taxation calls for tax policy that enables implementation of human rights, in particular a child’s right to well-being and freedom from poverty. Fairness in taxation and the realisation of human rights will be critical to implementing the Sustainable Development Goals. New Zealand has treaty obligations in this area (eg, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child). This aspect of fairness involves both attention to human rights in New Zealand and bringing about a more equitable global society in which all thrive. The Human Rights Commission has highlighted human rights obligations to which New Zealand is committed, (Human Rights Commission of New Zealand, 2018) with reference to the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights; and the Report of the Special Rapporteur,(Alston, 2015) who noted in para 53 that ‘tax policy is ...human rights policy’. We also refer to the Lima Declaration on Tax Justice and Human Rights: “Tax revenue is the most important, the most reliable and the most sustainable instrument to resource human rights in sufficient, equitable and accountable ways.”(Center for Economic and Social Rights et al., 2015); 6. Fairness requires offsetting externalities where the market has failed to address negative effects created by particular activities - health, social, or environmental; 7. Fairness requires recognition of the need for compensation for harms, historic and continuing, that have in part caused global poverty and inequalities. This is relevant to inequalities between countries; and also relevant to inequalities between particular groups within countries; 8. Fairness acknowledges connections between the sources of tax revenue and their use: Revenue that is gathered in order to compensate for historical harms, externalities, or to influence corporate/individual behaviour, should be used, at least in part, to address those harms and externalities. 4 Strategies for achieving a good tax system The three main sources of tax revenue are taxes on income, goods/services, and assets. We recommend the following changes to the taxation system to enhance fairness and help achieve public goods: 1. Tax on income be more progressive (to reduce inequalities, poverty); 2. Tax on goods/services be reduced (to reduce inequalities, poverty); 3. Taxes on wealth form a proportionately greater source of tax revenue. In addition: 4. Taxes on income and wealth focus as much on corporate entities as well as individuals; 5. Reforms are needed to ensure that cross-border taxes are collected rather than being avoided, evaded, and generally not paid; 6. A greater focus is needed on taxes on goods, services and activities which create externalities (for the environment, health, and other common good objectives) in order both to reduce the extent and nature of relevant activities and compensate for their externalities. We consider that measures to achieve the recommended aims through a reconfigured taxation system should together enable a higher overall tax take sufficient to minimise inequalities, eliminate child poverty, and attain social goals; and reduce implications of tax for specific groups through a lower rate of income tax for low-income groups and reduced GST on most items. Our submission provides background on many of the issues raised in the BP and discusses some specific ideas such as relating to wealth taxes. We recognise that many of such issues are complex, and that evidence on efficacy of some proposals may vary. We emphasise, therefore, that for some topics we are less concerned about how any of the particular aims (as set out above) are achieved - for example there may be a number of feasible options for increasing the proportion of tax revenue derived from wealth – provided that the general aim of an increase is attained. We note, however, that reasons for rejecting a possible measures because ‘it hasn’t worked in the past’ may not remain forever valid. Technological changes may in some cases make implementation of some measures (such as forms of wealth taxes) more feasible now. 5 PART TWO: SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS The following recommendations follow, broadly speaking, the chapters in the Tax Working Group Background Paper (BP). Some recommendations are identified as more long term, while others are achievable in the short term, ie within the next five years. The final two recommendations do not relate to substance but on process. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. That change is needed for a positive tax culture; that is, a culture that sees fair taxation as an essential basis for a good society; recognising that: (1) Tax policies over recent decades in New Zealand have, in conjunction with other policies, helped increase inequalities and reflect distrust of the state’s role in furthering explicit social goals; (2) It is time to reintroduce social wellbeing as the paramount aim of tax and social policy in order to reduce inequality, achieve social justice, and attempt to avert environmental disaster. 2. That the following concept of a good tax system, with its underlying values, are endorsed: (1) A taxation system for New Zealand, including both revenue gathering and tax expenditure, constitutes the foundation of a modern society that should be based on fairness; facilitate social and economic well-being, and financial stability; in a way that is environmentally sustainable; and: a. Generate sufficient revenue to provide appropriate social infrastructure and services to enable attainment of social, health and other common good goals; b. Reduce inequalities within New Zealand between communities and between generations; c. Eliminate child poverty; d. Contribute towards the lessening of global inequalities. (2) Aspects of fairness that underpin a good taxation system include: a. Partnership and protection principles derived from the Treaty of Waitangi; b. Similar tax treatment of similar taxpayers (‘horizontal equity’); c. Cultural norms of ‘what is fair’, eg that tax contributions relate to benefits received; d. Contributing differently in accordance with different ability; e. Enabling implementation of human rights, in particular a child’s right to well-being and freedom from poverty; f. Offsetting externalities where the market has failed to address negative effects created by particular activities - health, social, or environmental; g. Recognition of the need for compensation for harms, historic and continuing, that have in part caused global poverty and inequalities - relevant to inequalities between and within countries. h. Acknowledges connections between the sources of tax revenue and their use: Revenue that is gathered in order to compensate for historical harms, externalities, or to influence corporate/individual behaviour, should be used, at least in part, to address those harms and externalities. 6 3. That the following strategies for the overall design of a good system are adopted, along with policies for tax expenditure: (1) A significantly higher tax take implemented incrementally; (2) Comprehensive progressivity on income tax: this would involve treating all income as eligible for tax, ie income from wages, salaries, transfers, benefits, superannuation, income from trusts, and rents; with reduced levels of tax up to certain levels of income; and higher rates at upper levels; (3) Wealth tax: Taxes on wealth should constitute a greater proportion of tax revenue. It is recognised that options for introducing wealth taxes need to be carefully explored. Options to be considered could include taxation on land, wealth, capital, comprehensive capital gains, inheritance, gifts, and stamp duties. Suggestions have also been made for the reduction of taxes on retirement savings for those born after 1980. There are also options as to how any wealth tax would be paid (eg via a small annual percentage tax paid on high wealth). Further issues related specifically to housing are discussed in responding to Ch 7 Specific Challenges; (4) Continuation of, but possible reduction in level of, consumption tax (GST) for most items: reduction is justified on the grounds that GST contributes to inequalities. However GST for some goods and services should be continued at current levels and increases in specific taxes considered (eg (tobacco, alcohol, sugar sweetened beverages, with appropriate hypothecation of revenue (see below); (5) Corporate entity tax to be comprehensive but also more nuanced. That is, corporate taxes should cover all entities with different kinds of corporate status, such as trusts and corporations; and as far as possible should be taxed as similar rates (eg trusts and corporations should be taxed at similar rates to reduce incentives for restructuring for tax avoidance purposes); (6) Options for financial transaction taxes, and other taxes relevant to corporates including diverted profit taxes, should be considered as long term options (long term recommendation); (7) On the transfer side, our system should ensure greater levels of transfer payments for children and families to mitigate, in particular, child poverty; (8) Consideration of a universal basic income for those without work, both to reduce inequalities and poverty, and recognise the importance of time spent on such activities as child and elder care, artistic endeavour, amateur sport, or involvement with non-governmental organisations (long term recommendation); (9) Taxes to modify individual and corporate behaviour for the public good (see below); (10) Minimisation of cross-border tax avoidance (see below). 4. That taxes to modify corporate and individual activity/behaviour are legitimate where externalities are created and health, social and environmental harms exist; specific examples relevant to health (for environmental harms, see below) are: 7 1) Tobacco: a. Government mandated tobacco prices: The tobacco tax system should include fixed retail prices and maximum prices before tax.(Branston & Gilmore, 2014; Gilmore, Branston, & Sweanor, 2010); b. Dedicated tax: Until 2025, the dedication of at least $100m of tobacco tax revenue annually creating an environment that minimises smoking uptake and supports smokers to quit; c. Tobacco tax rises: Continuing to use tobacco tax increases to reduce smoking prevalence, as long as a proportion of tobacco tax revenue is used for tobacco control, and smokefree policy changes are made to make it easier for smokers to quit; d. Differential increase in loose tobacco tax: Ensure that roll your own cigarettes are not a cheaper alternative to factory made cigarettes and do not encourage smokers to switch between products as an alternative to quitting. This can be done by implementing a differentially greater increase in loose tobacco roll your own taxation, monitoring the impact and repeating as necessary. 2) Alcohol: a. Alcohol excise rates to be raised by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10% b. Excise rates to be adjusted annually to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers) c. Rates of excise tax should be calculated on alcohol content, not volume of beverage; If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be based on the highest alcohol content for that category of alcoholic beverage d. Alcohol taxes be implemented along with a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy to address the availability of very cheap alcohol which may reduce the impact of tax increases e. The existing level of tax hypothecation should be increased. 3) Sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) a. A tax on these beverages should be put in place in conjunction with other measures to decrease availability and consumption b. The tax system for SSBs should be designed to maximise the stimulus to manufacturers to reformulate products to have a lower sugar content as well as discouraging consumption by consumers. 4) Options for taxes relating to products and services with adverse health consequences, such as forms of non-nutritious food, and gambling, to be kept under review in the light of evidence of harm and efficacy of measures (long-term recommendation) 5. That the TWG recognise that tax minimisation strategies on the part of corporates and individuals with cross-border reach results in significant loss of revenue to New Zealand (as well as other countries); noting in particular that: (1) The Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill currently before the New Zealand Parliament takes only modest steps towards reducing the level to 8 which corporations and wealthy individuals are enabled to avoid tax, and should, at least, not be weakened; (2) As the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill in itself will do little to address basic issues, the TWG should agree to a process of reviewing cross- border transactions that would go wider than the present Bill, and focus on (1) unitary taxation enabling taxation of whole corporate entities and (2) a coherent international regime overseen by an appropriate international body (long-term recommendation). 6. That hypothecation/dedication of specific taxes for specific health, environmental or common good purposes is justified, in appropriate cases, in order to: (1) Ensure continuity of funding; (2) Provide visible and tangible evidence of governmental commitment to reduction of social harm; (3) Identify clearly, for those who pay such taxes, their eligibility for services in return, ie support in improving their health and environmental protection; (4) Provide reassurance that the purpose of common good taxes is not only revenue generation but health and environmental improvement; (5) Signal, in symbolic but important ways, recognition of the reciprocal duties and relationships inherent in any tax system between state and citizens. 7. Housing (1) A capital gains tax should be introduced/extended which includes assets such as all investment properties, as well as other properties capable of generating capital gain; (2) The tax categorisation of expenditures on rental housing should be revised as an incentive for bringing a property up to the Building Code, or the regulatory standards under the Healthy Homes Guarantee Act 2017 (whichever standards are higher), so that the costs of bringing rental property up to the Code would be treated as ‘maintenance’ not ‘improvement’. 8. Environmental taxes: that the use of taxation for environmental protection (in conjunction with other policy measures) be endorsed: (1) For goods and services throughout their life cycles: eg collection, production, use, disposal; in all domains eg transport; energy production/use; food water production use; agricultural /pastoral/forestry/fishing activity; housing construction; and technological construction; (2) That (ideally) a system with tax incentives and disincentives for all goods and services be adopted, based on certification of products and services against standards relevant to the environment, health and human rights, (long term recommendation); (3) A specific focus on carbon tax to replace the existing emissions scheme, ideally both hypothecated and designed to be overall revenue-neutral; (4) Consideration to be given to other taxes relevant to the environment, eg fertilisers, pesticides, (long term recommendation). 9 9. That the process of submission analysis be seen as a beginning for the TWG, not the end, and that: (1) Ways of continuing conversations be developed - eg with invitations for oral discussions and provision for further input and information; (2) The TWG identify from their submission analysis possible gaps in the range of submissions received and create further opportunities for submissions from any relevant communities or groups; (3) Creative ways be developed for ensuring productive and inclusive discussion on the first draft of the TWG report in September 2018. 10. Alignment of reviews: We recommend that the Draft Report of the TWG (scheduled for September 2018) be aligned as far as possible with the Transfer Review (whose work will hopefully be advanced at that stage). 10 PART THREE: RESPONSES TO TWG BP SPECIFIC CHAPTERS Response to Chapter 2 Background Paper: The future environment This chapter asks: What is seen as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? Many of the issues identified in chapter 2 are clearly important to considering the future environment in which a tax system would operate: changing demographics, te ao Māori; the changing nature of work, technological change, and patterns of globalisation. We are, however, uncomfortable with the chapter’s framing of inequality issues: the challenge is posed as a ‘concern about inequality’ rather than inequality itself! We have four main points about the background paper’s (BP) outline of future issues: 1: The paper does not mention ‘poverty’ as a main risk/challenge over the medium to long term and, specifically, does not refer to child poverty. We consider that poverty and its amelioration or, worded more positively, child rights to wellbeing, provide a challenge and opportunity for changes to the tax system. The Living Standards Framework developed by Treasury identifies four capitals that are essential for intergenerational wellbeing. Three of these capitals - human, social, and economic - are directly influenced by child wellbeing. Thus, in addition to the moral and legal imperative of supporting children’s wellbeing as codified in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, an investment in children is an investment in our collective future.(Boston, 2014) Children born into adverse early environments are at risk of experiencing poor outcomes in virtually every domain of health and wellbeing, with more adverse outcomes for each increment of increasing disadvantage.(Goldfeld et al., 2018) These inequities play out across the life-course in multiple ways including increased risk of physical and mental health problems, lower educational attainment and reduced employment capability. All of these inequities can be observed in the New Zealand population.(Baker et al., 2012; Boston, 2014) Moreover, if not addressed in time, early disadvantage in one generation is transmitted on to the next through multiple pathways including the programming effect of pervasive, long-term stress (also known as toxic stress) on unborn children. (Shonkoff et al., 2012) A substantial body of research evidence demonstrates the mechanisms through which poverty gets ‘under the skin’ to influence child wellbeing.(King et al., 2012) Family income matters for children, although measures for increasing family income should take effect in conjunction with other policies to mitigate the consequences of child poverty (Cooper & Stewart, 2013; Gershoff, Aber, Raver, & Lennon, 2007) 11 2: The BP understates some of the combined implications of globalisation, digitalisation, and changing patterns of work. Digital technologies and the use of artificial intelligence are likely to disrupt the nature of work, lead to an increase in levels of transient unemployment, eliminate jobs, lead to widening inequality, and threaten tax revenue.(Boyd & Wilson, 2017) 3: The BP identifies ‘falling company tax rates’ as a risk (or challenge, or opportunity). This is the only instance in this chapter where issues to do with corporate taxation are mentioned. This view of corporate taxation issues, and the conclusions to which it leads, i.e: ”New Zealand must be aware of the international environment and future governments should have the option of reducing the company tax rate if this is considered sensible..’ (p 14) is extremely limited as a perspective on the challenges and risks posed by international tax law/policy. It invites the solution of a ‘race to the bottom’ which has been detrimental at both national and international levels. The risks to the tax system posed by corporate taxation issues are far broader than that outlined, stemming from arrangements that enable minimal tax to be paid. While this is more clearly seen at the international level, given other issues identified in this chapter, especially globalisation and changing technology, it is not possible to separate international aspects of taxation from national ones. We return to ‘opportunities’ for corporate taxation issues in our response to ch 6, on cross-border transactions. 4: The last risk/opportunity identified in this chapter of the BP is that of ‘environmental challenges’. While we do not disagree with what is said, we believe the paras on P 14-15 significantly underplay the significance of environmental challenges. The two examples discussed - climate change and biodiversity – are major; but the chapter does not confront head on a central issue: can economic productivity and growth be consistent with environmental sustainability, and if so how? To summarise our views on this chapter, we agree with the most of the risks and challenges set out, but would add: 1. Child poverty is a risk and challenge; 2. Inequality, not ‘concern about inequality’ should be recognised as a challenge; 3. Changing patterns of work have the potential to significantly increase inequalities 4. Implied concerns about New Zealand’s relatively high corporate tax rates are the least of problems associated with corporate activities; 5. The risks posed by environmental degradation are understated and avoid confrontation between drives towards economic growth on the one hand and global survival on the other. Response to chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Chapter 3 asks for ideas on principles for assessing the performance of the tax system and definitions of ‘fairness’. We support the general principles and values set out in the background paper, but expand on them further, as set out in our Introduction with our high-level perspective on taxation, and concepts of fairness. 12 Response to chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Chapter 4 asks questions about (1) the overall design of our tax system, (2) any greater role for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour; and (3) issues about retirement. Overall design of our tax system While in principle the concept of a system that is broad-based and as low-rate is reasonable, these ideas are a means to an end rather than the end itself. The more fundamental question is the extent to which our tax system contributes towards societal wellbeing in a way that is socially just and environmentally sustainable for future generations as well as our own. Trends in tax policy since the 1980s (in New Zealand and elsewhere) have occurred in conjunction with other policies that aim to contribute to the free operation of markets and efficiency (Christensen, 2017)(p 6). These policies neglect inequalities and implicitly distrust the state’s role in furthering explicit social goals. Compared with OECD countries we are a low tax country (low 30% of GDP compared with mid 40% of Scandinavian countries - prosperous nations with high quality of life). Taxation can affect both wealth and income inequality. Income and wealth inequality in New Zealand have grown significantly since the mid-1980s. High levels of income and wealth inequality have harmful effects on many determinants and pathways related to social wellbeing, levels of cohesion and cooperation in society and the economy. In more recent times economic growth has slowed but inequalities have not decreased. In fact, there are risks that inequalities may over time become exacerbated with changing patterns of employment, eg, rapid advances in digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, threaten to widen wealth and income inequalities, and may lead to an increase in levels of transient or ongoing unemployment. It is also now clear that market-oriented policies in general have had detrimental environmental consequences with consequences for the current major threat to planetary health and human wellbeing – climate change. Given the implications of inequalities, poverty, environmental degradation and climate change for public health and child health, and wellbeing, a system that is more progressively based is needed. This should be more broadly based, with a greater proportions of revenue from taxes on wealth, environmental externalities and cross-border activity; and implemented in a way that does not damage the poor. Strategies for implementing a good tax system A significantly higher tax take: In order to reduce inequalities, eliminate child poverty, and attain a range of social and common good goals, including the provision of appropriate health and social infrastructure and services, a higher overall tax take is required: possibly in incremental stages up to 40% of GDP. Comprehensive progressivity on income tax: this would involve treating all income as eligible for tax with reduced levels of tax up to certain levels of income. eg income from wages, salaries, transfers, benefits, superannuation, income from trusts, rents, all realised capital gain including the family home, inheritances, and gifts. 13 Some form of wealth tax or taxes: Current tax settings do not fairly or adequately tax high levels of wealth and we consider that options for introducing wealth taxes should be carefully explored. There are a number of types of tax on wealth that exist around the world and/or are proposed, ranging from the very general (the concept of a net wealth tax) to the specific - such as capital gains tax, inheritance taxes, gift duties, and stamp duties. Such specific taxes have been used in this country in the past. (We recognise that New Zealand does have a form of capital gains tax, but it is not a comprehensive one given it does not apply to all rental houses or houses occupied by their owners.) The aim of taxing wealth is to collect revenue, redistribute wealth more fairly, treat income earned through rises in capital value consistently across different types of assets (e.g. housing or investments) and to design a system that is not easily avoided. We recognise that it is not easy to tax wealth effectively, but it remains important to try to ensure that high wealth holders contribute to the wellbeing of all through the tax system. Issues relating to wealth inequalities, and wealth taxes are discussed in the New Zealand PSA booklet: (New Zealand Public Service Association, 2017)). Wealth taxes are suggested such as the reinstatement of estate and gift duties. “A simple and progressive structure for an estate duty would be to exempt an amount approximately equal to the median house price ($550,000 at time of writing) and tax the remainder at the top income tax rate which is currently 33% but should be higher ..’ https://www.psa.org.nz/media/news/progressive- thinking-ten-perspectives-on-tax/. A small annual percentage tax paid on high wealth could generate significant revenue but its annual cost to individual asset holders would not be great enough to encourage avoidance or tax minimisation strategies. Many of these issues are canvassed in a recent OECD study(OECD, 2018a) which suggests that ‘there is a strong case for addressing wealth inequality through the tax system’ and that while options include a net wealth tax, there are also options for ‘personal capital income tax’, inheritance and gift taxes. The report has useful recommendations for both designing wealth taxes and putting them into effect. http://www.oecd.org/tax/the-role-and-design- of-net-wealth-taxes-in-the-oecd-9789264290303-en.htm The OECD concludes that countries that do not have significant taxes on personal capital income or inheritance taxes could benefit from a form of “net wealth tax” that include various kinds of annual tax on individual wealth stocks, net of debt. Continuation of, but possible reduction in level of, consumption tax (GST) for most items: reduction is justified on the grounds that GST contributes to inequalities. However GST for some goods and services which adversely affect public goods such as health and the environment should be continued at current levels with increases in specific taxes considered eg, tobacco, alcohol, SSB), with appropriate hypothecation as discussed below. Corporate entity tax to be comprehensive but also more nuanced. That is, corporate taxes should cover all entities with kinds of corporate status, such as trusts and corporations; and as far as possible should be taxed as similar rates (eg trusts and corporations should be taxed at similar rates to reduce incentives for restructuring in order to avoid tax). 14 Effective measures to increase tax revenue by reducing cross-border tax avoidance. This needs not only effective implementation of the current Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Sharing) Bill; but, more importantly, measures to ensure a unitary approach to taxing multinationals and a more coherent international taxation governance approach (eg through creating an appropriate global body). This issue is discussed further in response to chapter 6 BP. Effective reduction of cross-border tax avoidance would help contribute also to effective implementation of wealth taxes. Specific taxes to compensate for externalities and/or influence for social objectives corporate and or individual activities (eg, tobacco, alcohol, sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) taxes, environmental taxes). This issue is discussed further below, with reference to tobacco, alcohol, SSB; and with reference to environmental issues in response to chapter 7 BP. Our system also, on the transfer side, should envisage: 1. greater levels of transfer payments for children and families to mitigate, in particular, child poverty; 2. consideration of a universal basic income (UBI) for those without work, both to reduce inequalities and poverty, and recognise the importance of time spent on such activities as child and elder care, artistic endeavour, amateur sport, or involvement with non-governmental organisations. Use of tax for behaviour modification Tax always and inevitably influences corporate and individual behaviour, whether intentionally or not. By its very nature tax involves incentives and disincentives that have implications for economic activity. Hence while we agree that tax has a role in modifying behaviour, primarily at the corporate but also individual level, exploring the function of tax in relation to behaviour modification is not a new form of ‘nanny state-ism’. Instead it is acknowledgement that tax can and should be used to help achieve common good goals. P 26 of BP sets out two justifications for using taxes for these purposes; based on (1) externalities and (2) motivating individuals who might not otherwise act in their own best interest. A third justification which frames the externality issue at a higher level is the role of tax in shaping a society that seeks to achieve common good goals, ie economic wellbeing, human rights, social justice, and environmental sustainability. Extent of externalities: An example of the extent of possible externalities comes from the health sector which accounts for $15.6 billion of government expenditure (the second largest expenditure source after Social Security and Welfare). Using the tax system to prevent disease has the potential to reduce the tax take needed to maintain current provision of services, or to provide additional government services within the existing revenue collected. For example, our modelling work shows that a strategy of future tobacco tax increases would save NZ$ 1.1 billion in future health system costs (over the lifetimes of New Zealanders alive in 2011) (Blakely et al., 2015) – in addition to the additional tax revenue raised (L. J. Cobiac, Ikeda, Nghiem, Blakely, & Wilson, 2015). Similarly, a salt tax could save NZ$ 1.0 billion in health 15 system costs (as well as raising $452 million in revenue per year) (Nghiem, Blakely, Cobiac, Pearson, & Wilson, 2015) . Specific issues: Specific products and services that relate to activities with a range of harms and for which taxation should be considered, primarily at the corporate level but with some implications for individuals, are: 1. Tobacco; 2. Alcohol; 3. Sugar sweetened beverages; 4. Other products and services with potential harm consequences such as non- nutritious food and gambling. Our specific recommendations on these issues are: (ideas on environmental taxes are set out in our response to chapter 6) Tobacco Research indicates that tobacco tax increases are the most effective single way of reducing tobacco smoking prevalence, initiation and inequalities in smoking.(Hiscock et al., 2017) In New Zealand, the decline of smoking prevalence and tobacco sales has been helped by the recent (2010-18) period of regular above inflation tax increases.(Health Promotion Agency, 2018; N Wilson et al., 2017) Tobacco tax increases in New Zealand can produce further health gains, reduce health inequalities and generate cost-savings for the health system. (Blakely et al., 2015; Cleghorn et al., 2017; L. J. Cobiac et al., 2015; van der Deen et al., 2017) There are also some risks from high tobacco taxes. These include financial harm to smokers, increased tobacco- related retail robberies, and encouraging smuggling and an illegal tobacco market. (Ajmal & U, 2015; L. J. Cobiac et al., 2015) These risks can be reduced (by retail legislation and better tobacco control policy) or are minimal (the illegal market). The best available evidence suggests illicit tobacco sales are and will be a small problem in New Zealand (Ajmal & U, 2015; L. J. Cobiac et al., 2015) and the degree to which retail- related robberies have increased and if they have the contribution of tobacco taxes is uncertain. However, it is widely perceived as a problem. However, rather than changing the tobacco taxation policy and abandoning an effective means to reduce smoking uptake and promote quitting, the best approach may be to implement complementary tobacco control measures such as restricting where tobacco can be sold to more highly secure premises. There can be financial harm for smokers who do not quit or sufficiently reduce smoking after tobacco tax increases, though any harm to health among smokers is small relative to the health benefits to those who quit smoking. (N. Wilson, Thomson, Tobias, & Blakely, 2004) The economic effects are also mixed – for examples smokers who quit or never start as a result of tobacco tax increases will benefit greatly economically. However, some disadvantaged continuing smokers (and their families) will suffer significant adverse financial consequences. Such consequences could be ameliorated by other changes to the 16 tax system (e.g. reduced GST and lower income tax for people on low incomes) to promote reduced poverty and inequalities. In addition, these adverse impacts could be minimised through hypothecation of some of the tobacco tax revenue to measures to promote and support quitting, particularly for low income smokers. This approach is supported by the finding that New Zealand smokers support tobacco tax increases as long as some of the tax revenue is dedicated to helping them quit. (N. Wilson et al., 2010) Recommendations: 1. Government mandated tobacco prices: The use of a tobacco tax system that includes fixed retail prices and maximum prices before tax.(Branston & Gilmore, 2014; Gilmore et al., 2010); 2. Dedicated tax: Until 2025, the dedication of at least $100m of tobacco tax revenue annually creating an environment that minimises smoking uptake and supports smokers to quit; 3. Tobacco tax rises: Continuing to use tobacco tax increases to reduce smoking prevalence, as long as a proportion of tobacco tax revenue is used for tobacco control, and smokefree policy changes are made to make it easier for smokers to quit; 4. Differential increase in loose tobacco tax: Ensure that roll your own cigarettes are not a cheaper alternative to factory made cigarettes and do not encourage smokers to switch between products as an alternative to quitting. This can be done by implementing a differentially greater increase in loose tobacco roll your own taxation, monitoring the impact and repeating as necessary. Alcohol Alcohol causes significant harm. In the short-term, alcohol is associated with increased rates of injury and criminal offending. (Boden, Fergusson, & Horwood, 2013; Gmel & Rehm, 2003). Longer-term alcohol consumption increases risk of chronic diseases, such as liver cirrhosis, cancer and alcohol dependence.(Shield, Parry, & Rehm, 2013) While there is some evidence that low-level drinking may have a protective effect against non-fatal heart attacks, the risk for other cardiovascular diseases (eg, stroke) is increased, and the total net harm to health is increased above 100 grams of alcohol per week. Indeed, there is six months life expectancy loss estimated for consumption at only >100 to ≤200 g of alcohol per week \[22\], or 10 to 20 standard drinks per week in New Zealand. (Parry, Patra, & Rehm, 2011) In addition to harms for the drinker, various New Zealand studies show how important harm to others from alcohol in this country.(Connor & Casswell, 2009, 2012; Connor, You, & Casswell, 2009) Some of the worst examples are where alcohol is a component of road traffic deaths involving others, violent crime against others, and lifetime harm to others via foetal alcohol spectrum disorder and child neglect. The total health harm from alcohol use makes it the fifth most important risk factor (albeit with other drugs) for health loss in New Zealand. (Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation) As such, alcohol use is a major contributor to health costs, to lost productivity for New Zealand businesses (and therefore tax revenue to the government) and to financial costs to society associated with crime, including property damage, police and court time, and incarceration. 17 These problems help justify relatively high alcohol taxes on negative externality grounds and promotion of individual and societal welfare. Increases in alcohol excise rates are urgently required to address the growing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. In 2016, there were 179,000 more hazardous drinkers than in 2012. Almost every group defined by age, ethnicity and sex has increased their drinking since 2011. The greatest increases are among women. There remain significant inequities in alcohol-related harm between Māori and non-Māori. Raising the tax on alcohol would provide a price incentive to reduce consumption, and therefore reduce the harm and associated health and societal costs. Increasing alcohol tax has been widely recommended by health experts in New Zealand and also in a thorough Law Commission Report. (Law Commission, 2009) Increasing alcohol tax is very likely to produce health gain, particularly by reducing injuries (see these 2 systematic reviews: (Elder et al., 2010; Wagenaar, Tobler, & Komro, 2010)). Higher alcohol taxes are also likely to save health system costs eg, according to Australian modelling work. (L. Cobiac, Vos, Doran, & Wallace, 2009) Recommendations: 1. Alcohol excise rates to be raised by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10%; 2. Excise rates to be adjusted annually to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers); 3. Rates of excise tax should be calculated on alcohol content, not volume of beverage; If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be based on the highest alcohol content for that category of alcoholic; 4. Alcohol taxes be implemented along with a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy to address the availability of very cheap alcohol; 5. The existing level of tax hypothecation should be increased. Sugar sweetened beverages We consider that the epidemics of obesity and diabetes justify the adoption of taxes on sugary drinks. There are a growing number of countries and American cities that are adopting taxes on sugary drinks;(Backholer, Blake, & Vandevijvere, 2017) and there is evidence of their efficacy. Possibly of most relevance to New Zealand is the UK “soft drink industry levy” which appears to have resulted in a reported 10% reduction in the average sugar content of energy drinks in the UK – prior to the levy even coming into force.(Hashem, He, & MacGregor, 2017) Recommendations: 1. A tax on these beverages should be put in place in conjunction with other measures to decrease availability and consumption; 2. The tax system for sugar sweetened beverages should be designed to maximise the stimulus to manufacturers to reformulate products to have a lower sugar content as well as discouraging consumption by consumers. 18 Other potential health-justified taxes Mexico has a “junk food” tax which appears to be working (Taillie, Rivera, Popkin, & Batis, 2017) and some European countries tax salty products.(European Commission) Favourable results have also come from a potential salt tax modelled for New Zealand (Nghiem et al., 2015), a modelled salt tax in the USA (Smith-Spangler, Juusola, Enns, Owens, & Garber, 2010), and a range of food taxes modelled for Australia (on saturated fat, salt, sugar, and sugar-sweetened beverages) (L. J. Cobiac, Tam, Veerman, & Blakely, 2017). We expect that these types of taxes on such foods and key ingredients will have merit at some point in the future for New Zealand. Recommendation: Options for taxes relating to products and services with adverse health consequences, such as forms of non-nutritious food, and gambling, to be kept under review in the light of evidence of harm and efficacy of measures (long-term recommendation) Response to chapter 5: The results of the current tax system This chapter sets out information on the fundamentals of our taxation system. In accordance with our views on the role that tax should play in reducing inequalities and poverty, we have suggested steps in response to chapter 4 to increase the ‘progressive’ aspects of our tax system. Issues on cross-border transactions are discussed in relation to chapter 6. Response to chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system This chapter asks: What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? The chapter also raises the question of whether taxes for some purposes should be hypothecated, ie dedicated for specific purposes. The main inconsistencies in our current system arise from: 1. the emphasis on taxing income and goods/services but not capital/wealth; 2. the consequences of cross-border transactions that allow entities that operate cross-borders to evade tax obligations. We recommend, as outlined in chapter 4, a wealth tax, to be applied to individuals and corporate entities of all kinds, along with a focus on corporate taxation, especially with 19 regards to cross-border transactions but to include perhaps limited financial transaction tax of some kind; plus tax on assumed diverted profits (rebuttable). Cross-border transactions Review of New Zealand’s tax system must include a focus on cross-border international tax because cross border transactions have implications for the amount of revenue gathered, fairness, and equity values. Countering Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill BEPS Bill The BP notes that New Zealand is at present implementing OECD recommendations on some issues related to cross-border transactions through the Countering BEPS Bill. We will not focus on proposed measures included in the Bill, apart from one recommendation. Instead we focus on the root causes of the issues that allow and facilitate tax avoidance by multinational entities. Our one recommendation on the BEPS Bill arises from a review of submissions on the Bill: most are from corporate entities and their representatives; and many although not all set out significant concerns about the Bill’s implications. The basic and quite explicit fear of some entities is that the Bill will result in a less competitive environment for corporates. We recommend, at the very least, that the Bill not be weakened in any way. Addressing the causes of tax avoidance: While we support the OECD BEPS work, and the Bill, we consider that it is incapable of actually addressing the root causes which enable multinational enterprises (MNEs) to minimise and evade tax obligations. The ability of MNEs to evade tax rests, to a large extent, on a presumption that MNEs, for instance Google or Amazon, are composed of lots of small entities, enabling their manipulation of rules in different countries to pay the least tax possible. This presumption does not accord with the legal and business realities of MNEs, which are more realistically seen as whole corporate structures. The OECD recommendations, in the view of NGOs concerned with tax justice, and some academics, perpetuate the inaccurate notion that business entities such as Google are lots of small entities. The OECD proposals are concerned with devising rules that improve transactions between the sub-entities (such as, for example, what rates of interest or loans they can lend each other). Our medium-term recommendations are therefore: that New Zealand works with other international agencies for a comprehensive review of international tax that would enable more tax to be collected from MNEs and cross-border tax (which could in turn allow a reduced level of income tax from low-income individuals/families); greater fairness (with regards to locally-based businesses); and potentially some income thus generated able to be used for international purposes. Any such review would require a focus on international law and policy for an issue which is international: a focus on the use of unitary taxation (instead of the approach which regards MNES as Google as composed of multiple entities); and establishment of an international body (along the lines of WHO for health or WTO for trade) that would instigate and monitor the development of a unified and coherent regime to minimise tax avoidance by multinational agencies and individuals with cross-border reach. 20 Recommendations on cross-border tax issues: 1. That the TWG recognise that tax minimisation strategies on the part of corporates and individuals with cross-border reach results in significant loss of revenue to New Zealand (as well as other countries); 2. That the BEPS Bill takes only modest steps towards reducing the level to which MNEs are enabled to avoid tax, and should at least not be weakened; 3. That the TWG agree that a process of cross-border transactions be initiated, to go wider than the present Bill, to focus on (1) unitary taxation enabling taxation of whole corporate entities and (2) a coherent international regime overseen by an appropriate international body. Hypothecation The BP notes that, although the New Zealand system does not generally favour hypothecation, there are exceptions. Justifications for hypothecation referred to in the BP include ensuring that the public understand and support the need for the tax. The BP also notes some downsides. We consider that the BP omits a primary justification for tax dedication, that is, fairness. It is recognised that existing taxes on tobacco, and possible new or increased taxes on other products such as alcohol or gambling, could be argued to result in increased poverty – for those whose addiction is such that they cannot quit or sufficiently cut down. New Zealand qualitative research indicated that many of those unable to quit ‘felt victimised by a punitive policy system that coerced change without supporting it.’ (Hoek & Smith, 2016) In New Zealand, research has found that tobacco spending can have a major effect on households with children. (Thomson, Wilson, O'Dea, Reid, & Howden-Chapman, 2002) In our view this ethical dilemma – that is whether to increase population equity by reducing levels of incidence and/or consumption by increasing the cost of tobacco when this can involve difficulties at the individual level – would be addressed to at least some extent by dedicated taxes to be used for helping people quit tobacco. Dedicated taxes, at least in relation to tobacco control and possibly other health issues, is justified by two elements of fairness as identified above: those of (1) getting some return in accordance with what is contributed; and (2) identified connections between the sources of tax revenue and their use. While general tax revenue can, and is, used to fund tobacco control, a dedicated tax (to be spent, for example, on treatment/counselling, mass media campaigns) would: 1. Ensure continuity of funding; 2. Provide visible and tangible evidence of governmental commitment to reduction of social harm; 3. Identify clearly, for those who pay tobacco tax, their eligibility for services in return, ie support in improving their health; 4. Provide reassurance that the purpose of tobacco tax is not only revenue generation but health improvement; 5. Signal, in symbolic but important ways, recognition of the reciprocal duties and relationships inherent in any tax system between state and citizens. 21 The need for increased justice in the use of tobacco tax revenue is shown by the New Zealand smoker support for tobacco tax increases if the revenue is used to help smokers quit. (Waa et al., 2018; N. Wilson, Weerasekera, Edwards, & Blakely, 2009) We consider that these ethical (and to some extent practical) arguments for a dedicated tax apply may apply to a range of issues besides tobacco and alcohol. Recommendations on hypothecation 1. Using tax revenue for dedicated purposes is justified on a case-by-case basis; and in some cases the generation of tax can only be justified ethically where it is hypothecated; 2. Justification for hypothecation includes not only ethical grounds, but also evidence of efficacy; 3. Alcohol is an example where hypothecation is justified (and tax revenue accordingly should be increased); tobacco is another clear example. Other possible examples would include gambling and marjiuana (if and when legal). Chapter 7: Specific challenges This chapter raises issues about housing affordability, capital gains tax, land taxes, opportunities for effective environmental taxation; the possibility of GST exclusions; and tax in relation to small businesses. Housing Two major distortions in the New Zealand economy are the lack of tax on imputed rental income of owner-occupied dwellings, and the absence of a capital gains tax (CGT) on residential property (Howden-Chapman, 2015). These distortions have led to significant over-investment in property and the bidding up of house prices, the unnecessary expansion of urban areas and adverse environmental consequences arising from this – from carbon emissions, to adverse impacts on air and water quality, to loss of habitat (Howden- Chapman, Early, & Ombler, 2017). We recognise that it may be impractical to introduce a tax on imputed rental income, even though such a tax is not unheard of in developed economies (one did exist in the UK until the Second World War). This makes it more important to consider other mechanisms for the twin but related purposes of (1) raising revenue (given that housing is an asset) and (2) assisting with regulating the housing market. We support an extension to New Zealand’s present capital gains tax (CGT), even if this is not in a fully comprehensive form (ie assuming the family home remains exempt). Other developed countries have successfully managed the associated administration and compliance costs of a CGT. The signal a CGT’s introduction would send, in terms of both efficiency and equity, and both domestically and internationally, are important. Given the poor quality of rental housing relative to owner-occupied housing, there is a case for addressing the tax categorisation of expenditures on rental housing made to bring rental housing up to the Building Code standard. This would address the widespread reluctance of landlords to bring their property’s standard up to this minimum socially acceptable standard 22 (Johnson, Howden-Chapman, & Eaqub, 2018). Expenditures on bringing a property up to code would be considered ‘maintenance’, while going beyond the code would remain categorised as ‘improvements’ for tax purposes. We believe this would have a major incentive effect across the rental sector, and lead to an improvement of the health and well- being outcomes of an important part of society, those in private rental housing. The change would need to be aligned with the measures identified in the Healthy Homes Guarantee Act 2017, and University of Otago’s Rental Warrant of Fitness (Telfar-Barnard et al., 2017), (Bennett, Howden-Chapman, Chisholm, Keall, & Baker, 2016). Recommendations: 1. A capital gains tax should be introduced/extended which includes assets such as all investment properties, as well as other properties capable of generating capital gain; 2. The tax categorisation of expenditures on rental housing should be revised as an incentive for bringing a property up to the Building Code, or the regulatory standards under the Healthy Homes Guarantee Act 2017 (whichever standards are higher), so that the costs of bringing rental property up to the Code would be considered as ‘maintenance’ not ‘improvement’. GST exclusions We recognise the potential relevance of GST exclusions, or reductions, for specific products as a lever for attaining health, environmental and social goals. Given however the present state of evidence, we have no view at this stage on whether some goods (eg healthy staple foods, heating, internet access) should be excluded from GST. At some point evidence might point to advantages in having no or reduced GST on some products – for example GST rates might be linked to a nutritional labelling system. Hence while we do not think that GST exclusions would be appropriate at this time, we suggest that in principle tax amendments along these lines may be appropriate. We recommend therefore that the need for and relevance of GST exclusions be reviewed in the future. We do however consider that there is an argument for reducing the level of GST in general, back down to 10% from the current 15%. The loss in revenue that this would result would be compensated by increased taxes on products with externalities, eg (eg, carbon emissions) and hazardous products (eg, tobacco and sugary drinks) Tax and the environment: Environmental requirements should be central to our taxation system, forming a central test with taxation for all goods and services throughout their life cycles: collection, production, use, and disposal with implications for all domains eg: 1. Transport; 2. Energy production/use; 3. Food water production use; 4. Agricultural /pastoral/forestry/fishing activity; 5. Housing construction/technological construction/use/disposal. 23 Carbon tax Climate change is a major threat to international health and New Zealand (as a rich country) is far from playing an adequate role in responding to this major threat. In particular, New Zealand’s current pricing system for carbon New Zealand (an Emissions Trading Scheme \[ETS\]) has numerous design problems (Bertram & Simon, 2010) (Wright) (Ecofys World Bank) (Chapman, 2015). As such it urgently needs major reform – possibly by replacing it entirely with a carbon tax (an issue for the new Climate Commission to consider as well as the Tax Working Group). If such a tax was adopted, then consideration could be given to the recycling of carbon charges to the community as per the approach in British Columbia (BC) in Canada (Demerse). The revenue-neutral approach with the BC tax is one reason for the majority public support of this tax (ie, it “now funds more than a billion dollars a year in other tax cuts” (Demerse)). An alternative to the BC system would be balancing the carbon tax with a reduction in GST and personal income tax (for low-income New Zealand citizens) as detailed above. Revenue from a carbon tax could also be used for promoting lower carbon lifestyles (eg, better walkways and cycle-ways for commuting) and promoting carbon sequestration (eg, better incentives for allowing native forest regeneration). Recommendations: that the use of taxation for environmental protection (in conjunction with other policy measures) be endorsed; 1. For goods and services throughout their life cycles: eg collection, production, use, disposal; in all domains eg transport; energy production/use; food water production use; agricultural /pastoral/forestry/fishing activity; and housing construction; technological construction; 2. That (ideally) a system with tax incentives and disincentives for all goods and services be adopted, based on certification of products and services against standards relevant to the environment, health and human rights, long term; 3. A specific focus on carbon tax to replace the existing emissions scheme, ideally both hypothecated and designed to be overall revenue-neutral; 4. Consideration to be given to other taxes relevant to the environment, eg fertilisers, pesticides long term. 24 References Ajmal, A., & U, V. (2015).

Box 924 Nelson 7040 Tax Working Group submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz 30 April 2018 Submission to the Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax in New Zealand: OTANZ represents as large section (1) of New Zealand taxpayers and have seen taxation influence behaviors. This submission has been formulated on the three key amendments that are required to the existing taxation model to improve behavior and fairness within the future taxation system. This is to address our members client’s experiences and is not intended to address the key 5 questions identified by the Tax Working Group nor the outcomes that are anticipated or expected from them e.g. Capital Gain Tax. 1. Making it easy to get people engaged in the workforce: 1.1 How income (even from salary and wages) is calculated and the tax thereon has a significant impact on an individual’s ability to engage in the workforce. This also impacts their perception of how fair the taxation system is. 1.2 Our members have seen a large number of taxpayers disadvantaged and excluded from the workforce due to the inability to allow a deduction of the costs associated with them deriving income from employment. 1.3 These are real costs, whether it be protective clothing, transport to the place of employment or the cost of a uniform. An individual does not understand why these costs are not treated the same as interest costs on a rental property or the provision of a motor vehicle to an executive, both are cash consuming and are used to derive taxable income. 1.4 This to a hard working individual can be perceived as unfair. It can also lead to the individual disengaging from the workforce (Case A and Case B) 1.5 Costs which allow an individual time to work also influence decisions for them on entering the workforce. We would suggest that costs associated with the care of dependents should also be allowed for deduction. 1.6 These costs would include the care of a child, including but not limited to the use of a nanny, an au pair, preschool or crèche. This allows a parent to return to the workforce and have a deduction for the direct costs associated with deriving the income. It would be anticipated that there would have to be either a cap or private use adjustment to ensure deductibility remains linked to the income it derives. 1.7 It is also assuming that this would apply both aged care and special needs care. Both of which are becoming a large issue for our clients as the population ages and government funded facilities are cut. This allows the direct costs to be offset against the income it derives (Case C). 1.8 The following cases are examples of this: Case A: Minimum wage employee (hotel worker) living 60 kilometres from their place of employment receives no deduction for expenses associated with this trip in the face of increasing vehicle running costs. The decision to accept a benefit in the absence of a local job is becoming more realistic as both time to travel and costs increase. They are disengaging from the workforce and increase the governmental transfer costs due to the non-deductibility of expenditure that generates their taxable revenue. Case B: School leaver required to purchase protective clothing to be able to accept a job on a building site. Based on the cost they do not accept the position but decide to attend the local tertiary institute as the first year’s fees are free. The costs with entering the workforce negatively influence their decision that could have been reversed had costs been deductible from the income derived from the activity. Case C: Factory worker unable to continue in paid employment as they care for the aged members of their family as per the family’s cultural belief. This places added burden and pressure on the house hold financially that could be averted should the costs associated with the care of the dependants be deductible against the revenue derived. 2. Engaging people within their community: 2.1 A general concern trending throughout the country is the loss of community spirit and people within the community supporting it. The future of tax has the ability to influence these behaviours for the benefit of local communities which in turn impacts positively the whole country. 2.2 OTANZ believes that a small number of simple changes would improve outcomes significantly for communities. 2.3 Donated Goods 2.4 Currently there is no recognition within the taxation system of donated goods received by charity organisations. Donating physical items is a positive behaviour and allows the reuse and recycling of household items and clothing. This not only benefits the charity organisation but allows individuals essential items at affordable prices. 2.5 This also increases sustainability and reduced items entering landfill which has a positive environmental impact and is a secondary benefit. 2.6 Additional benefits to a community are well documented (2) including supporting those families that need it most from both the revenue generated, receiving support from local people and the option to purchase at affordable prices. 2.7 This behaviour is encouraged in other OCED countries through taxation treatment yet not in New Zealand. 2.8 The United States of America allows the deduction of donated goods to goodwill and thrift shops. This is based on a specific set of rules and most tax preparation software have a generally accepted value for items donated (3) . 2.9 This can also be supported through the taxation treatment for the recipient of the donations (both cash and goods) through a system like Gift Aid in the United Kingdom. This allows the recipient to claim the taxation benefit gross up for the taxation impact (4) . 2.10 OTANZ believes that both of these methods should be considered with a maximum cap to ensure that excessive deductions are not taken. 2.11 Schools Donations and Fees 2.12 School fees remain a significant area where taxation treatment is not achieving the outcomes that are best for the community as a whole. 2.13 The portion of school fees that can be claimed are not being claimed and this is a significant number. 2.14 OTANZ believes that this is because of the complexly of claiming the rebate and that people are unaware of what they can claim. 2.15 This has resulted in schools only receiving a small portion of donations. This places additional funding constraints on the schools. This is negative behaviour which can easily be resolved through changes in taxation. 2.16 All school fees should be deductible. This provides clarity for both the school and the parent about what is deductible. This would have an annual cap to ensure private school fees were not deductible above that paid in the public sector. The Ministry of Education could set this level based on the average school fees / donation charged. 2.17 Many parents still face financial constraints. To facilitate these family to support their local school donated hours would also be able to be deducted. The living wage would be a good benchmark to apply to the donation. 2.18 It has been proven that educational outcomes are improved when parents are engaged within the educational institution. This would be a secondary outcome for those families involved. 2.19 Schools will always welcome this as there are endless tasks requiring parental help from grounds upkeep, physical education assistance (e.g. sports day, cross country), community gardens and art projects to name a few. This will have a positive community outcome supported from changes in taxation. 2.20 Donations can also be supported through taxation treatment so the recipient of the donations (both cash and time) through a system like Gift Aid in the United Kingdom. This allows the school to claim the taxation benefit rather than the parent. 2.21 A secondary benefit of this is that the school’s annual donation charge would reduce as there is certainty of the taxation benefit and this in turn will lead to a higher collection rate. 2.22 Definition of a charitable organization 2.23 OTANZ would also like to a see a wider definition of a charitable organization. This would allow community-based activities i.e. refurbishment of a local playground to achieve this status and allow a high level of community support. 2.24 It is envisaged that this would be by application through IR and allow communities to have short term status to achieve goals without the set up or maintaining costs associated with managing a charity. 2.25 Simple reporting and oversight from IR would generate positive community activities and outcomes improving wellness for those living in those communities. 3. Simplification / Fairness 3.1 Business transformation will see a simplified interface with IR for individual as more information is made available electronically to IR. 3.2 These changes would facilitate the combination of the existing Personal Tax Summary or IR3 for income tax obligations and the IR526 for claiming rebates into one single form. This would allow simplification of an individual’s obligations. 3.3 There remains a number of areas where non-cash benefits are not taxed in the hands of the recipient which questions whether the existing system is fair to all taxpayers. 3.4 Examples of this would be ‘bonus’ trips for insurance agents writing policies, builders achieving spend targets at suppliers or advertisers spending targets with media channel providers. 3.5 This allows a tax-free benefit to the recipient and the deduction of the expense to the organization incurring the costs. This is not available to all taxpayers and creates the perception of the system not being fair as the benefits are generally enjoyed by business owners. 3.6 This would have to have a minimum cap to ensure flybuys or other incentive programs are excluded from the calculation. 3.7 Education of taxpayers 3.8 A concerning trend within our member’s client’s is the lack of understanding either about tax or an individual’s obligations. This can be easily measured with the lack of engagement from taxpayers in their taxation obligations. 3.9 This can be corrected with increased education of taxpayers at a high school level as to what taxes are, how they are used and what an individual’s obligations are. OTANZ is happy to discuss this further should the need arise.

Oxfam New Zealand (“Oxfam”) is a NZ registered Charitable Trust that is a legally autonomous member of the global Oxfam Confederation. Oxfam welcomes the opportunity to submit its views on the ‘structure, fairness and balance of the tax system’. 1 Limitations of the terms of reference Oxfam believes the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference, with a number of key issues explicitly ruled out of scope, is impossible to reconcile with the intention to consider the ‘structure, fairness and balance of the tax system’. These exclusions include increases to income tax rates, the rate of GST, and certain forms of wealth tax, such as inheritance tax. With these key aspects apparently ruled out of scope from the start, it is hard to see how the Tax Working Group can plausibly make any recommendations towards a more balanced or fair tax system. As an international development agency, however, Oxfam’s view is that the apparent exclusion of ‘international tax reform under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agenda’ is of most concern. We challenge this exclusion from the terms of reference for the following reasons: • It makes no sense to review tax systems in isolation while being part of a global economy. It rules out the consideration of NZ tax systems interdependence and interface with other national and global tax systems. • If the objective of the New Zealand tax system is to ‘promote long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy’, 2 the loss of revenue due to tax avoidance by multinationals (MNCs) requires urgent attention. • The Paradise and Panama Papers demonstrated a shocking epidemic in tax avoidance that is a global problem that needs a global solution. • International tax reform cannot be dismissed as a ‘technical matter’ 3 but one of fairness, and one that can be addressed with sufficient political will. Countries must work collaboratively to remedy the system. New Zealand needs to be part of the global solution if it is serious about tackling inequality domestically and globally. 1 Tax Working Group – Terms of reference page 1 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid, page 2 2 • As stated in the Tax Working Group documents, ‘we are living in an era of rapid technological change, rising economic certainty and mounting environmental challenges. Our tax system must be robust to these challenges.’ 4 The Oxfam submission will therefore respond specifically to ‘Chapter 6: Thinking outside the system’. As an international development agency, Oxfam restricts its comments to international tax reforms, focusing on tax avoidance (and not domestic tax reform). Executive Summary Oxfam believes that the Tax Working Group must extend its recommendations to Cabinet to examine New Zealand’s role and responsibility to fix the global tax system. Developing countries are missing out on USD$150 billion each year due to multinational tax avoidance. Tax avoidance deprives governments around the world (including NZ) the money they need to tackle poverty and inequality. Governments must act together to force this system to end and countries must work collaboratively to remedy the system. New Zealand must stand in solidarity with developing countries and call for a new generation of global tax reforms. Oxfam has two key proposals that the Tax Working Group must recommend to effectively tackle MNC tax avoidance: • Global tax reform: New Zealand to actively support the creation of a new global tax body. • End tax secrecy: New Zealand must commit to public country by country reporting. Why Oxfam is concerned about tax avoidance Oxfam is an international development agency that works in over 92 countries. Oxfam has witnessed first-hand the impact of lost tax revenue on developing countries. MNCs shifting their activities to low or zero tax jurisdictions is estimated to cost people in developing countries at least US$100 billion a year 5 . Even if this kind of tax avoidance is usually legal, it is morally dubious. Most individual taxpayers cannot reduce their tax liability. The effect can mean highly profitable MNCs pay a lower effective tax rate than many citizens. Inequality and Poverty: Tax avoidance deprives governments around the world of the money they need to tackle poverty and inequality. When MNCs avoid paying their fair share of tax, people living in poverty can end up paying twice: having to pay more taxes to make up shortfalls in national tax revenues, and missing out on quality public services such as hospitals and schools that may otherwise be funded. MNC 4 ‘Future of Tax – Summary for Submitters’ page 5 5 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). (2015). World Investment Report 2015. Available at: http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2015\_en.pdf 3 tax avoidance is entrenching poverty and weakening developing country economies. Poverty doesn’t just coincide with tax avoidance; it’s driven by it. Sustainable Development Goals: There is a growing recognition that having effective and functional tax systems is a key building block for sustainable development. 6 Domestic revenue mobilization is therefore critical for developing countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and in particular SDG 10: Reducing Inequalities. New Zealand: The failure of international cooperation in tax matters is not only a problem for developing countries. It undermines the tax systems of all countries, and deprives governments of the vital resources needed to provide public services and uphold the human rights of their people. Tax avoidance by MNCs also impacts New Zealand. Oxfam’s research last year uncovered that Reckitt Benckiser (RB) may have avoided paying as much as NZ$15.2 million in tax in New Zealand and NZ$395 million globally in the three years to 2016. 7 New Zealand is currently missing out on revenue between NZ$200-500 million a year (Tax Justice Network estimates this could be as high as NZ$700 million 8 ). If the remit of this review is to consider the ‘structure, fairness and balance’ of the tax system, it must include recommendations to remedy the shocking ‘unfairness’ of New Zealand missing out on this revenue. Oxfam position on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) In New Zealand, Oxfam welcomed the recent introduction of the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill and supported the work in progress to reduce the tax losses that result from tax avoidance from MNCs. However Oxfam’s primary concern is that the proposed legislation is not comprehensive and ambitious enough to effectively tackle the problem of MNC tax avoidance. Oxfam’s recommendations to the Tax Working Group This Tax Working Group review offers New Zealand the opportunity to demonstrate leadership on the global stage and play a key part in the reform of the unjust global tax system, to lead by example for many developing countries in the pursuit of tax justice and to respond convincingly to public outrage about MNC tax avoidance. Globally, Oxfam is calling for all governments to cooperate internationally to ensure that tax rules are fair, transparent and consistently applied. Oxfam’s view is that it requires political will to adopt strong and effective legislation to stop MNCs avoiding paying their fair share of tax. Tax avoidance is not a victimless act: when governments do not have the money to pay for decent public services, it is the poorest people who lose out. Some progress has been made in curtailing the ability 6 Please refer to the outcomes of the ‘First Global Conference of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax – Taxation and the SDG’s. http://www.worldbank.org/en/events/2017/06/06/first-global-conference-of-the-platform-for-collaboration-on-tax 7 https://www.oxfam.org.nz/reports/making-tax-vanish-how-practices-consumer-goods-mnc-rb-show-international-tax-system-broken 8 https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c\_id=3&objectid=11824675 4 of MNCs to do this through BEPS, but too many loopholes remain. Concerted action is needed to restore trust in national and international tax systems. Below are Oxfam’s two key proposals that the Tax Working Group are strongly advised to recommend to Cabinet to effectively tackle MNC tax avoidance: 1. Global tax reform: New Zealand to actively support the creation of a new global tax body Oxfam recommends the urgent need for a strong global response to the international problem of cross-boundary tax avoidance and in particular the importance of establishing an intergovernmental body on tax cooperation under the auspices of the United Nations (UN). The idea of establishing an intergovernmental body on tax matters under the UN has been endorsed by the previous UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon 9 , several independent experts on human rights and poverty issues 10 , as well as by the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT) 11 . There are ten reasons why an Intergovernmental UN Tax Body will work for the benefit all countries, both developing and developed 12 : i) A key step towards a coherent global system. Currently, the international tax system consists of a complicated web of thousands of bilateral tax treaties and different parallel international systems to regulate, for example, information exchange and corporate reporting. Negotiation of a globally agreed system is the only way to remove the complexity, confusion, inconsistency and mismatches that exist today. A truly global tax body is a crucial first step towards this goal. ii) Stronger cooperation between tax administrations. A coherent global system will make it easier for tax administrations to communicate and cooperate. This will further strengthen international coherence and improve working conditions for tax administrations. iii) Less unilateral action. Blacklisting and special restrictions on transfer pricing, financial transfers, corporate reporting and documentation are only some of the measures individual governments are currently introducing to protect their tax base. If the crisis in the global tax system continues to be unresolved, we are likely to see many more of these kinds of self-protective measures. Only truly global cooperation can ensure that all governments have a real alternative to unilateral action. 9 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon. (2014).

The fear of losing investments is currently driving governments to introduce tax incentives, loopholes and harmful tax practices in a tragic ‘race to the bottom’, which is costing countries billions of dollars in lost tax income. Through truly global cooperation, we can turn this deeply disturbing development around. v) Better business environment. Clear, consistent, global and stable rules are good for business. Operating across diverse, inconsistent national tax systems creates heavy administrative burdens, legal uncertainty and high risks for international business. vi) A level playing field. Today, governments who commit to increasing transparency and closing loopholes fear that being a ‘first mover’ will result in businesses and wealthy individuals registering themselves in other jurisdictions. Through truly global negotiations, governments can agree on coordinated global action and ensure a level playing field. vii) Stronger implementation. No government will feel obliged to implement tax standards and norms adopted in closed rooms where it was not welcome. The UN is the only global institution where all governments participate as equals, and therefore the place to achieve a global commitment to action. viii) Less double taxation and double-non-taxation. The wide variety of mismatches between national tax systems is the core reason why some get taxed twice on the same income while others don’t get taxed at all. Only truly global cooperation can put an end to these problems. ix) More financing for development in the poorest countries. Currently, the world’s poorest countries are excluded from decision making on global tax standards, and international systems often don’t take into account their realities and interests. This means lower tax income and thereby less available financing for development in these countries. A global tax body would ensure the voices of the countries where tax avoidance hits the hardest will have an equal say in the design of the new global system. x) Fair and consistent global action against tax havens. Many governments are currently trying to protect their tax base through national blacklists based on criteria that are often both unclear and inconsistently applied. While random blacklisting can be burdensome for impacted countries, it will not solve the tax haven problem. It also punishes some developing countries without offering alternatives to help transition away from the reliance on the small benefits of being a tax haven. Action against tax havens must be fair, consistent and globally coordinated in order to be effective. 6 2. End tax secrecy: New Zealand must commit to public country by country reporting Oxfam urges New Zealand to join the growing momentum for greater tax transparency. Tax transparency is an essential step in fighting global tax avoidance. A lack of transparency over what profits are made and what taxes are paid by MNCs in every country in which they operate makes it hard to identify abusive tax practices. The complex way in which many MNCs are structured means that citizens and governments often have limited insight into the taxes paid by large corporations. An MNC’s reporting rules depend on where it is registered, and whether and where it is listed on stock exchanges. Most countries require publicly listed companies (i.e. those listed on a stock exchange) to publish audited annual reports and accounts, although these are often on a consolidated basis for the entire group, rather than separating out individual subsidiaries. However, for private companies, there are often no public reporting requirements at all. The structure of MNCs, with a parent company and multiple subsidiaries, makes collecting and assessing all relevant information hard, especially when subsidiaries are based in tax havens that do not require the publication of financial information. New Zealand and country by country reporting BEPS currently requires large MNCs to provide accounting information on a country by country basis to tax authorities so that they can assess whether an MNC is meeting its obligations. In New Zealand these requirements have already been adopted and apply to corporate groups headquartered in New Zealand with annual consolidated group revenue of over EUR 750 million (approximately $1.3 billion). New Zealand IRD initial population analysis suggests that around 20 New Zealand- headquartered corporate groups are affected. First reporting of country by country data was due to take place during the 2017 calendar year. 13 However, all forthcoming reports will be accessible only to tax authorities, not the public, and will not include all MNCs in New Zealand. People in New Zealand and in developing countries need transparency about what taxes MNCs pay and where, so that avoidance can be better detected and understood and better rules agreed. As the RB case study demonstrates, we do not know the scale and precise nature of avoidance because of a lack of publically available information. Oxfam is not alone in this thinking: the globally respected Tax Justice Network, Global Alliance for Tax Justice and other international agencies such as ActionAid, Transparency International, Christian Aid and Nobel Award winning economist Joseph Stiglitz believe that greater tax transparency will tackle tax avoidance. 13 http://www.ird.govt.nz/international/business/international-obligations/country-by-country-reporting/new-country-by-country-reporting-requirements.html 7 Oxfam urges the Tax Working Group to recommend to Cabinet that MNCs based in New Zealand are required to publicly declare income, profits and tax paid in each country where they operate, including New Zealand. Benefits This data will allow the public to see if MNCs are paying their fair share of taxes in each country in which they operate. This would help hold MNCs to account, ensuring that transfer pricing is not openly abused, and help governments improve tax rules to prevent avoidance in the first place. Research also shows that public scrutiny has a positive effect on curbing tax avoidance by MNCs. 14 It also helps shareholders make informed decisions on where to invest. This should lead to fairer tax systems and greater confidence in the system itself. How does tax transparency benefit MNCs? a. Paying tax is an investment by MNCs in the countries in which they operate. It supports the development of the type of societies in which profitable, sustainable companies can thrive – peaceful, stable societies that have healthy and productive workforces, prosperous economies, viable transport systems and strong consumer bases with purchasing power. b. Transparent behaviour also mitigates reputational risk. A diverse range of stakeholders, including consumers, now have expectations about MNCs’ behaviour on tax. MNCs seen to be behaving unfairly are exposed to adverse publicity and all the risks to brand that entails. Tax behaviour can impact a company’s reputation as a good corporate citizen, impact on shareholder expectation and call into question whether its behaviour is consistent with, for example, its commitment to sustainable development or its stated social purpose. c. Perhaps less obvious, but just as serious, are the risks that tax avoidance poses to profit; a successful challenge to an MNC’s filing position can reduce share price and lessen investor confidence in the good management of the company’s tax affairs. Investors are also increasingly screening companies for tax risk, and a higher investor risk categorisation may increase the cost of funds needed to finance the business. Current thinking • Public country by country reporting is already mandatory for financial companies in the European Union. A number of companies such as Vodafone, Unilever and Barclays are already voluntarily providing more information about their tax practices. 14 For instance, Dyreng et al. (2016) find that firms that are subject to public scrutiny engage less in tax avoidance, indicating that public pressure can exert some influence on MNCs. In a similar vein, Herbert et al. (2015) contend that reduced public disclosure is positively correlated with international tax avoidance. 8 • The European Commission found that public country by country reporting was likely to also boost, not harm, economic growth 15 . Having more company tax data in the public domain would provide more certainty for investors at a time when so many other aspects are uncertain. • Many investors in MNCs are also calling for public country by country reporting. For example, Legal & General Investment Management Limited 16 and Norges Bank Investment Management 17 have called for public country by country reporting.

Oxfam welcomes the opportunity to submit its views on the ‘structure, fairness and balance of the tax system’. 1 Limitations of the terms of reference Oxfam believes the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference, with a number of key issues explicitly ruled out of scope, is impossible to reconcile with the intention to consider the ‘structure, fairness and balance of the tax system’. These exclusions include increases to income tax rates, the rate of GST, and certain forms of wealth tax, such as inheritance tax. With these key aspects apparently ruled out of scope from the start, it is hard to see how the Tax Working Group can plausibly make any recommendations towards a more balanced or fair tax system. As an international development agency, however, Oxfam’s view is that the apparent exclusion of ‘international tax reform under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agenda’ is of most concern. We challenge this exclusion from the terms of reference for the following reasons:  It makes no sense to review tax systems in isolation while being part of a global economy. It rules out the consideration of NZ tax systems interdependence and interface with other national and global tax systems.  If the objective of the New Zealand tax system is to ‘promote long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy’, 2 the loss of revenue due to tax avoidance by multinationals (MNCs) requires urgent attention.  The Paradise and Panama Papers demonstrated a shocking epidemic in tax avoidance that is a global problem that needs a global solution.  International tax reform cannot be dismissed as a ‘technical matter’ 3 but one of fairness, and one that can be addressed with sufficient political will. Countries must work collaboratively to remedy the system. New Zealand needs to be part of the global solution if it is serious about tackling inequality domestically and globally. 1 Tax Working Group – Terms of reference page 1 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid, page 2 2  As stated in the Tax Working Group documents, ‘we are living in an era of rapid technological change, rising economic certainty and mounting environmental challenges. Our tax system must be robust to these challenges.’ 4 The Oxfam submission will therefore respond specifically to ‘Chapter 6: Thinking outside the system’. As an international development agency, Oxfam restricts its comments to international tax reforms, focusing on tax avoidance (and not domestic tax reform). Executive Summary Oxfam believes that the Tax Working Group must extend its recommendations to Cabinet to examine New Zealand’s role and responsibility to fix the global tax system. Developing countries are missing out on USD$150 billion each year due to multinational tax avoidance. Tax avoidance deprives governments around the world (including NZ) the money they need to tackle poverty and inequality. Governments must act together to force this system to end and countries must work collaboratively to remedy the system. New Zealand must stand in solidarity with developing countries and call for a new generation of global tax reforms. Oxfam has two key proposals that the Tax Working Group must recommend to effectively tackle MNC tax avoidance:  Global tax reform: New Zealand to actively support the creation of a new global tax body.  End tax secrecy: New Zealand must commit to public country by country reporting. Why Oxfam is concerned about tax avoidance Oxfam is an international development agency that works in over 92 countries. Oxfam has witnessed first-hand the impact of lost tax revenue on developing countries. MNCs shifting their activities to low or zero tax jurisdictions is estimated to cost people in developing countries at least US$100 billion a year 5 . Even if this kind of tax avoidance is usually legal, it is morally dubious. Most individual taxpayers cannot reduce their tax liability. The effect can mean highly profitable MNCs pay a lower effective tax rate than many citizens. Inequality and Poverty: Tax avoidance deprives governments around the world of the money they need to tackle poverty and inequality. When MNCs avoid paying their fair share of tax, people living in poverty can end up paying twice: having to pay more taxes to make up shortfalls in national tax revenues, and missing out on quality public services such as hospitals and schools that may otherwise be funded. MNC 4 ‘Future of Tax – Summary for Submitters’ page 5 5 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). (2015). World Investment Report 2015. Available at: http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/wir2015\_en.pdf 3 tax avoidance is entrenching poverty and weakening developing country economies. Poverty doesn’t just coincide with tax avoidance; it’s driven by it. Sustainable Development Goals: There is a growing recognition that having effective and functional tax systems is a key building block for sustainable development. 6 Domestic revenue mobilization is therefore critical for developing countries to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and in particular SDG 10: Reducing Inequalities. New Zealand: The failure of international cooperation in tax matters is not only a problem for developing countries. It undermines the tax systems of all countries, and deprives governments of the vital resources needed to provide public services and uphold the human rights of their people. Tax avoidance by MNCs also impacts New Zealand. Oxfam’s research last year uncovered that Reckitt Benckiser (RB) may have avoided paying as much as NZ$15.2 million in tax in New Zealand and NZ$395 million globally in the three years to 2016. 7 New Zealand is currently missing out on revenue between NZ$200-500 million a year (Tax Justice Network estimates this could be as high as NZ$700 million 8 ). If the remit of this review is to consider the ‘structure, fairness and balance’ of the tax system, it must include recommendations to remedy the shocking ‘unfairness’ of New Zealand missing out on this revenue. Oxfam position on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) In New Zealand, Oxfam welcomed the recent introduction of the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill and supported the work in progress to reduce the tax losses that result from tax avoidance from MNCs. However Oxfam’s primary concern is that the proposed legislation is not comprehensive and ambitious enough to effectively tackle the problem of MNC tax avoidance. Oxfam’s recommendations to the Tax Working Group This Tax Working Group review offers New Zealand the opportunity to demonstrate leadership on the global stage and play a key part in the reform of the unjust global tax system, to lead by example for many developing countries in the pursuit of tax justice and to respond convincingly to public outrage about MNC tax avoidance. Globally, Oxfam is calling for all governments to cooperate internationally to ensure that tax rules are fair, transparent and consistently applied. Oxfam’s view is that it requires political will to adopt strong and effective legislation to stop MNCs avoiding paying their fair share of tax. Tax avoidance is not a victimless act: when governments do not have the money to pay for decent public services, it is the poorest people who lose out. Some progress has been made in curtailing the ability 6 Please refer to the outcomes of the ‘First Global Conference of the Platform for Collaboration on Tax – Taxation and the SDG’s. http://www.worldbank.org/en/events/2017/06/06/first-global-conference-of-the-platform-for-collaboration-on-tax 7 https://www.oxfam.org.nz/reports/making-tax-vanish-how-practices-consumer-goods-mnc-rb-show-international-tax-system-broken 8 https://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c\_id=3&objectid=11824675 4 of MNCs to do this through BEPS, but too many loopholes remain. Concerted action is needed to restore trust in national and international tax systems. Below are Oxfam’s two key proposals that the Tax Working Group are strongly advised to recommend to Cabinet to effectively tackle MNC tax avoidance: 1. Global tax reform: New Zealand to actively support the creation of a new global tax body Oxfam recommends the urgent need for a strong global response to the international problem of cross-boundary tax avoidance and in particular the importance of establishing an intergovernmental body on tax cooperation under the auspices of the United Nations (UN). The idea of establishing an intergovernmental body on tax matters under the UN has been endorsed by the previous UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon 9 , several independent experts on human rights and poverty issues 10 , as well as by the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT) 11 . There are ten reasons why an Intergovernmental UN Tax Body will work for the benefit all countries, both developing and developed 12 : i) A key step towards a coherent global system. Currently, the international tax system consists of a complicated web of thousands of bilateral tax treaties and different parallel international systems to regulate, for example, information exchange and corporate reporting. Negotiation of a globally agreed system is the only way to remove the complexity, confusion, inconsistency and mismatches that exist today. A truly global tax body is a crucial first step towards this goal. ii) Stronger cooperation between tax administrations. A coherent global system will make it easier for tax administrations to communicate and cooperate. This will further strengthen international coherence and improve working conditions for tax administrations. iii) Less unilateral action. Blacklisting and special restrictions on transfer pricing, financial transfers, corporate reporting and documentation are only some of the measures individual governments are currently introducing to protect their tax base. If the crisis in the global tax system continues to be unresolved, we are likely to see many more of these kinds of self-protective measures. Only truly global cooperation can ensure that all governments have a real alternative to unilateral action. 9 UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon. (2014).

The fear of losing investments is currently driving governments to introduce tax incentives, loopholes and harmful tax practices in a tragic ‘race to the bottom’, which is costing countries billions of dollars in lost tax income. Through truly global cooperation, we can turn this deeply disturbing development around. v) Better business environment. Clear, consistent, global and stable rules are good for business. Operating across diverse, inconsistent national tax systems creates heavy administrative burdens, legal uncertainty and high risks for international business. vi) A level playing field. Today, governments who commit to increasing transparency and closing loopholes fear that being a ‘first mover’ will result in businesses and wealthy individuals registering themselves in other jurisdictions. Through truly global negotiations, governments can agree on coordinated global action and ensure a level playing field. vii) Stronger implementation. No government will feel obliged to implement tax standards and norms adopted in closed rooms where it was not welcome. The UN is the only global institution where all governments participate as equals, and therefore the place to achieve a global commitment to action. viii) Less double taxation and double-non-taxation. The wide variety of mismatches between national tax systems is the core reason why some get taxed twice on the same income while others don’t get taxed at all. Only truly global cooperation can put an end to these problems. ix) More financing for development in the poorest countries. Currently, the world’s poorest countries are excluded from decision making on global tax standards, and international systems often don’t take into account their realities and interests. This means lower tax income and thereby less available financing for development in these countries. A global tax body would ensure the voices of the countries where tax avoidance hits the hardest will have an equal say in the design of the new global system. x) Fair and consistent global action against tax havens. Many governments are currently trying to protect their tax base through national blacklists based on criteria that are often both unclear and inconsistently applied. While random blacklisting can be burdensome for impacted countries, it will not solve the tax haven problem. It also punishes some developing countries without offering alternatives to help transition away from the reliance on the small benefits of being a tax haven. Action against tax havens must be fair, consistent and globally coordinated in order to be effective. 6 2. End tax secrecy: New Zealand must commit to public country by country reporting Oxfam urges New Zealand to join the growing momentum for greater tax transparency. Tax transparency is an essential step in fighting global tax avoidance. A lack of transparency over what profits are made and what taxes are paid by MNCs in every country in which they operate makes it hard to identify abusive tax practices. The complex way in which many MNCs are structured means that citizens and governments often have limited insight into the taxes paid by large corporations. An MNC’s reporting rules depend on where it is registered, and whether and where it is listed on stock exchanges. Most countries require publicly listed companies (i.e. those listed on a stock exchange) to publish audited annual reports and accounts, although these are often on a consolidated basis for the entire group, rather than separating out individual subsidiaries. However, for private companies, there are often no public reporting requirements at all. The structure of MNCs, with a parent company and multiple subsidiaries, makes collecting and assessing all relevant information hard, especially when subsidiaries are based in tax havens that do not require the publication of financial information. New Zealand and country by country reporting BEPS currently requires large MNCs to provide accounting information on a country by country basis to tax authorities so that they can assess whether an MNC is meeting its obligations. In New Zealand these requirements have already been adopted and apply to corporate groups headquartered in New Zealand with annual consolidated group revenue of over EUR 750 million (approximately $1.3 billion). New Zealand IRD initial population analysis suggests that around 20 New Zealand- headquartered corporate groups are affected. First reporting of country by country data was due to take place during the 2017 calendar year. 13 However, all forthcoming reports will be accessible only to tax authorities, not the public, and will not include all MNCs in New Zealand. People in New Zealand and in developing countries need transparency about what taxes MNCs pay and where, so that avoidance can be better detected and understood and better rules agreed. As the RB case study demonstrates, we do not know the scale and precise nature of avoidance because of a lack of publically available information. Oxfam is not alone in this thinking: the globally respected Tax Justice Network, Global Alliance for Tax Justice and other international agencies such as ActionAid, Transparency International, Christian Aid and Nobel Award winning economist Joseph Stiglitz believe that greater tax transparency will tackle tax avoidance. 13 http://www.ird.govt.nz/international/business/international-obligations/country-by-country-reporting/new-country-by-country-reporting-requirements.html 7 Oxfam urges the Tax Working Group to recommend to Cabinet that MNCs based in New Zealand are required to publicly declare income, profits and tax paid in each country where they operate, including New Zealand. Benefits This data will allow the public to see if MNCs are paying their fair share of taxes in each country in which they operate. This would help hold MNCs to account, ensuring that transfer pricing is not openly abused, and help governments improve tax rules to prevent avoidance in the first place. Research also shows that public scrutiny has a positive effect on curbing tax avoidance by MNCs. 14 It also helps shareholders make informed decisions on where to invest. This should lead to fairer tax systems and greater confidence in the system itself. How does tax transparency benefit MNCs? a. Paying tax is an investment by MNCs in the countries in which they operate. It supports the development of the type of societies in which profitable, sustainable companies can thrive – peaceful, stable societies that have healthy and productive workforces, prosperous economies, viable transport systems and strong consumer bases with purchasing power. b. Transparent behaviour also mitigates reputational risk. A diverse range of stakeholders, including consumers, now have expectations about MNCs’ behaviour on tax. MNCs seen to be behaving unfairly are exposed to adverse publicity and all the risks to brand that entails. Tax behaviour can impact a company’s reputation as a good corporate citizen, impact on shareholder expectation and call into question whether its behaviour is consistent with, for example, its commitment to sustainable development or its stated social purpose. c. Perhaps less obvious, but just as serious, are the risks that tax avoidance poses to profit; a successful challenge to an MNC’s filing position can reduce share price and lessen investor confidence in the good management of the company’s tax affairs. Investors are also increasingly screening companies for tax risk, and a higher investor risk categorisation may increase the cost of funds needed to finance the business. Current thinking  Public country by country reporting is already mandatory for financial companies in the European Union. A number of companies such as Vodafone, Unilever and Barclays are already voluntarily providing more information about their tax practices. 14 For instance, Dyreng et al. (2016) find that firms that are subject to public scrutiny engage less in tax avoidance, indicating that public pressure can exert some influence on MNCs. In a similar vein, Herbert et al. (2015) contend that reduced public disclosure is positively correlated with international tax avoidance. 8  The European Commission found that public country by country reporting was likely to also boost, not harm, economic growth 15 . Having more company tax data in the public domain would provide more certainty for investors at a time when so many other aspects are uncertain.  Many investors in MNCs are also calling for public country by country reporting. For example, Legal & General Investment Management Limited 16 and Norges Bank Investment Management 17 have called for public country by country reporting.

For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 30 th April 2018 BY EMAIL: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz FUTURE OF TAX Thank you for giving Packaging New Zealand the opportunity to submit to the Tax Working Group. We would be happy to elaborate on any of the points raised here as part of the consultation process. INTRODUCTION Packaging New Zealand represents the whole packaging supply chain, including raw material suppliers, packaging manufacturers, brand owners, retailers and recycling operators. Our members represent more than 80% of the packaging industry by turnover, contributing $4,229m to New Zealand GDP and supporting over 5900 businesses employing over 50,000 people. Packaging New Zealand’s role is to represent the interests of the packaging industry in applicable public policy and debate. Our members have a strong commercial incentive and statutory responsibility to manufacture ‘fit for purpose’ packaging. Fit for purpose includes, but is not limited to, reducing the environmental impact of packaging through applicable and cost effective solutions and product stewardship. Packaging must deliver goods in a condition in which they can be used, that meet the needs of many different groups in the community, and all at a price reflective of commercial pressures in an open economy. Stakeholder interest has increased the number of our members actively aligning their activities and investment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and circular economy concepts. These global movements are likely to drive the pace, and shape the degree, of change in New Zealand’s open economy. Page 2 of 4 Packaging NZ submission to Tax Working Group April 2018 What is clear is that to achieve transformational change will require changes to the way we make things; the way we use the resources of our planet; the way we communicate and interact with each other as humans; the way we learn; the way we work; the way we govern; and the way we do business. We commend the objectives of the tax working group “to apply a particular focus on the future to its work, with a view to exploring the major challenges, risks, and opportunities facing the tax system over the next decade and beyond.” SPECIFIC COMMENTS The Waste Minimisation Act 2008 raises a $10 levy on every tonne of waste going to registered landfills. These funds are hypothecated: Waste Minimisation Act, Part 3 Waste Disposal Levy, Clause 25. Purpose of Part. The purpose of the Part is to enable a levy to be imposed on waste disposed of to – (a) Raise revenue for promoting and achieving waste minimisation; and (b) Increase the cost of waste disposal to recognise that disposal imposes costs on the environment, society, and the economy. Packaging New Zealand’s submission is limited to comments on the hypothecated tax (waste levy), which to date has raised more than $192m 1 , and is currently split: LOCAL AUTHORITIES Under the Act, half of the levy raised is given to local authorities in proportion to population. The intent of the Act is to support local authorities to promote or achieve waste minimisation. The waste minimisation activities undertaken by local authorities are discretionary and not mandated in any sense other than “activities to reduce waste”. New Zealand’s larger Councils have been the beneficiaries of substantial extra funding as a result of the levy, funds for which they are not directly accountable to their ratepayers. It is reasonable to expect that the levy would after 10 ten years be showing measurable progress towards waste minimisation from actions funded by them to date. However, media reports from the Ministry for the Environment 2 indicate that the situation in New Zealand has not shown any improvement with regards to waste minimisation since the Waste Minimisation Act came into effect. 1 http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/media/Waste/Review-of-the-effectiveness-of-the-waste- disposal-levy-2017.pdf 2 https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/time-turnaround-nz%E2%80%99s-rubbish-record-waste Page 3 of 4 Packaging NZ submission to Tax Working Group April 2018 An inference of MFE’s finding is that the value derived from levy expenditure is unclear, demonstrated by the lack of measurable improvement. It is therefore questionable whether the current distribution provisions of the hypothecated tax under the Act, represents the optimal use of this money from both a waste minimisation and a broader consolidated fund perspective. The value of expenditure of public money on waste minimising, or any other activities, are better assured through open accountability and greater contestability. Ideally, government (all levels) expenditure on waste minimisation should be judged against all of Governments priorities by removing the hypothecation. As a minimum, 100% contestability of the hypothecated fund against a prioritised list of waste minimising options should be considered. We reiterate our position stated in 2007: Statement made in submission to the Local Government & Environment Select Committee on the Supplementary Order Paper to the Waste Minimisation (Solids) Bill (October 2007): Any levied funds should be made 100% contestable. Giving territorial authorities 50% of revenues raised as a right, will not, in our opinion, advance a national strategic plan aimed at waste minimisation or resource recovery or allow the level of funding required to be quantified. WASTE MINIMISATION FUND The other half of the revenue raised by the hypothecated tax (waste levy) (circa $96m, less administration costs since the Act came into effect), is available on a contestable basis to any person or organisation to fund activities approved by the Minister to “promote or achieve waste minimisation” according to the criteria stipulated under the Act. Whilst accountability for the value arising from this fiscal expenditure is greater than that of the Council’s share, (being assessed by officials against set criteria), it is in our view less than ideal, since there is no requirement to measure efficacy of funding allocation relative to the activities being funded and/or against an overall strategy of national waste management and minimisation. Thus, funded activities can meet the criteria to promote or achieve waste minimisation, but this does not necessarily translate into the intended outcome of broader societal impact. Reiterating our point above, it is therefore questionable whether the distribution provisions of the hypothecated tax represents the optimal use of this money from both a waste minimisation and a broader consolidated fund perspective. Page 4 of 4 Packaging NZ submission to Tax Working Group April 2018 IN SUMMARY The Waste Fund epitomises the risk that hypothecated taxes expended without strong underpinning policy and overt accountability may be fiscally inefficient. What can amount to be substantial revenues have the potential to be squandered through fragmentation and diverse or contradictory objectives. Consideration of hypothecated taxes, in our opinion, is perhaps an example of good intentions over-ruling accountability for best outcomes. Sharon Humphreys Executive Director \[1\]
24th April 2018 Tax Working Group submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz SUMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP Introduction We are a not for profit free women’s health information service which also provides some personal health services. We are particularly relevant to those on low incomes. We are writing on behalf of our governance group and staff to add our voices to support moves toward a fairer tax system - one that addresses the environment that has led to the increasing gap between highest and lowest income earners in Aotearoa New Zealand, and the subsequent growing inequalities in Aotearoa. What does the future of tax look like to you? An Ethical and Principled Taxation System that Creates a Fairer Society It is our view that government needs to intervene so as to halt, and reverse, the continual growing inequality in our country. We need a tax system that recognises the importance of aroha – love and empathy, a caring society, with recognition of the importance of the collective pot, so that wealth is shared by all. We advocate that vibrant, healthy communities and societies need to recognise that uplifting those most vulnerable benefits all. Recognizing the tax relief needs of women (with feminization of poverty), single parents, all beneficiaries, low wage workers, lower income families and children should be central to the review. A long term view to support the changing demographics, and a sustainable environmentally aware approach to the taxation of the future is also crucial. We want to change the narratives on taxation in our country so that our taxation system is seen as a public good, and a positive contribution to our country’s well-being. We need to increase the revenue required to fund high quality public health, welfare and education systems, and for investment in employment and the protection of the natural environment etc. Cross-political party 53 Waldegrave Street P.O. Box 4253 PALMERSTON NORTH 4442 Phone: (06) 357 0314 pnwhc@xtra.co.nz work is important to an ethical approach to taxation, for a fairer tax system, so that bottom lines are agreed to and a halt to tax cuts being used as election bribes occurs. We must reverse the mindset that leads to cuts in public spending and replace this by public recognition of the need for increasing revenue. An emphasis on the need to raise more tax is needed, as we under-tax people as compared to similar countries. What is the Purpose of Tax? Protections and Excellent Public Services In our view the purpose of tax is to fund public services and protection measures to ensure a strong social safety net, excellent public services and protection and restoration of our waterways, forests and flora and fauna. We want quality public health, schools and tertiary education system etc. Are We Taxing The Right Things? Specific Taxation Policy Supported 1. We support restoring a progressive taxation system so that the wealthy pay more tax. 2. GST is not generally supported as makes it harder for low income families to afford living costs and making healthy choices (such as healthy food choices) more difficult. We also think that there needs to be recognition of the fact that GST affects those on lower incomes the most because they are required to spend all their earnings on basic living costs. This impact and reliance on GST needs to be decreased by the introduction of other fairer taxes. 3. We do not support secondary tax which affects low income and part-time workers most. We support the creation of a tax system that makes it easier for those on benefits to transition into paid work comfortably. 4. We support a capital gains tax, and particularly want all property speculators taxed to discourage the proliferation of this activity while at the same time raising revenue from this. 5. We urgently want to see an emphasis on the taxation of big multi-corporations who attain wealth from our people and take it off shore. We support the idea of a UN Global Tax Body that would make sure multinationals pay a fair share of tax. This is critical in the measures to close the gaps between rich and poor not only in Aotearoa but world wide. 6. We support a fair tax on businesses and also perhaps some tax rebates to encourage ethical and ecological business practices. 7. We want to know that wealthy tax evaders are being investigated and caught (with a much greater emphasis than that of benefit fraud). 8. We support environmental taxes including a tax on polluters, and taxes that support conservation work such as a tax on those visiting the country for this purpose. 9. We support consideration of a universal basic income as a model for the future. 10. We support tax rebates for lower income workers in the not for profit sector (a tax rebate that is called salary sacrifice in Australia). 11. We also want to express our support for the creation of a public contribution fund for those willing and able to pay more tax. Can We Make Housing More Affordable? Yes making housing more affordable is something that can and should be achieved. We support using Kiwisaver, rent to own and other means of supporting people into buying a first home. What Tax Issues Matter Most to You? A fairer tax system that redistributes wealth and protects people and the environment is most important to us. Conclusion We support changes to the tax system that enhances fairness through redistribution and maximises impact for a fairer society that protects our people and our environment.

This impact and reliance on GST needs to be decreased by the introduction of other fairer taxes. 3. We do not support secondary tax which affects low income and part-time workers most. We support the creation of a tax system that makes it easier for those on benefits to transition into paid work comfortably. 4. We support a capital gains tax, and particularly want all property speculators taxed to discourage the proliferation of this activity while at the same time raising revenue from this. 5. We urgently want to see an emphasis on the taxation of big multi-corporations who attain wealth from our people and take it off shore. We support the idea of a UN Global Tax Body that would make sure multinationals pay a fair share of tax. This is critical in the measures to close the gaps between rich and poor not only in Aotearoa but world wide. 6. We support a fair tax on businesses and also perhaps some tax rebates to encourage ethical and ecological business practices. 7. We want to know that wealthy tax evaders are being investigated and caught (with a much greater emphasis than that of benefit fraud). 8. We support environmental taxes including a tax on polluters, and taxes that support conservation work such as a tax on those visiting the country for this purpose. 9. We support consideration of a universal basic income as a model for the future. 10. We support tax rebates for lower income workers in the not for profit sector (a tax rebate that is called salary sacrifice in Australia). 11. We also want to express our support for the creation of a public contribution fund for those willing and able to pay more tax. Can We Make Housing More Affordable? Yes making housing more affordable is something that can and should be achieved. We support using Kiwisaver, rent to own and other means of supporting people into buying a first home. What Tax Issues Matter Most to You? A fairer tax system that redistributes wealth and protects people and the environment is most important to us. Conclusion We support changes to the tax system that enhances fairness through redistribution and maximises impact for a fairer society that protects our people and our environment.

PEPANZ represents private sector companies holding petroleum exploration and mining permits, service companies and individuals working in the industry. Regulatory certainty is very important for the petroleum mining industry given the significant capital investments that have been made and the long-term nature of petroleum mining projects. The stability of fiscal policy settings is particularly important. We thank you for the opportunity to submit to the TWG. We are happy for the TWG and the Secretariat to contact us to discuss any of the points raised in this submission. Summary This submission is in three sections and responds to questions in the Background Paper in relation to: • capital gains tax; • environmental taxation; and • fairness and balance. Broadly, PEPANZ submits that: • if a capital gains tax is to be introduced, it should not apply to shares or interests in controlled petroleum mining entities; 2 • it is not appropriate to use the New Zealand tax system to drive desired environmental or other social outcomes; • New Zealand should not consider replacing the current royalties regime with a resources rent tax; and • New Zealand’s current framework for taxing petroleum mining fairly recognises the unique characteristics of the industry and does not confer undue tax advantages to its participants. Submission Capital gains tax 1. PEPANZ notes that the TWG requests submissions concerning whether “New Zealand \[should\] introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)?” and, if so, what features it should have. PEPANZ notes further that TWG also requests submissions on the design issues of a capital gains tax (CGT. In particular, the TWG request for submissions on: 1.1. what assets should be covered by a CGT; 1.2. how a CGT would integrate with current tax laws; and 1.3. whether capital losses should be ring-fenced to be offset only against capital gains income or should be able to be offset against any income. 2. PEPANZ does not express any views as to whether New Zealand should introduce a CGT as a matter of general tax policy. 3. However, concerning the specific design issues listed above, PEPANZ submits that if a CGT is to be introduced, it should not disturb the current excluded income treatment (in section CX 42) of consideration derived from disposal of shares or interests in a controlled petroleum mining entity (CPME). 4. In support of this submission, PEPANZ notes that: 4.1. Petroleum mining assets are already fully taxable: The income that a petroleum miner derives from the disposal of petroleum mining assets is already subject to income tax (section CT 1). As petroleum miners can also claim a deduction for the acquisition cost of petroleum mining assets (sections DT 3 and DT 4), the net effect of the regime is that income tax is paid on the appreciation of petroleum mining assets. Therefore, in the absence of further amendments, taxing the profits derived from the disposal of shares or interests in a CPME, the value of which are explicitly linked to the value of petroleum assets already within the tax net, could result in double taxation of investors in a CPME. 3 4.2. A previous tax on shares in controlled petroleum mining entity has already been proven ineffective and repealed: Capital gains from the disposal of shares in a CPME were previously subject to tax. However, those rules did not achieve their policy objectives as, contrary to the original policy intent, they enabled petroleum miners to obtain deductions in excess of 100% of their capital invested in petroleum mining development and exploration expenditure. 1 Accordingly, sections CJ 6 and DM 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (the predecessors of the current sections CX 42 and DT 13) were amended in 2002 to exclude consideration derived from a disposal of shares in a CPME from gross income and prevent deductions for the cost of those shares. 4.3. Current Government policy makes it unlikely that a new CGT would be effective at raising revenue or equitable: Any continuation or furtherance of a similar nature of the current Government’s policy stance towards petroleum mining (exemplified by the recent ban on all new offshore exploration permits) would: a) make it increasingly unlikely that any revenue collected by a CGT that applies to CPME shares would justify its associated compliance or administration costs given that current Government policies will only serve to decrease the value of CMPE shares going forward (assuming that a CGT would not have retrospective application, which PEPANZ submits must be the case); b) mean that any attempt to address previous issues concerning capital losses generated from the disposal of CPME shares by ring-fencing those losses against gains from future disposals (which PEPANZ does not support) would be inequitable because Government policies are actively discouraging further investment in New Zealand petroleum mining. Environmental taxation It is not appropriate to use tax system to drive environmental outcomes 5. PEPANZ agrees that New Zealand and the rest of the world currently face profound environmental challenges such as climate change 2 and acknowledges the role of Government policies in addressing them. 6. However, PEPANZ submits that the New Zealand tax system should not be used as a lever to ensure that “consumers and producers face the costs of emissions and other environmental harm” (as suggested at page 15 of the Background Paper). 1 See Petroleum Mining – Base Maintenance: Regulatory Impact and Compliance Cost Statement, October 2001, and Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill – Commentary on the Bill, December 2001. 2 PEPANZ has acknowledged this on many occasions, see for example: http://www.pepanz.com/news/response-to-greenpeace-open-letter-on-oil-and-gas- exploration/ and http://www.pepanz.com/oil-and-gas-new-zealand/responding-to-climate- change/. 4 7. In support of this submission, PEPANZ notes that: 7.1. Targeting particular activities is contrary to the established principles of a good tax system: The New Zealand tax system should, to the greatest extent possible, be objective and not discriminate against certain activities. This was acknowledged by the 2010 Victoria University Tax Working Group, which espoused 6 key principles of a good taxation system, including that the tax system should be fair and: “Taxes should be efficient and minimise as far as possible impediments to economic growth. That is, the tax system should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (e.g. causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms”. 3 7.2. Using the tax system to address externalities is contrary to our broad-base-low rate system: Parliament should minimise the extent to which it uses the tax system in a manner that effectively picks winners and losers, such as by targeting certain activities with additional taxes to address externalities. This is to prevent New Zealand’s departure from its broad-base low-rate philosophy and reduce the risk that our tax system becomes something fundamentally different than the mechanism by which revenue is collected to fund the provision of public goods, services and transfers. This view is supported by the 2001 Tax Review, which concluded (in the context of other punitive taxes such as excise and duties on alcohol, tobacco, gaming and petrol) that such taxes cannot readily be justified on conventional policy grounds. 4 8. New Zealand’s tax system is not the appropriate policy tool to drive positive environmental outcomes. Instead, PEPANZ continues to support the use of designated policy tools such as the Emissions Trading Scheme which is demand focussed and target emissions which actually contribute to climate change. 5 Any policy changes proposed by the TWG should be integrated with and not replace such tools. Resource rent taxes are not appropriate as an alternative to current royalty regime 9. PEPANZ supports the Government, as the owner of petroleum resources, seeking to maximise the value of New Zealand’s petroleum resources for the benefit of all New Zealanders. 6 10. PEPANZ submits that the most effective way to achieve this is the continuation of New Zealand’s current approach to impose royalties on the extraction of Crown-owned 3 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf, page 15. 4 https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2007-11/taxreview2001-report.pdf, page 41 5 http://www.pepanz.com/assets/Uploads/PEPANZ-Oil-and-Gas-Questions-and-Answers-April- 2018.pdf. 6 http://www.pepanz.com/dmsdocument/15, page 15. 5 minerals and, therefore, that New Zealand should not consider replacing this with a resources rent tax (as suggested at page 41 of the Background Paper). 11. In support of this submission, PEPANZ notes that: 11.1. The current royalty regime is appropriate: Royalties from the petroleum mining industry have delivered substantial sums to the Government’s Consolidated Fund over a long period. Over the ten year period to 2015 royalties from petroleum production amounted to NZ$3.2 billion. 7 PEPANZ notes that the 2012 review of the current petroleum royalty regime concluded that it is internationally competitive and meets the objectives for an appropriate royalty regime. 8 11.2. Petroleum resources rent tax was considered in a comprehensive review of New Zealand’s petroleum tax regime and rejected: A comprehensive review commissioned by the New Zealand Government in 2009 concluded that a resources rent tax is not appropriate and should not be considered for New Zealand unless very attractive discoveries are made and/or gas prices rise very substantially (which has not occurred). Notably, after modelling the likely impact of Australia’s petroleum resources rent tax on New Zealand’s industry, the report found that “other things being equal, \[it\] does not compete with New Zealand’s oil taxation system”; 9 11.3. Petroleum resources rent taxes are currently under scrutiny in other jurisdictions: Notwithstanding that Australia recently decided to continue with its petroleum resources rent tax, the Australian Government has acknowledged, as a response to widespread criticism of its effectiveness, 10 that the regime requires significant structural change in order to function as an effective revenue collection tool. 11 PEPANZ submits that the Australian experience is a compelling case for continuing with New Zealand’s royalty regime rather than departing from it. Fairness and balance 12. The Background Paper states that it may be appropriate to consider whether tax concessions that result in some sectors of the economy paying lower effective rates are still relevant and fair (see page 29). 7 https://www.productivity.govt.nz/sites/default/files/sub-low-emissions-65-pepanz-53Kb.pdf. 8 http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/natural-resources/oil-and- gas/overview-crown-minerals-act-regime/pdf-document-library/Cabinet%20paper%20- %20Royalties%20on%20minerals.pdf. 9 Evaluation of the Petroleum Tax and Licensing Regime of New Zealand, Final Report to the Ministry of Economic Development, July 2009. 10 https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/13/petroleum-rent-resource-tax- review-author-may-face-senate-questions. 11 https://treasury.gov.au/consultation/options-to-address-the-design-issues-identified-in-the- petroleum-resource-rent-tax-review. 6 13. The petroleum mining industry was not specifically identified in the Background Paper as a sector that receives tax concessions. But given that the petroleum mining tax regime has on many prior occasions been subject to scrutiny, for the avoidance of doubt PEPANZ submits that no material concessions are currently afforded to the petroleum mining industry. This is consistent with the conclusion in APEC’s 2015 Peer Review on Fossil Fuel Subsidy Reforms in New Zealand that no part of New Zealand’s petroleum specific regime constituted “inefficient subsidies that encourages wasteful consumption”. 12 14. In particular, PEPANZ notes that: 14.1. IRD has recently reviewed the tax treatment of decommissioning expenditure (which led to the replacement of the previous spread-back mechanism with a refundable tax credit) and reaffirmed its view that it is not concessionary. Rather, the treatment recognises that the particular business lifecycle for petroleum mining leads to over-taxation during a petroleum field’s productive years and large amounts of expenditure being incurred once revenue generation has ceased that would not otherwise be deductible (i.e. the current regime over-taxes on the way through and that over-taxation is reversed by the credit at the end). 13 14.2. The exemption for non-residents rig operators and seismic survey providers in relation to offshore permits (in section CW 57) is not concessionary: (a) in 2013, IRD supported extending the period of the section CW 57 exemption, on the basis that if the exemption was repealed no extra revenue is likely to be collected from oil rig operators and firms purchasing their services could pay less tax. This is because the New Zealand tax deductible costs of engaging oil rig operators would increase without any corresponding amount of additional income (Double tax agreements relieving rig operators who are in New Zealand’s territorial waters for less than 183 days from any New Zealand taxation); 14 (b) in the absence of the exemption, the progress of petroleum exploration and subsequent generation of royalty revenue from any ensuing production would be slowed; 15 12 http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/energy/international- relationships/pdf-document-library/peer-review-fossil-fuel-subsidy-reforms-nz.pdf, page 13. 13 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2017-ris-areiirm-bill/petroleum-mining- decommissioning. 14 https://treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2009-02/ris-ird-ete-nov13.pdf. 15 http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/energy/international- relationships/pdf-document-library/peer-review-fossil-fuel-subsidy-reforms-nz.pdf, page 40. 7 (c) by encouraging non-resident rig operators to remain within New Zealand’s territorial waters for longer periods, New Zealand generates increased tax revenue by way of PAYE on rig-worker salaries and GST charged on supplies to those employees. 15. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development also identified the immediate deduction of exploration expenditure (in section DT 1) as a concession. However, PEPANZ submits that the treatment is not concessionary and should be retained on the basis that: 15.1. the general tax rule in New Zealand is that expenditure on research and development is normally deductible in the year it is incurred while expenditure on capital assets should be capitalised and amortised over the economic life of the asset. Allowing immediate deductibility of exploration expenditure is in accordance with this principle because it is not clear at the time exploration expenditure is incurred whether it is of a capital nature, since it is more likely than not that a particular exploration well will not result in a revenue generating asset. Further, if exploration expenditure results in such an asset, the expenditure is clawed back and deducted as petroleum development expenditure; and 15.2. the measure is consistent with New Zealand’s broad-based low-rate tax principles, and is intended to avoid distortions between sectors. Allowing an immediate deduction for expenditure that does not create a capital asset is consistent with New Zealand taxation principles and the treatment of other industries (for example, the deduction for research and development expenditure). 16 16. PEPANZ notes the Low-emissions Economy draft report recently released by the Productivity Commission on 27 April 2018 recommended that “The Government should phase out all subsidies that support the ongoing production and use of fossil fuels.” 17 PEPANZ will make a detailed submission on that report separately, but reiterate that for reasons including those set out in this submission none of the tax measures broadly referred to in that report should be viewed as a subsidy to the petroleum mining industry. 17.

Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission on the Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper. 2. The Public Health Association of New Zealand (PHA) is a national association with members from the public, private and voluntary sectors. Our organisation’s vision is ‘Good health for all - health equity in Aotearoa’, or ‘Hauora mō te katoa – oranga mō te Ao’, and our purpose is to advocate for the health of all New Zealanders. 3. To achieve this, we provide a forum for information and debate about public health action in Aotearoa New Zealand. Public health action aims to improve, promote and protect the health of the whole population through the organised efforts of society. 4. We recognise Te Tiriti o Waitangi as Aotearoa New Zealand’s founding document, defining respectful relationships between tangata whenua and tangata Tiriti, and are actively committed to supporting Te Tiriti values in policy and legislation. The purposes and principles of a good tax system 5. Given that our focus is the health of all New Zealanders, the perspective we bring to our discussion of taxation considers the extent to which the taxation system promotes or inhibits equitable outcomes for the health of our citizens. 6. The World Health Organization’s work on equity and the social determinants of health has demonstrated that “the true upstream drivers of health inequities reside in the social, economic and political environments” (1). The WHO defines equity as the absence of avoidable or remediable differences among groups of people; and the New Zealand Ministry of Health elaborates this concept to acknowledges that not only are differences in health status unfair and unjust, but they Page 2 of 13 are also the result of differential access to the resources necessary for people to lead healthy lives (2). 7. Accordingly, our vision for the future of New Zealand’s tax system is based on the values of equity, fairness and social justice. A tax system should have as its starting point intent to improve the wellbeing of society and the environment on which society depends. 8. In framing our thinking about the taxation system, we welcome the raranga of the elements comprising the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework. The tendency to consider the ‘economy’ as if the daily lives of every citizen are not inextricably bound up with ‘the rational use of scarce resources’ implies that the economy is to be treated as if it is a separate entity from the lives of many people. The concept of ‘the economy’ has similarly become dissociated from our concept of ‘the environment’ when the resources that comprise the economy are elements of the environment - whether natural or constructed. We trust that, while the four capitals of the Treasury’s raranga will each receive due attention, the economic, social and environmental dimensions will be woven together and not constructed as competing claims. 9. Having advocated for a holistic view of wellbeing and the impact the taxation system has on our lives, we need to acknowledge limitations on our expertise and capacity, and will focus on those aspects of the taxation system and wellbeing with which we are most familiar. The purpose of tax: sharing our wealth 10. From our perspective, the primary purpose of the tax system should be to address the equitable distribution of the resources required for people to lead healthy lives. The background paper notes that the wealthiest 10% of the population contributes the largest portion of tax (35%). This may be true but we challenge the narrative of the ‘deserving wealthy’. The Oxfam Report Reward work not wealth revealed that income inequality is growing globally; last year saw biggest increase in the number of billionaires in history, with one more billionaire every two days. While 82% of all of the growth in global wealth in 2017 went to the top 1%, the bottom 50% saw no increase at all (3). This wealth is not acquired through hard work and talent. Oxfam calculated that approximately two thirds of billionaire wealth is the product of inheritance, cronyism and monopoly (3). Extreme inequality is also growing in New Zealand with the richest 1% of New Zealanders gaining 28% of all wealth created last year while the poorest 30% of the population got just 1%. “The extremely rich are growing fortunes they’ll never be able to spend in their lifetimes while the poorest and most vulnerable New Zealanders struggle to get by.” (4) 11. On the other hand the poorest portion of the population experiences the worst health. This outcome is most clearly evident from data on child poverty, material disadvantage and poor health. The Commissioner for Children and Otago University’s annual Child Poverty Monitor reported in 2017 that “Poverty interferes with the capacity of children to enjoy \[their\] rights and for children in rich countries, relative poverty also perpetuates cycles of disadvantage and inequity. As a result some children miss out on the opportunities to be educated, healthy or nourished compared with their peers” (5). Furthermore, New Zealand’s Child and Youth Mortality Review Committee Page 3 of 13 reported 26 April 2018 that “Children and young people living in the most deprived areas are three times more likely to die in childhood or adolescence than those living in the least deprived areas” (6). 12. This stultifying and deadly poverty affects not only the roughly one quarter of children who grow up with it, but also the rest of our society which bears the social and financial costs arising from ill health, educational failure, unemployment and, increasingly, crime. Independent researcher John Pearce analysed the costs of child poverty in 2012, concluding that “the annual cost of child poverty is between $6 billion and $16 billion, with the best estimate in the region of $8 billion. This is 3.5% to 9% of GDP, with the best estimate being about 4.5 (7). If his worst estimate were true, it would be roughly equivalent of the whole health sector’s current share of GDP. 13. On the other hand, the accumulation of high income, inheritance and capital gain permits the acquisition and enjoyment of wealth, including publicly-funded healthcare, resulting in increasing social distance between those at the ‘top’ and those at the ‘bottom’, with housing being a predominant marker of status, and a major factor in perpetuating poverty. 14. In their book The Spirit Level: why equality is better for everyone Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson demonstrated the "pernicious effects that inequality has on societies: eroding trust, increasing anxiety and illness, (and) encouraging excessive consumption". They claim that for each of eleven different health and social problems: physical health, mental health, drug abuse, education, imprisonment, obesity, social mobility, trust and community life, violence, teenage pregnancies, and child well-being, outcomes are significantly worse in more unequal countries, whether rich or poor (8). 15. New Zealand research has demonstrated “the beneficial impact on health of an extra $100 a month is greater for someone in poverty than someone who is already wealthy. For someone in poverty, an extra $100 a month is more likely to go to basic, health-sustaining expenditures such as housing, heating and a decent diet” (9)(10) (11). 16. Even if the living wage replaced the minimum wage as an acceptable income for those on the lowest rung of employment, on its own, this would likely prove inflationary and would have little impact on inequality. To achieve more equitable outcomes across the population, it makes sense to increase taxation of the wealthiest and use some of that tax as a means to increase the income of the poorest portion of the population. We recommend two ways of doing this. 17. The first is to review the current rates. We would expect to keep in place the principle of a broad- based, low rate system, but the rates at either end of the current model seem to us to be unfair and unrealistic. Taking 10% from anyone earning less than $14,000 seems at best mean-spirited and at worst prejudicial. The median income in 2016 was $48,800 p.a. and around $75,000 the average. Since $70,000 is no longer a high income, anyone whose income is significantly more than that is significantly privileged by the current rates. We understand that the higher tax bracket in the UK commences at 150,000 pounds. Page 4 of 13 18. The other approach we strongly recommend is some form of wealth tax (e.g. inheritance, capital gains or land). The technicalities of assessing the most appropriate kind of wealth tax suitable for New Zealand requires attention to detail that is not within our capacity. However, we understand that the OECD has recently released a major study on wealth taxes including recommendations for designing such taxes: http://www.oecd.org/tax/the-role-and-design-of-net-wealth-taxes-in-the- oecd-9789264290303-en.htm 19. We also understand that eleven European countries have been working to design a Financial Transactions Tax that could generate significant revenue but have not yet been able to get agreement on how to implement it: https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2017-07- 05/top-financiers-call-europe-agree-robin-hood-tax “ GST 20. The burden of GST falls disproportionately on poor people. The price of bread matters to someone struggling to manage a small budget and is of no consequence to someone whose disposable income is sufficient not to care. Consequently, GST helps drive the poor to buy the cheapest food, when more nutritious food might be within reach if it cost a little less. 21. The case for excluding specific products from GST as a lever for attaining health, environmental and social goals has been often made. However, as the evidence of benefit from this approach is inconclusive at this stage, we have no view on whether exclusion of some goods (e.g. healthy staple foods, heating, and internet access) should be adopted. But because the impact of GST is so significant to those on low incomes, we recommend reducing the level of GST to 10% from the current 15%. We expect that the resulting loss in revenue would be compensated for by other taxes on products with negative externalities (e.g. carbon emissions) and harmful products (e.g. tobacco and sugary drinks). The purpose of tax: incentives for change 22. The second main purpose of the tax system should be to discourage and reduce activity with negative social and environmental consequences and to encourage activity which has benefits for society and the environment. The first point we need to make, though, is that we don’t accept the distinction made in the background paper between activities that are harmful for society (e.g. pollution) and those that are harmful for an “individual who is unable or unwilling to act in their best interest” (e.g. tobacco smoking, alcohol and unhealthy food). We reject this distinction for two reasons: the first being that just as individual bees in a hive are acting as part of the whole hive, an individual's actions and circumstances will have consequences for the whole society. Secondly individuals are influenced and shaped by their environment and do not act in a vacuum; if that environment is structured to support or erode health-promoting behaviour individuals are likely to respond accordingly. Page 5 of 13 23. The sale of dangerous products benefits a significant proportion of commercial activity, whereas the costs to society and the economy for treatment and care for just some of our most common non- communicable diseases - cancer, heart disease, diabetes and mental illness - are huge and growing (12). These externalities are as problematic for the economy as are water, air and waste pollution. 24. New Zealand politicians have been far too cautious about taxing harmful products, even as the toll of misery, avoidable death and health care costs rises. The evidence shows that tobacco and alcohol taxes consistently raise prices, reduce consumption, and save lives, while generating additional revenues to support public services (13). Woodward & Blakely attribute about half the reduction in coronary heart disease mortality from the 1980s to 1990s to treatment and half due to improvement in risk factors (e.g. blood pressure and tobacco). Tax was a major factor in persuading people to give up smoking, and for young people never to start (9). Hiscock and others noted in an article in the journal Tobacco Control in 2017 that “tobacco tax increases are the most effective and inexpensive way of reducing tobacco smoking prevalence, consumption, initiation and inequalities in smoking” (14). 25. One argument commonly used against the introduction of ‘sin taxes’ is that they are unfair because they have a disproportionate effect on disadvantaged groups. It must be remembered that the burden of preventable non-communicable diseases caused by consumption of these harmful products falls unfairly on these same groups. In New Zealand smoking is three times more prevalent in the most deprived neighbourhoods, twice as prevalent in Māori men and three times as prevalent in Māori women as European. New research shows that there are major increases in inequalities for the obesity-related cancers (15). 26. Increasing the price of harmful products through tax has been shown to be not only a most effective way to reduce consumption but also reduces health inequalities. This is because lower socioeconomic households are more sensitive to price and consistently respond to higher prices by eliminating consumption in greater numbers or by reducing consumption more than richer households (13). Revenue raised by health taxes can further benefit poorer households or groups bearing a disproportionate burden of disease when tax revenue is used progressively e.g. to fund quit smoking programmes. In Denmark saturated fats were taxed and accompanied with corresponding changes to the income tax code (16). 27. Evidence also shows that the public is much more likely to support this kind of tax if they know that the revenue generated will be directly reinvested in health (17). A majority of the NZ public already supports a sugar-sweetened beverage tax as shown by a survey in 2015 (18). This support could be further strengthened if tax revenue were to fund sports in schools as the UK does with its soft drink levy (19) or used to expand the breakfast in schools programme. Framing public messages around these taxes must emphasise the beneficial potential of tax to fund much needed health care and other socially beneficial programmes.

Our view of the ‘civilised society’ Wendell Holmes refers to in the background paper, is captured succinctly by Nelson Mandela, who said “A nation should not be judged by how it treats its highest citizens but its lowest ones”. We consider that government has a responsibility to use a system of taxation as one of the policy tools at its disposal to promote the equitable wellbeing of all its citizens, and especially those who have the least resources available and accessible to them. 29. Cash transfers from the wealthy to the poor is one way of achieving this, but State provision of publicly owned services is an equally important way to create a more equitable society. The proportions of government expenditure indicated in Figure 6 of the background paper - prioritising social services, health and education - are roughly where most New Zealanders expect to see their tax dollars spent. But each of those areas of expenditure is complex and subject to considerable pressure from changing demographics and changing expectations. 30. For example, there is good evidence that the health sector has been seriously under-funded to manage increasing population demand and infrastructural costs: (http://www.union.org.nz/health- vote-2017-18-post-budget). It is even more evident that, as the system has been squeezed to do more with less, resources have been prioritised for clinical services over prevention. While this might be a rational response to urgent need, it is poor economics, since the need for treatment and care will not reduce without investment in prevention - currently at approximately 2% of Vote:Health. Furthermore, demographic pressure from an older, more diverse population, with long-term conditions (cancer, cvd, diabetes) will continue well into the future, while our failure to invest in the health of children and adolescents sees younger generations presenting with the health problems of tomorrow as well as today - most notably mental health. 31. The obverse of taxes as a disincentive is subsidies as an investment in health promoting behaviours. New Zealand has often been much quicker off the mark when it comes to subsidy - notably for sport - and we have also been quite creative in the variety of ways we have found to do this. The establishment of the Health Sponsorship Council, initially to replace tobacco sponsorship of sport, which subsequently picked up a range of other health promotion campaigns, was a significant milestone in this regard; more recently investment in the Akina Foundation to promote social enterprise - both for-profit and not-for-profit organisations - provides another model. 32. The scale of change that climate change presents requires a much wider consideration of who should pay for what and how. A UN conference in February this year urged participating countries to “strengthen the effectiveness of their tax regimes to unleash much-needed domestic resources to ensure the realisation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as well as the promotion of inclusive economic growth” (20). A summit on the SDGs convened by Victoria University in April this year was NZ’s first attempt to bring together academia, government, business and civil society to discuss a whole-of-society approach to responding to these goals. The NZ government has signed up to the goals, but to date has not developed a plan to address them. Page 7 of 13 33. The role of non-government not-for-profit organisations in the delivery of social, health and environmental services is already considerable. However, there is no consistent cross-government approach to the engagement of NGOs, many of which are funded, at least in part, via government contracts, while others might exist from hand-to-mouth on community fundraising. Current reviews of the 1908 Incorporated Societies Act and the Charities Act 2005 provide opportunities to consider how these expressions of civil society’s concern for their fellow-citizens and our collective future might be enhanced - including how they might be better treated in the taxation system. The purpose of tax: critical issues An effective carbon tax 34. Climate change has been described as “the greatest global threat to public health in the 21st century” (21). As with other harmful products, there is a case to be made for introducing an effective carbon tax reflecting the true price of the negative externalities carbon emissions impose on the environment and health. NZ’s current emission trading scheme is ineffective, as evidenced by the fact that our emissions are increasing (22). An effective carbon tax should reduce emissions and encourage the public and industry to move to a low emissions economy. Revenue from a carbon tax could be used to fund other activities to reduce emissions, such as afforestation, active transport, agricultural and industrial research - and consequently garner more public support. 35. Awareness of environmental sustainability should also be integral to decisions on our taxation system. Healthy human lives are as dependent on our environments - natural and constructed - as all other living things. We trust that other submitters with greater expertise, such as Ora Taiao - the New Zealand Climate and Health Council, will address the specific taxation issues that affect environmental sustainability, and that inter-dependence of the four capitals of the Treasury’s Living standards model will ensure that these interactions will retain a focus on the primary goal of improving the wellbeing of society and the environment on which society depends. Housing Affordability 36. Housing affordability is the single most destructive contributor to the ‘pernicious effects that inequality has on societies’ as described by Pickett and Wilkinson. Current media representation of New Zealanders’ interest in housing as a ladder which everyone must climb illustrates a radical shift from the concept of a house as a home to a metaphor for social mobility. Whether children have a warm, dry, home and security of tenure are the most significant factors influencing child poverty. 37. This is not only the most urgent issue facing our society, but also possibly the most complex. Simplistic solutions such as increasing supply or freeing up more land do not resolve the fundamental problem which is that housing, due to its privileged position in the tax system, is the most obvious and rational place for New Zealanders to invest for their future wealth. This is due to two major distortions in the economy which are the lack of tax on imputed rental income of owner- occupied dwellings, and the absence of a capital gains tax (CGT) on residential property (23). Page 8 of 13 38. The current focus on supply and land fails to address the crucial issue that our current market-driven model for housing is flawed and will never deliver the tens of thousands of affordable, quality homes that we need. This market-driven model also fails to account for the externalities of inappropriate land use including ecosystem degradation and the loss of fruitful agricultural land and our irreplaceable soil. A report recently released by Statistics New Zealand and the Ministry for the Environment found that NZ loses 192 million tonnes of soil every year as a direct result of poor land use including urban growth which has seen a 10% increase in the total size of our towns and cities (between 1996 and 2012)(24). 39. Property and housing-related taxation and trade-offs must be radically reformed to improve affordability and re-orient the housing market so that it competes for capital on a level field with more productive investment opportunities. We need to reclaim the perception of housing from merely an investment vehicle to a home for people to fulfil a satisfying and healthy lifestyle. 40. Accordingly we recommend: a. Introduction of a capital gains tax that includes all investment properties capable of generating capital gain; b. Revision of tax categorisation of expenditures on rental housing as an incentive to bring rental properties up to either the Building Code or the regulatory standards under the Healthy Homes Guarantee Act 2017 (whichever standards are higher), so that the costs of bringing rental property up to the Code would be considered as ‘maintenance’ not ‘improvement’. Countering Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill BEPS Bill 41. The PHA recently submitted to the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill in support of the Bill, but with recommendations to strengthen it along lines similar to those adopted in Australia. In particular we advised that: a. public transparency is fundamental, so the public have access to information relating to business activities arising from comprehensive disclosure to tax authorities; b. the Committee should review the Australian Tax Transparency Code to identify proposals that could be usefully incorporated into this Bill; c. tax avoidance should be recognised as fraudulent and criminal; and d. a comprehensive statutory framework for combating tax avoidance should be developed. Page 9 of 13 Conclusions: a tax system for future generations 42. The Public Health Association wants a taxation system that promotes equitable outcomes for the health of all our citizens. A tax system: a. whose primary purpose is to ensure equitable distribution of the resources required for people to lead healthy lives; b. should continue to be broad-based, but should shift the tax onus further towards those who can afford to pay; c. can be achieved by a mix of increased taxes on high incomes and wealth; d. should enable the provision of publicly-owned and well-funded social, health and education services to ensure their availability and accessibility to all citizens; e. should also enable universal cash entitlements for all families, with complementary benefits for individuals with special needs, such as disability; and emergencies, such as earthquake, storm and flooding. 43. We consider that taxation should also be used to incentivise social change and discourage activity that has negative social, environmental and economic consequences. We recommend specific taxes in relation to: a. Alcohol: i. increase excise tax on alcohol by at least 50% to increase the price of alcohol by at least 10%, excise rates to be adjusted annually to take into account changes in income ii. Calculate rates of excise tax on alcohol content, not volume of beverage iii. Implement a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy to address the availability of very cheap alcohol iv. Increase the existing level of tax hypothecation b. Tobacco: i. Government mandated tobacco prices: set retail prices and maximum prices before tax, provide an option to increase revenue without increasing the average tobacco price ii. Dedicated tax: Until 2025, dedicate at least $100m of tobacco tax revenue annually to create an environment which minimises smoking uptake and supports smokers to quit iii. Tobacco tax rises: Continue to use tobacco tax increases to reduce smoking prevalence, as long as a proportion of tobacco tax revenue is used for tobacco Page 10 of 13 control, and smokefree policy changes are made to make it easier for smokers to quit iv. Loose tobacco: Ensure that tobacco tax rates per weight of loose tobacco (roll your own) and factory-made cigarettes do not encourage switching between products. c. Sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs): i. Introduce a tax, modelled on the UK “soft drink industry levy” in conjunction with other measures to decrease availability and consumption ii. Design the tax on SSBs to maximise the stimulus to manufacturers to reformulate products to have a lower sugar content as well as discouraging consumption by consumers. 44. We consider that government should use taxation as one of a suite of policy tools with which to address complex and critical issues such as housing and climate change. 45.

Tax relief for charities A submission to Hon Judith Collins, Minister of Revenue From Chris Milne, Community Foundations of New Zealand 3 April 2017 Background Charities play an important role in New Zealand, delivering a range of services to communities and causes that would be difficult for government or the private sector to deliver. The community benefits provided by charities are recognised and supported by government through government grants, exemption from income tax, and encouraging and rewarding members of the public who provide financial support to charities by providing generous tax credits on donations. The revenue required by charities to deliver their services is partly sourced from investment income, including dividends from companies. Imputation cre dits Company tax is paid on income earned by New Zealand companies. Income tax paid by companies can be attached to dividends paid to shareholders, in the form of imputation credits. Company tax is effectively a withholding tax on the portion of company earnings that is paid to shareholders by way of dividends. Shareholders who are subject to New Zealand tax have to pay tax on dividends they receive, but can use imputation credits to pay all or part of that tax. The tax issue for charities The current imputation rules do not provide refunds of imputation credits that cannot be used. Shareholders who receive imputation credits greater than their tax liability can carry forward imputation credits to use against future tax liabilities. Tax exempt shareholders have no current or future tax liabilities, and therefore cannot access imputation credits on dividends they receive. Tax exempt shareholders therefore suffer tax at the company tax rate on dividends they receive from companies. This is contrary to the principle underpinning the imputation system, that shareholders should be treated as if the income earned by the company were earned by them directly. Tax exempt organisations & impact on optimal investment portfolios All income received by tax exempt organisations is appropriately exempt from income tax, other than company dividends. There is therefore an incentive for tax exempt organisations to invest their funds directly in commercial property, 100% owned companies and fixed interest securities where returns are received free of tax (note: RWT or Resident Withholding Tax is refundable). It is known that tax exempt organisations, once they reach a certain size, avoid investment in listed companies where imputation credits are lost. They do however invest in their own wholly-owned companies, which are, as a result of being wholly-owned, tax free. The non-recovery of imputation credits therefore incentivises investment portfolio structures that minimise tax. This is unfortunate as such portfolios are unlikely to be optimal in terms of risk and return and therefore such behaviour is likely to harm the longer term investment performance of charities – through sub-optimal asset allocation or reduced diversification. The fiscal cost of allowing claiming back of imputation credits by charities The benefit to charities and the fiscal cost to government of allowing refunds of imputation credits to tax exempt organisations is difficult to estimate. A 2004 study of the New Zealand non-profit sector (i) calculated that of the estimated $8.036b revenues of non-profit organisations, about 6% or $478m was from investment income. If the asset allocation of non-profit organisations were appropriately diversified, about $200m might be received from company dividends, and imputation credits attached to those dividends could be about $80m. Our submission We ask that legislation be amended so that organisations with tax exempt status be able to obtain refunds of imputation credits attached to dividends received.

In Support of Ngai Tahu Tribal Economies Strategy – Some Possible Lessons from the First Nation Experience DRAFT November 10, 2017 Prepared by the Ngai Tahu Research Centre and the Tulo Centre of Indigenous Economics DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 1 BACKGROUND In response to the trauma of European colonization many indigenous groups in Anglo settler states have reorganized their communities and societies and established development strategies that have facilitated cultural revival and significant improvements in economic opportunity and social well-being. However, the strategies used for achieving these ends are often different across countries, which is in part attributable to the specific institutional context of the settler state in which the indigenous group is responding. In the New Zealand context, we find a strong emphasis on co-governance and partnership between Maori and the national, regional, and local governments as a mechanism for achieving indigenous aspirations. Furthermore, we see the formation and growth of the corporate-beneficiary model as means to increase tribal wealth and economic opportunity. Although in the Canadian context there are examples of co-governance, there is significantly more emphasis placed on self-determined and independent governance as a development strategy. This strategy entails the formation of territorial jurisdiction, where an indigenous group gains the ability to regulate activities and raise taxes on the lands they own. These areas might be thought of as semi-autonomous indigenous states within Canada. The difference between the approaches can to some extent be explained by the different histories and institutional settings of the Canadian and New Zealand settler states. New Zealand was settled under the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi – an agreement that made Maori subjects of the Crown and that supposedly gave them the same status as other British subjects. It also guaranteed Maori tribes the right to self-govern their territories according to Maori lore and custom as long as the territory was not converted from Native title into a Crown title through either the sale of territory or through court processes. If converted from Native title to Crown title the territory, and people within that territory, would become governed by Crown law. In short, Maori tribal autonomy and self-government was directly linked to maintaining native land title. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 2 Once the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, the New Zealand settler government rapidly set-out on a vigorous land buying campaign. When land was not being made available at the rate needed to meet the insatiable demands of investors and settlers, the Crown put in place legal structures and processes that made it virtually impossible for Maori tribes to maintain their territories in Native title. This is why the colonization of New Zealand is often referred to as the ‘conquest by contract.’ In addition, Maori military resistance to land ‘sales’ also resulting in Crown confiscations that in turn hurried the conversion of tribal territories from Native title into Crown title. As a result, virtually all territory in New Zealand moved into Crown title quite early in New Zealand’s history meaning that the territory and the people within it became governed by Crown law, and consequently most Māori soon became tax-payers of the New Zealand state. This included land held in Maori land title. Maori land is a Crown-derived title which refers to land that is owned by Maori kinship groups but is regulated by Crown laws that specify how the land is to be owned and managed. Maori land was regulated in such a way as to make it difficult to retain and to encourage its sale to settlers. The outcome of this colonial history is that Maori tribes do not possess any territory that may be autonomously self-governed according to Māori custom and law. Given that this situation emerged very early on in New Zealand’s history it is very difficult for most Pakehā, and many Māori, to conceive of tribal territories with some level of autonomous self-governance. In addition, the transfer of nearly all Māori territory into Crown title makes it legally controversial to argue for the transfer of territory back into Native title, or perhaps other forms of title that provide greater self-determination. This situation is amplified by the institutional structures of New Zealand’s parliamentary democracy. As a unitary democracy since 1876 the country has had no experience of federalism, where particular territories within a nation-state have some level of independent self- governance. Even the roles and functions New Zealand’s regional and local governments are tightly legislated by New Zealand’s central government. Consequently it is very difficult for most people in New Zealand to imagine territorial areas that possess a level of political autonomy outside of central government. First Nations in Canada were removed from their traditional lands and placed on reserves. In much of Canada this was accomplished through historical treaties but in British Columbia there were very few historical treaties. Once placed on reserves, First Nation jurisdictions were removed by the constitution, policies and most notably the Indian Act and replaced by the federal and provincial governments. In particular, the federal government created the Department of Indian Affairs to implements control and jurisdiction on reserves. The Indian Act says how reserves and bands can operate, setting out rules for governing Indian reserves. It also defines who is, and who is not recognized as an "Indian". This is important as a key difference from Māori, who were made British citizens by the Treaty of Waitangi, as First Nations have a different relationship with the state from non-First Nation citizens because of inherited legal arrangements, including exemption on property tax on reserve land. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 3 The New Zealand situation is further complicated by land alienation process that led to the vast majority of Māori-owned territory, whether in native title, or Maori land title, being broken up into small fragmented land blocks. As outlined previously, this land was systematically sold due to regulations aimed at alienating Maori from their land. The result is that land that might be considered to be in Maori territory only exists in fragmented scatted blocks often in remote areas. This means that there are very few, if any, areas of land, which might provide coherent and contiguous areas on which self- governing territories might be established. Furthermore, the vast majority of Maori are settled in urban areas, away from traditional lands, where they are largely intermingled with New Zealanders from other cultures. Consequently there are few contiguous areas of Maori majority populations where self-governing territories might be established. This situation also makes it difficult to imagine Māori self-governing territories. First Nations have retained a greater territorial and demographic coherence and remain exempt from some taxes by other governments on their reserve lands It is for these reasons that most Maori tribes have not sought independent self- governance as a development strategy to facilitate cultural revival and improvements in economic opportunity and well-being. Instead, in the New Zealand context, the emphasis has been on co-governance with the New Zealand unitary government, and working on legislation to require local and regional co-governance. Treaty of Waitangi. In comparison, in part because of the federal system in which they operate, First Nations have sought to create autonomous areas within Canadian Provinces. Once successful First Nations have then passed laws to occupy these areas, where First Nation institutions are established including title and tax jurisdictional control. Thus, the different forms of regime, the different means of land alienation, and the different demographics have seen Māori and First Nations adopt different strategies that suit their specific context. Purpose Despite the lack of familiarity among Māori of jurisdictional control as a strategy for mana motuhake it is an approach that should not be ignored given the manner in which it has achieved significant success in Canada and the USA. Within these contexts it has generated economic opportunity and improved capacity for self-determined governance. With this in mind the purpose of the paper is to explain the way in which a jurisdictional control strategy is implemented. Fundamentally it is built upon the two central pillars of most governments – title and tax jurisdiction. A case study is used from Canada to illustrate the concepts, and furthermore a Ngāi Tahu case study is provided as a comparison and to explain how a jurisdictional control strategy might be implemented in New Zealand. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 4 The paper begins by providing a brief introduction to First Nations history in Canada, followed by an explanation of how these nations have brought land under their jurisdiction. This discussion is followed by a description of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation’s (MLCN) urban reserves, outlining the manner in greater jurisdictional control led to economic and social transformation. The strategy used in the urban reserve development is then investigated, while the many challenges and constraints experienced are studied. The MLCN case study is followed by an exploration of the Ngāi Tahu Wigram Skies development - outlining the economic benefits generated by this development, first to Ngāi Tahu, and second to the broader economy. This approach is compared to a jurisdictional control strategy so as to provide insight into how Ngāi Tahu might go about applying this strategy within their context to increase economic, social, and cultural opportunity. A Painfully Brief Introduction to First Nations There are 633 First Nation communities in Canada. These communities are dispersed throughout the ten provinces of Canada. There is great diversity with at least 50 distinct language groups with unique cultures. The greatest amount of language and cultural diversity is in BC with 200 First Nation communities and over 30 distinct languages. The First Nation land base for almost all communities across Canada is inadequate and in most cases uneconomic. First Nation economic, health, education and social outcomes are all well below national averages and the progress towards closing gaps is mixed. Generally, those living off reserve communities and those communities with more access to resources and economic opportunities are closing the gaps more quickly. First Nations does not include Inuit (northern Canada) and Metis (French and First Nation ancestry). These three groups together are considered aboriginal peoples. The 2016 Census reports about 1.7 million aboriginals in Canada or about 5% of the population. Since 2006, the aboriginal population has grown by 42% in Canada which is more than four times the growth rate of the non-aboriginal population. The First Nation population has grown by 39% in the last ten years. Among First Nations, 44% live in their reserve communities 1 . 1 For a complete statistical overview from 2016, see https://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily- quotidien/171025/dq171025a-eng.htm?HPA=1 DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 5 Despite the significant diversity, a common strategic bond among almost all First Nations is the restoration of their traditional lands and jurisdictions. Three broad strategies have emerged in the last 50 years. These strategies emerged because of (a) a failed proposed federal policy in 1969 to repeal the Indian Act and make First Nations subject to provincial jurisdictions and (b) some 1070s legal victories. Rights and Title – This strategy has focussed on court cases associated with aboriginal title and rights, changing the constitution and creating and implementing the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). It has been largely successful on all fronts. Recently, there has recognition of aboriginal title in traditional areas, and the federal and some provincial governments have committed to implementing UNDRIP and inherent aboriginal rights and title contained in s. 35 of the Canadian constitution. The challenge for this strategy is now to identify practical methods to implement these victories. Legislation, Taxation and Institutions – This is the strategy to practically implement First Nation jurisdiction and title. It has three broad elements. Enabling, legislation is passed so that other governments vacate jurisdictions as requested by First Nations. If they choose, First Nations pass laws to occupy these jurisdictions. First Nation institutions are established to help interested First Nations implement these jurisdictions. This strategy has been successful for some tax and land jurisdictions applied to reserve lands. Approximately 250 First Nations are now participating in this strategy through institutional and legislative frameworks. Modern Treaties and Agreements – Some First Nations have reached agreements and modern treaties with respect to their rights and title. These either resolve land claims to traditional territories, clarify jurisdictions or both. A little over 30 First Nations have reached these types of agreements including the Nisga’a Nation. The average length of time to negotiate these comprehensive agreements is near 20 years. All these strategies have relevance and possible lessons to the Ngai Tahu, but this section of the paper focusses on the First Nation practical institutional development strategy for two reasons. First, the Ngai Tahu already have a comprehensive settlement. Second, the Ngai Tahu tribal economies strategy contemplates the practical implementation of their title and jurisdiction. There are four sections. Adding Urban Lands to First Nation jurisdiction – This section briefly discusses some case studies of how First Nations added lands to their jurisdiction in urban areas. It also summarizes the economic and fiscal benefits realized by First Nations, regional economies and local governments from adding urban lands to their jurisdictions. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 6 The Economic Rationale and Strategy – The main reason that First Nations are restoring title and jurisdiction is to increase economic opportunities and improve outcomes for their tribal members. This section presents the economic basis for the practical institutional strategy and summarizes the potential economic and fiscal benefits that could be realized by implementing the strategy. Challenges – Change is hard. If It were not, then gaps between First Nations and the rest of Canada would have closed long ago. Some of the institutional strategy has been implemented but much remains. This section summarizes the main challenges to implementing this strategy. Lessons – The practical elements of the modern institutional development strategy are about 30 years old. Its strategic and political origin can be traced to well over a 100 years ago. The final First Nation section summarizes all the lessons that have learned to address each of these challenges. Adding lands to First Nation jurisdiction: First Nations can add lands to their jurisdiction through one of four processes. They can apply through the additions to reserve process (ATRs). They can purchase and then add lands through the Treaty Lands Entitlement process (TLEs). They can add lands through a specific or comprehensive claims or agreement negotiations process. And most recently, they can win an aboriginal title case and enter a negotiations process. Each one of these processes takes longer than adding lands to municipal boundaries. A review of 8 First Nation parcels converted to reserve status in urban areas revealed a reasonable estimate to be at least 8.6 years 2 . The comparable average length for a municipal boundary expansion is about 9 months 3 or about 11 times shorter. 2 Based on 70 applications under active review (at the time), the typical urban ATR-related delay may be at least 7.82 years. According to a National ATR Tracking System report provided by AANDC, there were 117 urban ATR applications under active review at the time. The report includes start dates for 70 applications. The average length of time these applications have been in the ATR process is 8.57 years. If all 70 applications were approved today, the average ATR-related delay, relative to the typical MBE, could be estimated at 7.82 years. 3 . It is common for a municipal council to be able to approve a boundary extension within six to twelve months. This estimate is from a Metro Vancouver Position Paper on the Federal Additions-to-Reserve Process, attached to the minutes of the March 2012 meeting of the Aboriginal Relations Committee, available at metrovancouver.org. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 7 The main reason for these delays the jurisdictional complexity that results when lands are moved from provincial jurisdiction to federal jurisdiction and then converted into an Indian reserve. This involves a series of considerations related to third party interests on the lands, institutional differences, liability considerations and service agreements with the previous tax authority. Resolving these issues to facilitate moving lands into First Nation jurisdiction explains the delays. There have been several legislative and policy suggestions to reduce the time including a new First Nation land registry, tax jurisdiction based service agreements and the Indigenous Land Title legislative proposal to address third party interests and liabilities. Hopefully, these solutions are implemented soon future because the benefits of adding lands to First Nations near or in urban areas are considerable for First Nations members and other governments. For reference purposes, we present two examples of First Nations who created urban reserves and then estimate the economic and fiscal benefits that resulted from adding lands to First Nation jurisdiction. Muskeg Lake Cree Lake Urban Reserve Example One of the Muskeg Lake Cree Nation’s (MLCN) urban reserves, Asimakaniseekan Askiy I.R. #102A, is shown in the Google Street View image below. The reserve is located within the municipal boundaries of the City of Saskatoon. The land was designated (for 86 years) in March 1991 and the MLCN leased (for 85 years) the land to Aspen Developments Inc. (a development company wholly owned by the MLCN). Muskeg Lake members can vote on subleases of the land. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 8 In 1993, the City and the MLCN completed a municipal services agreement. Under the agreement, the City provides municipal services, such as garbage collection, snow removal, and fire and police protection, and direct services, such as water and sewer. The reserve is the site of a significant level of commercial investment, including the McKnight Commercial Centre. There are three commercial facilities managed by Muskeg Lake Property Management on the urban ATR, including the McKnight Commercial Centre (35,000 sq ft of leasable area), which includes Veteran’s Plaza (an office complex), Cattail I (44,000 sq ft of leasable area), and Cattail II (11,000 sq ft of leasable area). All three facilities currently have 100% occupancy rates. Primary tenants include: Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations (FSIN), Saskatchewan Indian Gaming Authority (SIGA), the Saskatoon Tribal Council (STC), Peace Hills Trust (PHT), Indian Gaming Regulators (IGR), Saskatchewan Indian Equity Foundation (SIEF), and Saskatchewan Indian Institute of Technologies (SIIT). In addition, there are numerous other tenants, including a medical practice, three law firms, a dry cleaner, a printer, a framing shop, a restaurant / café and catering company, a large trucking / transport company (with 80 employees), management firms, three insurance brokers, several retail stores, a computer training company, a film production company, and a travel agency. \[1\] In addition, in 2001, a Petro-Canada Gas Bar and Convenience Store (known as CreeWay Gas East) was established on the urban ATR. Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation Urban Reserve Example One of the Peter Ballantyne Cree Nation’s urban reserves (PBCN), Kistapinanihk I.R. #231, is shown in the Google Street View image below. The reserve is located within the municipal boundaries of the City of Prince Albert. \[1\] Muskeg Lake Cree Nation, Business, Muskeg Lake Property Management, available at http://www.muskeglake.com/business/muskeg-property-management/.

DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 9 In 2005, Petro-Canada partnered with the PBCN. A gas station and convenience store were built and began operations in 2007. The PBCN owns and operates the gas station and convenience store, which has become one of the busiest retail locations in the city. Benefits from Urban ATRs In 2015, Fiscal Realities completed a study for the National Aboriginal Economic Development Board on Improving Economic Success of Urban ATRs. Among the study results were the economic and fiscal benefits generated by investment on eight urban ATRs. Economic benefits included: ◼ Employment Benefit – The number of jobs generated by investment on reserve, per acre of land intended for economic development purposes. Estimate – Based on the cases examined, the study estimated 35.9 jobs, on average, per acre of land intended for economic development purposes. ◼ Spending Related Economic Benefit – Increased off reserve spending, attributable to on reserve employment, per acre of land intended for economic development purposes. Estimate – Based on the cases examined, the study estimated $283,901 annually in additional off reserve spending per acre of First Nation land used for economic development purposes. The study also looked at fiscal benefits, resulting from First Nation ATRs which included: DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 10 ◼ Tax Revenue – First Nations can choose to assert local revenue jurisdiction under the authority of the First Nations Fiscal Management Act on these lands. Based on the case studies it was estimated that annual local and property tax revenues and payments in lieu or grants in lieu of taxes generated about $11,265 annually per acre. ◼ Service agreements – Several service agreements have been negotiated between First Nations and local governments for the provision of water, sewer and other local services. Based on the average results from these negotiations, it is estimated that approximately $5600 per acre is spent on service agreements with local governments. ◼ Employment Related Fiscal Benefit – The off-reserve tax base is larger owing to off reserve residents employed on each urban ATR. Some portion of those city residents will also own property off reserve and pay property taxes to the City. Estimate – Based on the urban ATRs examined, it was estimated that investment generated about $29,042 annually in additional municipal property tax revenue per acre of First Nation land intended for economic development purposes. The table below summarizes the benefits from converting lands to First Nation jurisdiction near urban areas. These benefits have been converted from a “per acre basis” to a “per hectare basis.” Source: National Aboriginal Economic Development, 2015– Improving Economic Success of Urban ATRs DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 11 The Economic Rationale and Strategy Indigenous leaders and development economists and other academics are all asking a similar question – what is the best way to decolonize? For First Nations, the question may be more specifically about the best way to restore title and jurisdictions, but it is fundamentally about decolonization. Authors such as Hernando De Soto in the Mystery of Capital and Robinson and Acemoglu in Why Nations Fail provide an important insight into this question from developing and decolonizing countries – build an economic environment where all individuals (tribal members) can succeed. This is the goal of the First Nation strategy discussed briefly below. Twenty year ago, two separate leakage studies were conducted for a group of Secwepemc First Nations in BC 4 and Waubetek First Nations in Ontario 5 . The BC study investigated households, governments and business and Ontario study focussed on households and governments. These studies concluded: • Expenditure by Secwepemc households were made off reserve about 95% of the time • The lowest Secwepemc multiplier was 1.003 and the highest was 1.04 – this led to the term bungee economics as almost every dollar invested on reserve bounced off reserve immediately • Every dollar invested on a Secwepemc reserve generated 25₵ of taxes for other governments • Every dollar invested on a Secwepemc reserve generated much more than a dollar off reserve • It was estimated that one Secwepemc community contributed almost $750 million a year to the regional economy • The Waubetek communities had lower leakages depending on their location – highest was close to 90₵ per dollar and lowest was 70₵ per dollar 4 See Le Dressay, PhD Dissertation, Some Economic Impacts from Settling Treaties in BC, 1996 5 See Waubetek Leakage Study results of 14 Ontario First Nations, Waubetek Group of First Nations, 2001. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 12 The policy conclusion for the BC study was that if there were a capital payment resulting from a treaty that it would result in a large economic benefit for off reserve residents and fiscal benefit for other governments. It would have provided little benefit to the communities. This is because it was assumed that much of that capital would be disbursed directly to members and without tax powers other governments would recoup many times their initial tax investment. Many First Nations recognize this economic challenge and have begun to look at ways to reduce leakages. Another study conducted twenty years ago, identified why it is so hard to close the gaps between on and off reserve business presence. In 1998 a series of case studies were conducted comparing investment projects on reserve to similar ones off reserve. The results were that it took 4 to 6 times longer to complete an investment on the best First Nation lands 6 . The reasons for the higher costs of doing business were simple. Because of the Indian Act, First Nations had forgone 140 years of institutional development. They lacked the legal, fiscal, property rights and administrative framework to build business grade infrastructure and facilitate investment competitively. This result applied equally to First Nation members and non-members. Stated differently, even if an entrepreneurial First Nation member wanted to start a business, the costs of start up would likely be prohibitive. This meant fewer on reserve businesses and higher leakages. 6 See http://www.fiscalrealities.com/uploads/1/0/7/1/10716604/expanding\_commercial\_activity.pdf DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 13 This recognition has supported the First Nation led agenda to address the institutional gaps and improve the investment climate. As illustrated below there are two main elements of any investment climate and a third requirement for a sustainable economy. The first column contains the public-sector requirements for an investment climate. The third column presents the competitive (and sometimes comparative) advantages and investment opportunities for individuals (tribal members). If the public requirements in the first column are well designed, then individuals are more likely to successfully implement economic opportunities. Together these two columns represent a competitive investment climate. As is illustrated, if there is an innovation strategy it becomes a sustainable competitive investment climate. The second column in this graphic presents the First Nation strategy to address these requirements. The column represents the specific initiatives that have been implemented or those that have been proposed to establish the intuitional framework for First Nation title and tax jurisdiction. The Indigenous Land Title initiatives is intended to improve property rights. The necessary legal framework is emerging from legislative recognition and restoration of First Nation jurisdiction. Tax powers are being expanded in existing legislation and a new jurisdiction based fiscal relationship is proposed. A new First Nations infrastructure institution is being advanced to build business grade infrastructure for interested communities. Finally, the Tulo Centre of Indigenous Economics 7 is being expanded to provide training for the necessary administrative capacity. 7 The implementation and elements of this strategy is the subject of the Tulo Centre’s online text book, Building a Competitive First Nation Investment Climate, http://www.tulo.ca/textbook/ Public Sector Elements Secure Property Rights Legal Framework to Support Markets Fiscal Relationship for Revenues & Services Competitive Infrastructure & Financing Governance & Administration + + + + First Nations Institutional Strategy Proposed Indigenous Land Title Initiative Recognize & Implement Jurisdictions (91.24 path to s.35) Proposed Infrastructure Institution in the FMA Training through Tulo Centre of Indigenous Economics Comparative Advantage (at least one) Location Natural Resources Human Resources Technology Ability to Innovate Supported by Training & Research Long - Term Sustainable Rate of Return on Investment Expand FMA with New Tax Powers & Fiscal Relationship DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 14 The benefits from this strategy are significant to First Nations and other governments. A case study of a representative sample of 10 First Nations interested in implementing this framework for a better investment climate was recently completed. This case study has been extrapolated to 78 similar BC First Nations where comparable property assessment data was available, and these extrapolated results are reported below. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 15 Improving the First Nation Investment Climate – 78 British Columbia First Nations Benefits - 10 Years after Implementation Increase in Property Values $6,549,625,526 New Investment on First Nation $9,012,490,196 New Investment Induced Employment 93,874 Increase in Annual Property Tax Per Year $94,987,811 Increase in Annual Taxation for the Provision of Services Per Year $36,643,355 Increase in Annual First Nation Goods and Services Tax Per Year $148,845,918 New Annual Revenues for Canada $8,249,735,865 Increase in First Nation Infrastructure Financing $2,438,180,268 Increase in Housing Units for First Nation members 5,580 Drop in First Nation Income Assistance Beneficiaries 6,515 These results are speculative but the experience of two First Nations who have implemented many elements of this strategy is instructive. In 1996, an acre of land in the Sun Rivers Development on the Tk’emlups to Secwepemc lands cost $8000. Today that same acre would be $750,000. In 1991 an acre of land along the highway on the Westbank First Nation cost $10,000 per acre. In both cases, the First Nations used different strategies with the same objective; build a competitive investment climate based on the simple formula. In addition to dramatically increasing property values, Tkl’emlups increased quadrupled their tax revenues and Westbank revenues increased by 14 times. Westbank and Tk’emlups developments support thousands of jobs, represent over a $1.5 billion of Canada’s GDP and generate over $200 million a year in tax revenues for other governments. The First Nation Challenges to Change If the benefits from change are so large for so many parts, why hasn’t change happened more quickly? For the past forty years, First Nations, as well as various governmental actors, have sought to repeal the Indian Act and remove the Department of Indian Affairs. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 16 During this time, there have been some important legal victories recognizing First Nation rights and title and existing aboriginal and treaty rights and inherent powers were recognized in the constitution. There have been at least four major national studies, Royal Commissions or enquiries that have resulted in numerous recommendations about how to improve outcomes by implementing First Nation jurisdiction. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has been adopted and supported. Despite this progress, the Indian Act and gaps in services, infrastructure, income and social indicators remain. Some jurisdictions have been implemented but many more remain on the drawing board. Moreover, despite the recognition of aboriginal title, it has not been practically implemented. Clearly, change is hard. First Nation efforts are best summarized by Clarence Jules Sr. “you can’t fix a flat tire by yelling at it.” The first step to fix a flat tire or to advance a First Nation policy change is to identify all the barriers: 1. Both First Nations and other governments must have political will and determination to support proposed changes. 2. The land base for many First Nation communities is either inadequate, uneconomic or both. Changes are less likely to be economically sustainable until this challenge is addressed. 3. The fiscal powers (tax base) for almost all First Nations are insufficient to support expanded jurisdictions because there are insufficient tax revenues, inadequate economic bases or both. 4. The legislative and institutional framework to support First Nation jurisdictions has been stagnating because of 140 years of the Indian Act. There is a large legal and administrative gap to fill. 5. First Nations have been mainly focused on Indian Affairs service delivery so there are management capacity gaps to support restored jurisdictions. 6. Explicit recognition of First Nation title and tax jurisdiction requires a difficult to achieve constitutional amendment. The strategy to achieve implicit constitutional recognition of First Nation jurisdiction through federal and provincial legislation vacating their jurisdictions in favor of First Nations can be difficult to communicate. 7. Switching costs from the Indian Act and Indian Affairs are high for both First Nation members and administrations and other governments. These switching costs have to be reduced to facilitate and policy changes. 8. Any proposed change must deliver and maintain economic and other benefits to First Nation communities and members in the short term to be sustainable. Stated differently, although almost all First Nation support change, they are rightly impatient for better results. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 17 9. First Nations are diverse and they have the right of self-determination. In the last 23 years, all efforts to impose a non-optional legislative change on First Nations have failed. Proposed changes must be optional and not universal. Lessons from the First Nation Legislation, Taxation Institutional Strategy The following is a list of the lessons based on a number initiatives, proposals and strategies to address each of the challenges to proposed changes. The table matches lessons and strategies to challenges. Challenge Lessons and Strategies First Nation support Leadership Identify historical-cultural connections (research) Identify economic and fiscal benefits Other government and public support Align interests Demonstrate economic and fiscal benefits Inadequate land base Provide institutional support for additions to First Nation lands opportunities Inadequate fiscal base Expand institutional framework to expand tax powers Focus on tax jurisdiction not revenue sharing Restoring institutional framework Create national institutions in legislation to support and expand jurisdictions for both small and large First Nations Base institutional design on strong research and rationale Building administrative capacity Accredited practical training for First Nation administrators Utilize First Nation administrative capacity to advance initiatives Constitutional recognition Use legislation to facilitate orderly jurisdictional transfers from other governments to First Nations High switching costs Use First Nation institutions to support First Nations Use First Nation institutions to replace Indian Affairs Deliver results in short term Focus on legislating changes (First Nation and other gov’t) Improve credit rating and access to capital for communities and members Access to independent resources Universal solutions don’t work Advance First Nation led optional legislative proposals DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 18 These lessons were gleaned from two sources – experience and reading about the experience of others. The experience was gained from legislative changes to the Indian Act, the First Nations Goods and Services Tax Act (FNGST), the First Nations Fiscal Management Act (FMA), the First Nations Lands Management Act (FNLMA) and the proposed Indigenous Land Title legislation (ILTI). Experience was also gained from the successful institutional development of the First Nations Tax Commission (FNTC), the First Nations Financial Management Board (FMB), the First Nations Finance Authority (FNFA) and the Tulo Centre of Indigenous Economics (Tulo Centre) and the failed institutional development of the First Nation Statistics Institute (FNSI). Significant original and secondary research was conducted in support of historical connections, communications, policy options and institutional and legislative design. A slightly more detailed description of the lessons contained in the table is presented below. 1. Leadership – The role of First Nation leadership in advancing change cannot be overstated. It is probably the single most important element of successfully implemented First Nation policy changes. First Nation leadership is required to assemble the necessary team of experts, manage the policy issues that always arise, obtain and maintain First Nation support, advance the proposal as required as legislation and secure parliamentary support for legislation. 2. Historical and Cultural Connections – The First Nation journey is captured in the historical time lines for taxation and title. These illustrations demonstrate pre-contact jurisdictions, policy decisions to take away title and jurisdiction and the efforts to restore them 8 . This historical and cultural research is important for three reasons. First and most importantly, it reflects that the strategy is First Nation led and inspired by the work of their ancestors and elders. This has been helpful in generating support. Second it demonstrates that these are historical (inherent) jurisdictions that are being restored. This not only supports communications but also the legal and constitutional framework to restore them. Third, it creates research methods and identifies the research sources to expand the strategy to other jurisdictions 9 . 8 This approach is based the common story arc of popular Hollywood action movies. The hero has something taken from them. There is a strong antagonist they must overcome to regain what was lost. And in Hollywood there is a happy ending. For First Nations, there are several individual and institutional antagonists who either took away or prevented the restoration of First Nation jurisdictions. Communication products associated with this journey have been successful in gaining support for proposed initiatives. 9 For example, recently the Chinook work t.a.k.s.i.s was discovered which meant taxes. These taxes (taksis) were used to pay for community infrastructure and lawyers to fight for title. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 19 3. Economic and Fiscal Benefits to Members and Communities – The institutional strategy should generate economic benefits (jobs, higher income, more home wealth) to members and fiscal benefits (more tax revenues) to communities. Estimating net benefits to members and communities supports communications and generates broader political support. 4. Align interests – Leading changes to First Nation legislation and creating new institutions has often been compared to multi-dimensional chess. This is because in addition to member support it often requires aligning with the interests of other governments, industry and the public to name a few. To make it more difficult, different governments have different interests and political issues constantly shift. The First Nation strategy to align interests has included appeals to justice, improved processes and efficiencies, implementing court decisions and legislation, better relations and of course the fiscal and economic benefits to other communities discussed next. One of the more successful communication messages was that the income and employment gaps between First Nations and the rest of Canada was causing a drag on GDP and costing billions because poverty imposes higher costs on government. It was estimated that Canada was losing $27 billion a year in GDP because of First Nation poverty. Strategies to reduce that poverty benefit everyone. 5. Fiscal-Economic Benefits to Other Communities – There is a strong interdependence between First Nations and their regional economies. One of the results of the initial leakage study was that the surrounding communities receive largest fiscal and economic benefit from First Nation economic growth. A subsequent study found that the surrounding communities and governments gained almost double the fiscal benefit and economic benefits from First Nation economic development near them. As a result, at least one non-First Nation community is now actively pursuing First Nations to establish their jurisdiction near this city because of the significant economic and fiscal benefits it would generate for them. 6. Adding lands to First Nation jurisdiction – The most effective strategy to improve the First Nation land base has been to add lands to their jurisdiction near economic opportunities. Several First Nations (especially in Saskatchewan and Manitoba) are adding lands that are in or near existing cities. These First Nations are supporting residential, commercial and industrial development on these lands. As these First Nations implement tax jurisdictions they are realizing even more benefits and opportunities for their members and as mentioned previously, also for the regional economies. The institutional-legislative approach helps these First Nations implement their new jurisdictions, negotiate service agreements with local governments and build and finance the necessary infrastructure to support land development projects. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 20 7. Expand First Nation Tax Powers – The FMA has helped generate over $1 billion in tax revenues for First Nations and over $1 billion in new investment. Its success in addressing issues like tax rates, expenditures, infrastructure financing and taxpayer relations has cleared the path for proposals to expand the First Nation tax base. This has included proposals related to the FNGST, tobacco taxation and most recently taxation on cannabis. 8. Tax Jurisdiction vs Revenue Sharing – Because of court decisions recognizing First Nation title and rights to resources there have been proposals from other governments to share resource revenues with First Nations. Several First Nations are supporting a counter proposal to revenue sharing that extend First Nation tax powers off reserve into their traditional territories with the Aboriginal Resource Tax (ART). The ART is considered superior to revenue sharing because it is First Nation jurisdiction as opposed to another government. This means revenues would be more stable and secure and less impacted by other government policy changes. 9. Build National and other First Nation institutions – The FMA directly created the FNTC, FMB and FNFA and for capacity development purposes the Tulo Centre. These national institutions have helped interested First Nations implement their jurisdictions by providing samples laws, standards, policies, software systems, the First Nations Gazette and accredited training. This means both large and small First Nations can implement taxation and get access to cheaper capital. National institutions have meant that participating First Nations have an A2 credit rating, so they can finance their infrastructure at rates comparable to the government of Canada. 10. Research and Rationales – The successful First Nation legislative or institutional changes or proposals almost always proceed along the same continuum – research, policy options, business case (net benefits), legislative proposal, institutional creation (where necessary) and jurisdictional transfer and implementation. The path and time for every proposed change is unique. Some have taken months and other initiatives years. It has been important, however, to complete work on each part of the continuum as soon as possible. In this way when opportunities occur, legislation and institutions can be advanced quickly. A dedicated research facility to support the institutional agenda has been instrumental in its advancement. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 21 11. Local administrative capacity – All First Nation jurisdictions are implemented locally by local administrators. In 2008 the Tulo Centre was established to help interested First Nation local administrators implement their FMA jurisdictions. This required the development of original curriculum, courses, a text book and programs. Over 200 students from over 80 First Nations have attended Tulo Centre courses and many have graduated from one of the two (and soon to be three) programs. This training is supported by original software, sample laws and processes to administer taxation and other jurisdictions. The training and institutional framework have created a stronger First Nation tax system with few disputes and greater member and investor confidence. Improved administrative capacity and systems has also made it easier for First Nations to propose jurisdictional expansion. Perhaps most importantly it has created a cadre of First Nation administrative experts that can advance jurisdictions within their communities and protect and expand these jurisdictions with other governments. 12. Legislation restores and protects jurisdiction – Proposed changes must be codified in either federal or provincial (or both) legislation. This legislative process is important for three reasons. First, it provides an orderly process for other governments to vacate a field in favor of First Nations. This provides the legal and jurisdictional space for the First Nation government to occupy with their own laws. Second, it provides a path to recognize First Nation governments into the federation. It provides the theoretical path to constitutional protection of First Nation jurisdictions. Third, it protects and make First Nation jurisdictions more permanent and stable. Reversing the process to eliminate First Nation jurisdiction would be difficult legally and politically for other governments. 13. First Nation Institutions are the bridge – There are high switching costs moving from the Indian Act and the Department of Indian Affairs to First Nation jurisdiction. These costs are high for other governments, First Nations, members, the public and investors. First Nations institutions have reduced these switching costs by providing sample laws, systems, templates, administrative capacity support and training. As a result, they have helped to implement, protect and expand jurisdiction relatively quickly. They have also provided a means to help First Nation move away from the Indian Act and dismantle the Department of Indian Affairs. For example, a recent First Nation proposal to establish the First Nations Infrastructure Institute would effectively replace a significant section of Indian Affairs with an institution focussed on helping First Nation implement this jurisdiction. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 22 14. Maintain Momentum – This refers to three important lessons. Focus energy and political support on legislative changes because they create the permanent legal framework for implementing First Nation jurisdiction. Second, deliver quick beneficial results to communities and members. The FMA established a First Nation credit rating. This meant the interest rate on loans to First Nations dropped by over 500 basis points (5%) for most communities. The ILTI initiative could eliminate the current First Nation housing discount of 88% versus comparable properties off reserve. Third, grow and use independent revenues to advance initiatives. Tax revenues allow First Nation communities to advance their agenda, their way and on their time line. Writing proposals and raising funds from government and other parties has slowed the First Nation institutional agenda. 15. Optional – All proposed changes must respect the right of self-determination. Proposed changes must be presented as option so that communities can choose when and if they wish to use them. It also gives communities time to go through their own processes to obtain support for changes. All the successful legislative and institutional strategies have been optional in nature. This means that the legislative and institutional framework only applies with a community’s formal consent. Any proposed change that was to apply universally to all communities has been politically rejected by First Nations. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 23 A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE WIGRAM SKIES RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE MUSKEG LAKE CREE NATION DEVELOPMENT i The Wigram Skies development is a Ngāi Tahu residential and commercial property project that may be compared and contrasted with the MLCN urban reserve development. This comparison is intended to provide insight into the differences between the two and how lessons learned from the latter could be applied by Ngāi Tahu. The processes applied in the development of each of each is outlined in the diagrams below: There are some stark differences between the two processes. Although the Wigram Skies development generated a significant economic income to Ngāi Tahu it did not gain as much economic benefit as the Cree approach both because it only focused on one element of the development value chain and because of the institutional restrictions only generated a limited duration income. Analysis shows that Ngāi Tahu obtained roughly 20% of the total economic benefits from the Wigram Skies residential development, but did not see the same ‘wraparound’ income that the MLCN development has been able to realize. Designate as Reserve (Ability to Tax and Regulate Secured) Establish Municipal Services Agreement (e.g. water, sewerage) Undertake Key Infrastructure Development Using MCLN Workers Lease to MLCN to Undertake Property Development Purchase Federal Land Encourage Development and Investment from Outside Reserve Collect Ongoing Tax Revenue, Lease Income, Capital Gains etc., Property Development Planning Undertaken by Ngāi Tahu Property Land Sold to Construction Companies for Housing Some Land Retained for Commercial Leasing Infrastructure Development Contracted Outside of Tribe Purchase Crown Land Portion of Profit Distributed to Beneficiaries Ongoing Revenue from Commercial Leasing MLCN WIGRAM DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 24 This is demonstrated in the following graph, which shows that the primary economic benefit from the development went to – in descending profit order – building material manufacturers and retailers, construction firm labour, the Crown tax revenue, homeowners, construction firm profits, council and legal services, and machine operators. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 25 This raises the question regarding how more of these economic benefits could have been captured by Ngāi Tahu through a variety of measures. For example, in regards to direct employment some of the $170 million spent on construction labour could been capture. Ngāi Tahu is in a position where measures could be developed for ensuring that at least some of the jobs generated by the development were explicitly targeted toward employing Ngāi Tahu and Māori. The graph below shows the number of jobs created by the development. In addition, the Wigram Residential development generated, and continues to generate significant tax and rates revenue for local and central government. This is illustrated in the graph below: DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 26 Applying MLCN lessons: The Ngāi Tahu scenario While the following is hypothetical it is insightful to try to apply the MLCN lessons to the Ngāi Tahu context. The overarching process could follow these steps: 1. Ngāi Tahu negotiate with the Crown on the creation of a new form of customary title. 2. Purchase land and convert it to this new customary title, turning it into a semi- autonomous zone akin to a reserve with title and tax jurisdiction. 3. Negotiate with surrounding jurisdictional body regarding service provision. 4. Decide what form of title land within a development will take. 5. Ensure Ngāi Tahu are engaged in the building process. 6. Make sure Ngāi Tahu are involved in the commercial district. 7. Help Ngāi Tahu members purchase housing. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 27 In this Ngai Tahu scenario the most obvious route through which a semi-autonomous zone could be created would be to return the land to Native title, or changes to land title under the Ahu Whenua Māori Act. Obviously, any contemporary arrangement would need to be fully recognized by the settler state with a title and relevant legislation that delineated the rights and responsibilities accorded to that title. Similar barriers to those faced by First Nations – third party interests on the lands, institutional differences, liability considerations and service agreements with the previous tax authority – would need to be overcome but these are not insurmountable and may actually be easier to negotiate in a unitary regime once the initial resistance has been. Gaining government and public support for this would be difficult, given the history of New Zealand explained in the background section of this paper, however the strong success of the Treaty settlement process and the new government’s impending tax review suggest that the time may be right. Furthermore the institutional capacity of TRoNT and the relationship developed with the Crown during negotiations and subsequent dealings suggest that there would be less friction and more common ground between parties. There would certainly still remain many issues, particularly regarding liability considerations and service agreements, but these are all negotiable issues that have clear domestic and international precedents that would help guide deliberation. With regard to service provision there would need to be clear legislation ensuring that the three main dangers – cost shifting, raising the bar and regulatory creep – to local governments do not impact Ngai Tahu. Success would see Ngai Tahu turning a defined area of land into a form of customary title that enabled both internal land title and tax jurisdiction, achieving a degree of mana motuhake. This offers Ngai Tahu the opportunity to decide what form of title they will create within this semi-autonomous zone. One possibility is that TRoNT create fee simple titles that are sold on the open market just as any other land in New Zealand is traded. However, while Ngai Tahu would still retain the de jure right no matter who bought the land this option also has the greatest potential for increasing loss of de facto authority as in the worst case a single non-Ngai Tahu buyer could eventually purchase all the land. A second option would retain ownership of the land and offer long-term leasehold tenure for sites, where leaseholders own any improvements made. A third option would be for Ngai Tahu to create a new form of property title that blended collective and individual ownership and usage rights in a manner that had a cultural match with pre-contact forms but was also practical in the contemporary context. An example of this could be fee simple residential land with covenants controlling ownership and usage, while commercial areas may be offered as leasehold to Ngāi Tahu owned and run businesses. A key part of gaining taxation authority would be the provision of other core services such as sewage and water and as noted above the ability to develop some form of internal policing is not out of the question - examples already exist in the case of Māori wardens and the marae-based youth courts. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 28 With regard to taxation it seems uncontentious that Ngai Tahu would be able to gain the capacity to charge rates. There are already provisions for this to occur within the Resource Management Act 1991. Across NZ local governments in 2016, 10% of total revenue was spent on roading, 6% on water supply, 8% on waste water, 5% on refuse. The other 69% of expenditure is not directly relevant to basic service provision. Although much of this expenditure is targeted toward meeting central government demands in regard to planning, consultation, permitting, and consenting, increased control of these processes would permit developments that would align with Ngāi Tahu cultural interests. Furthermore, other current council investments into arts, recreation, and parks could be invested into Ngāi Tahu centric approaches to these areas. Additionally, semi-autonomous zones could be designated as an eco-developments and built to be largely hermetic with regard to various services. By building an ‘off-the-grid’ development that had environmentally sustainable water, sewage and power capacity, Ngai Tahu could avoid simply paying the surrounding jurisdictional body to connect with their services whilst also embodying the core value of kaitiakitanga. This would enable a premium rates charge that would cover the provision of services. There is also the chance that they could capture some of the GST take. Currently businesses exporting goods and services from New Zealand are entitled to "zero-rate" their products, meaning that effectively, they charge GST at 0%. The semi-autonomous zone could be legislated as an export with regard to goods and services, with Ngai Tahu able to collect GST on any goods or services provided within their zone. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 29 The next aspect of this scenario involves the actual development of the semi- autonomous zone, providing one of the key mechanisms of preventing leakage. While Ngai Tahu would not be able to provide all the tradespeople required to build the necessary infrastructure and housing they could ensure that as many of the firms working on the construction had some form of affiliation. The ideal outcome would be that all the firms involved were both owned and staffed by Ngai Tahu members so that the wider community were involved in preventing leakage but while this may not be possible in the short term ways of reducing leakage are available. There are several options available, which could be used in conjunction. The simplest would be for TRoNT to use building companies owned and/or staffed by Ngai Tahu members as determined through the already operating Te Pou Here tool, though this is an ad hoc solution that requires a relatively high amount of insight and oversight. Another option would be for Ngai Tahu Property to purchase existing firms, or at least a stake in them, who they could then use for the development. This option not only insures that the profit from the construction goes back to the tribe but also provides the ability for Ngai Tahu to employ tribe members. Ngai Tahu already have the He Toki trade training scheme developed in conjunction with Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology and this could provide a pool of future employees. Currently TRoNT is partnered with building industry leaders to provide work experience for the graduates but if they owned their own firms then the multiplier effect would benefit both the NTHC and wider tribal members. While TRoNT see the current situation as creating “a talent pipeline for Māori”, ensuring they become employed within Ngai Tahu businesses would go beyond a ‘talent pipeline’, providing a ‘fiscal pipeline’ to prevent ‘bungee economics’. The next aspect of this scenario would see Ngai Tahu set up a number of commercial businesses and/or encourage Ngai Tahu owned business into the semi-autonomous zone, helping to further reduce leakage. The best option would probably involve a mixture of direct ownership by TRoNT along with encouraging tribal members to open their own businesses. To encourage businesses to move out to the semi-autonomous zone Ngai Tahu could use its control over title and taxation to provide an array of inducements, particularly if it was able to gain GST control. The most obvious types of business would be those necessary to the zone’s ongoing operations, including a supermarket, medical centre, gym, restaurants, appliance store, hairdressers, etc. The Wigram Skies development currently has many of these businesses operating from its commercial sector yet Ngai Tahu receives no ongoing income from them, aside from lease income. The various businesses could serve as work experience for tribal members who have gone through Ngāi Tahu affiliated training schemes. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 30 The final step of this scenario would be Ngāi Tahu helping members to purchase properties within the development. There are a number of mechanisms available to them that could be utilized. First, home ownership could be encouraged through the existing Whai Rawa scheme. The inducement could be that those who are able to save their deposit within the scheme get an extra discount on the home and/or land package. A second alternative, one that could also work in conjunction with the first, is that Ngāi Tahu expand the Whai Rawa scheme to provide mortgages for tribal members at lower rates than the banks. Finally, Ngāi Tahu could act as a collective guarantor for tribal members wanting a mortgage. With the first two options, the tribe would see the multiplier effect at its optimal as not only would the individual members secure the capital gains from their own properties but the tribe would be able to retain the interest on the mortgages. DRAFT PAPER April 30, 2018 P a g e | 31 CONCLUSIONS i The data provide on the Wigram Skies development in this paper only includes the residential component of the development, not the commercial districts. The commercial components were excluded due to data access problems The scale of the Wigram Skies development was determined from data provided on the http://wigramskies.co.nz website. The value of the Wigram Skies residential development was determined using Quotable Value valuations as of August 30, 2016 using a randomized sample of 150 properties with a sampling accuracy of between + or – 10%. The breakdown of economic activity within the Wigram Skies residential development was calculated using industry averages obtained from the Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ). The employment generated by the development was calculated using BRANZ and PayScale data. The tax generated from the development was calculated using IRD NZ calculators. The rates generated from the development were calculated using the Christchurch City Council rates calculator. Inflation rates (the CPI) were determined using the Reserve Bank of New Zealand inflation calculator. Home value inflation was calculated using the QV calculator.

Poverty Action Waikato has a vision of flourishing communities, valuing hauora, social justice, equity, and diversity. Our mission is to be bold and courageous in pursuit of our vision. In our mission we will engage with Te Tiriti O Waitangi and follow tikanga. We will also, challenge neoliberalism, connect with individuals and communities, research and inform through stories and statistics, discuss and debate, advocate with community to decision makers and each other, encourage and support participatory democracy, model inclusive language and we will support one another respecting our unity and diversity. Poverty Action Waikato functions as an open and inclusive working group, comprised of a diverse range of committed individuals who share PAW’s vision and mission. Poverty Action Waikato supports a more progressive tax system, and supports a tax and transfer system that reduces inequality to pre-1980 levels. New Zealand has one of the lowest top personal tax rates and we believe that this should be increased. We support the government introducing a tax-free threshold at the bottom of the income tax scale first and then reduce and simplify rates in the middle bands of the tax scale. We want to ensure that beneficiaries receive the benefits of the proposed changes by passing tax cuts on to those on benefits and adjusting benefit abatement rates. Poverty Action Waikato supports a comprehensive capital gains tax on inflation adjusted capital gains at the time the capital gains are realised. We ask that the family home be exempt from capital gains tax. We support Oxfam New Zealand’s call for the government to crack down on tax avoidance. Poverty Action Waikato supports the tobin tax. We ask that the government joins the group of countries working to agree on a tax on international currency movements, to set up a fund to provide capital for poor countries to improve their social and Error!

This would discourage currency speculation without being high enough to impede genuine trade. Poverty Action Waikato supports the government to implement a suite of measures – developed in cooperation with other OECD countries – that will further strengthen the rules for taxing income from investment in NZ. Poverty Action notes that the policies recommended by the Productivity Commission to mitigate Climate Change could increase the costs of household energy, food and transport. Poverty Action supports the Commission’s recommendation to reduce the adverse impact of such increases on the real incomes of vulnerable households through the tax and welfare system. We also support the Commissions’ recommendation for the government to monitor energy, food and transport price trends to ensure that the benefits and tax credits adjustments are being appropriately adjusted over time. Thank you for the opportunity to call for a tax system that we believe will reduce poverty and achieve greater equality in Aotearoa New Zealand. Ngaa mihi, Poverty Action Waikato

Recommendations 1.1. Property Council New Zealand (“Property Council”) supports the intention of the Tax Working Group to review our current tax regime. We wish to thank the Tax Working Group for the opportunity to submit on the discussion questions. 1.2. We understand the complicated task of meeting all the needs of a good tax system. To assist your consideration of the system, Property Council’s key comments and suggestions are: a. We support the ‘broad-based, low-rate’ approach recognising that all economic activities are broadly taxed on a similar basis; b. Commercial and residential property are different. The tax system should recognise commercial property as a business asset and it should be treated as such; c. Reinstating depreciation on commercial property. By not recognising that commercial building structures become obsolete and depreciate, our current tax law is acting as a disincentive to continuous improvement of New Zealand’s building stock, particularly in relation to seismic performance; d. We conditionally support a capital gains tax if it were to account for capital losses and allowed for depreciation of commercial property; e. We strongly support the current PIE taxation regime and recommend that the findings of the Savings Working Group 2010 in relation to the PIE tax rates be considered; f. We do not support other transactional taxes as they are inefficient and insufficient funds are likely to be collected to make them viable; and g. Land taxes could be a blunt instrument likely to have many negative unintended consequences, including a significant drop in property values. If the Working Group were to consider other taxes targeted at property, such as value capture taxes to fund infrastructure, Property Council would like to discuss how those taxes could be made to work with minimal perverse consequences. 2. Introduction 2.1. Property Council is a member-led, not-for-profit organisation offering a collective voice for the commercial property industry. The property industry is currently the largest industry in New Zealand with a direct contribution to GDP of $29.8 billion or 13%. In a sense the property sector is a foundation of New Zealand’s economy and caters for growth by developing, building and owning the buildings that house businesses. \[1\] 2.2. Our membership is broad and includes some of the largest commercial property holders in New Zealand, including several significant NZX listed companies. These companies own commercial property providing reliable rental income return on savings invested by retirees through Kiwisaver and other superannuation funds. Our members include companies that undertake a range of large-scale residential and commercial development projects, including large commercial buildings, industrial parks, and retail precincts. 2.3. Property Council suggests that any changes to the taxation of such an important economic sector should be carefully considered. 2.4. Our views on the tax system are set out below. We have also attached more detailed analysis in support of our submission (Attachment A: Property Council TWG Detailed Analysis Submission – April 2018). 3. Overall Design of the Tax System 3.1. Property Council supports the ‘broad-based, low-rate’ approach being that all economic activities are broadly taxed on a similar basis. We also note that our broad-based approach is simple and particularly attractive to offshore investors. 3.2. By its nature the commercial property sector is extremely capital intensive, with developments and buildings worth billions of dollars. Overseas investment is an important source of capital given the limitations of New Zealand's small capital market. Our simple tax system can be attractive to this overseas investment and we would be reluctant to see this change. 4. Differentiating Commercial Property 4.1. Commercial and residential property are different, both as property and why investors typically invest in property. Commercial property squarely fits in the physical capital sphere of the productive economy. It is designed to meet the needs of the businesses and industries it accommodates. Property Council recommends that the Tax Working Group differentiates commercial and residential property in its considerations. 4.2. Commercial property investors typically invest to secure a rental or income return. A large proportion of the capital invested in commercial property comes from retirees (Kiwisaver and superannuation funds) investing savings to produce regular income to support their retirement. Commercial property investors provide the infrastructure of business and, in exchange for that accommodation, those businesses pay rent which provides the desired income return that investors are seeking and upon which income tax is paid. 4.3. However, some investors in residential property may do so for the purposes of capital gain in a market. This can come about through demand exceeding supply for housing or house prices steadily increasing over time. Investing in residential property for rental or income return often makes little sense because rental returns on residential property are typically very low as a percentage of the property’s value. After the costs of ownership, the net income return can be even lower. Investors in residential property are motivated by the historical significant capital gains that can be available, which often has no tax paid. 4.4. Property Council recommends that the Tax Working Group also differentiates between residential and commercial property investment. Commercial property investment provides the infrastructure of business and services that the savings industry uses to produce rental returns (upon which income tax is paid). However, investment in residential property is often undertaken for the purposes of seeking capital gain, upon which historically little or no tax has been paid. 5. Depreciation 5.1. As the Tax Working Group will be aware the previous government removed the ability to depreciate commercial property. Property Council believes the decision conflated residential and commercial property as a single asset type and did not recognise the different economic roles they play. Property Council does not believe that it was a principled tax decision because depreciation of business assets used to generate taxable income is a cost of doing business. We believe it is illogical for one business asset to be treated very differently from other business assets. The decision made New Zealand one of only a handful of countries in the world that does not allow depreciation of commercial property. 5.2. Commercial building structures, like machinery and durable consumer goods, become obsolete over time and need replacing or upgrading. Building structures, including their services and fitouts all become obsolete over time. Obsolescence of commercial buildings occurs as business needs, tenant expectations, standards (building and environmental) and technology changes over time. 5.3. An obvious demonstration of this obsolescence was the failure of many building structures during the 2011 Canterbury and 2016 Kaikoura earthquakes. 5.4. Further, r esearch following the Canterbury earthquakes has shown that a yellow sticker on an at-risk building can lead to a significant devaluation instantly of up to 50 per cent of its original value, “First, buildings that have been declared earthquake-prone prior to the time of sale experience a statistically significant reduction in sale price following the Christchurch earthquakes. Second, this effect was more pronounced in the CBD than in suburban areas”. 1 . Yet the tax system disincentivises building owners from earthquake strengthening their buildings. A perverse outcome of the current tax system is that if a building falls down in an earthquake the loss is tax deductible but work to strengthen a building is not. 5.5. Tenants, including central government tenants, expectations around existing buildings have also changed since the earthquakes. They now expect buildings to meet seismic resilience standards equivalent to 80 per cent of the New Building Standard (NBS) or greater, which is significantly above the minimum requirement of the Building Act of 34 per cent NBS. Tenants will not lease space in commercial buildings which are not considered safe or seismically resilient. Obsolete building structures do not meet this requirement. 5.6. Commercial building structures also become obsolete as business needs and tenant expectations around what they need from their commercial space change. Such changes include, desire for modern services, better inter-tenancy connectivity, better building energy and other environmental performance, and general functionality. It is common for buildings that were considered ‘prime’ when built to slowly descend the building quality matrix to ‘A’ grade, then ‘B’ grade etc. As this happens, the building's rental income and building value typically declines, when absent of any further capital improvements. 5.7. By not recognising that commercial building structures become obsolete and depreciate, current tax law is acting as a disincentive to continuous improvement of New Zealand’s building stock. This has hindered building owners undertaking building upgrades and seismic 1 Timar, L., Grimes A., and Fabling R., Motu Working Paper, Before a Fall: Impacts of Earthquake Regulation and Building Codes on the Commercial Building Market, October 2015, pg 12. strengthening. This represents an economic cost in unrealised productivity increases and environmental gains that could be gained from the building stock 5.8. However, when the previous Government removed depreciation on commercial building structures it said it was open to reconsidering if evidence showed that commercial buildings did depreciate. There is ample evidence from around the world and New Zealand, including research by KPMG and the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER), which shows that non-residential buildings do depreciate (Attachments B and C: KPMG - Tax Depreciation - Non-residential buildings (8 February 2010) and NZIER report (8 Feb 2010)). 5.9. Property Council recommends that the Tax Working Group recommend reinstatement of depreciation on commercial property structure. This would recognise the contribution the commercial property sector plays in the productive economy, remove current disincentives to earthquake strengthening created by current tax law and promote safe and sustainable buildings. 6. Capital Gains 6.1. For a capital gains tax to work effectively in practice it needs to be universal. We note one of the key overriding drivers out of scope for the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference is that the family home is not to be considered. Given the complexity of designing a capital gains tax with all its intricacies, including carve-outs, Property Council doubts the benefits would outweigh the administrative and economic costs. 6.2. Property Council notes that significant consideration is being given in the Tax Working Group’s work to a potential capital gains tax. Property Council could conditionally support a capital gains tax if the tax system were to account for capital losses (and expenditure on capital upgrades) and allowed for depreciation of commercial property. 6.3. On balance if a capital gains tax were to be implemented we suggest it be triggered when a property is sold, with appropriate roll-over provisions. This would be the easiest to implement and would avoid adjustments required if estimates of unrealised gains are made. Property Council would also not like to see capital losses ring-fenced as it could disincentivise capital shifting from one asset class to another. 7. PIE Regime 7.1. Property Council is a strong supporter of the PIE taxation regime. This regime has helped collectivise commercial and industrial property investment to operate on a level tax playing field with other types of investment. 7.2. We also support the findings of the Savings Working Group 2010 in relation to the PIE tax rates recommending that the top PIE rate should be maintained at a minimum of five percentage points below the top personal marginal rate, and preferably 10 per cent points below. 7.3. Property Council also suggests that our current PIE regime approximates a “Exempt-Exempt- Tax” or a “Tax-tax-Exempt” models for taxing savings of other countries which helps keep New Zealand competitive and attractive to overseas investment. 8. Stamp Duties and Similar Taxes 8.1. Property Council notes that the Tax Working Group has asked questions considering other taxes such as stamp, cheque, gift and estate duties, and land tax. We note, due to it being an inheritance tax, estate duties are unlikely to be considered. 8.2. Stamp and cheque duties, being transactional taxes, have high efficiency costs although are unlikely to raise sufficient revenue to justify their administration if owner-occupier housing is excluded. We note New Zealand previously had these taxes and repealed due to insufficient funds collected and suggest nothing has changed currently to make them viable. 9. Land Tax, Rates, Value Capture Tax and Housing Affordability 9.1. Land taxes although believed by economists to be a leveller in any tax system, because taxing land is more efficient compared to taxing other things. Property Council believes this is not the case. 2010 IRD analysis suggested a land tax could potentially lead to a decrease in property values by up to 20 per cent. 9.2. Any land tax would need to interact with the local government rating system. Rates are a tax on real estate property used to fund local government services (in lieu of using general taxation). They are a significant portion of a council’s operating revenue. Introduction of a central government land tax could negatively impact that important stream of local government funding. 9.3. Land taxes could be used to counter land-banking to address one of the causes of housing affordability. However, a national land tax that applies to all land would be a blunt instrument likely to have many negative unintended consequences. Other more targeted instruments could better achieve that outcome. 9.4. We note that one such option, value capture taxes, is not discussed in the discussion document. Value capture is one way to fund infrastructure that enables both residential and commercial development. Value capture could be considered a form of a capital gains tax that allows the government to recoup value from the decisions (eg zoning) or investments (such as provision of infrastructure) that have driven, at least in part, capital appreciation of land. Value capture taxes can be complicated to design and risk unintended consequences. 9.5. If the Tax Working Group proposes changes to how property is taxed Property Council would like the Tax Working Group to provide more detailed analysis of all the taxes faced by property, including rates, and consult further on the design of any proposed changes (eg value capture) that will affect property. Our members are happy to work with the Tax Working Group to assist with this analysis. 10. Conclusion 10.1. Property Council thanks the Tax Working Group for the opportunity to submit on the discussion questions. We would also like to speak to our submission and ask that the Tax Working Group consider an oral submission. 10.2. We also wish to note our support for the BusinessNZ submission. 10.3. Any further queries do not hesitate to contact Jane Budge, Senior Advocacy Advisor, email: Yours sincerely, C onnal Townsend Chief Executive \[1\] \[1\]

Page 1 of 6 Submission to the Tax Working Group 27 April, 2018 The Property Institute of New Zealand (PINZ) welcomes the opportunity to provide a submission to the Tax Working Group. The Institute is a not-for-profit member-based organisation, representing more than 2,000 valuers, property managers, consultants, advisors and a range of other property professionals, with members throughout New Zealand and the world. PINZ is a leading contributor to public debate on the property market, drawing on specialist industry sourced data, publicly available data, and member input. Executive Summary The Property Institute of New Zealand is opposed to new property-related taxes, including land taxes, stamp duty, ring fencing losses, and a more comprehensive Capital Gains Tax. In general, PINZ does not support the claim that further taxes will make housing more affordable, nor does it subscribe to the view that new taxes will make houses more available. In fact, the Institute is of the view, that we are already seeing significant flight from the market of responsible property investors, which is leading to a new rental crisis, with fewer houses available and rising rents. The Institute is of the view that rather than forcing responsible landlords to exit the property market, they should be encouraged to expand their activity, build more new homes, and therefore increase supply. What is clear in 2018, is that the recent house price boom is over, and today we are seeing a flat/muted market, so much so, that the Reserve Bank and trading banks have been reviewing their macro-prudential and lending policies in order to stimulate market activity. There are no longer the same sorts of pressures for policy makers to place additional handbrakes on the market, and as we are witnessing, a cyclical slowing in house price inflation is now well underway. Recent figures are also showing promising growth in first home buyer activity. Further, other measures by the Government are already being introduced, such as the Overseas Investment Amendment Bill 2017, which are sending clear signals to foreign investors who may have previously looked to New Zealand property for a return. \[1\] Page 2 of 6 In summary, it is the Institute view that further Government intervention in the property market through taxation at this time is unnecessary and will, in all likelihood, further damage an already finely balanced rental market. Capital Gains Tax It is clear from the directions given to the 2017 Tax Working Group and policy statements made by the current Government that some form of Capital Gains Tax extension is likely to be one of the recommendations. The Property Institute opposes this. A CGT is administratively complex, does not generate large revenue, will not reduce house prices or increase supply, will deter investment from productive enterprises, will exacerbate the rental crisis, and will almost certainly lead to significant other unintended consequences. Further, a Capital Gains Tax is not just about housing, it will also deter many other forms of capital investment, including investment in productive businesses such as farms and other enterprises which generate jobs and growth. There is a great deal of public uncertainty about what other forms of capital may be subject to a CGT – with suggestions of exemptions for some things and not others. It is usually in this area that gross distortions can occur. Reviews The possible introduction of a comprehensive capital gains tax has been reviewed extensively in New Zealand dating back 50 years. There are many examples, including: • The 1967 Ross Committee which recommended a moderate CGT, but noted its potential for discouraging savings, risk-taking and investment for growth. • The 1982 McCaw Committee recommended against a CGT stressing the substantial complexity of the tax for little revenue. • The 1987 Brash Committee Report was ambivalent citing “ real, theoretical, practical and political difficulties.” • The 1988 Royal Commission on Social Policy favoured a CGT on equity grounds and for social purposes • The 1988 Valabh Committee was in favour of a CGT but inside the narrow context of international tax reform • The 1988 Planning Council Report concluded it would be difficult to design a CGT that did not channel resources away from income producing activities. • The 2001 Tax Review Commissioned by Finance Minister Michael Cullen who said: “The thinking is that it would increase the complexity and cost of the tax system. The government agrees with this analysis.” Page 3 of 6 • The 2009 Tax Working Group Review led by Professor Bob Buckle who warned exempting the family home could lead to the "mansion effect", through overinvestment in a primary house. The research papers and reports on the practical effect of a CGT in New Zealand are too numerous to list in full, but they often share common conclusions, particularly if the family home and other personal assets are subject to exemptions. Perhaps most worrying is the almost universal observation that a Capital Gains Tax channels resources & investment away from productive enterprises through share ownership and entrepreneurial endeavour. Does CGT arrest house price rises? No. Countries (including those in the OECD often cited by CGT supporters) where a CGT is in place have experienced the same cyclical spikes in property prices that New Zealand has recently experienced. Furthermore, New Zealand is already implementing a strengthened test for investment property (the bright line test), proposing to ring-fence losses, ban letting fees, and enforce new healthy homes standards, which PINZ believes should be allowed to properly bed in before further changes are contemplated. How much revenue does CGT generate? Not much. Economic forecasting conducted by BERL on Labour’s 2011 15% CGT policy (which did not feature inflation indexation) suggested it would raise $78 million in the first year, rising to $2.27 billion by year 10. That estimate was made in a rising market, not a flat one as we have now. And, the whole proposition becomes even less attractive when/if people start realising capital losses in significant numbers. Also, in the Institute’s view, the absence of inflation indexation would be a significant issue, and its inclusion should be part of any CGT proposal – otherwise those targeted by a CGT will be forced to pay extra taxes on simple cost of living increases. Practical considerations • Impact on residential rents: Even in its own 2011 Capital Gains Tax policy, Labour admitted the impact of a CGT on rents was “unclear”. Logic suggests however, that if such a policy were ever successfully implemented, it would further discourage the buying and selling of homes (including new ones) for rental/investment purposes. Rents are already on the way up according to numerous reports, including from TradeMe and the Property Institute/Valocity’s own statistics , which warn of a ‘perfect storm’ looming for those seeking rentals. • Retail/Commercial/Industrial: Of course, rental increases are not confined to the residential market either. Retail, Industrial, and Commercial property value gains would all be targeted with the addition of a CGT - and that too will be an extra cost on business as it is passed on. That has the potential to further slow employment and economic growth. At a time when our retailers (in particular) are facing huge Page 4 of 6 competition from online providers without bricks and mortar infrastructure (often based overseas), the Institute does not see this as a useful addition to the tax toolbox. • Farms & Horticulture: Farms & the animals upon them would undoubtedly be subject to some form of CGT even if the primary residence is excluded. This would be a new tax on farmers/horticulturalists and their families who often rely on capital gains to fund retirements/diversification/security. • Inheritance tax by another name: Previous CGT proposals suggest “the asset will automatically be rolled over to the new heir. But if you decide to sell the asset, CGT will apply to the gain made since valuation day.” Any consideration of this policy proposal needs to be measured against the promise of no new inheritance taxes, as laid out in the Tax Working Group mandate. • Exemptions: This is where Capital Gains Taxes generally become unwieldy, complex and subject to avoidance & legal challenge. The more exemptions that are added, the more susceptible the system is to manipulation. While the Institute does not support a CGT, international experience suggests the most effective implementation includes ALL classes of asset including a family home. Valuation Day Of particular interest to the Property Institute and its members is the method of valuation deployed during implementation, administration, and dispute processes of any CGT. The Property Institute membership includes the New Zealand Institute of Valuers (a legislated and approved professional body) and the only structured Plant, Machinery and Infrastructure Valuation professional community in New Zealand. In its 2011 paper, Labour suggests: ‘the implementation and operation of a valuation day system, including issues such as pragmatic valuation methods for assets not easily valued. The final approach adopted will need to be practical and flexible, such as the South African approach where taxpayers were provided with a choice of methods for valuations, some of which were relatively simple proxies for full market valuation’. The Institute views this as an area of significant concern and administrative uncertainty. Indeed, there are many ‘simple proxies’ for ‘full market valuation’, but research shows wild fluctuations between the values offered by ‘simple proxies’ and a proper valuation by a registered property professional. These can vary between a vast overestimate of the value, and significant underestimates by the ‘simple proxies’, which may not require the same full disclosure and/or an in-person inspection like Registered Valuers. Council and Government Valuations usually done via algorithms and sales history statistics are notoriously unreliable, as are the other online calculations. Page 5 of 6 And the public also distrust these other ‘simple proxy’ means of valuation. A recent poll by the Property Institute focused on, ‘who people trust for an accurate market valuation’. The result was clear. People least trust online appraisals (3%), only 7% believe Government or council valuations, only one in five trust their real estate agent, yet an overwhelming 62% of people trust a registered valuer to give them an accurate estimate of a property’s market valuation. Predictably, errors in calculations on Valuation Day will inevitably lead to dispute in the event of an asset’s sale/realisation. For example: Is Inland Revenue going to accept online valuations as a true and accurate reflection of an asset’s value on V-Day, or will they seek independent assessment/review? What form should the valuation take? Our best guess is that in cases of dispute, Inland Revenue and/or the asset owner will seek a review and/or closer examination from independent third parties. The Institute argues those should be respected property professionals, with rules, ethics and standards, disputes processes and a comprehensive Continuing Professional Development programme. Those would be our members, and while this may generate significant new business for our professional membership, it will certainly add complexity to the enforcement and administrative overheads of both the Crown and the individuals concerned. While the Institute sees some benefit in accurate market valuations of all assets held in New Zealand, the overall complexity is one of the reasons why, on balance, the Institute opposes the application of a Capital Gains Tax, despite the added workflows that some of our members may realise both in the short, and long term. Conclusion Like many popular OECD countries, the New Zealand property market has been through a period of rapid house price inflation. However, measures including the Reserve Bank’s macro-prudential tools, trading bank capitalisation rules, bans on foreign capital and other measures have already had a considerable dampening effect on the housing market. The Institute is of the view that further taxes targeting property investors and developers will lead to a further slowing of housing supply, and with a large state house building programme in the wings, there is also a considerable risk that the private sector will be crowded out. The Institute believes we need a good balance of private and public housing, but one should not be at the expense of the other. New Zealand has a housing supply problem, and putting up new barriers will only exacerbate that situation. Page 6 of 6 But for the Institute the opposition to the Capital Gains Tax and Land Tax runs deeper than just housing. New Zealand is a nation of risk takers, where it is already hard to source capital for business start-ups – new taxes on Capital Gains will only make it even harder for entrepreneurs to source the private investment they need for start-ups and expansion. A CGT is complex and cumbersome to administer, it does not generate significant revenue and it runs the risk of further slowing growth at a time when our OECD counterparts are ramping up economic growth. For these reasons the Property Institute of New Zealand would prefer to maintain the status quo with property taxes. They have served the country well in recent tough times. The Institute believes the raft of other changes made to the property market need time to bed in. PINZ would be more than happy to answer any questions the Tax Working Group may have, and/or appear in-person during any public hearing process.

We support the TWG’s review of New Zealand’s current tax system and we recognise the importance of regularly reviewing the appropriateness of the current tax settings to ensure they still provide the right outcomes for New Zealand. Given the high rate of social, technological, and environmental change, it is important to challenge the tax system to ensure it still aligns with New Zealand’s objectives and operates efficiently. We also support the TWG’s engagement with wider New Zealand in its review. This ensures diversity of thought as well as educating the public about New Zealand’s tax system and the need to consider change. Increasing the conversation about the tax system is important as changes in the use of labour and technology will invariably require a more flexible and adaptable tax system than has perhaps been necessary in the past. The ‘Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper’ (page 16) recognises that the primary objective of a tax system is to provide revenue to fund public goods and services as well as redistribution. While the use of the tax system may also address other objectives, such as specific social and societal priorities, we emphasise the importance of not losing sight of the overwhelming primary purpose of the tax system to fund public services that are vital to all New Zealanders e.g. healthcare, infrastructure, and education. The current New Zealand tax system raises revenue of c.32% of GDP. While we welcome positive change to the current tax settings, we caution that any change should be considered in a cohesive manner. New Zealand’s tax system needs to continue to deliver day after day so that it provides the level of revenue required for the Government to continue to fund its objectives. Ideally, the tax system should be one that is easy to implement and simple to interact with. Therefore, it is preferable that any additional complexity arising from changes should be minimised to ensure the system continues to operate effectively and efficiently on a day-to-day basis. In addition to the points raised above, we outline below our comments on other key issues raised in the Submissions Background Paper, as well as specific discussions on capital gains tax (CGT), goods and services tax (GST), and the role of the tax system in incentivising savings. \[1\] Tax Working Group Secretariat 30 April 2018 PwC2 3616586\_5 Qualities of a good tax system The Submissions Background Paper recognises the more traditional and established frameworks used previously in the design of our tax system. This includes assessment on the following qualities: efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and administration costs, and coherence. In addition to these qualities, the Submissions Background Paper also outlines the TWG’s use of The Treasury’s Living Standards framework as an additional mechanism to assess the impact any recommendations could have on the wider well-being of New Zealanders. We welcome the use of the Living Standards framework to assess the potential impact of changes. The Living Standards framework considers the potential impact in a more comprehensive manner than simply using traditional criteria. The use of the four capital stocks (financial and physical; human; social; natural capitals) will provide a broader picture of the potential impact and assist in highlighting the intergenerational impact of any changes immediately and in the future. We consider the overlay of intergenerational thinking to be an important perspective when considering fairness in the tax system. WhilewewelcometheuseoftheLivingStandardsFramework,wealsosupportthecontinueduseof the traditional criteria to assess changes. The use of both frameworks is helpful to provide multiple layers of thinking in which to assess proposed recommendations. Fairness of the tax system ThefairnessofNewZealand’staxsystemisakeyareathattheTWGisconsidering.Inparticular,the fairness of the tax system in the context of changing demographics (aging population and fiscal pressures) as identified in the Submissions Background Paper, as well as concerns about inequality. The Submissions Background Paper notes that the New Zealand public is concerned about inequality and that the tax system (along with redistribution and spending) can play a role in combatting inequality (page 15). Equality is an important feature sought in a tax system as it ensures sustainability and ensures taxpayers remain engaged with and supportive of the system. It is therefore critical that this concern is addressed to ensure New Zealand’s tax system will continue to have the support of the general public. A key aspect of fairness is horizontal equity – where taxpayers in the same circumstances or earning thesameamountofincomeshouldpaythesameamountoftax.Thecurrenttaxsystemenables situations where this is not the outcome e.g. New Zealand’s current distinction between the way labour and capital is taxed as well as the way certain capital gains are taxed. A person’s income from labour will generally all be subject to income tax while, under the current tax system, only some forms of income from capital are taxed (we discuss CGT further below). Where horizontal equity is not apparent, there is a risk that the tax system will be perceived as unfair. For a tax system to operate effectively, perception is often as important as reality. New Zealand’s tax system relies on self-assessment by taxpayers. A system that is perceived to be unfair could impact on the behaviour of the taxpayers, including their decision to be compliant or not. In our view, there is a clear need to assess and address horizontal equity in New Zealand’s tax system to ensure it continues to be one that encourages taxpayers to comply with their tax obligations, especially in the context of a self-assessment environment. Tax Working Group Secretariat 30 April 2018 PwC3 3616586\_5 Capital gains tax It is important to note that New Zealand currently taxes some income from capital already. Either in the form of the ‘purpose and intention’ test, which requires interpretation and is generally difficult for taxpayers to apply, or through specific taxing regimes, with the result being some capital gains (such as shares) are untaxed while other capital gains (such as bonds) are taxed (in some cases on an unrealised basis). The current tax settings therefore raise fairness issues. This current ad hoc and complex approach to taxing capital income also contributes to a lack of compliance and erosion of the potential tax base. Taxpayers simply do not understand the rules and may not return tax on gains unless advice is sought. The coherence of the tax system is reduced as is horizontal and vertical equity. Furthermore, it also raises a real question as to whether New Zealand’s current tax system is truly broad-base-low-rate (BBLR). While there may be fairness arguments supporting the introduction of a more comprehensive CGT, we note that other factors also need to be considered. Based on overseas experience, it is sometimes argued that a CGT can be complex for the level of revenue it generates, particularly if many exclusions are included. We understand the inclusion of owner-occupied housing in a CGT regime is excluded from the terms of reference of the TWG review. However, we note that 64% of households are owner-occupied. 1 This means a significant proportion of New Zealand housing will likely be outside the scope of any potential CGT raising questions as to coherence and efficiency of the resulting CGT. In our view, the introduction of a CGT requires careful consideration to ensure a balance is struck so that the resulting tax will have the necessary features of a good tax system, including coherence, equity, and fairness and low administration and compliance costs. At a high level, if the overriding policy rationale is that all income, regardless of form (i.e. labour or capital), is to be taxed then a CGT with as few exemptions as possible seems appropriate. Finally, any CGT should have a goal of minimising complexity resulting in a tax that is simple, intuitive, and easily understood. Specific design issues We comment on the following design issues that may arise in the development of a CGT: xCertainty–The current tax settings result in significant uncertainty as to when it could apply as it is heavily reliant on interpretation of the taxpayer’s purpose and intent at the time the asset is acquired. In addition, there is a degree of non-compliance due to the lack of understanding of the current rules. Any CGT implemented should provide greater certainty as to when it applies. We note that the broader the tax (i.e. the more that is included in the tax net), generally the greater the certainty. GST is a good example of this. xDifferential rates– The taxation of income from capital at marginal tax rates would limit the opportunity to structure around the tax. This would effectively treat income from labour and income from capital in the same manner. xDe minimis– We recognise that the inclusion of a de minimis would help reduce compliance costs. It may be appropriate to include a de minimis to ensure the additional time and expense that is incurred by the taxpayer in complying is justified by the additional revenue that is generated. 1 Statistics New Zealand, Dwelling and household trends: 1991 - 2015 Tax Working Group Secretariat 30 April 2018 PwC4 3616586\_5 xAccruals vs realisation basis–ItiscriticalthatanyCGTisappliedonarealisationbasis. Significant cash-flow difficulties could arise if the CGT is applied on an accrual basis as taxpayers may not have the necessary cash to meet their tax liabilities. It may also be difficult to ascertain values of assets on an accruals basis. xRollover relief– Roll-over relief should be made available as it is critical to ensure the tax does not hinder economic growth. However, the scope of the relief will need to be considered in more detail. Our initial thought is that it should be made available for productive assets. xCapital losses and deductions –It would seem unfair to tax capital gains while disallowing a deduction for capital losses and expenditure incurred in deriving those capital gains. The ring- fencing of capital losses may discourage risk-taking. However, we note that difficulties may arise around the calculation of the cost base. For example, what are the deductible costs created in building a business? Should goodwill be used as a proxy for the capital gain? Further, the deduction of capital losses may erode the tax base if it can be applied to other forms of income. xIndexation –Australia’s capital gains tax incorporates an indexation method to allow individuals to adjust their capital gain in relation to an asset held for over a year for inflationary aspects. This is required to limit the taxation that is paid on inflation. Care should be taken to ensure the resulting mechanism is not overly complex. xResidents and non-residents –Any CGT should be imposed on New Zealand residents as well as non-residents on any New Zealand based property. Appropriate double tax agreements will need to be in place to ensure foreign direct investment in New Zealand is not discouraged due to the risk of double taxation. xCollection –New Zealand currently operates a ‘self-assessment regime’ but the system often relies on the tax being collected and paid by another person and not the taxpayer. Examples of this include PAYE and the PIE regime. We acknowledge that it is often a more efficient collection mechanism. However, this often results in additional compliance costs for the payer. The design of the payment of the CGT should also consider the need to capture any non-residents holding New Zealand based property. Our comments on CGT is summarised as follow: xThe current CGT is not cohesive or well understood and difficult to apply. xThe lack of a more comprehensive CGT has caused considerable complexity in New Zealand including the introduction of arbitrary and ad hoc tax rules to try and limit taxpayers' exploitation of this large exemption in our otherwise broad tax base. It also does not align with a BBLR tax system. xCombined with the impact of discriminatory effective tax rates that applies across different types of income, horizontal equity and intergenerational equity are threatened. We agree with the view that consistent treatment should improve both fairness and efficiency. xAs evidenced by the design issues outlined above, a considerable amount of planning will be required to achieve a more balanced and efficient tax system while avoiding additional complexity and maintaining effective revenue generation. Tax Working Group Secretariat 30 April 2018 PwC5 3616586\_5 We also note that Submission Background Paper states the overall desire to maintain a tax system that generates tax revenues of c.32% of GDP. On this basis, it may be worthwhile to consider if other tax changes that may be revenue negative, but beneficial for New Zealand overall, are appropriate as a result of any additional revenue that may be generated by a more comprehensive CGT. Goods and services tax New Zealand’s holistic approach to GST is broad base, relatively low rate, intuitive and largely unavoidable. These are generally considered features that form part of a good tax system and, for these reasons, the GST system efficiently raises over 30% of Government revenue (in excess of $20 billion annually) with fairly low compliance costs. It consistently captures any bursts of economic growth (e.g. increased spending if a major sporting or cultural event is hosted in New Zealand) and is ‘neutral’ as any goods and services that are consumed in New Zealand are generally subject to New Zealand GST. New Zealand GST is a relatively straightforward system that is highly respected by tax designers around the world. Globally, similar value-added and consumption taxes tend to be riddled with exemptions and differential rates (often driven by political pressures), which commentators often criticise for lessening the efficiency of the tax. New Zealand’s GST is regarded as ‘best in class’ globally because it is pure, broad, and simple. There are currently three main exemptions from GST: financial services, long-term rental accommodation, and low value imported goods (de minimisupdated at the time of the GST rate increase in 2010). These exemptions are well defined and reflect policy rationale that was sound at the time when the exemptions were initially introduced. Specifically, it was determined that it would be administratively too complex to value financial services, imposition of GST would unduly inflate rental income costs, and that it would be too costly to collect GST on all low value imports. However, we acknowledge that it is important to revisit the design of our GST system to ensure that it continues to be world-class, especially in light of the rapid changes that New Zealand and the rest of the world is facing in a digital age. An example of this is the issue of imposing GST on the importation of low value goods into New Zealand. We also acknowledge that New Zealand’s comprehensive GST system is regressive as lower income households tend to spend a larger proportion of their income on consumption and therefore on GST. GST exemptions Where certain goods and services are excluded from GST, careful consideration should be given so that there is absolute clarity as to the desired outcomes and whether the exemption will sufficiently achieve those desired outcomes. There is also a need to adequately consider whether there is another way for the Government to achieve those desired outcomes without using the tax system. Experience from other jurisdictions suggests that the use of GST exemptions is often poorly targeted for the following reasons: xIt is inherently difficult to target a particular consumer by virtue of GST being a regressive tax. xThere is a risk any price differential may be absorbed by retailers. Tax Working Group Secretariat 30 April 2018 PwC6 3616586\_5 xIf the consumption of a particular good is being encouraged, there is no guarantee that the price will be sufficiently elastic to produce the desiredoutcome. 2 xAdditional rule complexity (and new interpretation issues) adds to collection costs and business systems have to change resulting in greater business costs. In our view, the current GST system results in minimum distortions (being broad base, low rate with minimum exemptions). If more exemptions are introduced, it is likely that there will be additional complexity and an increase in compliance costs. The additional compliance costs to sellers may be passed onto the ultimate consumers therefore increasing the costs of those goods and services. We note that, if 'exemptions' are to be pursued, we recommend the TWG considers whether GST zero- rating is a more appropriate way to exclude products from the GST net. This could lessen the costs for sellers (e.g. from the inability to recover input GST on their expenses) and prevent the cost from being passed onto the consumers. From a revenue perspective, the introduction of further GST exemptions will likely lead to a short-fall in revenue, therefore consideration will need to be given as to how that lost revenue will be recuperated. This would likely either be an increase in the rate of GST or the introduction of other taxes. The Treasury has previously concluded that economic growth can be increased by shifting the balance of taxation away from income taxes and toward a mixture of consumption taxes and taxes on immovable property. 3 There is therefore a question as to whether the reduction of the GST base is beneficial from an economic growth perspective. While further exemptions may help alleviate the regressive nature of GST, we question whether there is a better way to achieve this (e.g. the transfer system). The Submissions Background Paper (Figure 10, page 31) illustrates that the transfer system in New Zealand is reasonably effective, with the bottom five income deciles collectively paying less than 20% of all income tax while receiving 70% of all Government transfers. GST is not the only option available to reduce household costs and incentivise consumer behaviour. Healthy foods There has beensignificant discussion in the New Zealand media about a GST exemption for healthy food (fruit and vegetables) from GST to improve affordability and incentivise healthy eating. We therefore comment on the potential exemption of GST for ‘healthy foods’. 4 There is ample of evidence that healthy food is often comparatively more expensive than other less healthy options and that low income households consume less healthy food. However, we question whether the introduction of a GST exemption on 'healthy food' options would benefit those at which the exemption is aimed. It is difficult to target a GST-exemption on certain types of food to specific buyers. Therefore, it is likely that the exemption would benefit all buyers including those who already have the economic means to purchase healthy foods. As such, it is an expensive way for the Government to assist those families who are on lower incomes as the assistance will effectively be available to all consumers. 2 Child Poverty Action Group (2010).Will Removing GST on fresh fruit and vegetables achieve its stated aim? 3 EUCOTAX Series on European Taxation, The Future of Indirect Taxation, Recent Trends in VAT and GST Systems Around the World, Thomas Ecker, Michael Lang & Ine Lejeune, 2012 4 We note that there are issues as to whether 'food' would include fruit/vegetable juices and whether any percentage thresholds would exist to make the determination e.g. pasta/vegetable or stir-fry/vegetable pre-mixed packages or combinations. Tax Working Group Secretariat 30 April 2018 PwC7 3616586\_5 Given this proposal intends to target certain demographics, we question whether the transfer system is a more appropriate way to deliver the desired outcome and provide some compensation to households currently suffering a disproportional burden under the current GST system. Incentivising savings behaviour New Zealand’s tax system is relatively neutral in the sense that it does not overtly seek to change behaviour (with the obvious and noted exception of alcohol and cigarette duties). However, tax incentives may be appropriate to achieve greater horizontal equity and promote behaviour that serves New Zealand’s social and economic goals. Incentives may take the form of any concession, rebate, credit, subsidy, or contribution the Government makes towards changing behaviour to achieve a social or economic goal. We acknowledge the design of any tax incentive must be carefully considered to ensure it is well targeted, adequately funded, and maintains the integrity of the tax system. New Zealand’s past use of tax incentives has largely been poorly targeted, expensive, and inefficient. We outline below a framework to consider when evaluating the use of incentives, with a particular focus on savings incentives: xThe need for incentives –The use of incentives is an option available to the Government to correct market failures. Arguments that would support a tax incentive in the context of savings include the need to increase national savings, horizontal equity, and economic growth while decreasing dependency on state provided retirement income. Data included in the Submissions Background Document (page 40, figure 21) highlights the disparity between marginal effective tax rates on different types of savings. Bank accounts are taxed at a marginal effective tax rate of 55.7% while property investments are taxed at a marginal effective tax rate of 29.4%. The non-deliberate taxation incentives are arguably distorting the efficient allocation of what savings New Zealanders do have. 5 xDesign –A tax incentive should be structured to correct market failures, as opposed to creating distortions. This is particularly relevant in the context of savings given the potential distortionary effect on investment choices as outlined above. xLikely impact –Any tax incentive must be carefully modelled and the flow-on economic consequences thoroughly considered. In some instances, the incentive may only neutralise any distortions instead of incentivising a certain behaviour. In the context of savings, an incentive may level the playing field between different investments but it may not increase savings if the individuals do not have the capacity to save (e.g. those on lower incomes may not have the ability to benefit from the incentive as they need to consume a larger portion of their income). xRisk of irrational behaviour –We acknowledge that the impact of tax incentives can be difficult to predict. The Submissions Background Paper illustrates bank accounts are among the most punitively taxed investment in New Zealand, with the effective tax rate of PIE savings being 8.5% lower. However, taxpayers are nevertheless still placing their savings into a bank account despite the significantly higher effective tax rate. 5 Craig Stobo, Consensus of the Taxation of Investment Income, 2004 Tax Working Group Secretariat 30 April 2018 PwC8 3616586\_5 xObjectivity –When the rationale for granting tax incentives is based more on discretionary and subjective qualification requirements, instead of automatic and objective requirements, they can originate rent-seeking behaviour and manipulation of the granting process. xFunding –For the use of incentives to be fiscally neutral, the tax base will need to be expanded or rate heightened in another area. Specifically, the use of taxation incentives may result in inefficiency, fiscal costs, and distributional effects (greater benefit to high income earners). Looking forward, an incentive may become more costly as behaviour is induced. For example, the cost of a savings incentive may increase as society increases its saving level. We are of the view that incentives may be used to achieve greater horizontal equity. In the case of savings, incentives may result in an alignment of the marginal effective tax rates on various investments. For example, the low effective tax rate on rental property investment is likely disincentivising New Zealanders to invest in productive assets. This limits the capital available to grow our economy. Given New Zealand’s aging population, we consider it important to encourage saving for retirement. Concluding comments We support the current review of New Zealand’s tax system by the TWG and we support the ongoing review of the tax settings on a regular basis. The tax system should continuously evolve to keep pace with external changes to the environment in which it operates. We emphasise the importance of remaining open-minded and open to change during these reviews in order to challenge the current tax settings and the thinking behind them. As noted in our submission above, we believe this is being done as part of the current review by the TWG as it considers the use of new taxes, such as incentives, and seeks to consider the overall equity of the tax system. The current review is also making a conscious effort in opening up the discussion to all New Zealanders therefore resulting in greater diversity in how we may challenge New Zealand’s tax settings. Finally, we consider that the tax system is not the only way to address some of the concerns outlined in the Submissions Background Paper. Consideration should also be given to other methods of facilitating change to maintain the integrity and operational efficiency of our tax system. General We appreciate the opportunity for PwC to contribute our views and comments to the TWG on the future of New Zealand’s tax system. Please feel free to contact us should you wish to discuss our comments further. Yours faithfully \[1\]

In our submission, we have made a few general comments around how we believe a tax system should operate and provided our view on the one aspect of the following specific question canvassed: “Should our tax system just be as simple as possible or should it do more to incentivise certain behaviours we want to see? The wellbeing of a country is not just about the finances but also about how we live together and protect our natural resources for our children.” In the TWG paper, you have indicated there are two occasions where other countries have used tax to incentivise behaviours we want to see. “The first is when an activity has a social cost like the pollution of public rivers. Most economists agree that those whose activity create a social cost should be made to bear those costs. It’s not always easy to do but NZ doesn’t have many taxes like this.” We wish to address this first question after our general comments. General comments For whatever new tax regime/system or changes may be introduced as a result of the TWG, we believe a country’s tax system should be three things: 1. It should be administratively simple. To do otherwise would risk the compliance and administration costs being greater than the tax revenue generated by the changes. 2. It should be fair and equitable. The focus of the tax system should not be on how it can be used to redistribute wealth, but rather it should be focused on establishing the most fair and efficient ways of collecting tax and providing funding for core Government services. \[1\] 2 3. It should not be used as a blunt behaviour change mechanism to follow a particular political or ideological view. Creating taxes to penalise certain activities may not be as effective as other approaches, such as education, information sharing and targeted regulation to change the desired behaviours. In many instances these other approaches are likely to produce a more successful outcome than the imposition of a blanket tax across and activity or industry. Uses of taxes to influence behaviour New Zealand has stated that one of its obligations under the United Nations Paris Agreement is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. However, another element to the Paris Agreement is the importance of maintaining food security given a rapidly increasing world population. We deal with these two separate elements below: Greenhouse Gases Given there is an increasing world population and the consequential requirement for food production it would seem globally pragmatic to encourage those food producers that have the lowest amount of carbon emitted per unit of food produced. New Zealand features internationally well in this respect given its temperate climate and expertise with grazed pasture systems. A dominant focus on absolute emissions risks overlooking this important point. Ruminant livestock is a key component in satisfying the future food supply needs, especially protein, of the growing world population. However, the release of methane gas from ruminant livestock is the largest single contributor to New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions. Significant portions of New Zealand’s grazed pastures are hill and high country. That land, by way of its topography, is unable to be cultivated and therefore unable to produce food directly for human consumption. However, it provides a useful role to grow pastures, grasses and clovers which of themselves are not suitable food for humans directly, but rather they are available as food to be digested by grazing ruminants, which in turn provide protein to feed New Zealand and other parts of the world. Therefore, we believe New Zealand’s current agricultural system in this aspect supports the obligations under the Paris Agreement. Food security The overall contextual idea here is that the world’s population is increasing, meaning more food is needed to feed this growing population. Nitrogen fertiliser is a critical input to grow more food to meet this need, so you cannot just get rid of it. Without any mineral fertiliser use globally, global food production would likely to be halved which would be untenable. Therefore, the focus should be on how the fertiliser is used and the relevant on farm processes to ensure these processes are developed to improve the on farm system management of nitrate leaching to be as effective as possible. The results of improvements to farming systems are already proving to be effective in reducing nitrate leaching and damage to our land and water sources. In the context of the TWG’s brief, we propose that the focus should be on finding ways to decrease the nitrogen losses including those from fertiliser rather than blanket taxing the farming sector or the fertiliser industry as a potential means to decrease consumption. Further to this point, history indicates that 3 generally nitrogen fertiliser has a relatively inelastic demand pattern. This means that a tax on nitrogen fertiliser, either the production or use level is unlikely to influence the behaviour of farmers. I.e. it is unlikely to decrease demand. The better mechanism would be to assist in finding ways to decrease the losses of nitrogen. We consider that the recently announced research and development tax credit system which the Government has recently announces is a far more proactive way to encourage the development of products and systems to reduce nitrogen loss. Currently the largest losses of nitrogen in New Zealand from farming are because of the grazing behaviour of ruminants where they forage from a large area and deposit dung and urine in a small concentrated area resulting in system losses, rather than the application of fertiliser per sae. At present, a number of regional councils have operative plans in place with the predominant focus of these plans being modelling, measuring and placing a limit on nitrogen losses through farming systems. If for example if a nitrogen leaching tax was to be introduced, it runs the risk of penalising further the farmer who is already undertaken appropriate mitigations to reduce nitrogen loss, as well as those who have not undertaken any activity to reduce their nitrogen loss. This is likely to be de-motivating for the farmers who have already invested time and money in changing farm systems for the betterment of New Zealand’s environment if they are to be hit by a nitrogen leaching tax. Summary We believe that encouragement for the development of smart technology to both limit Nitrate leaching and greenhouse gas emissions will have a much better chance of success around making improvements to our environment, than that the addition of any broad base environmental taxes to the agricultural sector.

As a public health submission it may be useful to provide the working group with a definition of public health and the role that Regional Public Health plays in the greater Wellington region. Public health 1 Public Health is defined as “the art and science of preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society”. Activities to strengthen public health capacities and service aim to provide conditions under which people can maintain to be healthy, improve their health and well-being, or prevent the deterioration of their health. Public health focuses on the entire spectrum of health and well-being, not only the eradication of particular diseases. Many activities are targeted at populations such as health campaigns. Public health services also include the provision of personal services to individual persons, such as vaccinations, behavioural counselling, or health advice. Regional Public Health 2 Regional Public Health delivers population and personal health services to the greater Wellington region. Our geographical area of service delivery spans Hutt Valley, Capital & Coast and Wairarapa District Health Boards. Our aim is to improve the health of communities throughout the region, with a focus on achieving equitable health outcomes for high needs groups such as Māori, Pacific peoples, children, and low income families. We have a range of occupations working within Regional Public Health including: medical officers of health and public health physicians, public health advisors, public health analysts, health protection officers and public health nurses. We are happy to provide further advice or clarification on any of the points raised in our written submission. Ngā mihi Peter Gush Dr. Jill McKenzie Service Manager Medical Officer of Health 1 World Health Organization, Sourced: http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/Health-systems/public-health-services 2 Regional Public Health, Sourced: http://www.rph.org.nz/ \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] Overall statement A transparent and equitable tax base is a necessary foundation for a well-functioning nation and equity is a prerequisite for public health. 3 Public health related to non-communicable diseases and their associated risk factors have a significant impact on the well-being of the nation e.g. diabetes, tobacco related morbidity, obesity. Past taxation reviews and subsequent reforms have an impact on the funding of specific health issues using levies; most notably the alcohol and problem gambling levies. Ideally, appropriating (earmarking) a portion of monies from risk factors associated with adverse health outcomes e.g. tobacco use, soft drink use etc should be utilised to supplement health promotion programmes and resources. As noted: Strategically there is strong evidence of the cost effectiveness of spending in public health as a key vehicle for pursuing equity. Money invested in keeping people well leads to considerable savings in clinical treatment costs later. When executed well, public health programmes produce healthy, resilient communities, but disinvestment needs to be redressed and new funding streams dedicated. 4 For the purpose of this submission Regional Public Health will focus on three areas:  GST removal on fruit and vegetables  Tobacco tax  Sugar Sweetened Beverage (SSB) tax GST removal on fruit and vegetables Regional Public Health supports the position expressed in the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) paper: Will removing GST on fresh fruit and vegetables achieve its stated aim? 5 Two points expressed in the CPAG paper that align with our thinking on this issue are: 1. CPAG considers it would be much less costly overall and more beneficial to address the lack of purchasing power of low income families than to attempt to make good food more affordable by a selective application of GST. 2. In addition to the high administration costs such a policy imposes on both the Inland Revenue Department and the retailer, taking GST off fresh fruit and vegetables is likely to benefit high-income families the most and the revenue cost of such a policy requires extra taxes elsewhere or spending cuts that may harm low-income households more. Recommendations  The status quo prevails regarding GST on fruit and vegetables.  Taxation remedies that improve the “purchasing power” of low income whānau are given high consideration in preference to removing GST from fresh fruit and vegetables. 3 Public Service Association, Progressive Thinking: ten perspectives on tax, Sourced: https://www.psa.org.nz/assets/Campaigns/stand-together/Tax-booklet/Tax-book-2017-LOW-RES.pdf 4 Came H et al, The New Zealand Health Strategy 2016: whither health equity?

Sourced: http://www.cpag.org.nz/resources-2/tax-policy/ Tobacco tax The goal of Smokefree 2025 requires measures that will reduce smoking prevalence rates to <5% of current smokers. Tobacco tax has largely being the tool of choice to reduce the number of smokers in New Zealand. Of late, taxation on tobacco has seen a series of 10% increases since 2010 (legislated through until 2020) with a corresponding decline in overall smoking prevalence rates from 18–21% in 2006–08 to a 2013-15 level of 15%. 6 In support of the Smokefree 2025 goal Regional Public Health would like the Tax Working Group to consider two measures: 1. That a 2-3% portion of additional tobacco tax is appropriated to further support already budgeted tobacco control spend. 2. That there is consideration for significant tobacco tax increases of 20% per annum to lower the smoking prevalence rates. In terms of the first measure regarding the use of earmarking tax revenues, the World Bank notes: ...“soft” earmarking of funds — for example, linking increased taxes to increased health spending — has helped generate grassroots support for the tax hikes. This has been shown by experience in other sectors, and it has worked for tobacco taxes in countries like Australia, Philippines, and the United States. 7 There is evidence that New Zealand smokers would accept tobacco tax rises if they were dedicated specifically for tobacco control use. 8 9 Note, earmarking tobacco tax for tobacco control is already common practice in various jurisdictions overseas (e.g. Iceland, California, Switzerland and Vietnam). 10 11 The most notable use of earmarking, in New Zealand, is the alcohol levy. The second measure, also promoted in the recent World Bank publication 12 , notes that tax strategies should focus on health gains first, then on fiscal benefits. The World Bank endorses larger tobacco excise tax rate increases as a response to the high mortality and morbidity rates caused by tobacco use. Significant work undertaken by the University of Otago 13 indicates that smoking prevalence rates at the current tax hikes will not meet the 2025 goal of <5%; current modelling predicts this goal to be reached in 2035 and 2040. Substantially higher tax levels are required to assist with driving the smoking prevalence rates down. The University of Otago also state that other strategies are required 6 Blakely T et al, Smoking prevalence in New Zealand from 1996-2015: a critical review of national data sources to inform progress toward the Smokefree 2025 goal.

Ultimately, benefits are accrued through a strong tobacco tax strategy. These include higher productivity in the labour market and better health, resilience through lower risk of breadwinners falling ill or dying prematurely, as well as cost saving (both private and public health expenditure) in the treatment of tobacco-related illness. 14 Recommendations  That 2-3% of the current total tobacco tax is earmarked for health promotion programmes, smoking cessation courses and resources to support the Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 goal.  The current annual 10% tax is increased to 20% per annum to reach the Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 goal and to see a significant drop in smoking prevalence rates. Sugar Sweetened Beverage (SSB) Tax – Levy The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that evidence regarding the consumption of SSBs, and the adverse change in population health outcomes, warrant the imposition of Pigovian taxes or levies on sugar-sweetened beverages. 15 WHO research also specifies that interventions will see a reduction in children’s dental caries, weight decreases and lowering of non-communicable diseases. 16 17 In the New Zealand context, public health researchers provide the necessary and compelling evidence that requires a strong public heath response that includes a SSB Tax - Levy: High sugar intakes are linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease; a strong case can, therefore, be made for efforts to reduce consumption. There is particular concern about sugar-sweetened beverages because they are nutrient poor, and energy from beverages is less satiating than that obtained from solid foods, resulting in increased consumption. Almost one- fifth of the total sugar intake of New Zealand adults (17%) comes from non-alcoholic beverages. 18 On the balance of the current evidence Regional Public Health specifically supports a SSB Tax – Levy because of: 1. Increased number of dental caries in children and the number of tooth extractions being performed by dental services in New Zealand. 2. The increase in type II diabetes. 3. The association with an increased consumption of SSBs with weight gain (obesity). The aim is to curb the consumption rate of SSBs that will result in positive health gains in the New Zealand population. From an inequalities viewpoint these health gains will: 14 World Bank Group, P.136. 15 World Health Organization, Report of the Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity Implementation Plan: Executive Summary.

Around 96% of the industry by unit number are RVA members. We welcome the opportunity to comment on the Tax Working Group’s discussion paper “The Future of Tax”. This submission looks at how the retirement village sector contributes to the Four Capitals in the paper, and argues that the sector is actively meeting a range of public policy objectives, contributing to all four capitals, and especially around delivering age-appropriate housing for older people, the long-term provision for residential age care, employment, and combatting potentially serious health issues such as social isolation. The sector’s growth has been partly due to the demand for villages because of the benefits they offer, but also due to a stable and predictable regulatory regime. This includes the current taxation regime, which has been developed in conjunction with Inland Revenue over 15 or more years. The RVA’s principal submission is that the status quo should be maintained, so far as the capital gains tax, land tax and imputation systems are concerned. We have made some suggestions regarding the existing corporate tax regime. Social capital The country will see a significant increase in the population aged over 85 as well as the population over 75. This older group is most likely to need some form of care services, resulting in an increased health bill for the Government. The aged care sector is underfunded and the private sector, through the retirement village sector, is now and will continue to be a significant supplier of aged care beds, reducing the pressure on Government. In considering the tax system and potential changes, the TWG should consider the need for investment in both retirement village accommodation and aged care infrastructure, and consider the tax setting that will encourage this investment. We note that lack of private sector investment will inevitably lead to increased government costs in providing aged care service either within the home or in hospitals and other health facilities. A primary economic driver of housing affordability is supply. The RV industry is a critical supplier of affordable housing which reduces upward pressure on housing prices. Accordingly, any changes to the taxation settings in relation to property should be made with a view to incentivise development rather than deter investment in housing infrastructure. Retirement villages also have an important role to play in reducing social isolation and the attendant negative health impacts. There is no doubt that social isolation presents serious health implications, 3 and this is especially true for older people who may be trapped in their own home and not have any social interaction for days on end. Retirement villages are communities of like-minded people and our residents report a significant improvement in their social and physical life after they’ve moved in. Natural capital Retirement village operators are building eco-sustainable developments that comply with 6 or more Homestar standards. Villages are also highly efficient users of scarce land, with up to three dwellings occupying the land area of a conventional home. Human capital On-going employment from the day-to-day operations of retirement villages is approximately 19,000 people, which includes both full and part-time employees. This ranks 25 out of the 42 sectors in Statistics New Zealand’s Business Operations Survey 2016 (in terms of employee count). It is comparable with the real estate industry, or arts and recreation. 1 Salary information collected through PwC’s survey of retirement villages indicates that in 2017 almost $840 million was paid by the retirement villages to full and part-time employees across New Zealand. This has increased steadily each year since 2013 when $513 m was paid in salaries. Retirement villages also support employment during the construction of new villages. These jobs are predominantly locally-based, which offer employment opportunities for local residents. They cover a broad spectrum of construction-related tasks, which includes construction managers, designers, architects, engineers, builders, quantity surveyors, electricians, plumbers, labourers, heavy/civil labourers, painters, decorators, and landscapers. PwC’s analysis shows that every million dollars spent on retirement village construction supports the employment of 4.0 FTEs in construction and related industries. Once the indirect impacts are included, then every million dollars spent on construction supports the employment of 10.0 FTEs. Financial / Physical capital In 2017, day-to-day operations in the retirement village sector added around $1.1b to New Zealand’s GDP, accounting for roughly 0.4% of national GDP. This is approximately equivalent to the value-add from department stores, or the motor vehicle retailing industry in 2016. Economic activities supported by day-to-day operations of the industry include village management, administration, operations, marketing/advertising, maintenance and repairs, renovations, back office support, amongst other roles. In 2017, overall retirement village construction directly contributed approximately $162m to New Zealand. After including indirect impacts, value-added from construction activity and upstream impacts contributed a total of approximately $480m to New Zealand. 1 Information from the PwC report into the retirement village’s economic contribution to the economy, which will be released later this year. 4 Support for the existing corporate tax structure The current imputation system should be retained as in addition to reducing double taxation, the current system also ensures amounts which are untaxed at the company level are appropriately taxed when distributed to the shareholders. 5 SUBMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF TAX – SUBMISSIONS BACKGROUND PAPER 1. What is the RVA? The Retirement Villages Association represents the interests of the owners, developers and managers of registered retirement villages throughout NZ. Our 350 member villages operate some 31,000 villas, apartments and serviced apartments that are home to approximately 40,400 older New Zealanders. In 2017 the sector built 1,633 units (a rate of 32/week) and around 50 new residents moved in each week. 12.6% of the +75 population choose to live in a retirement village, and this penetration rate has increased steadily from around 9% six years ago. 2 Our membership is divided between the five listed companies plus Bupa Care Services’ 165 villages (18,430 units), 120 independently-owned villages (7,423 units) and 63 not-for-profit villages (3,692 units). This represents around 96% of the sector by unit number. The RVA welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Tax Working Group’s discussion paper, with a particular focus on section 2, dealing with the changing demographics and the ageing population, and the various challenges that presents. 2. The Retirement Village regulatory regime The sector’s regulatory regime has been in operation fully since 2009, when the reworked Code of Practice became effective. The Code has been amended significantly twice since that time; to improve the insurance and replacement provisions following the Christchurch earthquakes and to upgrade the complaints and disputes process last year. New Zealand’s regulatory regime for retirement villages (RV) consists of nine key elements: • An explicit description of a “retirement village”; • The requirement to register each new village with the Registrar of Retirement Villages; • A memorial on the land that prevents it from being operated as anything other than a RV; • A statutory supervisor to oversee residents’ interests; • Regulations stipulate what must be in the Disclosure Statement and Occupation Rights Agreement (ORA); • Residents must receive legal advice before signing their contracts; • Code of Residents’ Rights and Code of Practice protects resident rights and interests; • The monitoring reviews undertaken by the CFFC keep the regime current; • An effective legislative complaints and disputes resolution scheme exists. Underpinning this approach is the understanding that residents do not, in the majority of cases, actually own the bricks and mortar of their RV homes; rather, they have a contractual right to live 2 Jones Lang LaSalle RV White Paper, November 2017 6 there and enjoy the village’s amenities for as long as they want to or are able to live independently. This point is developed in section 3 of this paper. If the operator’s circumstances change, for example, if the village is sold, the residents’ rights continue unchanged under the new ownership. The extensive consumer protection means that incoming residents are well-informed about what they have access to, what the operator’s responsibilities are, and how the village’s financial arrangements are managed. It also demonstrates a commitment by the Government to ensuring the industry is well-managed and residents’ interests are effectively protected. The RVA has argued that our regulatory regime is “world-leading” and we evidenced this by the many requests from around the world (including Australia and the United Kingdom) for assistance in developing other jurisdictions’ regimes for their newly-expanding retirement village industry. The “world-leading” claim was reinforced by a report commissioned recently by the UK industry’s sector peak body Associated Retirement Community Operators (ARCO) and produced by the International Longevity Centre – UK, an independent non-partisan research organisation looking at longevity, ageing and population change. This report said “Perhaps the strongest example of legislation specific to this sector \[retirement villages\] comes from New Zealand, where the RV Act was passed in 2003.” The report noted “The NZ model incorporates a range of innovative elements that outline the requirements for operators and offer extensive consumer protection”. 3 We stress that the sector’s undoubted success is underpinned by a comprehensive and credible regulatory regime that is well-understood and accepted by residents and operators alike. It allows operators and financiers to develop villages in confidence that the regime is robust, stable, and mature. We would strongly argue against any significant changes to the taxation regime that might undermine that level of confidence. 3. The business model The principal business model in the NZ regime is the “licence to occupy” model. Residents pay a capital sum to the operator to enjoy an unrestricted right to live in their unit and enjoy access to a range of community amenities such as the bowling green, café, cinema, gym, lounge, library, swimming pool amongst others. The initial capital sum is based on around 75% of the average freehold property value in the area. This allows a resident to release equity in their family home to add to their retirement savings, often resulting in a significant improvement in their quality of life, and at the same time, releasing another home for another family to enjoy. Residents then live in the village for as long as they want to or are able to, and when they move out the unit is refurbished and the occupation right (the contract between the operator and the resident, or ORA) is then made available to another resident. Once the operator has received the next payment, between 70 and 80% of the original capital sum is repaid to the outgoing resident or their estate. 3 Beach, B : Stronger Foundations: International Lessons for the Housing-with-Care Sector in the UK, 2018, p.12 7 The balance, between 20 and 30%, is referred to as the Deferred Management Fee (DMF) and is used by the operator to meet the costs of providing the range of community assets the resident has enjoyed during their life in the village. It’s an “enjoy now, pay later” model. Residents have confidence in paying a capital sum because their investment is protected by the Retirement Villages Act and related regulations, and know almost to the last dollar how much they will get back when they leave. Their rights are enshrined in the ORA and enforced by contract law, and thereby, risks and uncertainly are avoided. Village operators are also responsible for all maintenance in the village, which can be substantial. For example, a listed RV operator recently provided guidance to the market that they have a $44 million liability for remedial costs to ensure the integrity and quality of their villages for the residents’ benefit. As a result, residents are not liable for the structural repairs and maintenance that they would be responsible for in their own homes. Issues facing domestic homeowners around “leaky buildings” is a good example of this. It’s important to stress that any increase in the market value of the ORA between residents is not retained in the long term by the operator, but is repaid to the exiting resident from the next incoming resident’s capital payment, less the DMF. Because the ownership of the unit never changes hands there is no capital gain earnt by the operator from unit sales. Diagram 1 below illustrates the point. Around 95% of the RVA’s members’ village units are under the LTO model. The balance are held under a unit title tenure. 8 4. The Four Capitals The Association notes the TWG’s emphasis on the “Four Capitals” – Natural Capital, Social Capital, Human Capital, and Financial / Physical Capital. We understand the proposal that intergenerational wellbeing relies on the growth, distribution and sustainability of these four Capitals. We believe that the retirement village sector makes a direct contribution to each, and the balance of this submission links our work and outputs with the four Capitals. SOCIAL CAPITAL 5. Impacts on an ageing population Statistics New Zealand predicts that the population of New Zealanders who are in the 75+ age group will grow from 6% of the total population in 2016 (295,000 people) to 10% of the total population by 2033 (586,000 people), which means the demand for retirement villages is likely to grow substantially over the coming years. The rate of growth in retirement village units is forecast to outpace this growth in the 75+ age group through to 2026 (the end of the analysis period). This will be important to support the forecast growth in demand for retirement villages, as more people choose retirement village living. Penetration rates (i.e. the percentage of 75+ year olds choosing to live in a retirement village) have been consistently increasing year-on-year since 2012. 4 Diagram 2 – retirement village penetration rate (market share). The country will see a significant increase in the population aged over 85 as well as the population over 75. This older group is most likely to need some form of care services resulting in an increased health bill for the Government. The aged care sector is underfunded and the private sector, through the retirement village sector, is now and will continue to be a significant supplier of aged care beds, reducing the pressure on Government. Of the 30,000 or so units, 25,000 are available as independent living and the balance, around 5,000 units, are occupied as “serviced apartments” in residential care facilities. Serviced apartments are designed to allow an older person who expects to need a higher level of care to purchase an ORA 4 Data from Jones Lang LaSalle, RV White paper 2017; 2017 data from RVA 0 5 10 15 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Penetration rate Penetration rate 9 and receive that care in more comfortable surroundings than the standard 11m 2 rest home room. Serviced apartments for which an ORA exists are covered by the RV Act, Code of Practice and related regulations. They allow residents to contribute towards the cost of their care without the need for additional government financial assistance via the Aged Residential Care subsidy. This is important because the country’s demographics demand more care rooms that will not be affordable, unless the resident contributes to their capital cost. Government and TWG have recognised that New Zealand has an aging population. As such, there is a growing need for investment in infrastructure to provide the required aged care services to this growing demographic. The “continuum of care” model adopted by many retirement villages increasingly incorporates aged care facilities into their business model, which provides the required aged care services within the village if greater levels of assistance are required. These include peace of mind with on-call medical assistance and support services provided under contract from DHBs. Reports indicate a shortfall of aged care beds within the next four years. In addition, analysis suggests the private sector will provide around 40% of rest home beds needed over the next 10 years. However, stand-alone rest home operators are struggling to stay in business and the commercially sustainable operations tend to be for aged care linked to a retirement village operation. As approximately 74% of retirement villages include an aged care facility, the retirement village sector will be critical in providing the aged care beds necessary for the demographic changes (193% growth in over 75s). Furthermore, with the aging population, there will be an increasing amount of Government funding required for care services and home-based support. A benefit of integrated retirement villages is that care services can be provided more efficiently compared with aged care services provided to elderly people living at home. In considering the tax system and potential changes, the TWG should consider the need for investment in both retirement village accommodation and aged care infrastructure, and consider the tax setting that will encourage this investment. We note that lack of private sector investment will inevitably lead to increased government costs in providing aged care service either within the home or in hospitals and other health facilities. 6. The sector’s contribution to providing affordable housing A primary economic driver of housing affordability is supply. The RV industry is a significant supplier of affordable housing which reduces upward pressure on housing prices. Accordingly, any changes to the taxation settings in relation to property should be made with a view to incentivise development rather than deter investment in housing infrastructure. Generally, a retirement village unit will be priced at about 75 - 80% of the average local residential house price, but in some of the very high-value areas in Auckland, it can be much lower, around 50% to 60 % of what residents sold their house for. This means that there’s a buffer before a fall in house prices impacts on retirement village ORA prices. Operators are reporting that they haven't seen material impacts on ORA prices, which is an important market protection against a dramatic price fall in residential prices. 10 The Government’s desire to build 100,000 new homes across the country is well-understood, and the retirement village sector is part of the solution. Table 1 shows the number of new units built across New Zealand over the last six years. 5 Year to 31 December Villages UnitsEstimated residents Penetration rate 75+ 2012 343 21,81524,6509.4% 2013 351 24,14827,29010.5% 2014 363 25,27232,85012.0% 2015 376 26,30734,20012.1% 2016 383 28,16836,61812.4% Nov 2017 401 29,801 6 38,750 12.6% Over the last six years the sector has built almost 8,000 units. Each new unit releases a family home back onto the market for a new family to purchase, renovate, and enjoy. The steady increase in resident numbers means the sector is now part of the mainstream housing options for older people. We appreciate that villages will not suit everyone, but we are pleased to note that not only is the number of 75 year olds in the population growing, but our market share is also steadily increasing, as diagram 2 shows. On average, a village’s resale rate is around 10% of the available units annually. This means that in addition to the new builds noted above, a mature village with 250 units would add the equivalent of 25 new homes to the local market as new residents sell their family homes and move in. With an existing unit stock of 30,000 units, the average turnover rate means that there are 3,000 homes released back into the market. A soon-to-be released report commissioned by the RVA from PwC shows that the retirement village sector has been building units at a faster rate than the general level of housing stock growth (see diagram 3, below). Since 2009 new private dwellings have been growing at around 1% (or slightly below) annually, while retirement village units have been growing at between 3.5% (2010) and slightly below 8% (2015 and 2016). 5 Jones Lang LaSalle, NZ Retirement Village White Paper, February 2017, p.15 6 CBRE, NZ Retirement Village Capital Value Estimate, October 2017 and extrapolations and Jones Lang LaSalle 2018 White Paper preview 11 Diagram 3 : Percentage growth in retirement village units vs percentage growth in residential dwellings (2009 – 2016) The demand is driven by six key influencers: • The ageing population aged 75+ will increase from around 6% of the general population in 2013 to 14% by 2043, which means that if the penetration rate remains constant, there will continue to be a significant demand for new village stock; • The relatively low-risk nature of the asset class means that developers enjoy good access to capital; • Lifestyle preferences means that older people want to realise the built-up equity in their homes and use it while they still can, while living in a secure, safe, age-appropriate environment; • Villages provide a pathway to care if that’s needed. 73% of retirement villages have an aged residential care facility on or near the campus; • The community of like minds means that the scourge of social isolation is minimised. 66% of our residents report an improved social life after moving in; • The regulatory regime is well-understood and accepted by all parties, and many City and District Councils are easing the paths to build new villages. Reference to the housing stock impact has already been made in this paper, and we stress that the sector’s contribution is both substantial and nationally-focused. Auckland, Canterbury, the Bay of Plenty and the Waikato have seen the greatest increases in RV housing stock over the last nine years (between 51% and 60%), the country as a whole has experienced a 53% increase in RV homes since 2008. The development pipeline (i.e. units either planned, in the consent process or under construction) includes around 16,000 units across the country, which is a six to eight year horizon. By 2028 we 12 expect the industry to have grown to almost 52,500 units if this development pipeline becomes a reality. 7. The sector’s contribution to combatting social isolation There is no question that some older New Zealanders experience isolation and loneliness. This isolation and loneliness is known to have a strong relationship with poor mental and physical health outcomes for these people. This is especially true for those older people who are living in regional or remote parts of New Zealand, or who may be living some distance from their families. Retirement villages bring older people together. Villages often have shared facilities and other opportunity for interaction with peers. In doing so, they reduce the isolation and loneliness that would otherwise be felt by some of these people, thereby potentially preventing some of the negative physical and mental well-being impacts that would otherwise be experienced. Research has found that three of the most common social advantages older people expect from transitioning into retirement village living are: • greater opportunities for keeping active • being around people the same age • a better social life. 7 Other research has found that the aged care environment can provide older people who are physically frail but cognitively intact with a better life than when they were living in their own homes. A study of residents in retirement villages confirmed what many people have long- suspected: living in a community where you can chat with friends, pursue hobbies and have a support network around you makes you happier and may even help you live longer. 8 The factors have a positive impact on the country’s health budget. NATURAL CAPITAL 8. Eco-sustainable design and building Some retirement village operators are aware of an increasing market demand for eco-sustainable developments and ensure their villages comply with these standards. For example, Metlifecare’s village The Orchards in Auckland is one of the first – if not the first – retirement villages in NZ to achieve a 6-Homestar Design rating, which recognises a higher level of efficiency and sustainability that most NZ homes. 7 Massey University, A study of the ageing in Aotearoa. 2014. Available online at: https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/fms/Colleges/College%20of%20Humanities%20and%20Social%20Sciences/ Psychology/HART/publications/reports/ICC\_Summary\_Report\_2014.pdf?CC3F1B9AE2CE105B8A36E3DE735C7 D81 accessed 20.11.17 8 Whiteley Village study: Cass Business School, Faculty of Actuarial Science and Insurance, City, University of London 13 Key features in this rating include double glazing, energy-efficient heat pumps, LED lighting, rainwater harvesting, solar water heating, thermal insulation to a high level, water-efficient fittings throughout the village. Others, such as Kerikeri Retirement Trust, have invested in a fleet of electric cars that will be available for their residents’ use, thereby allowing them to replace their conventional petrol vehicle with a sustainable one. Retirement village developments 9 can result in improved land use intensity and a higher housing density compared with other types of housing development. This is particularly true for mid to large- sized Auckland-based villages. These villages have a unit density of 1 per 164 m 2 (villages throughout the rest of NZ have an average density of 1 unit per 273 m 2 ). This compares favourably with the density in the Auckland Unitary Plan single house zone of 1 dwelling per 600 m 2 , through to 1 dwelling per 250-300 m 2 in the mixed housing urban zone. The objective of the Unitary Plan is to achieve high-density urban living that increase housing capacity. Retirement village developments deliver on this objective. HUMAN CAPITAL 9. The sector’s contribution to employment On-going employment from the day-to-day operations of retirement villages is approximately 19,000 people, which includes both full and part-time employees. This ranks 25 out of the 42 sectors in Statistics New Zealand’s Business Operations Survey 2016 (in terms of employee count). It is comparable with the real estate industry, or arts and recreation. 10 Salary information collected through PwC’s survey of retirement villages indicates that in 2017 almost $840 million was paid by the retirement villages to full and part time employees across New Zealand. This has increased steadily each year since 2013 when $513 m was paid in salaries. Retirement villages also support employment during the construction of new villages. These jobs are predominantly locally-based, which offer employment opportunities for local residents. They cover a broad spectrum of construction-related tasks, which includes construction managers, designers, architects, engineers, builders, quantity surveyors, electricians, plumbers, labourers, heavy/civil labourers, painters, decorators, and landscapers. PwC’s analysis shows that every million dollars spent on retirement village construction supports the employment of 4.0 FTEs in construction and related industries. Once the indirect impacts are included, then every million dollars spent on construction supports the employment of 10.0 FTEs. 9 Data in this section comes from the PwC report commissioned by the RVA “Retirement Village Contribution to housing, employment and GDP in New Zealand”, March 2018, p. 16-18 10 Information from the PwC report into the retirement village’s economic contribution to the economy, which will be released later this year. 14 Based on a total retirement industry construction spend of approximately $620 million in 2017, PwC estimates that approximately 2,300 FTEs were supported in construction and related industries. After including indirect impacts, a total of 5,700 FTEs are supported by building new villages each year and their supply chain impacts. Our analysis also shows that the construction a retirement village of size 250 units directly supports the employment of 303 FTE, made up of : • 44 engineers, quantity surveyors, architects, and other technical and business professionals • 230 builders and other tradesmen, building managers, suppliers of building materials, and those involved in land subdivision and site preparation • 15 heavy labourers delivering civil works including site drainage and road construction • 14 people working in furniture, fittings, and equipment retailing and installation. As indicated above, the forecast annual build of retirement village units is approximately 1,900 units per annum over the next 7-8 years. For every 100 retirement village units, on average, there are 64 people employed to support the retirement villages’ operations. There are approximately 14,700 retirement village units in the pipeline, creating over 9,500 new jobs over that timeframe. By 2023, approximately 29,000 people will be directly employed by retirement villages in New Zealand to support their day-to-day operations, as the following table shows: FINANCIAL / PHYSICAL CAPITAL 10. The sector’s contribution to GDP In 2017, day-to-day operations in the retirement village sector added around $1.1b to New Zealand’s GDP, accounting for roughly 0.4% of national GDP. This is approximately equivalent to the value-add from department stores, or the motor vehicle retailing industry in 2016. Economic activities supported by day-to-day operations of the industry include village management, administration, 15 operations, marketing/advertising, maintenance and repairs, renovations, back office support, amongst other roles. The industry has grown rapidly over the last few years. Between 2013 and 2017, the industry’s value added has grown by just under two and a half times (in nominal terms). PwC has estimated the total spend on retirement village construction across various types of retirement village development, based on data provided by RVA members who are also developing new villages. The average cost of construction of seven retirement village case studies ranged between $28m and $114m, and the size of the developments ranged between 69 units and 418 units. Extrapolating from PwC’s seven case studies to the total retirement village development pipeline gives a total retirement village construction spend in 2017 of approximately $620 million. In 2016, the total value of gross fixed capital formation in the residential building industry was approximately $20 billion (the equivalent value for the total construction industry is $34 billion when non-residential building and infrastructure are included). Assuming a similar level in 2017, the spend on the retirement village construction above represents 3.1% of the total fixed capital formation in the residential building industry in 2017 (or 1.8% in the total construction industry). PwC also estimated the value-added impact of retirement village construction. Value-added differs from expenditure (or gross output) as it considers the cost of intermediate inputs. They used the seven retirement village development project case studies and value-added multiplier tables from Butcher Partners. For every million dollars spent on retirement village construction in 2017, the contribution to direct value added was $262,000. After including indirect impacts, value-added from construction was equivalent to $773,000 per million of construction spend. In 2017, overall retirement village construction directly contributed approximately $162m to New Zealand. After including indirect impacts, value-added from construction activity and upstream impacts contributed a total of approximately $480m to New Zealand. 16 THE CURRENT TAX SYSTEM 11. Support for existing corporate tax structure The current imputation system should be retained as in addition to reducing double taxation, the current system also ensures amounts which are untaxed at the company level are appropriately taxed when distributed to the shareholders. In many situations, companies may have net profits in a particular period for financial reporting purposes, but a reduced income tax liability at the company level in that same period. Common examples of this situation arise when companies have brought forward losses from earlier income years, amounts are classified as revenue under the accounting standards which are not income for tax purposes or there are timing differences between when revenue arises for accounting purposes and when that revenue is subject to income tax. Due to the legal nature of the arrangements between retirement village operators and residents, many operators in retirement village industry experience differences between the level of accounting profit and taxable income resulting in lower income tax liabilities. Despite the differences that arise at the company level between the accounting profit and the payment of income tax, the existing imputation system and its interaction with the resident withholding tax (“RWT”) and Non-resident withholding tax (“NRWT”) regimes ensure that an appropriate amount of tax is paid on the underlying profits. Specifically, where a company is not in a tax paying position and has no imputation credits to attach to its dividends, those dividends (in most instances) will be subject to RWT or NRWT. The overall effect is that the company tax rate is in effect a withholding tax and the final tax is collected on the accounting profits when it is distributed to the shareholder. To the extent no dividends are paid and the profits are undistributed, these profits are re-invested into the operations of the company which will increase dividends in the future. The imputation system therefore provides an appropriate mechanism to ensure differences in the accounting profit and taxable income are subject to income tax. For this reason, we submit that the current imputation system should be retained. 12. Conclusions We are delighted to have the opportunity to comment on the TWG’s discussion paper on the future of tax in New Zealand. This submission shows that the retirement village sector is making major contributions to alleviating serious public policy concerns around housing supply, especially age- appropriate housing for older people, the long-term provision for residential age care, employment, and combatting potentially serious health issues such as social isolation. The sector’s growth has been partly due to the demand for villages because of the benefits they offer, but also due to a stable and predictable regulatory regime. This includes the current taxation regime, which has been developed in conjunction with Inland Revenue over 15 or more years. 17 The RVA’s principal submission is that the status quo should be maintained, so far as the capital gains tax, land tax and imputation systems are concerned. We have made some suggestions regarding GST. We welcome the opportunity to discuss this submission in more detail when the opportunity arises. John Collyns Executive Director 30 April 2018

Around 96% of the industry by unit number are RVA members. We welcome the opportunity to comment on the Tax Working Group’s discussion paper “The Future of Tax”. This submission looks at how the retirement village sector contributes to the Four Capitals in the paper, and argues that the sector is actively meeting a range of public policy objectives, contributing to all four capitals, and especially around delivering age-appropriate housing for older people, the long-term provision for residential age care, employment, and combatting potentially serious health issues such as social isolation. The sector’s growth has been partly due to the demand for villages because of the benefits they offer, but also due to a stable and predictable regulatory regime. This includes the current taxation regime, which has been developed in conjunction with Inland Revenue over 15 or more years. The RVA’s principal submission is that the status quo should be maintained, so far as the capital gains tax, land tax and imputation systems are concerned. We have made some suggestions regarding the existing corporate tax regime. Social capital The country will see a significant increase in the population aged over 85 as well as the population over 75. This older group is most likely to need some form of care services, resulting in an increased health bill for the Government. The aged care sector is underfunded and the private sector, through the retirement village sector, is now and will continue to be a significant supplier of aged care beds, reducing the pressure on Government. In considering the tax system and potential changes, the TWG should consider the need for investment in both retirement village accommodation and aged care infrastructure, and consider the tax setting that will encourage this investment. We note that lack of private sector investment will inevitably lead to increased government costs in providing aged care service either within the home or in hospitals and other health facilities. A primary economic driver of housing affordability is supply. The RV industry is a critical supplier of affordable housing which reduces upward pressure on housing prices. Accordingly, any changes to the taxation settings in relation to property should be made with a view to incentivise development rather than deter investment in housing infrastructure. Retirement villages also have an important role to play in reducing social isolation and the attendant negative health impacts. There is no doubt that social isolation presents serious health implications, 3 and this is especially true for older people who may be trapped in their own home and not have any social interaction for days on end. Retirement villages are communities of like-minded people and our residents report a significant improvement in their social and physical life after they’ve moved in. Natural capital Retirement village operators are building eco-sustainable developments that comply with 6 or more Homestar standards. Villages are also highly efficient users of scarce land, with up to three dwellings occupying the land area of a conventional home. Human capital On-going employment from the day-to-day operations of retirement villages is approximately 19,000 people, which includes both full and part-time employees. This ranks 25 out of the 42 sectors in Statistics New Zealand’s Business Operations Survey 2016 (in terms of employee count). It is comparable with the real estate industry, or arts and recreation. 1 Salary information collected through PwC’s survey of retirement villages indicates that in 2017 almost $840 million was paid by the retirement villages to full and part-time employees across New Zealand. This has increased steadily each year since 2013 when $513 m was paid in salaries. Retirement villages also support employment during the construction of new villages.

They cover a broad spectrum of construction-related tasks, which includes construction managers, designers, architects, engineers, builders, quantity surveyors, electricians, plumbers, labourers, heavy/civil labourers, painters, decorators, and landscapers. PwC’s analysis shows that every million dollars spent on retirement village construction supports the employment of 4.0 FTEs in construction and related industries. Once the indirect impacts are included, then every million dollars spent on construction supports the employment of 10.0 FTEs. Financial / Physical capital In 2017, day-to-day operations in the retirement village sector added around $1.1b to New Zealand’s GDP, accounting for roughly 0.4% of national GDP. This is approximately equivalent to the value-add from department stores, or the motor vehicle retailing industry in 2016. Economic activities supported by day-to-day operations of the industry include village management, administration, operations, marketing/advertising, maintenance and repairs, renovations, back office support, amongst other roles.

After including indirect impacts, value-added from construction activity and upstream impacts contributed a total of approximately $480m to New Zealand. 1 Information from the PwC report into the retirement village’s economic contribution to the economy, which will be released later this year. 4 Support for the existing corporate tax structure The current imputation system should be retained as in addition to reducing double taxation, the current system also ensures amounts which are untaxed at the company level are appropriately taxed when distributed to the shareholders. 5 SUBMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF TAX – SUBMISSIONS BACKGROUND PAPER 1. What is the RVA? The Retirement Villages Association represents the interests of the owners, developers and managers of registered retirement villages throughout NZ. Our 350 member villages operate some 31,000 villas, apartments and serviced apartments that are home to approximately 40,400 older New Zealanders. In 2017 the sector built 1,633 units (a rate of 32/week) and around 50 new residents moved in each week. 12.6% of the +75 population choose to live in a retirement village, and this penetration rate has increased steadily from around 9% six years ago. 2 Our membership is divided between the five listed companies plus Bupa Care Services’ 165 villages (18,430 units), 120 independently-owned villages (7,423 units) and 63 not-for-profit villages (3,692 units). This represents around 96% of the sector by unit number. The RVA welcomes the opportunity to contribute to the Tax Working Group’s discussion paper, with a particular focus on section 2, dealing with the changing demographics and the ageing population, and the various challenges that presents. 2. The Retirement Village regulatory regime The sector’s regulatory regime has been in operation fully since 2009, when the reworked Code of Practice became effective. The Code has been amended significantly twice since that time; to improve the insurance and replacement provisions following the Christchurch earthquakes and to upgrade the complaints and disputes process last year. New Zealand’s regulatory regime for retirement villages (RV) consists of nine key elements:  An explicit description of a “retirement village”;  The requirement to register each new village with the Registrar of Retirement Villages;  A memorial on the land that prevents it from being operated as anything other than a RV;  A statutory supervisor to oversee residents’ interests;  Regulations stipulate what must be in the Disclosure Statement and Occupation Rights Agreement (ORA);  Residents must receive legal advice before signing their contracts;  Code of Residents’ Rights and Code of Practice protects resident rights and interests;  The monitoring reviews undertaken by the CFFC keep the regime current;  An effective legislative complaints and disputes resolution scheme exists. Underpinning this approach is the understanding that residents do not, in the majority of cases, actually own the bricks and mortar of their RV homes; rather, they have a contractual right to live 2 Jones Lang LaSalle RV White Paper, November 2017 6 there and enjoy the village’s amenities for as long as they want to or are able to live independently. This point is developed in section 3 of this paper. If the operator’s circumstances change, for example, if the village is sold, the residents’ rights continue unchanged under the new ownership. The extensive consumer protection means that incoming residents are well-informed about what they have access to, what the operator’s responsibilities are, and how the village’s financial arrangements are managed. It also demonstrates a commitment by the Government to ensuring the industry is well-managed and residents’ interests are effectively protected. The RVA has argued that our regulatory regime is “world-leading” and we evidenced this by the many requests from around the world (including Australia and the United Kingdom) for assistance in developing other jurisdictions’ regimes for their newly-expanding retirement village industry. The “world-leading” claim was reinforced by a report commissioned recently by the UK industry’s sector peak body Associated Retirement Community Operators (ARCO) and produced by the International Longevity Centre – UK, an independent non-partisan research organisation looking at longevity, ageing and population change. This report said “Perhaps the strongest example of legislation specific to this sector \[retirement villages\] comes from New Zealand, where the RV Act was passed in 2003.” The report noted “The NZ model incorporates a range of innovative elements that outline the requirements for operators and offer extensive consumer protection”. 3 We stress that the sector’s undoubted success is underpinned by a comprehensive and credible regulatory regime that is well-understood and accepted by residents and operators alike. It allows operators and financiers to develop villages in confidence that the regime is robust, stable, and mature. We would strongly argue against any significant changes to the taxation regime that might undermine that level of confidence. 3. The business model The principal business model in the NZ regime is the “licence to occupy” model. Residents pay a capital sum to the operator to enjoy an unrestricted right to live in their unit and enjoy access to a range of community amenities such as the bowling green, café, cinema, gym, lounge, library, swimming pool amongst others. The initial capital sum is based on around 75% of the average freehold property value in the area. This allows a resident to release equity in their family home to add to their retirement savings, often resulting in a significant improvement in their quality of life, and at the same time, releasing another home for another family to enjoy. Residents then live in the village for as long as they want to or are able to, and when they move out the unit is refurbished and the occupation right (the contract between the operator and the resident, or ORA) is then made available to another resident. Once the operator has received the next payment, between 70 and 80% of the original capital sum is repaid to the outgoing resident or their estate. 3 Beach, B : Stronger Foundations: International Lessons for the Housing-with-Care Sector in the UK, 2018, p.12 7 The balance, between 20 and 30%, is referred to as the Deferred Management Fee (DMF) and is used by the operator to meet the costs of providing the range of community assets the resident has enjoyed during their life in the village. It’s an “enjoy now, pay later” model. Residents have confidence in paying a capital sum because their investment is protected by the Retirement Villages Act and related regulations, and know almost to the last dollar how much they will get back when they leave. Their rights are enshrined in the ORA and enforced by contract law, and thereby, risks and uncertainly are avoided. Village operators are also responsible for all maintenance in the village, which can be substantial. For example, a listed RV operator recently provided guidance to the market that they have a $44 million liability for remedial costs to ensure the integrity and quality of their villages for the residents’ benefit. As a result, residents are not liable for the structural repairs and maintenance that they would be responsible for in their own homes. Issues facing domestic homeowners around “leaky buildings” is a good example of this. It’s important to stress that any increase in the market value of the ORA between residents is not retained in the long term by the operator, but is repaid to the exiting resident from the next incoming resident’s capital payment, less the DMF. Because the ownership of the unit never changes hands there is no capital gain earnt by the operator from unit sales. Diagram 1 below illustrates the point. Around 95% of the RVA’s members’ village units are under the LTO model. The balance are held under a unit title tenure. 8 4. The Four Capitals The Association notes the TWG’s emphasis on the “Four Capitals” – Natural Capital, Social Capital, Human Capital, and Financial / Physical Capital. We understand the proposal that intergenerational wellbeing relies on the growth, distribution and sustainability of these four Capitals. We believe that the retirement village sector makes a direct contribution to each, and the balance of this submission links our work and outputs with the four Capitals. SOCIAL CAPITAL 5. Impacts on an ageing population Statistics New Zealand predicts that the population of New Zealanders who are in the 75+ age group will grow from 6% of the total population in 2016 (295,000 people) to 10% of the total population by 2033 (586,000 people), which means the demand for retirement villages is likely to grow substantially over the coming years. The rate of growth in retirement village units is forecast to outpace this growth in the 75+ age group through to 2026 (the end of the analysis period). This will be important to support the forecast growth in demand for retirement villages, as more people choose retirement village living. Penetration rates (i.e. the percentage of 75+ year olds choosing to live in a retirement village) have been consistently increasing year-on-year since 2012. 4 Diagram 2 – retirement village penetration rate (market share). The country will see a significant increase in the population aged over 85 as well as the population over 75. This older group is most likely to need some form of care services resulting in an increased health bill for the Government. The aged care sector is underfunded and the private sector, through the retirement village sector, is now and will continue to be a significant supplier of aged care beds, reducing the pressure on Government. Of the 30,000 or so units, 25,000 are available as independent living and the balance, around 5,000 units, are occupied as “serviced apartments” in residential care facilities. Serviced apartments are designed to allow an older person who expects to need a higher level of care to purchase an ORA 4 Data from Jones Lang LaSalle, RV White paper 2017; 2017 data from RVA 0 5 10 15 201220132014201520162017 Penetration rate Penetration rate 9 and receive that care in more comfortable surroundings than the standard 11m 2 rest home room. Serviced apartments for which an ORA exists are covered by the RV Act, Code of Practice and related regulations. They allow residents to contribute towards the cost of their care without the need for additional government financial assistance via the Aged Residential Care subsidy. This is important because the country’s demographics demand more care rooms that will not be affordable, unless the resident contributes to their capital cost. Government and TWG have recognised that New Zealand has an aging population. As such, there is a growing need for investment in infrastructure to provide the required aged care services to this growing demographic. The “continuum of care” model adopted by many retirement villages increasingly incorporates aged care facilities into their business model, which provides the required aged care services within the village if greater levels of assistance are required. These include peace of mind with on-call medical assistance and support services provided under contract from DHBs. Reports indicate a shortfall of aged care beds within the next four years. In addition, analysis suggests the private sector will provide around 40% of rest home beds needed over the next 10 years. However, stand-alone rest home operators are struggling to stay in business and the commercially sustainable operations tend to be for aged care linked to a retirement village operation. As approximately 74% of retirement villages include an aged care facility, the retirement village sector will be critical in providing the aged care beds necessary for the demographic changes (193% growth in over 75s). Furthermore, with the aging population, there will be an increasing amount of Government funding required for care services and home-based support. A benefit of integrated retirement villages is that care services can be provided more efficiently compared with aged care services provided to elderly people living at home. In considering the tax system and potential changes, the TWG should consider the need for investment in both retirement village accommodation and aged care infrastructure, and consider the tax setting that will encourage this investment. We note that lack of private sector investment will inevitably lead to increased government costs in providing aged care service either within the home or in hospitals and other health facilities. 6. The sector’s contribution to providing affordable housing A primary economic driver of housing affordability is supply. The RV industry is a significant supplier of affordable housing which reduces upward pressure on housing prices. Accordingly, any changes to the taxation settings in relation to property should be made with a view to incentivise development rather than deter investment in housing infrastructure. Generally, a retirement village unit will be priced at about 75 - 80% of the average local residential house price, but in some of the very high-value areas in Auckland, it can be much lower, around 50% to 60 % of what residents sold their house for. This means that there’s a buffer before a fall in house prices impacts on retirement village ORA prices. Operators are reporting that they haven't seen material impacts on ORA prices, which is an important market protection against a dramatic price fall in residential prices. 10 The Government’s desire to build 100,000 new homes across the country is well-understood, and the retirement village sector is part of the solution. Table 1 shows the number of new units built across New Zealand over the last six years. 5 Year to 31 December Villages Units Estimated residents Penetration rate 75+ 2012 343 21,815 24,650 9.4% 2013 351 24,148 27,290 10.5% 2014 363 25,272 32,850 12.0% 2015 376 26,307 34,200 12.1% 2016 383 28,168 36,618 12.4% Nov 2017 401 29,801 6 38,750 12.6% Over the last six years the sector has built almost 8,000 units. Each new unit releases a family home back onto the market for a new family to purchase, renovate, and enjoy. The steady increase in resident numbers means the sector is now part of the mainstream housing options for older people. We appreciate that villages will not suit everyone, but we are pleased to note that not only is the number of 75 year olds in the population growing, but our market share is also steadily increasing, as diagram 2 shows. On average, a village’s resale rate is around 10% of the available units annually. This means that in addition to the new builds noted above, a mature village with 250 units would add the equivalent of 25 new homes to the local market as new residents sell their family homes and move in. With an existing unit stock of 30,000 units, the average turnover rate means that there are 3,000 homes released back into the market. A soon-to-be released report commissioned by the RVA from PwC shows that the retirement village sector has been building units at a faster rate than the general level of housing stock growth (see diagram 3, below). Since 2009 new private dwellings have been growing at around 1% (or slightly below) annually, while retirement village units have been growing at between 3.5% (2010) and slightly below 8% (2015 and 2016). 5 Jones Lang LaSalle, NZ Retirement Village White Paper, February 2017, p.15 6 CBRE, NZ Retirement Village Capital Value Estimate, October 2017 and extrapolations and Jones Lang LaSalle 2018 White Paper preview 11 Diagram 3 : Percentage growth in retirement village units vs percentage growth in residential dwellings (2009 – 2016) The demand is driven by six key influencers:  The ageing population aged 75+ will increase from around 6% of the general population in 2013 to 14% by 2043, which means that if the penetration rate remains constant, there will continue to be a significant demand for new village stock;  The relatively low-risk nature of the asset class means that developers enjoy good access to capital;  Lifestyle preferences means that older people want to realise the built-up equity in their homes and use it while they still can, while living in a secure, safe, age-appropriate environment;  Villages provide a pathway to care if that’s needed. 73% of retirement villages have an aged residential care facility on or near the campus;  The community of like minds means that the scourge of social isolation is minimised. 66% of our residents report an improved social life after moving in;  The regulatory regime is well-understood and accepted by all parties, and many City and District Councils are easing the paths to build new villages. Reference to the housing stock impact has already been made in this paper, and we stress that the sector’s contribution is both substantial and nationally-focused. Auckland, Canterbury, the Bay of Plenty and the Waikato have seen the greatest increases in RV housing stock over the last nine years (between 51% and 60%), the country as a whole has experienced a 53% increase in RV homes since 2008. The development pipeline (i.e. units either planned, in the consent process or under construction) includes around 16,000 units across the country, which is a six to eight year horizon. By 2028 we 12 expect the industry to have grown to almost 52,500 units if this development pipeline becomes a reality. 7. The sector’s contribution to combatting social isolation There is no question that some older New Zealanders experience isolation and loneliness. This isolation and loneliness is known to have a strong relationship with poor mental and physical health outcomes for these people. This is especially true for those older people who are living in regional or remote parts of New Zealand, or who may be living some distance from their families. Retirement villages bring older people together. Villages often have shared facilities and other opportunity for interaction with peers. In doing so, they reduce the isolation and loneliness that would otherwise be felt by some of these people, thereby potentially preventing some of the negative physical and mental well-being impacts that would otherwise be experienced. Research has found that three of the most common social advantages older people expect from transitioning into retirement village living are:  greater opportunities for keeping active  being around people the same age  a better social life. 7 Other research has found that the aged care environment can provide older people who are physically frail but cognitively intact with a better life than when they were living in their own homes. A study of residents in retirement villages confirmed what many people have long- suspected: living in a community where you can chat with friends, pursue hobbies and have a support network around you makes you happier and may even help you live longer. 8 The factors have a positive impact on the country’s health budget. NATURAL CAPITAL 8. Eco-sustainable design and building Some retirement village operators are aware of an increasing market demand for eco-sustainable developments and ensure their villages comply with these standards. For example, Metlifecare’s village The Orchards in Auckland is one of the first – if not the first – retirement villages in NZ to achieve a 6-Homestar Design rating, which recognises a higher level of efficiency and sustainability that most NZ homes. 7 Massey University, A study of the ageing in Aotearoa. 2014. Available online at: https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/fms/Colleges/College%20of%20Humanities%20and%20Social%20Sciences/ Psychology/HART/publications/reports/ICC\_Summary\_Report\_2014.pdf?CC3F1B9AE2CE105B8A36E3DE735C7 D81 accessed 20.11.17 8 Whiteley Village study: Cass Business School, Faculty of Actuarial Science and Insurance, City, University of London 13 Key features in this rating include double glazing, energy-efficient heat pumps, LED lighting, rainwater harvesting, solar water heating, thermal insulation to a high level, water-efficient fittings throughout the village. Others, such as Kerikeri Retirement Trust, have invested in a fleet of electric cars that will be available for their residents’ use, thereby allowing them to replace their conventional petrol vehicle with a sustainable one. Retirement village developments 9 can result in improved land use intensity and a higher housing density compared with other types of housing development. This is particularly true for mid to large- sized Auckland-based villages. These villages have a unit density of 1 per 164 m 2 (villages throughout the rest of NZ have an average density of 1 unit per 273 m 2 ). This compares favourably with the density in the Auckland Unitary Plan single house zone of 1 dwelling per 600 m 2 , through to 1 dwelling per 250-300 m 2 in the mixed housing urban zone. The objective of the Unitary Plan is to achieve high-density urban living that increase housing capacity. Retirement village developments deliver on this objective. HUMAN CAPITAL 9. The sector’s contribution to employment On-going employment from the day-to-day operations of retirement villages is approximately 19,000 people, which includes both full and part-time employees. This ranks 25 out of the 42 sectors in Statistics New Zealand’s Business Operations Survey 2016 (in terms of employee count). It is comparable with the real estate industry, or arts and recreation. 10 Salary information collected through PwC’s survey of retirement villages indicates that in 2017 almost $840 million was paid by the retirement villages to full and part time employees across New Zealand. This has increased steadily each year since 2013 when $513 m was paid in salaries. Retirement villages also support employment during the construction of new villages. These jobs are predominantly locally-based, which offer employment opportunities for local residents. They cover a broad spectrum of construction-related tasks, which includes construction managers, designers, architects, engineers, builders, quantity surveyors, electricians, plumbers, labourers, heavy/civil labourers, painters, decorators, and landscapers. PwC’s analysis shows that every million dollars spent on retirement village construction supports the employment of 4.0 FTEs in construction and related industries. Once the indirect impacts are included, then every million dollars spent on construction supports the employment of 10.0 FTEs. 9 Data in this section comes from the PwC report commissioned by the RVA “Retirement Village Contribution to housing, employment and GDP in New Zealand”, March 2018, p. 16-18 10 Information from the PwC report into the retirement village’s economic contribution to the economy, which will be released later this year. 14 Based on a total retirement industry construction spend of approximately $620 million in 2017, PwC estimates that approximately 2,300 FTEs were supported in construction and related industries. After including indirect impacts, a total of 5,700 FTEs are supported by building new villages each year and their supply chain impacts. Our analysis also shows that the construction a retirement village of size 250 units directly supports the employment of 303 FTE, made up of :  44 engineers, quantity surveyors, architects, and other technical and business professionals  230 builders and other tradesmen, building managers, suppliers of building materials, and those involved in land subdivision and site preparation  15 heavy labourers delivering civil works including site drainage and road construction  14 people working in furniture, fittings, and equipment retailing and installation. As indicated above, the forecast annual build of retirement village units is approximately 1,900 units per annum over the next 7-8 years. For every 100 retirement village units, on average, there are 64 people employed to support the retirement villages’ operations. There are approximately 14,700 retirement village units in the pipeline, creating over 9,500 new jobs over that timeframe. By 2023, approximately 29,000 people will be directly employed by retirement villages in New Zealand to support their day-to-day operations, as the following table shows: FINANCIAL / PHYSICAL CAPITAL 10. The sector’s contribution to GDP In 2017, day-to-day operations in the retirement village sector added around $1.1b to New Zealand’s GDP, accounting for roughly 0.4% of national GDP. This is approximately equivalent to the value-add from department stores, or the motor vehicle retailing industry in 2016. Economic activities supported by day-to-day operations of the industry include village management, administration, 15 operations, marketing/advertising, maintenance and repairs, renovations, back office support, amongst other roles. The industry has grown rapidly over the last few years. Between 2013 and 2017, the industry’s value added has grown by just under two and a half times (in nominal terms). PwC has estimated the total spend on retirement village construction across various types of retirement village development, based on data provided by RVA members who are also developing new villages. The average cost of construction of seven retirement village case studies ranged between $28m and $114m, and the size of the developments ranged between 69 units and 418 units. Extrapolating from PwC’s seven case studies to the total retirement village development pipeline gives a total retirement village construction spend in 2017 of approximately $620 million. In 2016, the total value of gross fixed capital formation in the residential building industry was approximately $20 billion (the equivalent value for the total construction industry is $34 billion when non-residential building and infrastructure are included). Assuming a similar level in 2017, the spend on the retirement village construction above represents 3.1% of the total fixed capital formation in the residential building industry in 2017 (or 1.8% in the total construction industry). PwC also estimated the value-added impact of retirement village construction. Value-added differs from expenditure (or gross output) as it considers the cost of intermediate inputs. They used the seven retirement village development project case studies and value-added multiplier tables from Butcher Partners. For every million dollars spent on retirement village construction in 2017, the contribution to direct value added was $262,000. After including indirect impacts, value-added from construction was equivalent to $773,000 per million of construction spend. In 2017, overall retirement village construction directly contributed approximately $162m to New Zealand. After including indirect impacts, value-added from construction activity and upstream impacts contributed a total of approximately $480m to New Zealand. 16 THE CURRENT TAX SYSTEM 11. Support for existing corporate tax structure The current imputation system should be retained as in addition to reducing double taxation, the current system also ensures amounts which are untaxed at the company level are appropriately taxed when distributed to the shareholders. In many situations, companies may have net profits in a particular period for financial reporting purposes, but a reduced income tax liability at the company level in that same period. Common examples of this situation arise when companies have brought forward losses from earlier income years, amounts are classified as revenue under the accounting standards which are not income for tax purposes or there are timing differences between when revenue arises for accounting purposes and when that revenue is subject to income tax. Due to the legal nature of the arrangements between retirement village operators and residents, many operators in retirement village industry experience differences between the level of accounting profit and taxable income resulting in lower income tax liabilities. Despite the differences that arise at the company level between the accounting profit and the payment of income tax, the existing imputation system and its interaction with the resident withholding tax (“RWT”) and Non-resident withholding tax (“NRWT”) regimes ensure that an appropriate amount of tax is paid on the underlying profits. Specifically, where a company is not in a tax paying position and has no imputation credits to attach to its dividends, those dividends (in most instances) will be subject to RWT or NRWT. The overall effect is that the company tax rate is in effect a withholding tax and the final tax is collected on the accounting profits when it is distributed to the shareholder. To the extent no dividends are paid and the profits are undistributed, these profits are re-invested into the operations of the company which will increase dividends in the future. The imputation system therefore provides an appropriate mechanism to ensure differences in the accounting profit and taxable income are subject to income tax. For this reason, we submit that the current imputation system should be retained. 12. Conclusions We are delighted to have the opportunity to comment on the TWG’s discussion paper on the future of tax in New Zealand. This submission shows that the retirement village sector is making major contributions to alleviating serious public policy concerns around housing supply, especially age- appropriate housing for older people, the long-term provision for residential age care, employment, and combatting potentially serious health issues such as social isolation. The sector’s growth has been partly due to the demand for villages because of the benefits they offer, but also due to a stable and predictable regulatory regime. This includes the current taxation regime, which has been developed in conjunction with Inland Revenue over 15 or more years. 17 The RVA’s principal submission is that the status quo should be maintained, so far as the capital gains tax, land tax and imputation systems are concerned. We have made some suggestions regarding GST. We welcome the opportunity to discuss this submission in more detail when the opportunity arises. John Collyns Executive Director 30 April 2018
Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submission to the Tax Working Group Jan Rivers, as a Trustee of the ​Scoop Foundation​, along with John Pennington and Simon 1 Wright, as Partners of ​PEP​, have prepared this submission, which is based on the findings of 2 Scoop's HiveMind public engagement process called ​Fair Enough? How should New 3 Zealanders be taxed? 4 We believe that an issue as important as the fairness of the tax regime should be open for discussion, debate and dialogue by all New Zealanders. Unfortunately, a written submission process doesn’t encourage the kind of public exchange we think is necessary in a well-functioning democracy. We decided on Friday 13 April, to provide an alternative way for New Zealanders to engage with the tax review. The Tax HiveMind was launched on Monday 16 April, 2 weeks before the Tax Working Group’s submission process was due to close. By providing a space for citizens to collectively explore and help shape public policy, the HiveMind was both a contribution towards strengthening our democracy and a pilot for a new model of interactive public-interest media based on 2-way communication. Judging by the levels of participation, we believe there is a lot of interest in both the issue of tax and in being actively involved in the review process. Scoop and PEP have been developing the ‘HiveMind’ public engagement process since 2016 and it has been used to host discussions on policy issues such as sugar and public health, housing affordability, water quality, medical cannabis and whether there should be a universal basic income. In the 2 weeks that the Tax HiveMind was open, 335 people agreed, disagreed or passed on statements about tax, casting over 17,000 votes. In addition to this, 55 people added 107 statements for other participants to consider and vote on. These levels of participation top previous efforts and we have no doubt that many more people would have participated if the HiveMind had been open for longer and if we had had the resources to promote it more widely. Structure of this submission This submission is structured as follows: ●HiveMind findings that correspond to the TWG’s questions ●The Tax HiveMind process ●Findings of Tax HiveMind ●Recommendations 1 ​https://foundation.scoop.co.nz 2 Public Engagement Projects, ​https://pep.org.nz 3 ​http://info.scoop.co.nz/HiveMind 4 ​http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1804/S00054/fair-enough-how-should-new-zealanders-be-taxed.htm?5 HiveMind findings that correspond to the TWG’s questions What does the future of tax look like to you? Does a broad-based, low-rate system remain fit-for-purpose and is there a case for broadening the base further with new taxes such as a comprehensive capital gains tax (excluding the family home)? The majority of people who took part in the Tax HiveMind believe that the current broad-based, low-rate system is exacerbating inequality, not meeting current demands for public services or that it will meet significant future challenges such as those posed by the introduction of new technologies, climate change and an aging population. 92% of respondents believe that tax isn’t a weapon politicians use against the economy, it’s what we use to pool our resources and secure the things we need: schools, hospitals, homes and more. In order to meet these challenges, the majority of respondents agree that the total tax take needs to increase to adequately fund public services such as health and education. The failure to tax wealth is seen by many as the most glaring hole in NZ’s tax system and some form of capital gains tax is supported by over 45% of participants. Participants believe that New Zealand’s current tax settings have encouraged property speculation, which has contributed to making housing unaffordable for many New Zealanders. There was also significant support for some form of pollution or environmental taxation, including taxes on tourists and taxes which change detrimental behaviours such as traffic congestion and sugar consumption. 77% of respondents believe that business innovation and new technologies mean that workers will be out of work more often and will need to retrain. This will reduce revenue from income tax. New ways of supporting these workers will need to be found (e.g. a universal basic income) and paid for. 53% of respondents think that a Tobin tax on financial transactions should be introduced to discourage international speculation. What is the purpose of tax? Inequality ●76% thought that the most glaring hole in New Zealand’s tax system from a fairness point-of-view is the failure to tax wealth, except for the very minimal tax on houses sold within 2 years of purchase ●72% thought that, apart from Working for Families, changes to the tax system have tended to unfairly favour wealthy people at the expense of low and middle-income earners ●80% thought that New Zealand’s current tax settings have contributed to growing income, wealth and social inequalities ●83% of participants believe that our tax system should ensure wealth does not become concentrated and warp our society. The tax system should do more to incentivise certain behaviours ●68% agreed that taxes should be used to change behaviours ●71% agreed that excise tax on cigarettes has helped reduce smoking. Similar taxes should be considered on other issues such as sugar consumption, pollution and traffic congestion ●69% of people agreed that as tourism burdens NZ’s environment and essential infrastructure (roads, sewerage, water, health etc.) an entry tax should be levied on non-New Zealand citizens ●71% agreed that we need more eco taxes to encourage better ecologically beneficial behaviours ●87% of participants believe that there should be a gradual pollution tax for business to provide funds for cleaning up and to discourage pollution. Are we taxing the right things? ●51% of participants thought that New Zealand should reintroduce wealth taxes (e.g. death and gift duties) to make the tax system fairer and more progressive ●76% of participants thought that churches must pay tax so that companies such as Sanitarium cannot use church exemptions to undermine other businesses and create inequality. Globalisation ●95% of people believe that we should be following countries like Australia and the UK in ensuring multinationals pay their fair share of tax in New Zealand, where people are using their services. Can tax make housing more affordable? ●84% of respondents believe that New Zealand’s current tax settings have encouraged property speculation which has contributed to housing unaffordability for many New Zealanders ●44% thought that a capital gains tax, if implemented, should only be incurred at the point of sale of a property ●46% thought that a capital gains tax should be treated differently for housing, investments and business assets. What tax issues matter most to you? Should GST be on everything? ●60% of participants believe that the GST rate should be reduced, as GST is a regressive tax that impacts low income families most ●59% of participants support the removal of GST from basic food, as it is seen as a regressive tax that hits the poor the hardest. The Tax HiveMind process The Tax HiveMind was entitled ​Fair Enough? How should New Zealanders be taxed?​ and was launched on Monday 16 April. The Tax HiveMind webpage invited New Zealanders to explore tax issues and proposals with other New Zealanders. It explained the rationale for the HiveMind and that the results would be submitted to the TWG as a submission. Instructions about how to participate were set out. Supporting information was also provided. This was based on the TWG’s discussion document and its fact sheets. Outreach To attract participants, the Tax HiveMind webpage was displayed prominently on the Scoop website for 2 weeks. Advertisements encouraging participation were also placed across the Scoop website, including articles and press releases that were related to the TWG’s review. People in Scoop’s Facebook and Twitter communities were informed. Individuals and organisations with a range of perspectives were identified and invited to take part via email, phone calls and social networks. These people were also asked to inform their networks about the Tax HiveMind. The digital platform Scoop’s HiveMind is powered by ​Pol.is​, a new type of interactive survey technology that allows participants to consider statements about an issue, add their own statements for others to vote on, and to see how their opinions fit with other people’s views. Pol.is analyses voting patterns and groups participants based on 2 criteria: 1.Participants who tended to vote similarly on multiple statements are grouped together as an opinion group 2.Each group of participants who voted similarly will have also voted distinctly differently from people in other groups. The resultant opinion groups are presented to participants as they participate. The visualisation highlights both areas of agreement and difference in real-time. Unlike in standard surveys, participants are encouraged to return to Pol.is regularly over several weeks to review emerging patterns, vote on new statements and add their own ideas, perspectives and proposals for all other participants to consider. These features promote greater learning and ownership amongst participants. Pol.is is one of the promising new digital platforms designed to enable mass public participation and has been used by a number of governments (e.g. Taiwan, Canada) and by major organisations (e.g. Columbia University). In Taiwan, Pol.is has been used as a major part of the policy development process for at least 6 laws. Seed statements 41 ‘seed’ statements, including 15 ‘metadata’ statements designed to collect information about the participants, were prepared by the Tax HiveMind project team to give early participants some statements to vote on at the start of the HiveMind. The seed statements about tax reflected a range of well-known perspectives. Findings of Tax HiveMind Select findings of the Tax HiveMind are set out below. A full and interactive report is available by clicking ​here​. The Pol.is report provides a range of different views on the data and we 5 recommend that TWG members use it to further explore participant opinions. 5 ​https://preprod.pol.is/report/r45ru4zfmutun54ttskne Who participated? The vast majority of the 335 people who participated provided information about themselves by responding to the 15 demographic statements. Their responses show that a diverse group of New Zealanders took part in the Tax HiveMind. ●17% were 30 years old or younger, 49% were between 30 and 55, and 35% were 55 or older ●62% lived in major cities, 37% in towns or small cities, and 16% in rural areas ●22% had household incomes of $50,000 per year or less, 31% between $50,000 and $100,000, 28% between $100,000 and $150,000, and 21% above $150,000 ●65% owned property ●21% owned businesses ●26% were self-employed ●10% were unemployed ●For 12%, high school qualifications were their highest. Opinion Groups Of the 335 people who voted on statements, 295 voted enough times for their voting patterns to be analysed and two opinion groups emerged. Of the 245 participants who formed Opinion Group A: ●84% agreed that apart from Working For Families, changes to the tax system have tended to unfairly favour wealthy people at the expense of low and middle income earners ●80% believed that taxes should be used to change behaviours ●93% did not agree that Government is inefficient ●92% did not agree that New Zealanders are over-taxed ●86% did not agree that lowering taxes would help improve the economy. Of the 50 participants who formed Opinion Group B: ●82% agreed that New Zealanders are over-taxed ●77% did not believe that taxes should be used to change behaviours ●77% agreed that lowering taxes helps to create the right incentives for people to invest and work hard ●65% believed that Government is inefficient ●69% did not believe that changes to the tax system have tended to unfairly favour wealthy people at the expense of low and middle income earners. See the ‘Graph’ section in the ​Pol.is report​ to review the association of all statements with opinion groups and with individual participants. To do this, make sure the ‘Participants (bucketized)’ button and the ‘Group outline’ button are selected. Compared with people in Opinion Group A, more people in Opinion Group B tended to: ●Be aged between 30 and 55 years old ●Have a high school qualification as their highest qualification ●Live in rural areas ●Own property or a business or be self-employed ●Have a household income of over $150,000 per year. Compared with people in Opinion Group B, more people in Opinion Group A tended to: ●Live in a major city ●Be unemployed ●Have a household income of between $100,000 and $150,000 per year. See the ‘Metadata’ section presented in the ​Pol.is report​ to review the demographic breakdown of all participants across all categories. Areas of Strong Agreement Across Opinion Groups To see all statements listed from greatest-to-least levels of agreement across the opinion groups, see the ‘All statements’ section in the ​Pol.is report​ with ‘Group-informed Consensus’ selected for sorting. The following selection includes only statements that were voted on by at least 100 participants with 60+% agreement or disagreement in each of the opinion group.

Services now done by charities (eg Refuge) would be funded by tax, & Sanitarium etc would pay fair tax ●Company income tax is only 16% of the total tax take. Changes should be made to increase this, particularly from multi-national companies ●There should be a tax-free threshold of $20K. It's an incentive to work, and cuts the bureaucracy of taxing then giving back in benefits ●all taxes should be structured to reduce inequality gradually over a decade or two by including wealth in their assessment ●I am prepared to pay a higher tax rate to improve our public services ●GST on rates should be set at zero. Either that or the Government should pass on to the Councils the GST portion on rates instalments collected ●Successful countries past and present have Government spending at 50 to 60% of GDP. New Zealand is around 30% ●Wealthy individuals and companies have removed money from tax cuts, from our community, rather than re-investing, as Rogernomics promised ●Top tax rates in Australia are over 45%. New Zealand has plenty of room for a tax-free bracket on low incomes and higher taxes on high incomes. Recommendations While we do not claim that the participants in the Tax HiveMind were representative of all New Zealanders, the findings suggest support for the current broad-base, low-rate tax system may not be as strong as supposed. On a topic as vital to the wellbeing of New Zealanders as tax, further research and dialogue with citizens is necessary to determine what changes New Zealanders would consider fair and just. The TWG should therefore seek a wider mandate from the government to do this work.

implementation of social survey research, formative, process and outcome  evaluation, community action research, GIS, Kaupapa Māori research and a number   of qualitative methodologies.   WHO Collaborating Centre   The Research Centre is designated as a WHO Collaborating Centre in Research  and Training in Alcohol and Drug Abuse, one of four WHO Collaborating Centres  in New Zealand. SHORE was re‐designated in 2016.    This submission was prepared by Professor Sally Casswell, PhD, FRSNZ, ONZM, Co‐ director  SHORE & Whariki Research Centre  April, 2018    We have read and support the overall thrust of the submission made by the Department of Public  Health,  University of Otago, Wellington, particularly regarding the need for New Zealand to move  towards social wellbeing being the ‘paramount aim of tax and social policy in order to reduce  inequality,  achieve social justice, and attempt to avert environmental disaster’.   This submission is confined to discussion and recommendation about the use of excise tax on  hazardous products (alcohol, tobacco and sugar) as a contribution to these overall objectives. In the  global health community, there is currently an increased focus on excise tax  on hazardous products  for two purposes: first, to increase health and wellbeing and reduce health inequity and second to  enable funding for financing of prevention and control of non‐communicable diseases (eg heart  disease, cancers) and health services in general.  The use of excise tax has been explored in many  contexts recently including the  Lancet Taskforce on NCDs and Economics (Summers, 2018) and the  Bloomberg Commission on Fiscal Policy for Health (Bloomberg Philanthropies, 2018).   One of the issues thoroughly covered in the research literature is that of regressivity, since this is an  argument frequently raised in opposition to the use of  excise tax on hazardous products. However,    when the health benefits are taken into account these contribute to increasing equity as the adverse  health effects, which are reduced, fall disproportionally on lower socio‐economic people. Equitable  outcomes can also be enhanced by the use to which taxation is put, for example,  increasing health  services to support reductions in consumption and enhanced health services (Summers, 2018) or to  reduce other regressive taxes (Whitehead, 2010).  People generally support excise taxes more if they  believe there will be an improvement in related services (Parry et al., 2017).   The remainder of this brief submission will focus on alcohol  excise tax.   NZ’s alcohol excise tax was reformed in the mid‐1980s. There was a suggestion, supported by the  alcohol industry that alcohol should not be subject to any specific tax. However, as Easton (2005)  says: ‘Fiscal prudence, political realities, and the vigour of the alcohol control lobby resulted in  the  imposition of a excise duty based on the quantity of absolute alcohol, so that wine and beer face the  same tax for the same quantity of absolute alcohol.’ Spirits are taxed at a higher rate reflecting the  lower costs involved in their production resulting in a tax system in which  the price reflects,  approximately, the absolute alcohol in the beverage. A positive aspect of the New Zealand tax  system is that every six months duty levels are automatically increased by the same amount as  consumer prices. This means the government does not have to face criticism by passing legislation  and  it prevents the real value of the taxes falling. However, despite this, affordability of alcohol,  particularly that of wine, was shown to increase 1988 ‐ 2011 (Wall & Casswell, 2013) and again 2012  – 2017 (Health Promotion Agency, 2018) because the increases in price have not kept pace with  increasing incomes. Off  license sales (accounting for more than 70% of alcohol sales) are the  cheapest way to buy alcohol and the HPA report points out it took less time in 2017 than in 1999 to  earn enough to buy an averagely priced drink of beer, whisky or cask wine from a supermarket  or  liquor store.  Wine sold in a cask is the most affordable type of alcohol. In 2017, it took only 2.1  minutes for a person on a median income to earn enough for an averagely priced drink of cask wine.    The issue of alcohol taxation was addressed in the context of  reforming alcohol policy in 2009 ‐10  but no action was taken. The New Zealand Law Commission in their review of alcohol harm in New  Zealand and in the process of deciding on evidence based and effective policy changes  commissioned a review by an Australian consultancy (Marsden Jacobs Associates, 2010). This  was  described as ‘a valuable contribution’ by NZ Treasury who described alcohol excise tax, as a tax with  relatively low welfare losses. The NZ Law Commission recommended a 50% increase in alcohol  excise tax, which would result in a 10% increase in price but this was not implemented by  government.   The  establishment of a Working Group on Taxation in New Zealand provides a new opportunity for  public health voices to enter the debate on the appropriate level of alcohol taxation.   There is strong evidence of the benefits of increased price of alcohol, most commonly achieved by  excise taxes. alcohol taxation has  been proven to be a singularly cost effective way to reduce  consumption and harm (Anderson et al., 2009).   Globally researchers estimate that every 10 percent increase in the price of alcohol decreases  consumption by between four and five percent, the same relationship as found with tobacco   (Wagenaar et al., 2009; U.S. National Cancer Institute and World Health Organization, 2016).     The evidence shows heavy drinkers reduce their drinking (Chaloupka   et al., 2002) and there is a  clear relationship with harm which, in Finland, was found to impact more on people of lower socio‐ economic status (Herttua et al., 2008).  In addition the initiation of drinking/heavy use by younger  people is delayed (Cook, 2012).  In New Zealand evidence shows heavier drinkers (Casswell et al.,  2014) and the heaviest younger drinkers choose lower prices (Wall & Casswell, 2017).   An argument often made (especially by lobbyists on  behalf of the alcohol industry) is that excise  taxes are inappropriate because they will impact on the moderate drinker. In fact, simply because  the ‘moderate drinker’ purchases so much less than the heavier drinker the tax burden falls on the  heavier drinker to a much greater extent. An increase in  excise tax on alcohol might therefore be  seen as increasing fairness to the extent this contributes to the externalities of alcohol use which  otherwise are met by other forms of taxation including those paid by the moderate drinker. The  argument regarding ‘moderate drinkers’ is also influenced by beliefs about health benefits  of  moderate drinking. However, while there is evidence of low levels of consumption reducing ischemic  heart disease low levels also have detrimental effects, for example there is no threshold for breast  cancer (Rehm et al., 2017), and this benefit should not influence policy aiming to reduce harm any  more than  the benefit of reduced Parkinson’s disease from tobacco use (Hernán et al., 2002).   The arguments raised by alcohol industry lobbyist against excise taxation (and other effective  policies) should be interpreted in the light of their conflict of interest. Research evidence, from the  NZ arm of the International Alcohol (IAC) study, showed  that 40% of their sales in New Zealand are  consumed in harmful drinking occasions (based on measure of typical drinking per occasion of 8 plus  drinks for men and 6 plus for women) (Casswell et al., 2016). For this reasons effective policies which  reduce harmful drinking, such as alcohol taxation,  are consistently opposed.   Data from the IAC study has also explored the proportion of the retail price of alcohol which is made  up of excise tax in New Zealand. This is based on the prices paid by New Zealanders (and has been  validated (Casswell, et al., 2014). It showed that less  than 30% of the alcohol retail prices paid was  made up of excise tax (Wall et al., 2017). This can be contrasted with the 70+% of tobacco price  which WHO recommends should be contributed by excise tax and which New Zealand has achieved.   In conclusion it is recommended an increase  in alcohol excise tax of 100% would be appropriate  along with ongoing monitoring of retail prices in case other complementary approaches to control  pricing are required.     References

Spirits New Zealand The Future of Tax ‐ Submission to the Tax Working Group. April 2018 Introduction 1. Spirits New Zealand is the national trade organisation representing New Zealand’s leading producers, distributors, brand owners, importers and exporters of premium spirits and spirit‐based drinks. Our members are Bacardi, Beam Suntory, Brown‐Forman, Diageo, Hancocks, Independent Liquor, Lion, Moet‐Hennessy and Pernod Ricard. In addition we have three associate members who are Lactinol (formerly Anchor Ethanol), EuroVintage and Federal Merchants. 2. Spirits NZ represents over 96% of spirit industry interests in New Zealand. 3. Spirits NZ and its members are very supportive of a review of our current tax system within the remit of the Tax Working Group. A progressive, supportive and distributive tax system is at the core of a healthy functioning economy and society and a broad review of our tax systems functionality, effectiveness and scope is appropriate. 4. Additionally Spirits NZ has always supported well‐evidenced policy and regulatory interventions that support the creation of a moderate drinking culture in New Zealand. We are, therefore, very interested in any discussion that might have implications to our tax system in general but also because of other interests who will claim that increased taxes – particularly excise tax – will have a marked impact on immoderate consumption. 5. While some of my members will make individual submissions on the broader questions posed in the Tax Working Group’s discussion paper – The Future of Tax – this submission will deal specifically with the matter of excise, price and drinking behaviour. In particular we will show that although alcohol excise tax is being applied in recognition of consumption externalities it is not an effective or efficient means of modifying the behaviour of those consumers who drink hazardously and should not be viewed in this way. 6. Please do not hesitate to contact me to discuss anything in this document in more detail. We give permission for this submission to be made available publicly. Robert Brewer Chief Executive Spirits New Zealand Inc \[1\] \[1\] Submission Current Drinking Statistics 7. By way of context we make the following points – a. Per capita alcohol consumption, measured by alcohol available for consumption, has fallen from 9.6 litres of pure alcohol per capita (15 years and older) in 2010 to 8.6 litres at the end of 2017. 1 b. The volume of alcohol available per person aged 18+ (measured by the number of standard drinks) is the third lowest in the last 17 years (after 2015 and 2001), and 8.5 percent below the recent peak of 2010. 1 c. Harmful consumption (total population) for 15 – 24 year olds has fallen from 34.7% in 2006/7 to 26.1%. in 2015/16. 2 d. Harmful consumption (total population) for 45 – 65 year olds has increased for the same time period. 2 e. Consumption of 6+ drinks at least once (monthly) has fallen significantly for all measured age groups since 2006/07 as has 6+ drinks at least once (weekly) for most demographics (45+ have increased but not with statistical significance). 2 f. Approximately 80%, on a total population basis, drink moderately. 3 The Role of Alcohol Excise Tax. 8. In her 2002 Treasury Working Paper, Felicity Barker concluded that an excise tax on alcohol is appropriate given the externalities associated with its consumption. However she goes on to make the point that because of its nature, excise is linear in impact – that is it must be applied uniformly and cannot be meted ‘...across individuals’ 4 . 9. While we agree that the purpose of an indirect tax such as excise is to account for externalities we do not agree, as some might argue, that it is an effective modifier of harmful consumption behaviours. This is because of its linear nature and, by definition, the ‘non‐linear’ nature of consumer behaviour. Excise, Price and Behaviour 10. The drinking statistics listed in paragraph 7 above tell a story of changing drinking behaviour. This is particularly so among younger consumers who are choosing to drink less, less hazardously or not at all than at any other time. 11. This is not a New Zealand‐specific phenomenon but is echoed in most western democratic mature markets. As harmful consumption among younger consumers falls there has, more recently, been a rise in harmful consumption among ‘older’ drinkers as if this cohort or bubble of behaviour is slowly moving through the population. 12. In scaled up terms the data tells us that 80% of us drink moderately and 20% do not. It is therefore reasonable to expect that focus should be on growing the former and reducing the latter. 13. At its core this means trying to change negative consumer behaviours and the social constructs that support them and replace them with more positive ‘moderate’ constructs. Tax Working Group members will be more than aware of the number and range of interventions focusing on this but for more information see www.cheers.org.nz and www.hpa.org.nz. 14. In this context however price, and more specifically price increases, are often proposed as a means of changing consumer behaviour and significantly reducing harmful consumption. And one means cited to increase the price of a unit of alcohol is to significantly increase the level of excise. 15. However it is well documented that the price responsiveness of heavy drinkers is less so than moderate or light drinkers. A metastudy by Wagenaar et al found the price responsiveness among heavy drinkers to be about 60% of the price responsiveness of light drinkers. 5 Wagenaar’s analysis showed heavy drinkers responded to a 10% price increase by reducing consumption by 2.8% whereas average consumption dropped by 4.4% with the same price increase. 16. Byrnes et al found that even Wagenaar’s analysis probably overstates the potential effect because heavier drinkers responded to price increases by curbing their consumption on light‐drinking days to maintain their preferred binge habits – the main cause of harm. 6 17. Additionally, Nelson's metastudy showed that heavy drinking by young adults is particularly difficult to shift through price. 7 18. These and other analyses illustrate the complex interrelationships between price and consumption as it relates to alcohol with the evidence suggesting that the moderate consumer will tend to respond in a more price elastic manner than the heavy consumer – and that the heavy drinker will alter their consumption habit to maintain the binge elements of their lifestyle. 19. Considering that light to moderate consumption is associated with well‐evidenced health benefits – including an extended lifespan on an all‐cause mortality basis ‐ then the implied somewhat perverse impact of unilateral price increases may actually be a negative health outcome. 8‐13 20. It is also relevant to bring the Tax Working Group’s attention that evidence often cited as indicating the effectiveness of taxation policies to reduce harmful drinking is increasingly being challenged by new studies that offer a more nuanced analysis of the complex relationships. Earlier work around the impact of taxation relied largely on aggregate consumption measures, such as per capita consumption and population‐based indicators, obscuring the variations in impact within populations and across drinking patterns. 21. Additionally much of the evidence for taxation as a health policy tool are based on predictive models and projections of outcomes, and are rarely backed by empirical evidence. A large portion of the literature relies on predictive studies of the likely impact of changing taxation and price of alcohol on consumption per capita and other indicators of harm (e.g., road traffic crashes, liver cirrhosis, suicide, violence). 5, 14‐18 22. Lastly, taxation as a policy tool has been well studied mainly in Northern Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand. One of the main insights from such studies is no matter the control policy, effectiveness relies heavily on adequate enforcement. 19,20 Conclusion 23. Increases in alcohol excise tax are often cited as a means to increase price and significantly reduce harmful drinking. 24. Evidence suggests that the relationship between consumption and price is complex. Because of the linear nature of excise the impact of tax increases will have different impacts on different cohorts within a drinking population with light to moderate consumers reducing consumption significantly more than heavy drinkers. 25. Spirits NZ therefore believes that other methods to continue or accelerate the generally improving trend in New Zealand’s drinking habits need to be examined rather than accepting that tax increases will provide a simple benefit in this regard.

Capital Flow of Investments The current tax system puts too much investment emphasis on horticultural/farming and residential property. New Zealand is a fast growing first world country. Growth has been derived from a number of different sources in recent years. Namely, I.T., Financial Services, Tourism, Pharmaceuticals, and niche primary industry value added products, to name a few. The Tax system needs to encourage investment in these areas to facilitate a faster rate of growth and innovation. This can be facilitated through the reduction or removal of tax breaks to specific sectors mentioned above where the effective tax burden is much less than other alternative investments. E.g. residential investment property vs NZ bonds. ‘Kiwi Ingenuity’ is a term that is frequently used in the media. There is no doubt as a country we try to think outside the square to find solutions and have done so for 170 years pioneering many worlds firsts. This view can further facilitate change by encouraging an entrepreneurial way of thinking backed by a fair and equitable tax system. Investment into some sectors such as residential, horticultural and agricultural property is unfairly encouraged due to the taxable income being low and the expected tax free capital gain being high. This creates an uneven playing field with regard to the allocation of investment capital and encourages perverse investment behaviour which lessens the New Zealand's economic resilience to cyclical shocks. The fair and equitable solution is to introduce a capital gains tax to level the playing field whilst at the same time lessening the burden of middle income earnings shouldering the burden of growth 2. KiwiSaver KiwiSaver is the only integrated instrument available to the New Zealand public as a method of retirement planning (excluding NZ Super). For this reason, the focus of this part of our submission will be on improving KiwiSaver from a tax perspective. The NZ public in general is quite apathetic to KiwiSaver. History has seen the Government place less emphasis on it in terms of incentivising investment. The original Member Tax Credit (MTC) has been halved and the $1,000 kick-start payment has been abolished. What has happened in parallel with these changes is that the cost has been placed on the employer in the form of increased contributions. This approach has had added fuel to the public’s view that KiwiSaver is not something to focus on. The strategy on KiwiSaver needs to refocus on its goal towards retirement planning and social responsibility rather then as an investment solution. A simple remedy would be to net off employee contributions to KiwiSaver in a tax return. This would bring NZ in line with many other OECD countries. The objective is to contribute to the Error!

The current system encourages capping contributions at $1,042.86 to avail of all benefits available. Netting off KiwiSaver contributions against gross income incentivises the KiwiSaver member to exceed the contributions limit which benefits the member and society as a whole. The current system taxes a person under the PAYE framework then treats the contribution as an investment (rather than through a retirement lens) and taxes again under the PIR framework. This does not feel right when planning for retirement. Granted, the revenue from tax will decrease but this needs to be viewed in conjunction with creating an environment whereby residents of this country are protected into their retirement. The vast majority of New Zealand residents do not have the relevant experience to make informed decisions about retirement. As Kiwi's continue to live longer at 1.2 years per decade, Tax policy needs to assist in this area and would greatly assist in an evitable transition from universal State sponsored superannuation to the individual.

PO Box 91736, Victoria Street West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Phone 09 302 2972 • www.eds.org.nz Submission to Tax Working Group The Environmental Defence Society welcomes the opportunity to make a submission to the Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax in New Zealand. We think that a fundamental review of the system presents a valuable chance to improve both social and environmental outcomes. Summary The Tax Working Group asked for submissions on issues set out in its paper Future of Tax and, in particular, on solutions to problems that the Group, or submitters, have identified. We address four issues discussed in the Paper and two further issues that were not raised. They are: 1. The destruction of biodiversity and ecosystem services, which has been encouraged by the absence of tax on natural capital depletion, untaxed capital gains achieved by its depletion, and the tax-deductibility of expenses incurred to achieve its destruction; 2. Wealth inequality arising from low taxation on returns from real property relative to other forms of income; 3. Excessive dependence of tax revenues on GST and income and company taxes, given falling company taxes internationally and declining workforce participation; and 4. Funding climate change and superannuation costs. The two further issues that were not addressed are: 5. The need for land use changes 1 necessary to transition the economy towards carbon-neutrality. The difficulties with bringing agriculture into the Emissions Trading Scheme indicate a need to align incentives within the tax system with the goal of substantially reduced net greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. 6. The weak incentives in the current system for primary producers to transition from commodity volume growth (producing more product) to added value production (producing less, higher value product). The reason for this is that (untaxed) environmental inputs are cheap relative to (taxed) labour and other input costs required for adding value. 1 The recent draft report Low Emissions Economy published by the Productivity Commission discusses the land use changes needed for transition toward a low-emissions economy. \[1\] PO Box 91736, Victoria Street West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Phone 09 302 2972 • www.eds.org.nz These issues are addressed throughout the sections that follow. More generally, we encourage a holistic view and use of the tax system. Its primary purpose may be to raise revenue, but it has significant potential to modify behaviour in positive ways. As Future of Tax points out, this has been under-utilised in New Zealand, with some exceptions. The tax system is already being used to discourage drinking and smoking. Those activities are harmful to individuals (in a way, the tax system is seeking to protect people from themselves). But such activities have an impact on society as a whole – they cause a burden on the public health system, and can lead to a variety of negative impacts on people other than the drinker or smoker. We observe that the grounds for taxing environmentally harmful activities are similar. Environmental sustainability should be a consideration that permeates all aspects of the tax system, not just “environmental” taxes. Taxes can have many consequences for environmental well-being, even if they do not directly concern the environment per se. We encourage the Group to keep implications for sustainability at the forefront of its mind when proposing any kind of tax, not just “environmental” taxes. We also observe that early in the Paper, the principle of “efficiency” has been described as minimising impediments to economic growth and avoiding biases in the use of resources. Later in the paper, this is described in a more nuanced way. We think that it is important to recognise, consistently, that an efficient system does not have to be neutral as to the costs and benefits of activities – particularly those using or impacting on public resources (the “environment”). The language of “well-beings” is also preferable to that of “economic growth”. An Environmental Footprint Tax One solution that we think merits further investigation is a form of land tax, set according to the intensity of land use and consequent impact on the environment. This tax would be assessed from satellite imagery. It is not a traditional tax on land per se, and we prefer to call it an “environmental footprint tax”. In order to give effect to the Government’s promise not to tax the family home, the tax would have a threshold, in that it would only be payable by land owners whose environmental footprint exceeds that of a family home. It would normally be paid annually, but could be capitalised and paid from sale proceeds if means-testing shows that an annual payment is unaffordable (for example, retirees). An environmental footprint tax would be intended primarily to pursue environmental outcomes, and implement the polluter/user-pays principle, by: • Reducing incentives to destroy biodiversity and degrade ecosystem services, by internalising at least some of the environmental costs of economic activity; \[1\] PO Box 91736, Victoria Street West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Phone 09 302 2972 www.eds.org.nz • Increasing incentives to sustain biodiversity and ecosystem services, by providing rebate payments for their maintenance. It could also have desirable social outcomes, by: • More fairly and evenly distributing the tax burden across different sources, thereby enabling materially lower income, company and/or consumption taxes. • Mitigating wealth inequality, which in part arises from low taxation on returns from land-based assets relative to other forms of income. An environmental footprint tax would have all the merits of a land tax as described by the 2010 Victoria University Tax Working Group, while being rather more progressive. It might also prove to be among the least disliked of possible tax initiatives due to its: • reasonableness (charging something for environmental impacts – the idea that a polluter or user should pay); • highly progressive nature (the land area owned and the intensity of its use are, with some important exceptions, correlated with wealth); • ability to allow landowners to manage and control their personal tax liabilities via good land use and management actions; • ability to reward people for good actions, not just penalise them for bad ones (rebates for maintenance and enhancement of biodiversity and ecosystem services); • benefits to Maori provided by rebates associated with low-intensity land uses; • potential to complement and fill gaps in the Emissions Trading Scheme (particularly for agricultural activities); • potential to ameliorate some failures of our resource management system (such as positive incentives for land use change); • relatively small compliance or transaction costs for tax payers. An environmental footprint tax would have variable impacts on property values. It would depress the value of large, intensively used properties, while increasing the value of land with low-intensity uses. Thus owners of large and/or intensively developed property are likely to be most detrimentally affected. However, the key result would not be the redistribution of wealth (not all large landowners are wealthy relative to small or non-landowners). Rather, the key result would be the introduction of strong incentives to manage New Zealand’s natural capital in a sustainable manner, and the recognition that we should internalise costs of resource use. A user or polluter should pay unless there is a specific policy decision taken that the rest of society should subsidise the actions of a few. In keeping with the Government’s promise not to tax the family home, we envisage a tax would include an untaxed footprint allowance, equivalent to that of a family home. The tax would apply only to that part of the footprint exceeding \[1\] PO Box 91736, Victoria Street West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Phone 09 302 2972 • www.eds.org.nz this level. In that way, an ordinary family home and adjacent land could be excluded, but not a lifestyle block or farm. The tax levied on a property would be calculated as depth (expressed in dollars) times land area (hectares) in each category summed across the entire property, less the untaxed per-landowner footprint allowance representing the family home. Of course, what constituted a “family home” would need to be defined, but that is a problem of policy detail rather than a conceptual difficulty. For example, an allowance equivalent to 1000m 2 of impervious surface would effectively exempt the family home and some associated land and infrastructure. While we understand that the exclusion of the family home is a core element of the TWG Terms of Reference, we feel that it is important to recognise that this exclusion does compromise the contribution that any tax on land or capital can make to goals for housing affordability, wealth inequality and fair taxation. The remainder of this submission describes the concept of an environmental footprint tax, and its key design features. It concludes with some discussion of its strengths and weaknesses relative to other options under consideration. The case for an environmental footprint tax has been made previously by Stephens et al. (2016) 2 and Brown and Stephens (2017) 3 . However, we emphatically note that research and modelling is needed to adequately understand the impact on policy goals of varying category definitions and tax rates. If the Tax Working Group has a mind to pursue the potential of an environmental footprint tax, then we suggest that this research and modeling should be a high priority. Taxing capital and environmental inputs Products and services delivered by economic activity depend on many inputs. These include financial and built capital, labour (in the broad sense, not only manual labour), and natural capital (the services provided by the environment). A non-distortionary tax system would spread taxation evenly across each of the three categories of inputs and consumption of outputs. However, as explained in Future of Tax, the New Zealand tax system is heavily weighted towards taxing the consumption of outputs (such as GST), labour (i.e. income tax) and company profits (i.e. company tax). There is comparatively little taxation on capital and environmental inputs. This produces distortions. For example, a failure to tax capital encourages the accumulation of the least-taxed forms of capital (such as housing) and hence wealth inequality. A failure to tax environmental inputs to the same degree as 2 Brown, M.A. and R.T.T. Stephens (2017) ‘Big issues, bigger solutions: are bottom lines enough?’ Policy Quarterly 13 (3), pp.40-45. 3 Stephens, R.T.T., S. Greenhalgh, M.A. Brown and A. Daigneault (2016) ‘Enhancing the tax system to halt the decline of nature in New Zealand’, Policy Quarterly, 12 (1), pp.26-34. \[1\] PO Box 91736, Victoria Street West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Phone 09 302 2972 • www.eds.org.nz other inputs promotes high rates of greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and degradation of ecosystem services at the expense of employment. It also leads to an economy weighted towards environmentally intensive commodity volume production (such as milk and hamburger meat) rather than sustainable high-value-added production (such as manuka honey products and eco-tourism). We submit that an environmental footprint tax could reduce these distortions and their harmful effects, particularly if the footprint tax were large enough to enable material reductions of taxes on income, profit and consumption. Environmental footprint Here, we use the term ‘environmental footprint’ to mean a simple measure of the environmental effects derived from how a parcel of land is used. It has two dimensions: 1. land area (in hectares); and 2. footprint depth, which increases with the level of environmental impact typically associated with the land use and land cover. It is represented by increasing tax rates per hectare (in dollars). Footprint depth can be negative, if land provides net environmental benefits (such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity maintenance, provision of ecosystem services). In this case we envisage that a tax rebate would be provided to the landowner. The rebate provides an incentive for landowners to manage land in ways that have positive environmental effects. Table 1 illustrates possible categories of footprint depth, based on land use and land cover characteristics. We expect that these characteristics would be determined largely through remote satellite imagery 4 , supplemented by ground truthing and aerial photography as necessary. The annual environmental footprint tax levied on a property would be depth (expressed in dollars) multiplied by land area (hectares) in each category summed across the entire property, less the untaxed per-landowner footprint allowance (representing the family home). Category 1 in Table 1 shows that the level of environmental impact is greatest for artificially impermeable surfaces (such as paved roads and buildings) that cannot support the most basic of ecosystem services (such as photosynthesis, water purification). Such uses rely on ecosystem services elsewhere to assimilate wastes and other harms produced on-site. Category 2 includes highly disturbed artificial surfaces such as cultivated soil, clear-felled forest, unpaved roads, mines and quarries. These may retain some 4 We note that the resolution and frequency of available satellite imagery are increasing while acquisition cost is falling so that much of it is effectively free. Technologies for automated analysis and categorisation of land cover are also advancing rapidly. \[1\] PO Box 91736, Victoria Street West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Phone 09 302 2972 www.eds.org.nz capacity for photosynthesis and infiltration, but most wastes are not contained on-site, and their export exceeds assimilative capacity leading to pollution and contamination offsite. Category 3 captures intensively grazed pasture, which is a net exporter of nitrogen and greenhouse gas wastes. We associate these ‘deep’ footprint categories with the highest per hectare tax rates. At the opposite end of the scale (categories 9 to 11) would be land with riparian vegetation, native vegetation, and natural water bodies that retain indigenous biodiversity and supply natural ecosystem services. These categories would qualify for a per hectare tax rebate. On some properties, the rebate may be sufficient to more than offset tax liabilities from intensively used parts of the property. \[1\] PO Box 91736, Victoria Street West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Phone 09 302 2972 www.eds.org.nz Table 1: Structure of the proposed environmental footprint tax. Land cover types and associated footprint characteristics are indicative; tax rates are entirely hypothetical; negative values indicate tax rebate rates. The tax system could be ‘single tier’ based on a flat (Tier 1) rate for each category, as shown in the first four columns). Alternatively, it could be a two-tier system with the addition of variable rates (Tier 2 footprint) within the category applied according to defined standards (the two right hand columns). Provision for the tax free family home and associated land could be achieved simply by waiving the first $5000 of tax liability, this representing a house and paved area of 1000 square metres – a substantial family home.

Under the single-tier system, there would be a single tax rate for each category. Land categorisation would be exclusively the role of the tax authority and there would be no transaction costs to the landowner (although there could be a degree of consultation). Under a two-tier system, there could be multiple tax rates per category. The default setting would be the top rate, but the landowner would be eligible for a lower rate (or higher rebate) if key standards are proven by the landowner (a discretionary transaction cost). In this way, tax rates would reflect performance standards rather than arbitrary activity-based classifications. For example: • Green roofed 8 buildings could have a lower tax rate than conventional roofing, to reflect their reduced runoff. • Pasture that is managed so as not to exceed specified nitrogen loss and/or soil compaction standards could attract a lower rate than pasture that releases greater quantities of nitrogen to surface and ground waters. • Fully fenced riparian vegetation could attract a higher rebate than partially fenced riparian vegetation. • Native vegetation with permanent legal protection (such as through a covenant) could attract a higher rebate. There could also be rebates for land that is destocked and receives a defined level of management of pests and weeds. Nitrogen loss levels, soil health, greenhouse gas emissions, stocking rates, fencing standards, conservation management standards and legal protection standards could be among the variety of factors that might be used to define sub- categories associated with more favorable tax rates. We do not envisage objective measurement of actual environmental effects at any site. The tax rate per hectare for each land cover category would be indicative of some combination of environmental impact, societal concern about typical impacts and many other policy considerations. It is therefore value-based and largely subjective. But it would be constrained within two technical requirements: • the principle that increasing per hectare environmental impact is associated with higher tax rates • primary footprint categories can only be based on land cover types that are reliably identifiable from satellite imagery, and all land cover types must be associated with a footprint category. Beyond these two matters, we suggest that definition of categories and tax rates should be guided by: • fiscal goals for the tax (how much revenue is required); 8 a roof that is covered in plants, which reduces stormwater run-off and lowers cooling costs \[1\] PO Box 91736, Victoria Street West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Phone 09 302 2972 • www.eds.org.nz • economic goals (how substitutable it is for other taxes; any desired incentives for value added production); • environmental goals (water quality; halting biodiversity loss; carbon sequestration and reducing GHG emissions); • social goals (impacts on wealth inequality; incentives for environmental sustainability); and • social and political considerations about impacts on sectoral interests (these considerations should be transparent and explicit). Strengths and Weaknesses relative to other tax reform options One of the most valuable outcomes of tax reform would be a rebalancing of tax on environmental and capital inputs to production, relative to taxes on labour and the consumption of outputs. Such a rebalancing would promote social, economic and environmental sustainability which is undermined by current tax policy. An environmental footprint tax, combined with lower income, company and/or consumption taxes, would promote employment and enterprise, help manage wealth inequality, promote environmental sustainability, support agribusiness in its transition from high volume, emission-intensive production to low-emission and value-added production. The transition would be supported by lowering the costs of labor through reduced income tax, company tax &/or GST, while increasing the cost of environmental degradation. This may also be a constructive way to help prepare agribusinesses for the likely emergence of synthetic milk and meat on the global market. Another advantage of the footprint tax is that it sets up a framework for a comprehensive high-level environmental monitoring system. It would enhance national and regional environmental reporting and could inform a variety of Resource Management Act processes. The footprint tax could usefully be supplemented by much more specific environmental taxes, rebates and cap-and–trade schemes. Schemes for trading water takes and nitrogen emissions, subject to appropriate regulatory safeguards, may have potential for promoting economic efficiency while reducing pollution. Income, company and consumption taxes We have reservations about increasing income tax, company tax or GST as a way to improve the tax system. None of these options adequately addresses the dangerously distortionary effects of the tax system on our natural environment, on our greenhouse gas emissions, on our volume-based commodity production or on wealth inequality. However, we do not dismiss the potential for making our income tax more progressive with additional tax brackets (at, say, $200,000, $500,000 and $1,000,000) and higher tax rates associated with each. This could improve perceptions of fairness and inequality. Similarly, there may be a case for a progressive company tax. \[1\] PO Box 91736, Victoria Street West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Phone 09 302 2972 www.eds.org.nz Capital Gains tax While we do not comment on its overall desirability, we point out that a capital gains tax is not likely to be a silver bullet to improve the fairness of the tax system or mitigate its distortionary effects. If we relied only on a capital gains tax, revenue would be slow to accrue, and therefore much needed company and income tax adjustments could be excessively delayed. Issues identified in Appendix 2 of Future of Tax are difficult to resolve fairly, and so detract from the appeal of a capital gains tax. We do not necessarily oppose the idea of a capital gains tax, but suggest that it would be inadequate to address our fundamental concerns. The environmental footprint tax proposal provides a way to tax returns from land-based property in a way that both improves fairness, is essentially progressive, and addresses distortions created by the current system. Land Tax levied on capital value The absence of a land tax (beyond our local government rating system) means our tax system is not as broadly based as it could be. Its absence leads to higher rates for other taxes (than might otherwise be the case) and contributes to wealth inequality. However, adoption of a conventional land tax based on capital land value would do nothing to address environment degradation, nor would it incentivise a move from commodity production to added-value products (or nudge agribusinesses toward low-emission operations). In fact, it could add to environmental problems, particularly if private land that is managed for its natural values (and so earns negligible financial return) were to be taxed. An ordinary land tax would require exemptions, akin to the rates exemptions allowed by most councils for private land under conservation covenants, for natural areas. A public good can legitimately be supported by (what would essentially be) public funds. We suggest that a conventional land tax would be a missed opportunity to address the critical issues facing New Zealand. An environmental footprint tax would be a more appropriate and targeted approach to land taxation. Royalties on water We view natural surface and ground water as a public good part-owned by Māori and that a return to the public (and Māori) purse is due when taken for private benefit. Thus a royalty on the abstraction of surface and groundwater for private and commercial use is entirely appropriate both to recompense its owners and to encourage efficient use. However, we do not envisage a tax on taking water as being able to contribute in any substantive way to ameliorating water pollution issues because it does not alter incentives for the management of runoff and \[1\] PO Box 91736, Victoria Street West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Phone 09 302 2972 • www.eds.org.nz point source discharges to freshwater. However, revenue could be hypothecated to freshwater improvements, which are rightly a public responsibility.

He is a former CEO of AXA Insurance (New Zealand) and ACC. He has over 30 years’ experience in the New Zealand financial services sector. Ralph Stewart introduced variable annuities to the New Zealand market and the Retirement Income Group Limited provides a series of managed investment schemes, superannuation schemes and insurance products for post- retirement savers. 2 Introduction Retirement Income Group Limited (Lifetime) welcomes the opportunity to contribute a submission on the future tax treatment of pre and post retirement savings. Since 2013 Lifetime has pioneered variable annuities and other post-retirement savings products in New Zealand through the Lifetime Income Fund (Fund). Retirement income options are limited in New Zealand, the fundamental market and longevity risks ever present in retirement continue to be borne by the retirees not the providers of retirement savings products. Variable annuities cover the need of many retirees for a regular, reliable income providing longevity and volatility insurance to ensure a given level of income is guaranteed in retirement. On premature death the beneficiaries of the estate receive the residual investment balance. In seeking the regulatory approvals to establish variable annuities in New Zealand Lifetime obtained a binding ruling from Inland Revenue that it can provide investors with tax-paid income under current law with tax paid (at PIE rates) by the Fund. Lifetime investors however still face the impact of non- concessional PIE rates which over time create effective tax rates for investors well in excess of what they would pay on if their savings were made untaxed capital appreciating assets such as residential rental property. At the moment the market for variable annuities is relatively small when compared to KiwiSaver (2.7 million members) and bank term deposits (650,000 accounts held by adults) but it is growing fast. Back in 2015 Infometrics projected that in the years between 2021 and 2060 some 1.2 million KiwiSavers will reach age 65 with balances of $100,000 or more. Over that period the balances maturing as KiwiSavers reach age 65 will be worth $468 billion . We ask the Tax Working Group to address what we see as four major failings in today’s retirement income landscape. •Locked-in post-retirement savings are overtaxed in New Zealand; •The income needs of retired New Zealanders are not adequately provided for; •There is insufficient recognition for the risks to retirement income faced by retired New Zealanders; •There is a lack of willingness by KiwiSavers providers to protect retired investors from market and longevity risk; 3 Executive Summary 1.Locked-in post-retirement savings are overtaxed in New Zealand. •A retirement savings plan covers not just the 40 or so years of workforce retirement savings but also the 30 years or so the average person can expect to be living post- 60. At 2% per annum inflation the real value of a dollar saving halves every 36 years. Thus, over a full retirement savings period an initial dollar invested is worth only 25 cents in real terms but this 75% fall in value is ignored under our income tax rules. •The inflation impact over time is one of the ways retirement savers are penalised under current tax rules. The other is that progressive income tax rates are levied on annual income. Current PIE rates are 10.5%, 17.5% and 28% depending on the investor’s annual level of income. •Given New Zealand Superannuation (NZ Super) and modest other income, most retirees are on a 17.5% rate. This better reflects their lifetime income level but for a number of years they are taxed at the 28% even though retirement income is by definition spread over an investors retirement period when the 17.5% rate is more appropriate. A reasonable investment return on retirement savings is 6% per annum – 4% nominal and 2% inflation. That means only 2/3rds of the return is real income. We contend: a. To reduce the tax rates on locked in retirement savings (KiwiSaver, superannuation schemes and workplace saving schemes) and products with annuity benefits to 2/3rds of the nominal tax rates. This would mean dropping the PIE rates from 10.5%, 17.5% and 28% and the annuity fund rate from 28% to 7%, 11.67% and 18.67%. b. Given, as argued above, that the 17.5% is the correct top nominal tax rate for retirement savings we suggest the rates be set at 7% and 11.67% Please refer to the detailed analysis in appendix 1. 2.The income needs of retired New Zealanders is not adequately provided for •A 65 year old female with a family home, $150,000 of retirement savings, drawing down her capital at 5% a year ($625 per month or $7,500 per annum) to supplement NZ super faces limited practical choices: Investment option Net monthly income Able to protect income from inflation?

We contend: a. The financial services industry should be encouraged to accept more risk, make more use of shareholder capital to provide greater security to retirees and increase the number of retirement income options available. b. Investors actively seeking to supplement their NZ Super to support their retirement living expenses are currently penalised by tax rules because they are taxed on fictitious inflation gains that significantly impact retirement savings even at low rates of inflation and they are often taxed on their return from retirement savings at the top tax rate when on a lifetime basis the middle tax rate is more appropriate. c. If more radical reform options (such as moving to a ETT system) are not viable then we support dropping the PIE rates from 10.5%, 17.5% and 28% and the annuity fund rate from 28% to 7% 11.67% Supporting analysis for this proposal is set out in appendix 2. 3.The is insufficient recognition for the risks faced by retired New Zealanders; •Investing in retirement carries unique and specific risks which are not present when saving for retirement. •Dollar cost averaging works in reverse, while regular savers will benefit from buying assets at lower prices during market volatility. Retirees drawing on their capital to generate additional income are forced to sell into volatile markets and suffer from lower asset prices. •A negative market event at or with 15 years of retirement reduces capital and income with little opportunity to recover. •Volatile markets make the practical provision of a regular retirement income challenging . 5 •Market risk combined with longevity risk makes the process of identifying an appropriate level of capital drawdown impossible. •Inflation risk is ever present. We contend: a. The local financial services industry should be challenged to introduce modern risk management products to support the retirement challenge. Risk management products to manage retirement risks are offered freely throughout the OECD. The only provider of comprehensive retirement risk management tools in New Zealand is Lifetime. b. Development of modern risk management products should not be penalised by the tax rules as they are now and fairer rules be introduced for those who actively seek to manage their retirement income Please refer a detailed analysis in appendix 3. 4.There is a lack of willingness by KiwiSavers to protect retired investors from risk •Future retirees are in danger of KiwiSaver providers continuing to profit maximise from both saving in retirement and living in retirement. The only KiwiSaver offering retirement income options available in New Zealand today is Simplicity KiwiSaver, also New Zealand’s only not for profit KiwiSaver. •Some other providers offer what is referred to as ‘naked ’ draw down or in simple terms the investor can elect a given level of annual draw down paid as regular monthly income. The market risk and the longevity risk are pushed to the retiree. •Alternatively the provider can share or remove the risk by investing shareholder •capital into providing insurance against market volatility and living a long life. •The application of capital and the impact on KiwiSaver profitability, is respectfully contended as the primary reason why a disproportionate amount of risk is carried by the retiree when in practise it should be shared with the KiwiSaver provider. •Internationally capital requirement for providers offering protection against market and longevity risk are as follows; Country Capital Requirement (% of FUM) USA 1% Japan 4% Australia 10% Ireland/UK 3.5% Europe 2.5% New Zealand 8.0% 6 We contend: a. If KiwiSaver providers seek to profit maximise both when providing savings products and then providing decumulation options they should be encouraged to do so equitably, by offering practical solutions to market and longevity risk. b. Such intention should be recognised by tax rates for long term capital draw down so as to reflect the social capital benefits to New Zealand of people being in a position to build retirement savings to supplement their NZ Super. Please refer a detailed analysis in appendix 4. 7 Appendix 1 \[Locked-in, both pre and post-retirement savings are overtaxed in New Zealand.\] What is the Tax Problem for Long Term Locked-in Savings? The TWG first report sums up the current bias in investment which is particularly relevant for our industry of providing income security for retirees. Figure 21 on page 40 outlines the effective tax rates on various forms of investment. This can be summarised as follows in preferential order: 1 The taxpayer’s owner occupied residential home – effectively no tax and as such incentives over investment in this investment category which will be compounded if a capital gain tax is introduced exempting this asset 2 Residential rental homes – effectively tax subsidised as investors claim revenue losses against other income and all their returns are tax free capital appreciation. Add to this tax preference the current imbalances with the supply and demand curve, then this simply results in this form of investment looks the most attractive of all options. 3 PIE investments/international shares and corporate investments all are similarly taxed. 4 Interest bearing securities – this is the most stable form of investment however it is the most taxed of all investments as the inflation components is taxed on a unrealised real time basis. We hold regular seminars throughout the country explaining what variable annuities are. One of the most common themes of investment that comes out of these seminars is the number of retirees that have over invested in residential rental homes. This is far from the optimal investment that these people need. It is generally an asset rich, income low investment, it is illiquid and in times when there is no tenant or major repairs are required it can place significant stress on retirees as the low yielding income dries up. When we ask why such people have made these investments, the general response is that this is the most tax advantageous investment. As you are aware, the differences in the effective tax rates between residential rental properties and compound interest financial products (standard annuities, bank term deposits and KiwiSaver) are a result of capital gains being included as annual income in compound interest products but not residential rental properties. For rental properties any capital gains would only be taxed on realisation and only if sold before the brightline test eligibility deadline had passed. True investors avoid the brightline test by simply holding the asset pass two (or five) years. Paying tax on interest as it is earned cuts the after-tax earnings that can be reinvested to earn compound returns (interest on interest). Rental property investors are able deduct any tax losses created by their interest and other costs exceeding their rental income from their other wage and salary income. 8 These differences create a situation where for someone in the 33% marginal income tax bracket, can pay an effective tax rate over 50% on their KiwiSaver, standard annuity or bank term deposit, earnings and only 0-10% on their residential rental property over 30 years of saving. (Source Financial Services Council 2013” The tax barrier to retirement prosperity in New Zealand”.) These perfectly legal arrangements encourage over investment in residential rental property by higher income earners which makes it difficult for first home buyers to buy as they are in competition with investors with a major tax advantage. This discourages investment in new productive capacity even when equally profitable on a pre-tax basis. How should we fix this problem? Economists such as Dr Andrew Coleman have suggested that the best remedy for retirement savings, if we are not prepared to remove the tax advantages for residential rental property investments is to move from the current TTE regime for retirement savings back to the EET regime that operated prior to 1989 in New Zealand. The EET approach is the standard treatment in most OECD countries and is consistent with what Optimal Tax Theory would recommend. An alternative would be to move to a TEE regime – a 10% tax rate on retirement savings. If we are not prepared to remove all the tax advantages for residential rental property then the next best option would be to create an even playing field with compound return financial products by reducing the taxable portion of interest to the real interest rate excluding the inflation portion. We understand this raises a number of complex issues. There appears to be little appetite for the complexities of full indexation for the income tax base at low (2% or less) rates of inflation. However, for retirement savings taxing the fictional inflationary return has very significant adverse effects even at low inflation rates. This is because of the impact of compounding interest. A retirement savings plan covers not just the 40 or so years of workforce retirement savings but also the 30 years or so the average person can expect to be living post-60. At 2% per annum inflation the real value of a dollar saving halves every 36 years. Thus, over a full retirement savings period an initial dollar invested is worth only about 25 cents in real terms but this 75% fall in value is ignored under our income tax rules. The inflation impact over time is one of the ways retirement savers are penalised under current tax rules. The other is that progressive income tax rates are levied on annual income. Current PIE rates are 10.5%, 17.5% and 28% depending on the investor’s annual level of income. A fixed term annuity fund is taxed on its income at 28%. Given New Zealand Superannuation and modest other income, most retirees are on a 17.5% rate. This better reflects their lifetime income level but for a number of years they are taxed at the 28% even though retirement income is by definition spread over an investors retirement period when the 17.5% rate is more appropriate. 9 A reasonable investment return on retirement savings is 6% per annum – 4% nominal and 2% inflation. That means only 2/3rds of the return is real income. he suggested approach is to reduce the tax rates on locked in retirement savings (KiwiSaver) and products with annuity benefits to 2/3rds of the nominal tax rates. This would mean dropping the PIE rates from 10.5%, 17.5% and 28% and the annuity fund rate from 28% to 7%, 11.67% and 18.67%. Given, as argued above, that the 17.5% is the correct top nominal tax rate for retirement savings we suggest the rates be set at 7% and 11.67% The most important “T” to reduce is the middle one, the tax rate applied to earnings in the fund as it has the most impact on the final balances achieved for KiwiSaver investors and the returns for annuity and bank term deposit investors. The aim of KiwiSaver was to help those middle and lower income New Zealanders previously unable to save sufficient to achieve a comfortable retirement. At the present time these investors face the highest effective tax rates of any investors in New Zealand. Higher income earners who usually already own their own home are able to invest in residential rental property and pay effective tax rates well below the tax rates they pay on their other wage and salary income. Meanwhile annuity, bank term deposit and KiwiSaver investors pay effective tax rates much above the marginal tax rates they pay on their other income. This is not only unfair but it has also distorted investment patterns, helped make home ownership more difficult to achieve while increasing interest rates and our currency to make us less competitive. We would ask that post-retirement locked-in savings like annuities be extended the same tax treatment as KiwiSaver and bank term deposits sed to save, pre-retirement. We would also suggest that if we want KiwiSaver to enable more low and middle income New Zealanders to achieve a comfortable retirement then there should be an incentive not to spend up all your KiwiSaver nest egg at age 65. This could be done by having a withholding tax of 15% on any balance either not kept in KiwiSaver or transferred to an approved annuity or other product providing a regular income in retirement. Surveys have shown people typically under estimate the period they will live post retirement which leav es the risk they will run out of savings before they run out of life. If retirement balances are not spent wisely such as to pay down any residual mortgage we face the prospect that despite KiwiSaver many people are unable to maintain a comfortable income above NZ Super in retirement. If this happens, pressure will mount to raise the level of the age benefit. Given the ageing population this will increase the fiscal pressure on future Governments at the point where the capacity to raise tax revenue will be constrained by slower growth in the working age population. 10 Appendix 2 \[The income needs of retired New Zealanders is not adequately provided for\] How can I improve my retirement Income? Combine financial services jargon with uncertain investment returns, longevity of life and individual spending preferences and before long a simple question soon becomes a complex challenge. Ralph Stewart, the Managing Director of Lifetime a specialist provider of retirement income says, “We have been presenting retirement income seminars over the last 3 years with 5,000 attending. The key points of interest have always been the same, how much of my savings can I safely spend each year? Will my savings last my lifetime and how can I convert savings into a fortnightly or monthly tax paid income.” How much of my savings can I safely spend each year? Stewart says many people don’t have large amounts of retirement savings and need to draw both capital and interest to bridge the gap between New Zealand Superannuation and the cost of living in retirement. He uses a rule of thumb of a withdrawal rate of between 4 and 6% of savings for those aged 65+. The New Zealand Society of Actuaries recommends 1 6% each year or 4% plus inflation. Charles Schwab 2 a leading provider of retirement income in the United States also recommends 4% before inflation but notes the assumption is based on historical investment returns and an expected investment term of 30 years. Rob Williams from Schwab “the biggest mistake you can make with the 4% rule is thinking you have to follow it to the letter. It’s a basic guideline for how much to save for retirement, but after that, we suggest adopting a personalised spending rate, based on your situation, investments, and risk tolerance.” Stewart, supports this view, noting that while a retirement income plan must be simple and straight forward, spending patterns change throughout retirement and flexibility is essential. For example it may be prudent to have a draw down rate of 10% for an 85 year old Kiwi Wealth, owned by Kiwi Bank, recently released their view 3 of the cost of living in retirement, drawing from a Massey University study in 2015 4 . Instead of a percentage of savings as a guide they have estimated an actual cost of living in retirement. Kiwi Wealth have concluded a “no frills” 1 https://actuaries.org.nz/new-rules -of-thumb-to -help -kiwis-spend-their -retirement-savings/ 2 https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/beyond-4-rule -how -much -can -you -safely-spend-retirement 3 https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/90904082/Many-Kiwis -have -no- idea -how -much -income-they-need -to -retire -Kiwi - Wealth 4 https://www.massey.ac.nz/massey/fms/Colleges/College%20of%20Business/School%20of%20Economics%20&%20Finance/ FinEd/documents/177653%20Report%20Final%202015b.pdf 11 life style will cost $744 per week, a “flexible” lifestyle $1,075 per week and a “deluxe” lifestyle $1,114 per week. Stewart, notes the KiwiBank/Massey University work is helpful and reinforces the need to save as much as possible for retirement. The gap between NZ superannuation and the suggested living costs are significant: $1,416 Monthly superannuation after tax (m tax code) $1,560 No “frills” retirement living costs $2,976 Monthly Gap $1,416 To generate a regular monthly income of $1,416 a retiree will need approximately $350,000 in savings and draw this down by 5% per year. In Stewart’s experience this is a considerable sum for most people close to or already in retirement. “In New Zealand today there are over 600,000 people aged 65 or older 5 . The majority of these people have modest savings and are faced with supplementing their NZ Super now. Saving more without a working wage or simply trying to live on interest earnings alone is not a workable plan” Stewart, suggests a drawdown rate of 4-5% will suit most current retirees in their sixties. Will my savings last my lifetime and how in practice can I convert savings into a fortnightly or monthly tax paid income? Stewart says there are a number of good and diverse options available, albeit they are quite different. To illustrate their differences he has assumed a female aged 65 living alone with $150,000 of retirement savings drawn down by 5% p.a. Monthly superannuation after tax (m tax code) $1,560 $150,000 drawn down at 5% p.a. (paid monthly) $ 625 Monthly Income $2,185 Banks, finance companies, fund Managers, KiwiSaver providers and insurers all have sensible options to convert savings into a regular income. They all offer Portfolio Investment Entities (PIE’s) to manage tax and all provide access to capital after the deduction of regular withdrawals. 5 http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse\_for\_stats/population/estimates\_and\_projections/NationalPopulationEstimates\_HOTPAt30J un13/Commentary.aspx 12 The difference between these providers is the how the capital drawdowns are paid, the investment approach and earnings rates and how long the savings are expected to last. Bank term deposits are tried and true, but they are not specifically designed for regular drawdowns of capital. In this example we have assumed investing in a 1-year term deposit and before reinvesting each year drawing down $7,500 each year to fund a monthly income top up of $625. Savings may be depleted by age 93 and against a life expectancy of 89. As future interest rates are unknown an estimate is made of the probability of the savings lasting to 89. The probability is based on the long-term variability in interest rates. 6 The Probability of the savings lasting to age 93 is 95%. UDC offer a regular monthly capital drawdown from their term deposit facility, which is helpful and simple. The returns are higher than term deposits, so savings may last longer to age 97. The underlying investments (finance company advances) are not as secure as the banks so the probability of reaching 97 is lower (80%). 6 Lifetime Retirement Income Limited Investment option Net monthly income Able to protect income from inflation?

In this example, a balanced fund with expected returns over the longer term of 5.90% before fees and taxes has been used. The higher returns means savings may last until age102, well above life expectancy, however the higher returns are more volatile which reduces the probability of reaching 102 to 80%. Lifetime is a licensed insurer like a bank and guarantees income for life. Lifetime also offers an inflation-indexed option albeit at a lower weekly income level to start. If this option was selected the initial weekly income would drop from $625 to $468 and increase each year by the same amount as NZ Superannuation. As a licensed and regulated insurer the probability of the income lasting a lifetime should be 100%. By applying a simple drawdown rate of between 4 and 5% to retirement savings and selecting a provider that offers the most confidence, securing an income to supplement NZ super should not be a complex challenge!

Protect your savings against sequencing risk Some say that volatility is not a risk as long as you stay invested 'for the long term'. This is simply not true in the case of any portfolio that has volatility and cash flows. Portfolios with cash flows are exposed to a subset of market risk, called sequencing risk. It becomes more difficult to respond to sequencing risk in retirement, but the good news is that there are ways to protect against it. Sequencing risk Sequencing risk is the risk that the order and timing of your investment returns is unfavourable, resulting in less money for retirement. Two people about to retire might have made identical super contributions and experienced average returns of 8 per cent per annum over a 20-year period and yet have significantly different balances to retire on, all due to sequencing risk. Investment returns, good and bad, have more impact at some points in your superannuation lifecycle than at others. Negative investment returns early in retirement can be particularly damaging. Retirement portfolios are exposed to sequencing risk Your superannuation portfolio has cash flows if you are making contributions, or are withdrawing from it. Where there are no cash flows in a portfolio, there is no sequencing risk. Similarly, without volatility, all the return sequences are the same so there is no sequencing risk. Cash flows amplify market risk Consider a hypothetical example. Joe has $100,000 invested in superannuation. Table 1 shows the different outcomes for Joe's portfolio when the same set of annual returns occurs in reverse order over a nine-year period (using an 8 per cent arithmetic average annual return over the period). The table shows that there is no impact on the portfolio, as long as Joe does not contribute to, or withdraw from, his super for the investment period. Joe's investment balance at the end of nine years would have been $167,973 in both scenarios where there are no cash flows. Now let's look at what happens if Joe makes super contributions of $20,000 a year. The combination of market volatility and cash flows results in quite different outcomes after nine years. Portfolio A would be worth $378,656, while portfolio B would be worth $452,125. This is a difference of $73,469 (19.4 per cent), despite both portfolios having exactly the same 8 per cent average annual returns over the period and the same contributions made to them. Like many 15 people, Joe would be surprised to find that the end result could be so different when the portfolios looked so similar on the surface. This is sequencing risk. It applies not only when making regular contributions to an investment, but also when withdrawing from super to pay for your retirement. Table 1: Hypothetical example, value of Joe's portfolio with/without cash flows and with the same average annual return Source: Milevsky, Moshe and Anna Abaimova (2009) 'Retirement income and the sensitive sequence of returns' Metlife, Challenger Life Company Limited estimates Sequencing risk peaks at retirement Sequencing risk is typically greatest at the point of retirement, when you switch from building up you r nest egg to drawing down from it. This is because usually there is more money at risk if markets drop around the time of retirement. This is the concept of the retirement risk zone. The zone actually starts a few years before retirement as your nest egg has been largely built. It continues post retirement until you have spent a reasonable chunk of your retirement savings. How big is the risk? An example using recent Australian market performance data The simple example shown in Figure 1 uses a hypothetical investor and is based on historical Australian market performance data for the period 1979 to 2011. It illustrates how sequencing risk can impact retirement outcomes. 16 The investor illustrated in Path 1 in Figure 1 retired at the end of 1979 with an investment balance of $148,000. His portfolio was 50 per cent invested in Australian equities and 50 per cent in Australian bonds. Following his retirement, he lived off his retirement savings, drawing $10,000, indexed to inflation, each year. By 2011, the drawdown matches ASFA's 1 comfortable retirement standard of just over $40,000 a year. The retirement capital remaining at the end of each year is shown by the dotted blue line in the chart. The light blue line (Path 2) shows what would have happened if exactly the same returns were achieved, but in reverse order (i.e. 2011 returns first). If this were the case, the investor's money would have run out 10 years earlier. As can be seen in the chart, after 22 years in retirement, the other sequence of returns had doubled the retiree's capital. Figure 1: Example of the possible impact of sequencing risk in retirement using Australian market performance data Sourc e: Challenger Life Company Limited estimates based on data from Bloomberg. Don't let sequencing risk spoil your retirement plan The consequences of sequencing risk are potentially strongest around the point of retirement. If you have a run of poor market results close to retirement, it can ruin your retirement plan. Before you retire, you might be able to extend your working years to save a bit more. It is much harder to go back to work after you have retired. The good news is that there are ways to protect against the effects of sequencing risk. It can be a good idea to structure your cash flow needs around the time of your retirement to limit the risk that a poor sequence of investment returns impacts on your retirement goals.

Alcohol Healthwatch supports the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders. 2. Alcohol Healthwatch believes that the current approach to alcohol excise tax is unfair to many New Zealanders. 3. Alcohol Healthwatch suggests that the increasing affordability of alcohol has played a significant role in the increasing prevalence of hazardous drinking in New Zealand. 4. Alcohol Healthwatch believes that the current level of alcohol excise is not meeting its purpose of correcting for the externalities of alcohol use and reducing the problems associated with alcohol use. 5. Alcohol Healthwatch believes that the level of alcohol excise should reflect the level of harm that alcohol causes to drinkers as well as to others. In New Zealand, the harm to people from other peoples drinking is higher than the harm to the drinker; this must be given greater consideration in determining alcohol excise rates. 6. Alcohol Healthwatch recommends an urgent increase to alcohol excise rates, by at least 50% across all alcohol products. On average, this would raise the price of alcohol by at least 10%. Excise rates should be adjusted annually to take into account changes in income as well as to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers. 7. Alcohol Healthwatch recommends that the level of wine excise should be corrected immediately to account for a global shift towards higher strength wines. All wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%. This current anomaly in excise results in the government, as well as taxpayers, losing out on millions of dollars of excise revenue because of the incorrect taxing of wine products. 8. Public opinion polling by UMR in February 2018 showed that almost two-thirds (63%) of New Zealanders polled supported increases in alcohol prices if the revenue was earmarked for the funding of mental health and addiction services. 9. Alcohol Healthwatch supports the use of the Living Standards Framework to assess the effectiveness of the tax system. In relation to alcohol excise, Alcohol Healthwatch recommends that Treasury considers the regressive characteristics of alcohol taxes in economic terms against the significant potential for reductions in health inequalities. 2 10. To achieve a fairer and more equitable approach to taxing alcohol, Alcohol Healthwatch recommends the following approaches be considered: a. Requiring alcohol to be taxed proportional to alcohol content (volumetric taxation), with a higher rate for high strength beverages especially spirits; b. Implement Minimum Unit Pricing alongside increases in excise tax; c. Increase the Health Promotion Agency levy to fund replacement of alcohol sports sponsorship (at a minimum); d. Require multi-national alcohol companies to be more transparent about their financial accounts (to assist with determination of tax avoidance); and e. Legislate requiring alcohol manufacturers, importers and wholesalers to file annual tax returns to the Government, to be made available to public (similar to requiring the disclosure of tobacco products sold in New Zealand under section 35 of the Smokefree Environments Act). 3 Background 1. Current structure for taxing alcohol products in New Zealand 1.1 Rates of excise tax vary by type of beverage and alcohol strength. Beer (>2.5% alcohol content) is taxed according to its alcohol content, whereas wine is taxed according to the volume of alcohol sold. Spirits are taxed by alcohol content or by volume of product, depending on the strength of the spirits or spirit-based products for sale (Table 1). Table 1. Excise rates of alcohol products (as at July 2017) Type of beverage Alcohol strength (ABV) Beer Spirits (including RTDs) Wine >1.15-2.5% ABV 43.573 cents per litre of beverage 43.573 cents per litre of beverage >2.5% ABV for Beer >2.5%-6% ABV for Spirits & other beverages $29.054 per litre of alcohol $29.054 per litre of alcohol >6-9% ABV $2.3243 per litre of beverage ≤14% ABV for Wine >9-14% of ABV for Spirits $2.9054 per litre of beverage $2.9054 per litre of beverage >14% ABV $52.916 per litre of alcohol >14-23% ABV $52.916 per litre of alcohol ≥23% ABV 1.2 The combination of alcohol excise types (calculated by volume or alcohol content) means that some products attract a tax advantage. Where tax is based on a band of alcohol strength (e.g. 6-9%) and volume of beverage, it is clearly advantageous for producers to develop a product at the upper end of the band that is consequently viewed to be higher quality. In this way, they pay the same amount of excise as a product with lower alcohol strength. This anomaly has implications for tax revenue and the strength of alcoholic products in the New Zealand market. 1.3 For example, wine in New Zealand is taxed at a rate as if it contains 10% alcohol content. Alcohol Healthwatch believes that this requires correction and is discussed in more detail below. 1.4 There are also anomalies for RTDs between 6-9% alcohol strength. The Law Commission has demonstrated these anomalies clearly in their report (Figure 1). (1) 4 Figure 1. Alcohol excise tax rates (1) 1.5 Every year, on July 1, excise rates are adjusted for inflation (indexed to the Consumer Price Index). 1.6 Table 2 shows the proportion of the price of commonly-purchased alcohol products that is alcohol excise tax. Among these products (not including low-priced or high-priced products), the lowest proportion of tax is found in wine products (17-20% of retail price is tax), followed by beer (20-25% is tax), RTDs (approx. 30% is tax), and spirits (55-60% is tax). Table 2. Prices of alcohol products (as at January 2018) and the proportion that is excise tax.

This equates to 78c per standard drink. Figure 2. Four bottles of wine (750mL) currently available for sale at the price of $5.99. 1.8 These bottom-dollar prices of wine clearly illustrate the paradoxical situation whereby a bottle of wine costs almost the same as a bottle of juice. 1.9 In 2017, $1.001 billion in revenue was received from custom and excise duty on alcohol products sold in the domestic market. (2) 1.10 This revenue was received from the 476.1 million litres of alcoholic beverages available for consumption (Figure 3). 6 Figure 3. Alcohol available for consumption, 2017(3) Wine 110.6 23% Beer 289.0 61% RTDs 63.1 13% Spirits 13.4 3% Alcohol available for consumption, 2017 (million litres, %) Total alcohol available for consumption in NZ = 476.1 7 What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium to long-term? Which of these are most important? 2. Risk: Population growth will result in increased costs of alcohol harm if hazardous drinking levels are not addressed 2.1 Alcohol causes more harm, and has greater costs to society, than any other drug 2.1.1 Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cocaine, cannabis, methamphetamine, etc. (4) This arises because of the significant harm to both users (e.g., drug specific death and illnesses, dependence and loss of relationships, etc.) and to others (e.g. crime, injury and social costs) (Figure 1). Figure 4. Drugs ordered by their overall harm scores, showing the separate contributions to the overall scores from harms to users and harm to others (4) 2.1.2 Alcohol continues to be the leading behavioural risk factor for death and Disability Adjusted Life Years lost among 15-49 year old New Zealanders (Figure 5).(5) This large population group comprises many individuals driving our economy and raising future generations to contribute to a productive and healthy society. 8 Figure 5. Mortality rates by risk factor, New Zealand, both sexes, 15-49 years, 2016. Global Burden of Disease Compare Data Visualisation (5) 2.1.3 In 2005/06, the direct costs to Government from alcohol harm were estimated to be approximately one-third of the $5 billion total annual costs to society. Costs from alcohol harm comprised just over 70% of all costs from harmful drugs (excluding tobacco.(6) 2.1.4 It is important to note that the $5 billion annual estimate does not include the ongoing costs associated with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD), only the direct costs of inpatient care in 2005/06 were calculated. In 2013, Easton et al. calculated that the aggregate losses in productivity from FASD ranged from $49 million to $200 million per year.(7) 2.1.5 In 2017, revenue of $1.001 billion was received from custom and excise duty on alcohol. (2) This equates to approximately 1% of all tax paid but does not come close to off- setting the excessive cost of alcohol harm to society. 2.1.6 Excise taxes on alcohol products should reflect the level of harm that arises from its consumption. Alcohol Healthwatch suggests that this is not the case, as alcohol excise tax usually comprises around 25% as a proportion of the retail price, in comparison to tobacco excise tax which comprises 52-62% of the final price paid.(8,9) 9 2.2 The prevalence of hazardous drinking has been increasing across most population groups 2.2.1 Following declines in hazardous drinking in most population groups from 2007-2011, there have since been statistically significant increases in hazardous drinking in every age group over 18 years (Table 1, significant increases in drinking shown in bold). Table 3.

Results for 2016/17 are not shown as the survey question changed and comparisons are not possible. 2.2.2 These increases resulted in 179,000 more hazardous drinkers in 2015/16 than in 2012. (10) As Table 3 shows, some of the largest increases in hazardous drinking have been in New Zealanders aged 35 to 54 years. 2.2.3 As shown in Table 3, the prevalence of hazardous drinking in the 66-74 year age group has more than doubled (5.5% to 10%), and increased more than 50% among those 10 aged 45-54 years (11.7% to 18.5%) and 55-64 years (8.4% to 14.4%). In a recent international study of older people’s drinking, New Zealand drinkers were found to have some of the highest levels of drinking across the countries studied. (11) As shown in Figure 6, these age groups comprise a significant proportion of the New Zealand population. (12) Figure 6. Population pyramid for New Zealand in 2016 (projected). (12) 2.2.4 When subgroups of drinkers are analysed, these increasing trends appear to be very much driven by increases in women’s drinking. This has significant implications for women’s health and wellbeing (acute and chronic harms), equity in society, and the prevalence of, and outcomes associated with, Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (discussed later). 2.2.5 There are striking inequalities in rates of hazardous drinking by sex and ethnicity. In 2016/17, 39% of Māori men and 32.3% of all Pacific men were classified as hazardous drinkers. This compares to 28.4% of European/other men. (13) 2.2.6 Young adults (18-24 years) still have the highest prevalence of hazardous drinking in New Zealand. In 2016/17, more than one in three young adult men (39.5%) and one in four young adult women (25.7%) could be classified as hazardous drinkers. 2.2.7 There have been no significant changes in patterns of consumption across any age, sex or ethnic groups between 2015/16 and 2016/17. (13) Comparisons across longer time periods are not possible due to a slight change in the survey question in 2015/16. 11 3. Risk: The real price of alcohol (relative to other goods) is decreasing and affordability is increasing markedly 3.1 The real price of alcohol is decreasing 3.1.1 Changes across a range of factors (e.g. costs of alcohol production, advertising and marketing) can affect the retail price of alcohol paid by New Zealand consumers. 3.1.2 As shown in Figure 7, overall prices (adjusted for inflation) for alcohol have reduced. (14) This decrease in overall prices is mostly due to the real price of wine decreasing considerably over time, as the real price of beer has increased. 3.1.3 It is important to note that Figure 7 relates to overall prices in both on-licences and off- licences. Increasing prices in the on-licence sector may be masking trends in the real price of alcohol at off-licences over time. This is exemplified in the Law Commission Report in 2010, (1) showing that between 2000 and 2008, prices for off-licence alcohol products increased by 19% compared to all CPI goods increasing by 23%. In contrast, the prices for on-licence alcohol products rose by 45%.(14) Figure 7. The real price of alcoholic beverages.(14) 12 3.2 The affordability of alcohol is increasing 3.2.1 Changing incomes have a considerable impact on the ability of New Zealanders to purchase alcohol. 3.2.2 As such, changes in income strongly influence the effectiveness of excise tax rates to reduce demand for alcohol. If excise rates are not adjusted according to changing incomes, they become less meaningful and effective over time. 3.2.3 Research has shown that alcohol has become more affordable over the past two decades. (15) In 2017, wine was 20% more affordable than it was in 2013 (Figure 8). (14) On average, beer, wine and spirits have all become more affordable. Figure 8. Changes in affordability of alcohol products in New Zealand (1988 – 2016).(14) 3.2.4 This has resulted in increased alcohol purchasing power among consumers. Every year, New Zealanders spend more than $4 billion on alcohol products. (1,16) As real prices have reduced, consumers can purchase more alcohol every year for the same price. With higher incomes, greater quantities and/or higher-priced products can be purchased. 3.2.5 Research has shown that purchases and consumption of alcohol are linked to both its price and affordability. (17,18) When incomes increase and the real price decreases, consumption levels tend to go up. (15) 3.2.6 New Zealand’s experience is similar to that of Australia, whereby the price of wine decreased from 1980 to 2012 and the affordability index of wine increased significantly 13 from 70 to 105.(19) These changes are also apparent in the United Kingdom.(20) The box below shows how the price of cask wine (a beverage commonly preferred by dependent drinkers) has not kept pace with inflation in New Zealand. In 1988, a 3L cask of wine cost $15. An inflation price in 2018 (Quarter 1) would be $30.14. In 2018 (30 years later), it can be purchased for $19.79. 14 What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? 4. Principles for assessment of the tax system: Living Standards Framework 4.1 Goals of alcohol excise tax 4.1.1 The purposes of generating alcohol excise tax should be fourfold (21,22): • To cover the cost of the externalities associated with consumption; • To alter alcohol consumption behaviour in order to reduce associated harms; • To prevent drinking initiation; and • To generate revenue to fund public services. 4.1.2 In New Zealand, excise and customs duties are deemed to be administratively efficient in serving these purposes. (23) 4.2 The Living Standards Framework as a basis for taxing alcohol 4.2.1 Alcohol Healthwatch supports the use of the Living Standards Framework to measure the performance of New Zealand’s tax system. 4.2.2 Alcohol use has major direct and indirect negative effects on three of the capitals that encompass the Living Standards Framework. Alcohol production (e.g. growing grapes for wine) also requires significant amounts of water (a form of natural capital), but the water footprint of alcohol is not discussed further in this submission. 4.3 Impact of alcohol use on financial and physical capital 4.3.1 The level of alcohol use in a population is negatively correlated with economic growth; the higher the consumption, the lower the growth. (24) 4.3.2 It is acknowledged that every stage of alcohol production and sale creates employment. In addition, alcohol generates significant revenue through exports. In 2017, the export value of wine was $1.6 billion (a record high), making it New Zealand’s 5 th biggest export product. (25) 4.3.3 However, the cost of alcohol-related harm to society needs to be given the greatest weight in decisions relating to alcohol excise tax, rather than the role of the alcohol industry in the economy. It is argued that “the output, income and employment generated by the alcohol industry are not measures of social benefits attributable to alcohol” because they could be replaced by other industries.(26) 15 4.3.4 Hazardous drinking is associated with a higher risk of unemployment. In 2005/06, it was estimated that the labour cost for lost output associated with alcohol was approximately $1.8 billion.(6) Three-fifths of this amount ($1.1 billion) was due to excess unemployment. This was followed by premature death ($0.46 billion) as a result of harmful alcohol use. (6) 4.3.5 Within the workplace, alcohol consumption has serious implications for both employers and employees. This can range from death and injury as a result of impairment, to absenteeism, lost productivity, and general low workforce morale. In 2008, it was estimated that 147,500 adults took one or more days off work or school due to their alcohol use.(27) A total of 84,400 adults reported experiencing harmful effects on their work, study or employment because of alcohol. (27) 4.3.6 As described earlier, alcohol use is the major behavioural risk factor leading to death and disability in New Zealanders aged 15-49 years. This is a key period for employment and a population that contributes significantly to economic growth. 4.4 Impact of alcohol use on human capital 4.4.1 Alcohol use also affects a drinker’s development of skills and knowledge and greatly impacts on physical and mental health. Hazardous drinking can be a major barrier to full participation in society. 4.4.2 The impact of alcohol on physical health is enormous. Major physical harms begin in utero, through exposure of alcohol to the developing fetus. Alcohol is the most harmful of all drugs to the fetus, and is classified as a neurobehavioral teratogen. (28) 4.4.3 Alcohol exposure during pregnancy causes developmental abnormalities in the fetus, known as Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). FASD is the leading preventable cause of intellectual disability in the western world. Secondary disabilities such as mental health disorders, school failure, unemployment, alcohol and other drug dependence and trouble with the law may arise in persons affected by FASD. (29) 4.4.4 It is estimated that at least 600 children (but likely many more) in New Zealand are born with FASD. (30) It is also estimated that FASD affects half of the children and young people in Child, Youth and Family Care (now known as Oranga Tamariki – Ministry for Children). (31) 4.4.5 During childhood, alcohol consumption by a parent or guardian places children at high risk of death from maltreatment. In one New Zealand study, 17% of respondents who had a heavy drinker in their life reported that their children were negatively affected by this person’s drinking. Eleven percent of those with children living in the household indicated that the child had been yelled at or verbally abused because of someone else’s drinking. Seven percent of respondents with children in the household reported 16 that children had witnessed serious violence in the home because of someone else’s drinking. (32) 4.4.6 During adolescence, alcohol consumption can have irreversible effects on brain development and can have acute effects on learning and memory. These acute and long-term effects can have a profound impact on future success and wellbeing. Longitudinal research of New Zealand and Australian adolescents found an inverse, dose-response relationship in the relationship between the number of alcohol-related harms a young person experienced and their likelihood of finishing school.(33) 4.4.7 Alcohol consumption during adolescence also has significant impacts on mental health. There is a large body of research demonstrating the links between alcohol and poor mental health. (34,35) It is well-known that alcohol use and abuse can worsen existing mental health conditions, including depression. 4.4.8 Alcohol consumption significantly contributes to our country’s alarmingly high suicide rates. Alcohol-use disorders are second highest in prevalence in suicide victims, following mood disorders. (36) In 2014, over one third (34%) of all New Zealanders who had committed suicide had alcohol in their system and a further 23 percent had a trace 1 of alcohol in either their blood or urine. (37) In 2015, (34%) had alcohol in their system and a further 30 percent had a trace of alcohol in either their blood or urine. In ten percent of suicides, a toxicology report was not possible. 4.4.9 In a study of New Zealanders aged 16-64 years, one in five (18%) reported experiencing harmful effects from someone’s alcohol use (e.g. affecting their friendships or social life, home life or financial position). This is higher than the one in eight (12%) drinkers that were found to experience harmful effects from their own drinking in the past year.(38) 4.4.10 In the above study, more women (22.8% vs 17% of men), especially younger women (35% of women between 18 and 24 years of age), reported experiencing harms from someone else’s drinking in the past year. (38) 4.4.11 New Zealanders with more exposure to heavy drinkers in their life have been found to be less satisfied with their life. (32) This includes lower satisfaction with life as a whole, standard of living, health, safety, achievements, personal relationships, community connectedness, future security and feelings about self. People exposed to heavy drinkers also reported that they experienced more pain, discomfort, anxiety and depression. (32) 1 ESR Reference (Trace Level (less than 5 milligrams per 100 millilitres); Trace levels of alcohol may be due to means other than deliberate ingestion. 17 4.4.12 Finally, the toxic and carcinogenic nature of alcohol gives rise to its causal association with least 7 forms of cancer: liver, breast, mouth, bowel, throat, larynx, oesophagus. (39) An increased risk of cancer begins at very low levels of regular alcohol use. (40) 4.4.13 Among New Zealand women drinkers, cancer is the greatest cause of death attributable to alcohol (of which breast cancer is most common). (40) 4.5 Impact of alcohol on social capital 4.5.1 It is also clear that alcohol use in a community impacts on attitudes and norms in relation to coordination and collaboration between people. Social connections can be compromised in a neighbourhood that has high levels of drinking. 4.5.2 Perceptions of safety can influence the willingness of the community to venture into their neighbourhood to form healthy relationships. When the perceptions of Auckland children (aged 9-12 years) were examined in the “Kids in the City” study, aspects of neighbourhoods that children most disliked included drunk people (in the inner-city and low income suburban neighbourhoods).(41) Noise from drunken parties in some lower- income suburban neighbourhoods also kept children awake at night.(41) 4.5.3 In the 2016 New Zealand Quality of Life Project undertaken across nine Councils, respondents were asked to report on the issues impacting on their perceived problems in their city or local area in the last 12 months, as well as their sense of safety in their homes, neighbourhoods and city centres. More respondents reported that alcohol and drug issues were the biggest problem in their neighbourhood, compared to any other crime and safety issue. Six in ten (60%) respondents in the seven city areas perceived alcohol or drugs problems, or anti-social behaviour associated with the consumption of alcohol, to be a problem in their city or local area, with two in ten (19%) rating it ‘a big problem’ and four in ten (41) ‘a bit of a problem’. The level of perceived problems with alcohol and drugs did not changed across the 2012, 2014, and 2016 surveys.(42) 4.5.4 Perceptions that alcohol and drug consumption cause problems in one’s neighbourhood will undoubtedly influence their willingness to engage with others in the community and feel a sense of connection to their neighbourhood. New Zealand research has found that feelings of safety are significantly associated with a sense of community (which is imperative to establish social capital).(43) 5. Principles for assessment of the tax system: Fairness and equity 5.1 What is ‘fair’ in relation to alcohol excise tax? 5.1.1 Alcohol Healthwatch recommends that a ‘fair’ system in relation to alcohol tax is one whereby the greatest positive impacts are demonstrated among low-income drinkers that commonly experience the highest levels of alcohol harm. 18 5.1.2 Internationally, it has been shown that disadvantaged populations disproportionately experience higher levels of harm (alcohol-related death and hospitalisation) compared to other groups with a similar drinking pattern. (44,45) 5.1.3 Moderate drinkers of low socio-economic status have also been found to experience higher levels of harm than more advantaged drinkers. (44) 6. Principles for assessment of the tax system: Meeting Treaty of Waitangi obligations 6.1 A fair system should meet Treaty of Waitangi Obligations 6.1.1 A fair system in relation to alcohol excise tax should also be assessed in relation to reducing alcohol-related harm to Māori and, in particular, reducing the inequities in harm between Māori and non-Māori. This is consistent with the Crown meeting its Treaty obligations. 6.1.2 It is well-documented that Māori experience disproportionately more alcohol-related harm than other ethnic groups. (1) This includes: • Māori men having a death rate from alcohol which is more than twice that of non- Māori. • Māori being more likely to be apprehended by police for an offence that involves alcohol. • Māori being more likely to experience harmful effects on areas such as financial position, work, study or employment, injuries and legal problems as a result of their drinking compared with other New Zealanders. • Māori women suffering more adverse effects as a result of other people’s drinking than any other sub-group by ethnicity and gender. 6.1.3 This level of harm does not reflect biology, rather it represents decades of structural and institutional discrimination, (46) differences in access to key conditions that affect opportunities in life (adequate income, housing, employment) and the environments in which many Māori live (neighbourhoods with more alcohol outlets). 6.1.4 Alcohol Healthwatch strongly recommends that inequities in alcohol consumption and harm (between Māori and non- Māori) be used as indicators of performance of a fair tax system. 19 7. Principles for assessment of the tax system: Changing behaviour and reducing harm 7.1 Reduced population consumption 7.1.1 Following economic theory, price is a strong determinant of alcohol consumption. Of all research examining strategies to reduce consumption and harm, the effects of price changes have been the most extensively studied. 7.1.2 Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have pooled the studies on price elasticities and effects of price changes on consumption. The consistency of the research demonstrating the effects of price on consumption has resulted in many organisations (e.g. World Health Organisation, US Center for Disease Control, UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence) recommending that pricing policies are one of the most potent policy interventions to reduce both individual and population levels of consumption. (47) 7.1.1 A wide body of international evidence shows that, on average, an inverse relationship exists between alcohol excise tax and price and consumption of alcohol. That is, when the price of alcohol goes up by 10%, overall consumption reduces by 3% to 10%. (48) In New Zealand, the Ministry of Justice (in their examination of alcohol pricing policies) used the price elasticities modelled by the Sheffield Alcohol Research group that are determined by the type of drinker, place of purchase and type of beverage purchased.(49) 7.1.2 In Australia, temporal analysis of price changes and affordability of alcohol over time has shown that when the price and affordability of alcohol changes, consumption is affected for up to eight years.(19) 7.1.3 Higher alcohol prices have also been shown to make young people less likely to transition from abstainer to moderate drinker (and from moderate drinker to heavy drinker).(47) New Zealand’s low-risk drinking guidelines (50) recommend that not drinking alcohol is the safest option for children and young people under 18 years of age. Currently, 56% of New Zealanders aged 15-17 years consumed alcohol in the past 12 months, and one in seven of these were classified as hazardous drinkers. (13) 7.2 Reduced acute and chronic alcohol-related harm (and associated costs) 7.2.1 There is strong evidence demonstrating that alcohol excise taxes and price interventions reduce alcohol-related harm. Systematic reviews have shown that increases in alcohol prices reduce alcohol-related disease and injury outcomes, alcohol-impaired driving, motor vehicle crashes, motor vehicle injuries, death from cirrhosis, alcohol dependence, sexually transmitted infections, suicide, violence (including rape, robbery, and violence towards children (Table 4). (22,48,51) 20 Table 4. The price elasticity of various health outcomes in high-income countries.(48,51) Price elasticity Elder et. al., 2010 Outcome Wagenaar et al., 2009(1) Alcohol-related disease and injury outcomes -0.347 Alcohol-impaired driving -0.50 to -0.81 Motor vehicle crashes -1.20 Motor vehicle injuries -0.112 -0.1 to -0.27(2) Death from cirrhosis Inverse relationship between price and cirrhosis death, but there are substantial differences in the estimated strength of this relationship Alcohol dependence -1.49 Sexually transmitted diseases -0.055 Suicide -0.048 Violence -0.022 -0.13 for rape (2) -0.09 for robbery (2), -0.12 for any violence towards children (2) Crime and related behaviours -0.014 -0.09 for robbery (2) -0.12 for any violence towards children (2) (1) Results are pooled estimates of both price and tax elasticity. (2) These figures are based on tax elasticity, which is the percentage change in an outcome of interest resulting from a 1% increase in alcohol taxation. Typically, in the situation of a taxation increase resulting in a price increase and, eventually, in a reduction of the outcome of interest, price elasticity has a higher value than tax elasticity. 7.2.2 To address alcohol use as a major risk factor for suicide, the World Health Organization recommends price increases on alcohol products, restrictions on alcohol advertising and sponsorship and reduced availability and accessibility of alcohol.(52,53) 7.2.3 Suicide rates among young men appear to be responsive to alcohol price increases.(34,54) One study showed that, across all age groups, increases in the excise tax on beer were associated with reductions in male suicides. For the youngest males (ages 10-14), a ten percent increase in beer tax reduced the average number of suicides by 5.0 percent. The effects are slightly smaller for the older age groups, whereby a ten percent increase in the beer tax reduced the average number of suicides by 3.1 percent (ages 15-19) and 2.4 percent (ages 20-24). It may be somewhat surprising that beer taxes affected suicides by the youngest males (those ages 10-14), but this result is plausible given that children of this age do drink. (54) 21 7.3 Other considerations 7.3.1 Cost-effectiveness: Raising the price of alcohol is the most cost-effective (in terms of cost per Disability Adjusted Life Year saved) measure to reduce alcohol consumption. In comparison with raising taxes by 50%, reducing access to retail outlets is twice as expensive, a comprehensive alcohol advertising ban is 3-4 times more expensive, drink driving countermeasures 2-4 times more expensive, and brief interventions for heavy drinkers are 8-16 times more expensive.(55) 7.3.2 In 2014, an 82% increase in excise taxes was estimated by the Ministry of Justice (49) to result in net savings to society of $339 million in the first year and $2452 million over ten years. 7.3.3 Addressing information failure: Many drinkers are unlikely to take into account the full externalities of their alcohol use, especially in relation to having full information to recognise the long-term consequences of their consumption. 7.3.4 In a 2017 survey in the United Kingdom, only 10% of people mentioned cancer when asked which diseases and illnesses are linked to alcohol. Over three-quarters (77%) of respondents said they supported the idea of a cancer warning being added to the labels of alcoholic products. (56) 7.3.5 Although labels are required on alcoholic products stating the number of standard drinks and alcohol strength in the container, there are no other mandatory warning labels in New Zealand to inform consumers of the risks of consumption. The alcohol industry has voluntarily included a pregnancy warning label, but the label has since been shown to be subject to misinterpretation by consumers.(57) In the absence of effective warning labels, there remains significant information failure (particularly in relation to the risks of cancer). 7.3.6 Alcohol Healthwatch believes that increases in alcohol prices can send a signal to drinkers of the harm associated with the product (particularly in light of a lack of labelling of harms). 7.3.7 Minimising adverse effects: Alcohol excise increases are unlikely to lead to a significant increase in the home production of alcohol. It is estimated that 3% of alcohol consumed in New Zealand is produced by home production. (47) Although home brewing and distillation is increasing in New Zealand, any potential increase in home production resulting from excise tax increases is not enough to warrant inaction regarding the bulk of alcohol in the marketplace. 22 How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? 8. Rationale for increasing excise tax rates 8.1 Recommendation to increase all alcohol excise rates by 50% 8.1.1 Alcohol Healthwatch recommends that excise taxes are increased by 50%, with the effect of raising the overall price of alcohol by 10%. Given price elasticities, this level of increase is estimated to have an effect of reducing population consumption by around 5%. Increases in excise tax have been recommended by the New Zealand Law Commission in 2010, and by the Prime Minister’s Chief Science Advisor.(1,58) 8.1.2 Table 5 shows the potential effects of the tax increase on the retail price of a selection of alcohol products (as at 1 January 2018). Cheaper alcohol products are affected the greatest in terms of relative price increases. Table 5. The impact on prices (of some alcoholic beverages) from a 50% increase in excise tax. Wine 750ml Wine 750ml 3L cask wine (11% alcohol) Beer (15 pack 330ml 4%) Spirits 1L (37.2% alcohol) RTD 330ml (5% alcohol) Retail price $7.00 $15.00 $19.79 $22.99 $29.99 $1.50 Tax paid at current levels $2.18 $2.18 $8.72 $5.75 $19.38 $0.48 Tax paid at 50% increase $3.27 $3.27 $13.07 $8.63 $29.53 $0.72 New price (incl GST) $8.25 $16.25 $24.80 $26.30 $41.31 $1.78 Increase in price $1.25 $1.25 $5.01 $3.31 $11.32 $0.28 % increase in retail price 17.9% 8.4% 25.3% 14.4% 37.7% 18.4% \* Note: the HPA-levy is not included in the above prices 8.2 Increasing excise taxes to correct for externalities 8.2.1 As shown earlier, there is a significant gap between the level of alcohol excise revenue ($1b) and the cost to society from alcohol-related harm ($5b).(2,6) 8.2.2 To address this gap, revenue from alcohol excise needs to be increased. 23 8.3 Correcting the current tax advantage for wine products 8.3.1 As described earlier, excise tax rates on beer and spirits are calculated by the alcohol content of the beverage, whereas wine (up to 14% alcohol) is taxed per volume of beverage. The rate for wine is set as if all wine had a flat rate of alcohol content of 10%. It is understood that this level was set at a time when the alcohol strength in bottles of wine was lower and alcohol content was difficult (and costly) for winemakers to assess with accuracy.(21) 8.3.2 This flat rate has meant that the amount of excise tax in a 12% alcohol content bottle of wine is equivalent to that in a 14% strength bottle of wine. However, for all beer and most spirits, higher strength products comprise more excise tax as tax is determined by the amount of alcohol in the product. The under-taxing of higher strength wines was presented in Figure 1. 8.3.3 An equivalent tax rate of 10% alcohol strength in wine is no longer meaningful in 2018. Over recent times, global wine products have increased, on average, by 2% strength in alcohol (e.g., from 10% to 12%). Today, it would be difficult to find bottles of wine in the New Zealand market that have an alcohol content of 10%. Rather many bottles of wine are in the range of 12-14% alcohol strength. 8.3.4 This means that at present, a 12.5% and 13.5% alcohol strength 750ml bottle of wine attract an excise of $2.18 each. But if the rate was based on alcohol strength (the same rate as beer), they should each attract an excise of $2.72 and $2.94 respectively. 8.3.5 It is likely that the current approach simply encourages production of wine with a high alcohol content that consumers then perceive is high quality. 8.3.6 It is unfair to other types of alcohol products and unfair to New Zealand taxpayers that wine products are taxed at a rate below their alcohol content. If all wine products were taxed at a level of 14%, more than $100 million dollars in extra revenue would be received by the Government to distribute to public services. 8.3.7 Today, it is possible for many large winemakers to determine the alcohol content within their batches of wine. The labelling requirements for all bottles requires that the alcohol strength be reported on the label, with a 1.5% margin of error for alcohol strength. This large margin is surprising given that European Union Food Standards require an accuracy of alcohol content within a 0.5% range for the labelling of wine products. (59) 8.3.8 Alcohol Healthwatch recommends that wine is taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage sold. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on an equivalent of 10% alcohol strength to 14% alcohol strength. 24 8.4 Increasing excise taxes to intentionally modify behaviour 8.4.1 Approximately 11% of the New Zealand population will develop alcohol abuse (7%) or dependence (4%) on alcohol during their lifetime. (60) For a product that is addictive, alcohol taxes can assist to address the harms that are associated with its addictive properties.(1) Taxes may also reduce the likelihood that heavy drinkers progress to become dependent drinkers. 8.4.2 In 2014, the Ministry of Justice (49) examined the effectiveness of a range of alcohol pricing policy options. In relation to the smallest excise tax increase examined (82%), the largest impact was on harmful drinkers (Table 6). The larger effects on harmful drinkers were estimated to be driven by their responsiveness to the considerable increase in the price of spirits. It is important to note that increases in alcohol taxes can bring about reductions in the overall quantity of alcohol consumed per year as well as in the amount consumed in an occasion. This has implications for the prevention of both acute and chronic harms associated with alcohol use. Table 6. Changes in annual and drinking occasion consumption following excise tax increases of 82%. (49) % change in annual volume of alcohol consumed % change in alcohol purchased per drinking occasion All Low- risk Increased risk Harmful All Low- risk Increased risk Harmful 82% increase -12.2 -11.5 -11.8 -13.1 -8.6 -5.5 -9.7 -10.8 8.4.3 Although the Ministry of Justice modelled consumption changes based on an 82% increase (which would achieve a minimum price of $1 per standard drink), the report suggested that smaller excise increases would also have net benefits. 8.5 Increasing excise taxes to adjust for increasing affordability 8.5.1 As described in detail earlier, the inflation-adjusted excise rates have not kept pace with increasing incomes in New Zealand. 8.5.2 Alcohol Healthwatch strongly recommends that excise rates are adjusted annually to take into account changing incomes. 8.5.3 In 2008 in the United Kingdom, the affordability of alcohol was addressed through the implementation of a duty escalator. Overnight, alcohol duty rates increased by 6 per cent above the rate of inflation. For the next four years, alcohol duties increased by 2 per cent above the rate of inflation.(61) Unfortunately, the affordability-related duty escalator was scrapped by 2014 (reported to be due to an intense lobbying campaign by the alcohol industry in response to pub closures). 25 8.6 Increasing excise taxes has public support 8.6.1 There is strong public support for raising the price of alcohol. In a nationally- representative UMR poll in February 2018, almost two-thirds (63%) of people polled supported increasing the price of alcohol to fund mental health and addiction services. Higher levels of support were found among NZ First voters (84%), 30-44-year-olds (68%), people of Pacific ethnicity (70%) and those with lower incomes (Table 7).(62) Table 7. Public support for alcohol price increases. (62) Do you strongly support, somewhat support, neither support nor oppose, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose that: The Government should increase the price of alcohol, as long as the extra money is used for mental health and addiction services Strongly support + Somewhat support Party Support National 59% Labour 66% NZ First 84% Green 74% Other 58% Ethnicity Pacific 70% Age Group 30-44 68% Household Income Under $50,000 65% Between $50,000 and $100,000 64% 8.7 Increasing excise taxes is the fairest approach for non-drinkers 8.7.1 In 2016/17, one in five New Zealanders reported not having consumed alcohol in the past 12 months. When examined by ethnicity, 44% of Asian and 42% of Pacific adults did not drink alcohol in the past year. (13) 8.7.2 Non-drinking taxpayers continue to bear the costs associated with New Zealand’s drinking culture. By increasing alcohol taxes, the increased costs are internalised to the sellers and drinkers, instead of requiring every taxpayer to subsidise the cost of alcohol-related harm. When excise taxes increase, non-drinkers pay nothing extra yet significantly benefit from reductions in personal harm. 8.8 Increasing excise taxes is fair on low-risk drinkers 8.8.1 Those who generate the greatest externalities, i.e. high-risk drinkers, should pay the most in alcohol excise tax. A fair approach to alcohol tax would be one that has the most impact on heavy drinkers and the least impact on low-risk drinkers. 8.8.2 We are cognisant of the balance that must be achieved in setting the excise tax rate without unfairly impacting low-risk drinkers. 26 8.8.3 Currently, societal costs of alcohol-related harm are also being borne by low-risk drinkers who consume alcohol within New Zealand’s low-risk drinking guidelines.(50) Alcohol Healthwatch believes that low-risk drinkers are likely to pay small amounts of alcohol excise tax per year and so will only pay a modestly small amount more if taxes are raised. 8.9 Moderate drinkers will have a modest increase in costs 8.9.1 In New Zealand, it is estimated that 50% of all alcohol in New Zealand is consumed in heavy drinking occasions. Although a significant proportion of alcohol is consumed by hazardous and very heavy drinkers, it is also estimated that 50% of ‘moderate’ drinkers engage in heavy drinking during the year. (1) 8.9.2 Moderate drinkers (those that not classified as hazardous drinkers) comprise the majority in New Zealand drinkers. With a number of them also engaging in binge or heavy drinking during the year, collectively they comprise the largest share of alcohol’s burden on society. So although they are individually responsible for fewer harms than hazardous drinkers, the sheer number of moderate drinkers means that this group could also benefit from reductions in consumption. 8.9.3 In addition, it is not just heavy drinking occasions that could be addressed through tax increases. A number of moderate drinkers may also exceed the low-risk drinking guidelines (more than 2 or 3 standard drinks per day for women and men, respectively) placing themselves at risk of chronic health harms resulting from regular alcohol use. 8.9.4 Too often, the focus on the importance of alcohol taxes has been in relation to the acute harms caused by excessive drinking, despite cancer being the greatest cause of death attributable to alcohol among New Zealand women (of which breast cancer is most common).(40) 8.9.5 The Law Commission found that in 2007-08 light and moderate drinkers (50% of NZ drinkers) paid only $38 per person in excise taxes per year, whereas the top 10% of heavy drinkers paid over $1300 per person per year. In 2014, an excise tax increase of 82% was estimated to result in an annual increased spend of $92 among low-risk drinkers, $305 among increased-risk drinkers and $710 among harmful drinkers. (49) Costs associated with a 50% increase will clearly be lower than the figures presented above.(1) 8.9.6 Alcohol Healthwatch suggests that the costs borne by non-excessive drinkers from increased excise rates are modest: the reduction in the external cost of heavy and moderate drinkers is greater than any welfare loss experienced by light drinkers who never drink heavily or regularly. 27 8.10 Excise tax increases can be considered ‘progressive’ for low income groups 8.10.1 Effective public policies are required to reduce persistent and growing disparities in alcohol-related harm. (44) 8.10.2 In New Zealand in 2016/17, those living in the most deprived areas were 1.45 times (95% Confidence Interval 1.20 - 1.75) more likely to be classified as hazardous drinkers. (13) In 2015/16, those living in most deprived areas were 1.39 (1.03-1.86) times more likely to be hazardous drinkers. (10) 8.10.3 The differences in the prevalence of hazardous drinking also give rise to inequities in the prevalence of alcohol-related harm. New Zealand drinkers living in the most deprived areas are more likely to suffer harm from their own drinking and from the drinking of others. (63) 8.10.4 Alcohol Healthwatch believes that the regressiveness of alcohol taxes in economic terms needs to be considered against their significant potential to reduce health inequalities (i.e. to be progressive). (40,64) 8.10.5 In Australia, lower income groups have been found to be more price responsive than moderate drinkers and higher income groups. (19) 8.10.6 Given that low income groups experience higher levels of alcohol-related harm, they stand to be benefit the most from alcohol price increases. As such, significant equity gains can be achieved from alcohol pricing policies. 8.10.7 In addition, as low income populations are less likely to drink they are in effect subsidising the cost of alcohol harms among higher income drinkers. In 2016, New Zealand adults in the most socioeconomically deprived areas were less likely to have consumed alcohol in the past year (70%) than adults in the least deprived areas (86%). This is a matter of fairness. 8.10.8 Drinkers who reduce their consumption of alcohol in response to higher prices can find themselves with more money in their weekly or monthly budget. If people spend less money on alcohol, they will spend more money on other goods, which will create jobs elsewhere in the economy. (22) 8.10.9 It is important to note that price increases will put some people under financial pressure if they choose not to reduce their consumption. Therefore, it is important that there are appropriate and accessible treatment and intervention options available and these are heavily promoted. 28 8.11 Increasing excise to create a fairer playing field between licence types 8.11.1 Excise tax increases particularly impact the price of cheap alcoholic beverages, most of which are found for sale from off-licence premises. 8.11.2 New Zealanders now purchase around 75% of their alcohol from off-licences. (65) The differential in prices between off-licences and on-licences may contribute to New Zealand having the 3 rd highest level of pre-loading, as found in a 25-country study. (66) Although the price differential was not found to be associated with pre-loading in this study, the study excluded the differences in price for spirits and wine between licence types (which are often much larger than the differences in prices for beer alone). 8.11.3 Pre-loading is a significant risk factor for violence in night-time entertainment districts. A high quality study in Hamilton (67) found that mean breath alcohol concentrations were significantly higher among those who engaged in pre-drinking than those who did not, with the effect of pre-drinking on breath alcohol concentration being larger for women than for men. 8.11.4 Excise tax increases that result in prices at off-licences increasing more than prices at on-licences may contribute to reducing the differential in price between licence types. In the UK, the hospitality sector has been supportive of minimum unit pricing policies for this reason. 8.12 Legislating the earmarking of increased tax revenue 8.12.1 Alcohol Healthwatch believes that alcohol excise tax revenue should be earmarked to reduce the harms associated with hazardous drinking. Public support points to taxes being earmarked to support funding of the mental health and addiction sector. 8.13 Enhancing the effectiveness of increased excise taxes by implementing other evidence-based alcohol control policies 8.13.1 Alcohol Healthwatch recommends that the implementation of other evidence-based alcohol control policies will enhance the effectiveness of increased excise taxes. 8.13.2 In particular, measures are required to reduce the availability of alcohol through restricting the density and location of outlets in addition to reducing the length of their trading hours. These approaches are underpinned by strong evidence.(1,68–74) 8.13.3 In addition, measures are required to restrict alcohol advertising and sponsorship, as recommended by the Ministerial Forum on Alcohol Advertising and Sponsorship. (75) 8.13.4 Other measures to enhance the effects of tax increases include the implementation of screening and brief interventions in primary and secondary care as well as implementation of measures included in New Zealand’s Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Action Plan. (31) 29 Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? 9. Alternative approaches to taxing alcohol products 9.1 A scaled volumetric excise tax structure 9.1.1 Alcohol Healthwatch suggests that alcohol products should be taxed proportional to alcohol content, with a higher rate for high strength beverages (especially spirits). This approach has also been recommended by others. (21,61) 9.1.2 Spirits are, on average, cheaper to produce and distribute than other drinks. It is also claimed that they should be taxed a higher rate as they are more prone to ‘over-pouring’ (i.e. exceeding standard measures in their servings).(21) 9.1.3 A volumetric approach is also likely to be the fairest approach for moderate drinkers, given higher alcohol strength products (which would receive the highest tax rate under volumetric taxing) are more likely to be preferred by heavy drinkers (64) 9.1.4 High quality modelling by the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group examined the most effective tax structure and pricing policies to reduce alcohol consumption and alcohol- related harm especially among low-income heavy drinkers. To achieve a 4.3% reduction in population-level alcohol-related mortality and target a reduction in inequities in harm, volumetric taxation and minimum unit pricing policy were found to be the most effective methods compared to excise tax methods which included duty bands of alcohol strength and ad valorem tax.(64) 9.1.5 These findings are likely to have applicability given heavy drinkers in New Zealand also disproportionately purchase lower price products.(69) 9.1.6 It is suggested that a volumetric tax structure, whereby all alcohol is taxed proportional to alcohol content, positively encourages the production of low strength but high quality beverages. (22) This approach is also suggested to generate more tax revenue. (22) 9.2 Increase transparency in relation to the trade of alcohol 9.2.1 Alcohol Healthwatch recommends that legislation be implemented to require all alcohol manufacturers, importers and wholesalers to file annual returns to the Government. 9.2.2 The collection of this information is essential to design and implement an effective tax structure and pricing policies. The World Health Organization recommends that governments collect information including market shares of alcoholic beverage 30 categories for on-licence and off-licence alcohol sale, unrecorded consumption (e.g. home grown products, duty-free), as well as cross-price elasticity.(22) 9.2.3 Alcohol Healthwatch firmly believes that increased transparency in the reporting of alcohol companies on their gross revenue and accounts is required. 9.2.4 While some information, such as unrecorded consumption, can be difficult to collect, Alcohol Healthwatch recommends that alcohol manufacturers and importers are required to provide more detailed information on the amount of alcohol products they have released for sale in New Zealand market. 9.2.5 Alcohol Healthwatch believes that this approach will also increase transparency to the public and provide for better monitoring of tax avoidance behaviour. 9.2.6 Legislation to mandate alcohol returns could borrow from the legislation that requires the same for tobacco companies. Under section 35 of the Smokefree Environments Act, all tobacco manufacturers and importers must file an annual return to the Director- General of all the tobacco products (by types, by brands and by weight) released for sale in the New Zealand market. This includes the price and quantity of each product (up to the level of brand variant) released to the market. These annual returns are publicly available. 9.2.7 An examination of tax aggressiveness by Australia’s major alcohol producers (many of whom are the same major producers in New Zealand) found that many companies made consistent losses and paid little-to-no tax. This was deemed by the researchers as a potential sign of aggressive tax behaviour. 9.2.8 The high-quality analysis found that the wine industry made small tax contributions to the Australian community despite having revenues four to five times that of the two beer companies examined who paid twice as much tax. (76) 9.2.9 These findings are likely to have applicability to the New Zealand context given the same companies operate in the New Zealand market. One report in the New Zealand context did find alcohol companies shifting their pre-tax incomes to low-tax countries. (77) Alcohol Healthwatch recommends increased vigilance of taxes paid by the international alcohol companies operating in New Zealand (the majority of New Zealand’s largest alcohol producers are overseas-owned). 9.3 Increase the Health Promotion Agency levy to replace alcohol sports sponsorship (or all alcohol sponsorship) 9.3.1 The current Health Promotion Agency levy adds a few cents or more to the price of one litre of every alcoholic beverage (regardless of alcohol strength). Each year it contributes approximately $12 million dollars to the alcohol work of the Health Promotion Agency.(78) 31 9.3.2 Currently, the levy is not indexed at inflation. This has the effect of reducing the purchasing power of the Health Promotion Agency to fund alcohol harm reduction programmes. 9.3.3 Alcohol Healthwatch recommends that the Health Promotion Agency Levy is increased to address the harms from alcohol sponsorship. 9.3.4 By trebling the levy, the revenue from the Health Promotion Agency levy could increase to $36 million per year (Table 8). Table 8. Comparison between current HPA levy and the scenario of tripling the current rates. HPA Levy Current rates Triple the current amount of HPA levy Beer (2.5% ABV) 1.6152 cents per litre 4.8456 cents per litre Wine 1.6152 cents per litre 4.8456 cents per litre Spirits (23%+ ABV) 12.4064 cents per litre 37.2192 Estimated revenue from HPA levy for 2017 $12 million $36 million Source: (78,79) 9.3.5 This increased revenue could be earmarked to replace alcohol sports sponsorship, which is estimated to provide $23 million to sports in New Zealand, $14 million of which is indirect cash payments to clubs. Rugby receives 75% of all alcohol sports sponsorship funds. (80) 9.3.6 Replacing alcohol sports sponsorship was recommended by the Ministerial Forum on Alcohol Advertising and Sponsorship. (75) 9.3.7 A sponsorship replacement model was used when tobacco advertising was prohibited in the 1990s. The Health Sponsorship Council was established and funded from tobacco levies to replace tobacco sports sponsorship. 9.3.8 In a UMR poll in February 2018, 62% of New Zealanders supported restricting alcohol advertising and sponsorship in the same way as tobacco advertising and sponsorship. (62) 9.4 Implement Minimum Unit Pricing alongside excise tax increases 9.4.1 To enhance the effectiveness of tax increases, Alcohol Healthwatch recommends the implementation of a Minimum Unit Pricing policy that requires every standard drink to be sold for no less than $1.40. 9.4.2 This minimum price would be indexed at both inflation and affordability. 32 9.4.3 On May 1, 2018, Scotland will implement its Minimum Unit Pricing policy. The Northern Territory in Australia will implement their policy on July 1, 2018. Other jurisdictions have drafted relevant legislation or have the policy on their agenda, including Ireland, Wales, and Western Australia. 9.4.4 Minimum Unit Pricing has been used in Canada for many years, with high quality research demonstrating that it is one of the most effective pricing approaches to reduce inequities in alcohol-related harm. (81) 9.4.5 Further information on the effectiveness of this policy in the New Zealand setting can be found in the report conducted by the Ministry of Justice in 2014. (49) 10. Conclusion 10.1 Alcohol Healthwatch strongly supports the review by the Tax Working Group seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders. 10.2 Alcohol Healthwatch urges the Group to reconsider the level at which alcohol excise tax is set, and recommends all excise rates are increased by at least 50%. Particular attention needs to be directed to the under-taxing of wine. 10.3 Alcohol use significantly affects three of the four capitals as outlined in the Living Standards Framework. Alcohol Healthwatch strongly recommends that greater weight is given to the harm to others from alcohol use in the determination of excise rates. 10.4 Fairness, above all, needs to be the key goal of setting alcohol excise tax. This particularly extends to the Crown’s Treaty of Waitangi obligations. 33 11. References 1. New Zealand Law Commission. Alcohol in our Lives: curbing the harm.

P 0800 371 471 F 0800 371 001 W publictrust.co.nz 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand By email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz FUTURE OF TAX: PUBLIC TRUST SUBMISSIONS Public Trust welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Tax Working Group’s Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper. About Public Trust Public Trust is New Zealand’s largest and most experienced trustee services organisation. We are best known for our expert Wills and estate administration services, but also offer Kiwis a full range of estate planning services, including legal, financial, investment, trusts, and estate protection. We operate through a network of 23 customer centres around New Zealand. Our specialist advice has helped thousands of families and businesses look after what’s important to them – we’re all about encouraging New Zealanders to preserve the present and secure the future. Impact of proposed new taxes on Public Trust’s customers Public Trust has considered the specific challenges raised in the Working Group’s background paper from the perspective of our customers, with a particular focus on the impact of a capital gains tax and land tax. We are concerned that a capital gains and/or land tax may unfairly overburden one group of New Zealanders and may have unintended consequences for many of our customers. Public Trust manages over 4500 life interest estates and trusts, and the average age of our trust settlors is 59 years. We also manage 25 farms. Most of our customers have lived through a share market crash and a global financial crisis that have driven them to save and invest in a particular way under the current tax regime. Many of them are also retired or close to retirement age with minimal income and therefore have limited scope to change their current investment approach to accommodate a new tax regime. We believe that the introduction of a capital gains tax and/or land tax may have unintended consequences for many of our customers, including the following, which we would encourage the Working Group to consider in its assessment of any such taxes. 1. Increased rental costs a) Many of Public Trust’s customers are elderly and/or vulnerable, so are not in a position to purchase a property. We expect that such customers have limited ability to adjust to \[1\] increased rents and will struggle to meet higher rents that could occur as a result of a land tax, with their limited income. As a consequence, they may be forced to rely on social welfare to supplement their income or on the health system for accommodation 2. Impact on vulnerable customers and their family members a) A similar situation could occur where a customer moves into residential care but retains their property for a family member (who is often in a vulnerable position) to live in or to provide income to pay for their residential care. If the property is no longer deemed a ‘family home’ (because it is held in a trust or life interest estate) the customer may be left with a land tax they cannot afford due to limited cash flows, which may result in the sale of the property. Any family member living in the property will need to find alternative accommodation and may also be forced to rely on social welfare for supplemental income or the health system for accommodation. b) If the land of a retirement village is subject to land tax, we expect that the cost will be passed on to the retirement village residents. Again, these residents have limited income to cover the increased cost. 3. Potential impact on farms a) Public Trust currently manages 25 farms. As tax on farms is within the scope of Working Group, a land tax may significantly increase the cost of owning and operating a farm given the extensive land that they operate on. Farmers may not have the cash flow to pay for any land tax. 4. In the context of a trust or estate, who bears the cost of a land tax or capital gain and when it is paid a) As an example, Public Trust has a number of life interest estates where a will maker allows a spouse or other family member to live in their property for the rest of the spouse/family member’s life. A life interest estate can last for more than 20 years, over which time the property is expected to increase in value. If the property is no longer considered the ‘family home’, the final beneficiaries (who receive the property when the life tenant dies) will either be expected to cover land tax for the duration of the life tenancy (without having any benefit of the property), or if capital gains is paid on realisation, they will be left with a large tax bill to pay. b) There could be further tension between the income and capital beneficiaries of a trust or estate. For example, if a life interest with a share portfolio is subject to capital gains tax, the life interest holder will receive the income but the final beneficiaries will be taxed on any capital gain on the underlying shares, while not receiving any income benefit during the term of the life interest. 5. Impact on investment approach a) A tax on realised gains (consistent with most capital gains tax regimes worldwide) may distort the buy and sell decisions of investors. Such a tax may encourage investors to avoid selling investments in an attempt to delay or forgo the requirement to pay the capital gains tax. This is turn may lead to imprudent asset allocations, especially for aging investors, who may be best served with low-risk, income generating investments, but may be unwilling to sell their high risk, non-income generating investments, especially if these have been held for a long time and have seen significant gains since acquisition. Administrative challenges with proposed new taxes We expect that the introduction of a capital gains or land tax will result in increased costs to customers (in addition to the cost of the tax itself). There will also be additional complexity relating to numerous maters, including the following which affect our customers, which would require careful consideration and clarity: 1. the definition of ‘family home’. A clear definition is required for ‘family home’ or ‘owner occupied home’, particularly in relation to life interest estates and trusts; 2. considering if the cost of property improvements is tax deductible against the capital gain. The cost of a capital gains tax to the customer will include determining/recording the cost of improvements, determining the extent of any tax deduction and obtaining market valuations on a more regular basis; and 3. property held in a trust or life interest estate with multiple beneficiaries. There may be a situation where some beneficiaries dispose of their share which is taken over by the other beneficiaries, and the beneficiaries who maintain or increase their share of the property are subject to capital gains tax. Other suggestions We also have a broader change that the Working Group may wish to consider: 1. Tax concessions on passive income To incentivise saving and investment and to enable those who are dependent on passive income (especially retirees) to earn greater after-tax income to cover their living costs, the Working Group may wish to consider introducing a tax free savings scheme (such as an Individual Savings Account (ISA) in the UK). Conclusion In summary, we would encourage the Working Group to consider that any capital gains or land tax may unfairly overburden one group of New Zealanders and result in unintended consequences and complications for Public Trust’s customers, most of whom are not in a position to fund the additional tax. We also encourage the Working Group to carefully consider the impact that a capital gains or land tax would have on New Zealand’s vulnerable population in the situations we have outlined above. Thank you for considering our submission. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you require any further information on the matters raised. Yours sincerely Bob Smith Chief Executive Public Trust \[1\] \[1\]

Hawke’s Bay District Health Board supports the Group’s review seeking to identify a fair and progressive tax system that positively impacts the well-being of all New Zealanders. Although we understand the broad impact of taxation on health in New Zealand, this submission will be restricted to a call for a review of the current approach to alcohol excise taxation. Hawke’s Bay District Health Board believes that increases in alcohol excise rates are urgently required to address the growing number of hazardous drinkers in our region. We believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society, as highlighted by the Law Commission’s Alcohol in our lives: Curbing the harm 2010 review. Current levels of alcohol-related harm in New Zealand, and in Hawke’s Bay in particular, demonstrate that excessive and inappropriate consumption of alcohol is widespread. Indeed, recent data shows that the prevalence of hazardous drinking in Hawke’s Bay is significantly higher than the national average and one of the highest in New Zealand. 1 Rates of hazardous drinking in our region are also increasing (by up to 10 percent from 2006/07 to 2011/14). Of particular concern are the high rates of hazardous drinking among Hawke’s Bay young people (41 percent of 15-24 year olds) 2 and the increasing wholly attributable alcohol hospitalisations for Māori (increased 43.8 percent between 2011/12 and 2014/15) 3 . 1 Centre for Public Health Research, Massey University Environmental indicators programme, 2018. 2 New Zealand Health Survey, 2011/14 3 Hawke’s Bay District Health Board data. 2016. Corporate Services \[1\] We know that alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin and methamphetamine. 4 Alcohol-related harm in Hawke’s Bay burdens our hospital and wider health system and it is conservatively estimated to cost Hawke’s Bay District Health Board $3 million each year. 5 In contrast, alcohol is more affordable today than it has ever been and the approximately $1 billion dollars the Government receives from alcohol excise tax does not come close to matching the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to New Zealand individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). Recommendations In order to reduce the burden of alcohol-related harm, we would like to recommend the following:  Increase the alcohol excise rates by at least 50 percent across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10 percent (as recommended by the Law Commission in 2010)  Annually adjust the excise rates to take into account changes in income, for example, Consumer Price Index (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers)  That all alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc) be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Some products are currently taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. We stress that it is alcohol that causes the harm. In conclusion, we believe that whilst the primary objective is to drive the necessary behaviour change, to achieve fairness alcohol excise tax revenue should be earmarked to fund mental health and addiction services - services that are struggling as a result of a proliferation of alcohol in society. Whilst minimum unit pricing is an alternative taxation method, the industry gets to profit more with less being passed to the state, which loses out on the opportunity to enhance services. Evidence shows that increasing excise taxation is pro-equity, making this an important progressive taxation method. It shows that low-income hazardous drinkers are most impacted, with the health benefits accruing to this group more than to others. We are able to speak to our submission, if required.

Submission on the Future of Tax To: The Tax Working Group submissions@Taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Submitter: Helen Leahy Pouārahi / Chief Executive Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu 10 Show Place, CHRISTCHURCH 8024 www.teputahitanga.org INTRODUCTION Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Future of Tax in New Zealand. Whānau Ora is based on the belief that a healthy whānau is not reliant on indicators of deprivation but is instead driven by a belief in their own inherent wealth. Whānau wellbeing is intimately tied to the concepts of caring – the application of manaakitanga, wairuatanga, and ukaipotanga. Whānau Ora recognises the collective strength and capability of whānau to achieve better outcomes in areas such as health, education, housing, environment, employment and income levels. Our relationships encourage inter-dependence; we know that our strength comes through all of us taking up our roles and responsibilities to one another. Whānau Ora Navigators support whānau to be self-determining and navigate whānau to champion their aspirations. Our Whānau Ora Navigators work with whānau to:  support them through crisis and link them to the appropriate services  collaborate, broker services and advocate; ensuring their needs are addressed in a holistic way.  Help develop a step-by step plan to achieve their goals and aspirations.  Identify and strengthen support networks.  Reduce any risk of harm to whānau.  Uplift mana and create opportunities for cultural connectedness. The Whānau Ora approach is unique because it:  recognises a collective entity,  endorses a group capacity for self-determination,  has an inter-generational dynamic,  is built on a Māori cultural foundation,  asserts a positive role for whānau within society and,  can be applied across a wide range of social and economic sectors. Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu is the Whānau Ora Commissioning Agency for the South Island. We work to respond to whānau innovation, to foster and grow inspirational ideas that are whānau-centred, intergenerational, locally driven, and provide direct impact for whānau to enable independent transformational change. We represent a legal partnership of Ngā Iwi o Te Waipounamu, the nine iwi of the South Island: Ngāi Tahu; Ngāti Rarua; Ngāti Tama; Ngāti Kuia; Ngāti Koata, Rangitane o Wairau, Ngāti Apa ki te Rā To; Ngāti Toa Rangatira, Te Atiawa. This unique initiative is the first time, ever, that the iwi has come together for a common cause to trailblaze a new model that reflects the aspirations of ngā iwi as they relate to whānau. As our name suggests, we reflect the convergence of the rivers of Te Waipounamu, bringing sustenance to the people and reflecting the partnership’s founding principle of whanaungatanga. GENERAL COMMENTS Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu supports the purpose of the Tax Working Group, which has been established to examine improvements in the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. We acknowledge that the purpose of tax is to ensure we can pay for the things that we need to function as a society – health, education, an efficient and effective public transport system, a justice system, and providing for a minimum standard of living for everyone are some examples of the things provided through taxes. However, we also recognise that the wellbeing of a country is not just about finances but also about how we live together and protect our natural resources for future generations. Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu contends that it is also about ensuring that people have enough to live strong and vibrant lives. The urgency of survival issues for whānau is ongoing with rising concerns of food and fuel poverty; self-harm and suicide ideation; homelessness; and harm caused by alcohol and drug abuse. These are issues which urgently require a meaningful cross-sectoral approach and while it is not the role of the Tax Working Group to address these issues directly, any decision about a new fair and balanced tax system must be cognisant of the need to support the short and long-term health, social, economic and cultural outcomes for whānau. While the Tax Working Group does not promise a radical change to our system of taxation, it does raise some important questions for Māori to engage with. Central to this discussion is the intergenerational fairness of the tax system and how the changing dynamics of the Māori economy, and te ao Māori over the next thirty years will influence, and be influenced by, the tax system. SPECIFIC COMMENTS We note that the Tax Working Group has five key questions  What does the future of tax look like to you?  What is the purpose of tax?  Are we taxing the right things?  Can tax make housing more affordable?  What tax issues matter most to you? We also note that the Tax Working group has two main questions for Māori to consider. The first question is:  Are there parts of the current tax system that warrant review from the view of te ao Māori? Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu notes that the growth of the Māori economy is characterised by a strong focus on intergenerational sustainability, diversification and tikanga Māori. Values such as kaitiakitanga (guardianship, sustainability and care of the land), manaakitanga (the care of people and each other), and whanaungatanga (wider kinship ties), drive business, investment and distribution decisions. With respect to kaitiakitanga and how the tax system can uphold this by assisting entities to meet legislative obligations, Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu supports initiatives which engage with whānau. Many of the owners of these initiatives will be unaware of their tax entitlements and obligations prior to entering into an arrangement with the Commissioning Agency, and may find they have hefty sums to repay from overdue tax and penalties accrued. Kaitiakitanga is about meeting our responsibilities but the tax system should also uphold the value of manaakitanga and assist entities to know what is relevant and important for their enterprise. Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu has been contacted by whānau who advise that anyone who is a partner in a business and has a student loan, is expected to pay large amounts in repayment regardless of their situation. The repayment of the student loan does not consider actual living costs and an individual can be forced into a hardship situation. This may also impact on the whānau entities that Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu supports. As many of these entities are start-ups or the owners are new to business, this is not ideal and a potential solution to this dilemma would be helpful. Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu has been pleased to have contacted the Kaitakawaenga Māori for IRD located in Nelson, Greymouth, Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill. We hope that further communication between our entities and the kaitakawaenga Māori will enable greater uptake on legal compliance obligations. As an example, many of our Whānau Ora recipients may not be aware of a potential tax issue but perhaps information given at the time of applying for funding would assist in helping to address it. Any money received by recipients but not spent by 31 March may result in an income tax bill for the current year. Some of these recipients may be able to reduce the potential impacts by applying for a change of balance date, however, there is a process for doing this. We also note that many tradesmen are expected to work on contract putting all tax obligations on themselves rather than the employer and this is an area that needs be examined more closely especially when financial literacy is an issue for Māori, or they are a small business. Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu would also consider a progressive company tax for small companies compared to large companies. Aotearoa has a lot of small companies with many of them being Māori-owned and we consider it important to support them as they grow. However, we do note the challenges for some big companies that may not make very much profit, while some small companies make a lot of profit. Consideration for such an outcome may need to be examined further.  What are your ideas on how tikanga Māori might be able to help create a fairer, more future-focused tax system? While the questions posed specifically for Māori are excellent questions and a Māori perspective about tax has long been absent from tax policy discussions, Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu contends that one of the biggest challenges whānau are facing when they think about tax right now is how any new tax system will impact on their ability to feed, clothe and house their whānau. The removal of GST on items that are deemed to be healthy and necessary like fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and milk products would go some way to supporting whānau immediately. It does not matter what level the sugar and fat content of fruit or vegetables are at but rather that the full range of fruit and vegetables are available to whānau. We note that the family home is not included in this review and would support the continued exemption of the family home and the land upon which it stands. While there are parts of the current tax system that warrant a review from the view of te ao Māori such as whether there should be a capital gains tax or whether a land value tax should be implemented in New Zealand, (which will be addressed later in this submission), perhaps the question should not be how can tikanga Māori help create a fairer, more future-focused tax system; but rather how can the tax system be designed to create a more equitable outcome for Māori? If the notion of a tax system designed to create a more equitable outcome for Māori was the focus, then any answer to the five key questions and the two main questions for Māori would not only be aimed at a more equitable outcome for Māori but it would be cognisant of an arresting impact that is likely to be experienced by the next several generations of Māori who the newly improved tax system has been created to support. The Tax Working Group has highlighted that there are several future challenges including changing demographics, particularly the aging population and the fiscal pressures that these changes will bring. Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu see a role for the Māori economy in lifting New Zealand’s overall standard of living but we are also concerned about the inter- generational fairness of the tax system and how equitable this tax system is when it asks Māori to provide more and more general taxation to support retirement incomes for an aging population when Māori life expectancy is seven years less than the New Zealand average? As Pākēha New Zealand grows older and enters retirement, the more youthful Māori population comes into age and enters the workforce. While the Tax Working Group have acknowledged this shift in changing dynamics and in its call to action for Māori that “we will have an increasingly older Pākēha population that will be dependent on a larger and younger portion of working age Māori,” Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu contends that we will need a tax system that works to provide equitable opportunities for Māori in order to be able to support this older, retired Pākēha population. There is no contesting the benefits that taxation provides. However, when Māori are at the negative end of almost every social indicator there is, it is difficult to argue that the benefits of taxation have flowed equitably towards Māori. Māori are more likely to be unemployed, more likely to be imprisoned, more likely to be suffering poor health, more likely to die earlier, more likely to live in cold, damp rental housing, more likely to be renters on their own land, and more likely to be the recipients of some form of benefit or support from the government. The benefits of taxation need to be explored alongside models of how better outcomes for Māori can be achieved. While the promise of a Māori economy continues to grow, disparities also continue to persist between Māori and other New Zealanders and this will need to be considered in any decision on a new tax system. We note that the Tax Working Group is seeking solutions and have provided some thus far. Other such responses to specific questions include:  What does the Tax Working Group need to keep in mind when exploring what impact new taxes might have on Māori and Māori assets (e.g. Capital Gains Tax, wealth tax and land tax)? How should we deal with taonga assets? With respect to Capital Gains Tax, Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu supports a continued exemption of the family home and the land upon which it stands. We would also support the exemption of one rental property as this is often the investment property for a whānau retirement fund. We would also hope that any changes in the new tax system would not be onerous where Māori land ownership and the income in a whānau trust are also not subjected to an onerous tax regime and that tax exemptions would continue for those entities that have a charitable status. With respect to a Land Value Tax, Te Pūtahitanga would not support the application of such a tax particularly for Māori land which has collective ownership and often little return to its owners because the land is often underutilised due to the lack of working capital. Whenua Māori is a taonga and the likelihood of it being sold is very small. However, capital gains tax assessed on an annual basis or a land value tax has the potential to destroy Māori wealth. History details that a contributing factor to the loss of so much Māori land in the late 19 th and early 20 th century was the loading of rates onto Māori land, and the subsequent debt that kept accruing because these rates were unable to be paid but for which very little services were received. To do so again with a capital gains tax or land value tax would potentially open a new round of Māori land losses. Rates are currently charged on all land and any new land tax will need to have a consideration for this. A workable model would be if Māori land was exempt entirely from tax. In order to ensure that these past thirty years of Treaty Settlements, (which saw a return of a fraction of the assets stolen from Māori either through confiscation, or land alienation), is not an exception in the general history of New Zealand, we need a tax system that does not revert to the theft of Māori land again for the benefit of Pākēha, and a system of government that works to provide equitable opportunities for Māori.  Housing Affordability To the question of whether tax can make a home more affordable, Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu notes that housing affordability is a huge problem particularly for many Māori ad Pasifika who are more likely to be in social housing or rental properties. Owning a home does not seem like a reality for many whānau and Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu would reiterate its support of the whānau home for those who are fortunate enough to own one, continue to be exempt from any property tax.  The Environment Kaitiakitanga is about fostering and protecting the sustainability of the business and of the environment it operates within. Kaitiakitanga is how we seek to restore our ecosystems and to replenish natural resources. It is about protection, preservation and guardianship. Some might call this your ‘ecological footprint’ or footprint analysis –the mark we are making on the world. On current estimates humanity is exceeding its ecological limits by 39%; a fact which alerts us all to the urgent need to ‘do something’ to invest in the wellbeing of future generations; and the sustainability of the planet. Kaitiakitanga expresses itself in the sustainable maintenance of resources for future generations. Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu recognises the importance of a healthy environment and the seventh Pou 1 posits that whānau living in Te Waipounamu are responsible stewards of their living and natural environment. Climate change continues to impact upon all New Zealanders and using the tax system to ensure producers and consumers face the real costs of emissions and other environmental harm could be one way to meet our international obligations and especially our responsibilities to our future generations. We note that the productivity of the New Zealand economy is well below other OECD countries but we also note that many producers receive an environmental service such as the use of water at a fraction of the cost to themselves but the accompanying environmental cost – substances released into the air, water or land, the resulting pollution and the associated cost of that pollution is met by the rest of society. These environmental costs must be 1 Whānau Ora Outcomes Framework, endorsed by the Whānau Ora Partnership Group on 26 August 2015 reflected in the actual costs of the products being generated and this cost must be met by the producers in the first instance and by the consumers who buy the product. Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu would support a tourism tax particularly if Aotearoa is to cope with the large number of tourists which increases every year. This tax could be aimed at discouraging unwanted behaviours as well as supporting New Zealand’s unique species and ecosystems and could also be used to address cleaning up the large number of polluted rivers that we currently have. Te Pūtahitanga o Te Waipounamu welcomes the opportunity to meet with the Tax Working Group to discuss any aspect of this submission.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 1.1. Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu (“Te Rūnanga”) welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Tax Working Group’s Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper. 1.2. Te Rūnanga would like to acknowledge the Tax Working Group (“the TWG”) for the opportunity to make a submission. Te Rūnanga applauds the TWG’s intent to focus on Te Ao Māori and explore potential challenges, risks, and opportunities facing the tax system over the next decade and beyond. 1.3. While these are positives, Te Rūnanga is concerned with: • The issue of income equity for Māori; • The taxation treatment of Māori authorities and charities; • The potential introduction of a land and capital gains tax; • The use of environmental tax; and • Māori engagement with the tax system. 1.4. Te Rūnanga welcomes the opportunity to comment on areas of particular relevance and significance to Ngāi Tahu. Moving forward, as a Treaty Partner, Te Rūnanga expects direct engagement on these issues; specifically, any discussions with regard to fresh water. 2. TE RŪNANGA O NGĀI TAHU 2.1. This response is made on behalf of Te Rūnanga. 2.2. Te Rūnanga is statutorily recognised as the representative tribal body of Ngāi Tahu whānui and was established as a body corporate on 24th April 1996 under section 6 of Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Act 1996 (“the Act”). 2.3. We note the following relevant provisions of our constitutional documents: Section 3 of the Act States: “This Act binds the Crown and every person (including any body politic or corporate) whose rights are affected by any provisions of this Act.” Section 15(1) of the Act states: “Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu shall be recognised for all purposes as the representative of Ngāi Tahu Whānui.” 2.4. The Charter of Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu constitutes Te Rūnanga as the kaitiaki of tribal interests. 2.5. Te Rūnanga respectfully requests that this response be given the status and weight due to the tribal collective, Ngāi Tahu whānui, currently comprising over 60,000 members, registered in accordance with section 8 of the Act. Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 4 of 15 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu 2.6. Notwithstanding its statutory status as the representative voice of Ngāi Tahu whānui “for all purposes”, Te Rūnanga accepts and respects the right of individuals and Papatipu Rūnanga to make their own responses in relation to this matter. 3. INTERESTS IN THE FUTURE OF TAX: SUBMISSIONS BACKGROUND PAPER 3.1. Te Rūnanga notes the following interests: Treaty Relationship • Te Rūnanga have an expectation that the Crown will honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the principles upon which the Treaty is founded. Kaitiakitanga • In keeping with the kaitiaki responsibilities of Ngāi Tahu whānui, Te Rūnanga has an interest in ensuring that there is equitable and sustainable management of the tribal pūtea and factors that influence indicators of wellbeing for future generations. • At all times, Te Rūnanga is guided by the tribal whakataukī: “mō tātou, ā, mō ngā uri ā muri ake nei” (for us and our descendants after us). Whanaungatanga • Te Rūnanga has a responsibility to promote the wellbeing of Ngāi Tahu whānui and to ensure that the management of Ngāi Tahu assets and the wider management of resources supports the aspirations for economic and social development of iwi members. 3.2. The Act provides for Ngāi Tahu and the Crown to enter into an age of co-operation. An excerpt of the Act is attached as Appendix One, as a guide to the basis of the post-Settlement relationship which underpins this response. 3.3. The Crown apology to Ngāi Tahu recognises the Treaty principles of partnership, active participation in decision-making, active protection and rangatiratanga. 3.4. With regards to the Ngāi Tahu takiwā, Section 5 of the Act statutorily defines those areas “ south of the northern most boundaries described in the decision of the Māori Appellate Court”, which in effect is south of Te Parinui o Whiti on the East Coast and Kahurangi Point on the West Coast of the South Island (see map attached in Appendix Two). Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 5 of 15 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu 4. COMMENTS ON THE FUTURE OF TAX: SUBMISSIONS BACKGROUND PAPER 4.1. Te Rūnanga notes that there will be many challenges, risks, and opportunities facing the tax system over the next decade and beyond. These are discussed in the response below. The future environment 4.2. Te Rūnanga welcomes clear acknowledgement of the challenges faced by changing demographics. Data shows New Zealand has an ageing population that will over time be supported by a growing Māori population. To support changing demographics there needs to be major improvement in current educational, employment and income outcomes of Māori. New Zealand needs an integrated system that focuses on creating educational, employment and business development pathways while reducing income gaps and social inequities. While t he tax system can assist in improving outcomes widespread change across the whole of government is also essential . 4.3. One of the key opportunities for the tax system moving forward is how the system can support a reduction in income inequity for Māori. There is a significant gap between the average income of Māori and that of the average New Zealander. Te Rūnanga would like to see the TWG prioritise areas that: • Support growth in regional economies; • Reduce income inequity for Māori; and • Target areas of investment that improve health, educational and social wellbeing outcomes. 4.4. Te Rūnanga believes targeted responses will help address income inequity for Māori. 4.5. Te Rūnanga supports a progressive tax system and a review of income brackets including a potential exemption for those in the lowest income bracket and a review of the highest tax threshhold in line with wage inflation and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average . Bridging the income gap and reducing overall inequity will provide a number of social and economic benefits for Māori and New Zealand. 4.6. An increase in wage rates will generate tax revenue. If the income gap was reduced so that the average income for Māori was consistent with the New Zealand average, tax revenue would increase by around $700 million per annum 1. Recommendation 4.7. Te Rūnanga recommends that: • The TWG prioritise areas that help address income inequity for Māori; and • The TWG consider a review of income brackets; including an exemption for 1 Tokona Te Raki Change Agenda: Income Equity For Māori. Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 6 of 15 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu those in the lowest income bracket. Living Standards Framework 4.8. Te Rūnanga applauds the introduction of the Living Standards Framework and the growth, distribution and sustainability of areas that facilitate a more comprehensive analysis of the multiple factors relating to intergenerational wellbeing. 4.9. Te Rūnanga is undertaking a research project to assess the underpinnings of a Ngāi Tahu Living Standard. Research has shown that the inclusion of cultural capital is essential to ensure the validity and application of a Living Standard Framework. Recommendation 4.10. Te Rūnanga recommends that: • The Living Standards Framework informs all areas of tax reform; and • Cultural capital is included in the Living Standard Framework alongside the Four Capitals. Goods Service Tax (GST) exemption for particular goods 4.11. Te Rūnanga would like to see GST exemptions on fruit and vegetables and correlating GST increases on unhealthy foods such as , fast food and sugary drinks. The tax system should incentivise consumer behaviour that leads to improved outcomes and disincentivise consumer behaviour that leads to negative outcomes. Increasing the tax on unhealthy products and ensuring healthy options are available at lower cost will help improve nutrition and reduce pressure on the health system . 4.12. To mitigate the impact of loss in income through a GST exemption for healthy products , Te Rūnanga recommends increasing the tax rate on things such as : • Adverti sing of junk food and sugary drinks; • Taxes on harmful fertiliser (to reduce nitrogen pollution of waterways); and • Taxes on pesticides (to reduce non-essential usage). 4.13. Te Rūnanga believes increasing the tax rate on harmful goods will help address the negative externalities associated with the consumption and/or usage of particular goods. 4.14. Te Rūnanga would also welcome health services being eligible for tax exemptions. Tax revenue generated through the health care system should be ring-fenced and used to reduce inequities in the health care system . 4.15. The TWG should also consider the merits of including a health impact evaluation on all aspects of tax reform (including equity impact evaluation). 4.16. Te Rūnanga welcomes a tax system that is focused on supporting the most vulnerable. Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 7 of 15 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Recommendation 4.17. Te Rūnanga recommends that: • The TWG include a health impact evaluation on all aspects of tax reform; • The TWG apply GST exemptions to fruit, vegetables and health services; • Any r evenue generated through the health care system be used to reduce inequities in the health care system; and • The TWG increase tax on harmful products . Māori authority regime 4.18. Te Rūnanga considers that the Māori authority regime is working well and operates effectively to meet the needs of Members. Te Rūnanga does not propose that any changes are required. 4.19. The Māori authority regime has been in place for some time and its purpose, to pro vide an appropriate tax framework for iwi assets to be held in collective ownership, is being achieved. For Te Rūnanga, the current framework works well in serving this purpose. Māori authorities are an important feature of the Māori governance and asset ownership landscape that must be maintained to provide continuity for generations to come. 4.20. Some of the attributes of the Māori authority regime include an income tax rate reflective of the marginal tax rate of Members, low compliance costs, refundable credits , and the removal of the need for most Members to complete an income tax return (at least to the extent that they would need to claim or pay the difference between the Māori authority tax rate and their own personal tax rate). These are attributes that Te Rūnanga believe should remain in place given the underlying policy rationale of having tax levied at a rate approximating the marginal tax rate of Members. 4.21. Māori authorities are an integral part of the administration of the tax system, not only for Members but also more generally. For some Members, their most significant interaction with the tax system other than pay-as-you-earn is through the Māori authority regime, which subject to minor adjustment, meets the needs of Members. 4.22. Te Rūnanga would be very concerned if changes were proposed that would impact on the ability of Māori authorities to hold and manage their assets through a collective vehicle and for the tax on income earned to approximate that rate of the members. This is particula rly so given the intergenerational view that is taken to management of the putea that means that not all income is distributed in each year. Therefore accumulated income should continue to be taxed at the marginal tax rate of Members and any tax refund or top up for individual Members occur on distribution. Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 8 of 15 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Recommendation 4.23. Te Rūnanga recommends that: • The taxation treatment of Māori authorities remain unchanged. Charities 4.24. Te Rūnanga supports the current application and operation of the charities regime as it relates to Māori organisations, in particular its application to the Ngāi Tahu Charitable Trust, Papatipu Rūnanga and Ngāi Tahu subsidiaries. 4.25. Te Rūnanga invests millions of dollars a year into charitable programmes and activities to enhance the health, well-being, identity, and education of Ngāi Tahu whānui and other charitable purposes relating to the protection and sustainability of the natural environment within our takiwā. 4.26. Te Rūnanga understand that the TWG is considering the tax treatment of charities, including (but not limited to) the exemption from income tax for ‘tax charities’ in the Charities Act 2005, the list of donor organisations and the application of fringe benefit tax to charitable organisations. 4.27. Application of the Charities regime in its present form to Ngāi Tahu is fundamental because the kaupapa of Te Rūnanga, the Ngāi Tahu Charitable Trust, Papatipu Rūnanga and Ngāi Tahu subsidiaries are fundamentally charitable. The health, well- being, identity and education of Ngāi Tahu whānui are at the heart of why Te Rūnanga , the Ngāi Tahu Charitable Trust, Papatipu Rūnanga and Ngāi Tahu subsidiaries exist. 4.28. Te Rūnanga would be very concerned if changes were to occur to the Charities regime that would impose a tax cost on the source of funds or income that is applied by charitable entities for charitable purposes and activities. We believe that this would be in direct contravention to the Act’s intent; creating, the potential for confusion and inconsistency. Recommendation 4.29. Te Rūnanga recommends that: • The taxation treatment of charities remain unchanged. Land tax 4.30. Te Rūnanga does not support the potential introduction of a land tax as the cost of this would be borne disproportionately by Māori. Under the Treaty Settlement process, Māori negotiated in good faith for redress for historic grievances by the Crown. As part of the process, iwi (including Ngāi Tahu) received land from the Crown, as well as other assets, as full and final settlement/ redress for historic grievances. As a result, Māori hold a significant portion of freehold land in New Zealand and by virtue of this would suffer the greatest impact if a land tax were to be introduced. A land tax would, in effect, be a tax on Māori – one that would Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 9 of 15 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu exacerbate the myriad of current inequities discussed in this submission. 4.31. Iwi negotiated and settled the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act (“the Settlement”) in good faith and expect that Settlement lands will not be negatively affected by future regimes. If a land tax had been in contemplation at the time of Settlement, Te Rūnanga considers the outcomes from negotiations would have been substantially different. A land tax would decrease the effective value of the land received under the Treaty Settlement, significantly reducing the redress provided under the Settlement process. 4.32. Many iwi may not be able to absorb the impact of the decrease in effective value, or to fund a land tax. This would particularly be so where a significant amount of the land transferred through the Treaty settlement process generates very low returns as it is classified as cultural land, is poorly productive land or is encumbered by existing rights (for example, Crown Forest licenses) that impact on the financial return. A land tax may force Māori to sell the very land that was transferred to them in settlement of the historical grievances committed against them by the Crown. 4.33. Whilst Te Rūnanga do not support a land tax in any form, if a land tax is to be introduced, all land owned by iwi authorities (and their groups) should be excluded from such a tax. 4.34. If a land tax were to be imposed on all land including land transferred as redress under a Treaty settlement, Te Rūnanga would need to reconsider its position given that past claims will be negatively impacted in a significant manner. 4.35. While Te Rūnanga understand that minor changes will be made to New Zealand’s tax system over time (including changes that will affect Māori organisations), a land tax would be a significant and substantial change that would have a material impact on Māori. Recommendation 4.36. Te Rūnanga recommends that: • The TWG do not introduce a land tax; and • If a land tax is to be introduced, all land owned by iwi authorities (and their groups) should be excluded from such a tax. Capital gains tax 4.37. Te Rūnanga does not support the potential introduction of a capital gains tax (“CGT”) , for many of the reasons noted above in relation to a potential land tax. 4.38. The introduction of a capital gains tax would again be borne disproportionately by Māori as it would largely apply to land. 4.39. Whilst Te Rūnanga understand the driver behind a CGT being to encourage investment in more productive or income generating assets rather than capital appreciating assets, Māori hold a disproportionate number of low income Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 10 of 15 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu generating capital assets (particularly land) and are not afforded such flexibility to simply divest those assets in favour of other assets. As such, Māori would be caught by a CGT. 4.40. Again, iwi negotiated and settled under a particu lar regime . If a CGT had been in contemplation at the time of the Settlement, Te Rūnanga considers the outcomes from negotiations would have been substantially different. 4.41. A CGT would decrease the effective value of assets and land received by iwi / Māori land trusts, significantly reducing the redress provided under the Settlement process from that which was expected and negotiated. 4.42. If a CGT was to be imposed on all land including land transferred as redress under a Treaty settlement and/or land owned by iwi authorities (and their groups), Te Rūnanga would need to reconsider its position given that the basis of past claims will be negatively impacted in a significant manner. 4.43. If a CGT is to be implemented, all land including land transferred as redress under a Treaty settlement and/or land owned by iwi authorities (and their groups) should be excluded, it should only apply on a realised basis, and roll-over relief should be provided to allow asset ownership reorganisations to take place without tax consequences. Recommendation 4.44. Te Rūnanga recommends that: • The TWG do not introduce a CGT; and • If a CGT is to be introduced, all land including land transferred as redress under a Treaty settlement and/or owned by iwi authorities (and their groups) should be excluded from such a tax. A CGT should only apply on a realised basis, and roll-over relief should be provided to allow asset ownership reorganisations to take place without tax consequences. Environmental tax 4.45. Environmental sustainability, particularly the protection and sustainable management of the natural environment and resources for future generations is a key concern for Te Rūnanga. 4.46. The relationship with the natural environment is at the heart of the Settlement and our whenua and natural environment is fundamental to Ngāi Tahu’s identity. 4.47. As kaitiaki Te Rūnanga invests considerable money and resources to sustainably manage natural resources throughout the Ngāi Tahu tribal takiwā. This is significantly over and above the action require d by statute or regulation. Te Rūnanga is best placed to determine what the Ngāi Tahu contribution to sustainability measures should look like based on intergenerational knowledge. 4.48. Te Rūnanga believes the best results are achieved when the appropriate balance of Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 11 of 15 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu disincentives and incentives is struck. Te Rūnanga acknowledges that environmental taxes can provide some benefits however, if not implemented correctly can dis- incentivise rather than incentivise . 4.49. Te Rūnanga generally favours incentives for example, tax credits or greater deductions for those investing in environmentally friendly alternatives or other environmental initiatives. 4.50. Ngāi Tahu whānau have rights interests and responsibilities for fresh water bodies and their tributaries throughout the Ngāi Tahu tribal takiwā. Te Rūnanga does not accept an environmental tax on consumption/use of fresh water bodies as such a tax would impact on Ngāi Tahu rights and interests and impinge on our ability to exercise rangatiratanga. Te Rūnanga would however support the use of effective tax measures to dis-incentivise fresh water and plastic pollution and ring fence tax revenue to support activities that result in positive environmental benefits . 4.51. The tax system should support sustainability measures (such as pollution mitigation, riparian planting, forestry etc ). Mechanisms should err on the side of deductibility so that tax is not a barrier. Often such environmental expenditure ends up as a ‘black hole’ expenditure, with no immediate deduction available and no depreciation deduc tion certainty. 4.52. Environmental taxes must not impose any additional costs on iwi who already significantly contribute to the sustainable management, protection and restoration of the natural environment. 4.53. Any consideration of environmental taxes must take into account the contribution, funds, activities and resources already directed towards the sustainable management, protection and restoration of the environment by iwi . Recommendation 4.54. Te Rūnanga recommends that: • Te Rūnanga does not accept an environmental tax on consumption/use of fresh water bodies ; and • If an environmental tax is to be introduced, it should take into account the contribution, funds, activities and resources already directed towards the sustainable management, protection and restoration of the natural environment. Engagement by Māori with the tax system 4.55. Historically, Māori have had, as a generalisation, low levels of engagement with Inland Revenue, to the detriment of the Māori economy and in particular the next generation of rangatahi. 4.56. For example, a 33% RSCT rate automatically applies to distributions/contributions to savings schemes where the Māori organisation does not hold a Members IRD number. Te Rūnanga understands that future changes may increase the non- Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 12 of 15 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu declaration rate in some cases to 45%. This also applies to PIR tax which automatically defaults to the highest rate of 28%. 4.57. This has a significant impact on the amount of net funds that may be paid /contributed to a members saving schemes when their marginal rates would on ave rage be closer to 17.5% and in the case of pēpi, tamariki and rangatahi, 10.5%. 4.58. This is particularly true in the case of Te Rūnanga as members of our savings scheme who are 15 years and under and who do not supply an IRD number are automatically defaulted to the highest RSCT and PIR tax rate. Te Rūnanga knows by fact that 99% of those members do not have an income in excess of $14 thousand per annum. 4.59. The cumulative impact over time is significant as it affects the lifetime balance of the member and is a barrier to improving the social-economic outcomes for Māori as they are being over taxed. Recommendation 4.60. Te Rūnanga recommends that: • All members of a savings scheme aged 15 years and under who do not supply an IRD number or RSCT/PIR default to a RSCT and PIR Tax of 10.5%. Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 13 of 15 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu APPENDIX ONE: TEXT OF CROWN APOLOGY The following is text of the Crown apology contained in the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. Part One – Apology by the Crown to Ngāi Tahu Section 6 Text in English The text of the apology in English is as follows: 1. The Crown recognises the protracted labours of the Ngāi Tahu ancestors in pursuit of their claims for redress and compensation against the Crown for nearly 150 years, as alluded to in the Ngāi Tahu proverb ‘He mahi kai takata, he mahi kai hoaka’ (‘It is work that consumes people, as greenstone consumes sandstone’). The Ngāi Tahu understanding of the Crown's responsibilities conveyed to Queen Victoria by Matiaha Tiramorehu in a petition in 1857, guided the Ngāi Tahu ancestors. Tiramorehu wrote: “‘This was the command thy love laid upon these Governors ... that the law be made one, that the commandments be made one, that the nation be made one, that the white skin be made just equal with the dark skin, and to lay down the love of thy graciousness to the Māori that they dwell happily ... and remember the power of thy name.” The Crown hereby acknowledges the work of the Ngāi Tahu ancestors and makes this apology to them and to their descendants. 2. The Crown acknowledges that it acted unconscionably and in repeated breach of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in its dealings with Ngāi Tahu in the purchases of Ngāi Tahu land. The Crown further acknowledges that in relation to the deeds of purchase it has failed in most material respects to honour its obligations to Ngāi Tahu as its Treaty partner, while it also failed to set aside adequate lands for Ngāi Tahu's use, and to provide adequate economic and social resources for Ngāi Tahu. 3. The Crown acknowledges that, in breach of Article Two of the Treaty, it failed to preserve and protect Ngāi Tahu's use and ownership of such of their land and valued possessions as they wished to retain. 4. The Crown recognises that it has failed to act towards Ngāi Tahu reasonably and with the utmost good faith in a manner consistent with the honour of the Crown. That failure is referred to in the Ngāi Tahu saying ‘Te Hapa o Niu Tireni!’ (‘The unfulfilled promise of New Zealand’). The Crown further recognises that its failure always to act in good faith deprived Ngāi Tahu of the opportunity to develop and kept the tribe for several generations in a state of poverty, a state referred to in the proverb ‘Te mate o te iwi’ (‘The malaise of the tribe’). 5. The Crown recognises that Ngāi Tahu has been consistently loyal to the Crown, and that the tribe has honoured its obligations and responsibilities under the Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 14 of 15 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Treaty of Waitangi and duties as citizens of the nation, especially, but not exclusively, in their active service in all of the major conflicts up to the present time to which New Zealand has sent troops. The Crown pays tribute to Ngāi Tahu's loyalty and to the contribution made by the tribe to the nation. 6. The Crown expresses its profound regret and apologises unreservedly to all members of Ngāi Tahu Whānui for the suffering and hardship caused to Ngāi Tahu, and for the harmful effects which resulted to the welfare, economy and development of Ngāi Tahu as a tribe. The Crown acknowledges that such suffering, hardship and harmful effects resulted from its failures to honour its obligations to Ngāi Tahu under the deeds of purchase whereby it acquired Ngāi Tahu lands, to set aside adequate lands for the tribe's use, to allow reasonable access to traditional sources of food, to protect Ngāi Tahu's rights to pounamu and such other valued possessions as the tribe wished to retain, or to remedy effectually Ngāi Tahu's grievances. 7. The Crown apologises to Ngāi Tahu for its past failures to acknowledge Ngāi Tahu rangatiratanga and mana over the South Island lands within its boundaries, and, in fulfilment of its Treaty obligations, the Crown recognises Ngāi Tahu as the tangata whenua of, and as holding rangatiratanga within, the Takiwā of Ngāi Tahu Whānui. Accordingly, the Crown seeks on behalf of all New Zealanders to atone for these acknowledged injustices, so far as that is now possible, and, with the historical grievances finally settled as to matters set out in the Deed of Settlement signed on 21 November 1997, to begin the process of healing and to enter a new age of co-operation with Ngāi Tahu.” Page 15 of 15 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu APPENDIX TWO: NGĀI TAHU TAKIWĀ

Our Whakaaro  The tax system needs to enable active participation by Māori as individuals, whānau businesses and entities in the New Zealand economy.  Our primary concern is that the Tax Working Group Report makes recommendations that will lead to a more equitable tax system and considers that issues regarding tax collection and revenue distribution are closely linked. Therefore, tax collection and tax distribution should not be considered in isolation of each other.  Previous work undertaken by Te Puni Kōkiri and others confirms that Māori are paying high levels of PAYE and are heavily reliant on welfare payments but are unable to benefit from other features of the tax system such as Working for Families like non-Māori. Māori households are different in make up to non-Māori households and the tax system needs to be flexible enough to support this.  The demographics in Aotearoa are shifting and Māori will make up a greater percentage of working age people along with people of Pacific and Asian descent.  Supporting, growing and unlocking the potential of rangatahi should be a key driver in system design. At the moment working age Māori and others are being asked to support older New Zealanders that have often accumulated large wealth throughout their life and yet are able to access superannuation. Tilting the system in favour of the young is crucial whether that be through tax credits, incentives or other mechanisms. At the same time means testing of superannuation should be considered.  The Māori Economy is also growing and the tax system needs to be supportive of social and cultural values of manaakitanga, whanaungatanga and kaitiakitanga – Māori business tend to use these values to inform their decision making. We are aware of international examples where social enterprise tax rates are utilised. It should also be noted that Māori businesses and organisations are often the first into communities to support after a disaster occurs, as in Edgecumbe and Kaikōura so there should be a tax incentive in doing that work in the community.  The MEDAB believes that any consideration of a capital gains tax should be focused only on short term investments and avoid situations where the intention is to hold the asset for a long period of time. Many Māori often purchase a second home for whānau that are not in a position to own their 2 | P a g e own home so this should not be captured. Even the consideration of a capital gains tax on short term investments in property needs to be carefully addressed as there is a risk that the opportunity cost is built into rents which Māori will be more exposed to given their lower rates of homeownership and higher dependence on rental accommodation.  Māori interest in whenua tuku iho is not contestable. Our whenua is a taonga that we must protect, retain and maintain. Māori land owners face a number of challenges not faced by other New Zealand land owners such as fragmentation, multiple owners, and many years of Treaty negotiations meaning that it remains difficult to generate a return from the underlying asset. The rating burden faced by Māori land owners still remains an issue though better relationships are being formed with some local authorities. MEDAB is against any move towards a land tax as Māori should not be penalised for seeking to maintain and develop their cultural assets.  MEDAB are of the view that the Māori authority tax exemption is an outdated concept that does not fit the changing profile of the Māori economy and Māori entities. We believe that Tax incentives for a wider array of Māori owned businesses could be considered on the basis of encouraging the development of underutilised Māori assets and unlocking Māori entrepreneurial and enterprise potential.

Te Hunga Roia Māori o Aotearoa (New Zealand Māori Law Society Incorporated) Submission on Te Aheawhe Tāke (Tax Working Group’s) ‘Future of Tax’ 27 APRIL 2018 Te Hunga Roia Māori o Aotearoa The Māori Law Society Inc. 1 TE HUNGA ROIA MĀORI O AOTEAROA SUBMISSION ON TAX WORKING GROUP’S ‘FUTURE OF TAX’ 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 This submission is made for and on behalf of Te Hunga Roia Māori o Aotearoa (THRMOA), also known as the New Zealand Māori Law Society Incorporated. 1.2 THRMOA has a membership of approximately 350 Māori lawyers. In addition to these members, THRMOA also includes membership of Māori students studying towards a Bachelor of Laws or taking law related papers offered at wānanga throughout Aotearoa. 1.3 THRMOA encourages the effective networking of members, makes submissions on a range of proposed legislation, facilitates representation of its membership on selected committees, and organises regular national hui which provide opportunities for Māori to discuss and debate legal issues relevant to Māori. 1.4 When making submissions on law reform, THRMOA does not attempt to provide a unified voice for its members, or to usurp the authorities and responsibilities of whānau, hapū and iwi, but rather seeks to highlight areas of concern, and suggest further reform options where appropriate. 1.5 The current co-presidents of THRMOA are Tu’inukutavake Barron Afeaki and Ophir Cassidy. 1.6 This is a high-level submission which seeks to highlight the major issues that THRMOA sees as priorities for Māori.

KEY ISSUES 2.1 We support moves to broaden the tax base and create a fairer tax system. We are in favour of changes that would, among other things, support the inclusion of tikanga Māori into Aotearoa’s tax system and the further consideration of how taxes could apply to taonga assets. Māori authority regime 2.2 We support the retention and development of the Māori authority tax regime. 2.3 The Māori authority regime has been key to providing ownership models for whānau that reflect the traditional nature of Māori communities and economies. Any substantial changes that would reduce the economic alignment offered by the Māori authority tax regime should not be supported on the basis that this will undermine the regime and introduce a bias for individual ownership. The taxation of Land and Capital gains tax 2.4 We have concerns about how either a land tax or a capital gains tax might be applied to Māori. We consider that the unrealised taxation of tribal land held by whānau, hapū and iwi poses a significant risk to Māori tino rangatiratanga (Māori rights to self-determination and sovereignty) in respect of their own land. We consider wide exemptions for tribal land held by Māori will be necessary if the Crown is to meet their obligations in respect of Māori tino rangatiratanga. 2.5 We also consider that unrealised taxation of tribal land could lead to Māori being alienated from their lands and suggest that this risk will need to be mitigated if land held by Māori within their own tribal area is to be taxed. 2.6 Finally, we are concerned with the impacts that unrealised land taxation will have on the Treaty settlement process. Post-settlement entities tend to be comparatively “asset rich” and “cash poor” meaning they may face cashflow difficulties if they are taxed on an unrealised basis in respect of their land. More broadly, unrealised land taxation may materially impact the outcomes of the Treaty settlement process and could undermine the good faith in which Treaty settlements are carried out. 2.7 Against these concerns, we also observe that the benefits associated with protecting Māori rights and facilitating the post-settlement development of hapū and iwi may offer significant advantages as New Zealand continues to shape itself and develop. We consider these benefits also warrant consideration and speak in favour of an exemption for Māori tribal land. 2.8 We suggest that, when considering either a capital gains tax or a land tax, the Tax Working Group should have regard to the following: (a) The principles of the Treaty of Waitangi and Māori tino rangatiratanga; (b) the impact that the tax will have on the Treaty settlement process; 3 (c) the risk that the tax will have the effect of alienating Māori from their land; and (d) the benefits that might be promoted through tax concessions for tribal land held by Māori. A progressive company tax 2.9 We are generally in favour of a progressive company tax rate. Māori have, for centuries, been entrepreneurial peoples and starting a small business is a simple way to realise a more prosperous life for whānau. 2.10 Similarly, the current company tax rate applies to other body corporates (such as us) which are “for Māori, by Māori” organisations. Progressive company tax rates, which are more in-line with personal income rates would allow small Māori businesses and organisations to operate more effectively for their whānau or members. Tikanga Māori 2.11 We support initiatives that will further incorporate Tikanga Māori into the tax system. This includes having consideration to values such are: (a) Tino rangatiratanga (self-determination); (b) Whanaungatanga (family); and (c) Kaitiakitanga (stewardship). 3. SUMMARY 3.1 We encourage the Te Aheawhe Tāke to consider how the tax system can better reflect a Māori world-view. This includes: (a) Continuing to recognise the importance of the Māori authority regime for whānau, hapū, iwi and Māori organisations; (b) The recognising of the disproportionate effect a land tax or capital tax could have on whānau, hapū, iwi and Māori organisations; and (c) The implementation of a progressive company tax rate.
