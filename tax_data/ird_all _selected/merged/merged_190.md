Determination PROV24: Provisional depreciation rate for mushroom factory buildings and plant
============================================================================================

Determination PROV24 (Oct 2012) sets a provisional depreciation rate for specialised buildings and plant used to grow mushrooms on a commercial basis.

The Commissioner has been asked to review the estimated useful life and depreciation rate applicable to specialised buildings and plant used to grow mushrooms on a commercial basis. These assets consist of composting buildings (that may include bunkers that are contained within the building); phase 2 pasteurisation buildings (that may include separate mushroom spawning tunnels that are contained within the building), and growing buildings (that may include separate mushroom growing tunnels that are contained within the building), and are constructed predominantly of structural insulated panels ("SIP"). Non-SIP areas are usually constructed with concrete walls and floors, cement panel and colour steel or similar material.

The Commissioner accepts that these specialised, mushroom growing buildings and plant are exposed to a wet, humid and corrosive environment due to the material that is used in growing mushrooms and the environment that mushrooms need to grow successfully.

For these reasons the Commissioner is satisfied that the estimated useful life ("EUL") of these specialised buildings and plant (mushroom spawning tunnels and mushroom growing tunnels, when in books separately from building cost) is 33.3 years and has set a provisional depreciation rate for these assets accordingly. It needs to be noted that _Bunkers (concrete)_ are already included in the _Building and structures_ asset category, with a EUL of 20 years, and may be used by owners of bunkers used in mushroom growing.

Whether bunkers, spawning and growing tunnels are items of plant that are merely contained within a building or part of the building itself will be a question of fact. In deciding how these items should be categorised it is necessary to consider the degree of affixation and integration these items have with the building.

It also needs to be noted that these rates of depreciation do not apply to those buildings that are not directly involved in the mushroom growing process. These buildings (such as staff facilities, workshops and office areas) are not directly affected by the harsh conditions experienced in the specialised buildings and the estimated useful life will remain at 50 years.

Similarly, buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years that are converted from some other use to mushroom growing cannot be subject to this determination. This change in use may have enabled the owner to apply for a special depreciation determination, on the basis that the change of use of the building has affected the buildings estimated useful life. However, with effect from the 2011/12 income year section EE 35(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 states that the Commissioner is not able to set a special rate of depreciation for buildings. However, if the owner places the specialised plant subject to this determination (bunkers, spawning and growing tunnels) inside an existing building envelope, these items of plant may be depreciated using these new rates.

Stabilised Turf Systems
=======================

Determination PROV25 (Jun 2013) sets provisional depreciation rates for stabilised turf systems.

#### Note to Determination PROV25

The Commissioner has set provisional depreciation rates for stabilised turf systems by adding new asset classes to the "Leisure" industry category.

Stabilised turf systems comprise the playing surfaces of some sports stadiums.  The turf systems are made up of the playing surface, infill, base, drainage, and watering system.  The turf systems vary in that one involves synthetic grass and the other synthetic tufts and plastic mesh through which natural grass grows.  Ground preparation work, other than trenches cut to facilitate the installation of drainage pipes, is not depreciable as it relates to the land. 

As the determination shows, the stabilised turf system consists of a number of components that have different useful lives.

* * *

### Provisional Depreciation Determination PROV25

#### 1\. Application

This determination applies to taxpayers who own depreciable property of the kind listed in the table below.

This determination applies from the 2011/12 and subsequent income years.

#### 2\. Determination

Pursuant to section 91AAG of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the provisional determination will apply to the kind of items of depreciable property listed in the table below by:

*   Adding into the "Leisure" industry category new asset classes, estimated useful lives, and provisional diminishing value and straight line depreciation rates as listed below:

| Asset class | Estimated  <br>useful life  <br>(years) | DV rate  <br>(%) | SL rate  <br>(%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Synthetic Grass, infill and shock attenuation pads | 10  | 20  | 13.5 |
| Stabilised Turf System Matrix and infill | 10  | 20  | 13.5 |
| Base Sand, Gravel and Drainage (including drainage trenches but not including land contouring) | 20  | 10  | 7.5 |
| Watering System | 20  | 10  | 7.5 |

#### 3\. Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, words and terms have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994.

This determination is signed by me on the 5th day of June 2013.

Determination : Tax Depreciation Rates Provisional Determination Number PROV20
==============================================================================

Determination PROV20 (2010) sets a provisional depreciation rate for equestrian arenas consisting of permanent construction materials.

#### Equestrian Arenas: consisting of permanent construction materials - depreciation

* * *

The Commissioner has set a provisional depreciation rate for equestrian arenas consisting of permanent construction materials.

Equestrian arenas are made up of several layers. The first layer is a base course consisting of compacted and graded material such as rock, or rubble such as old bricks or roading material. This layer is permanent and does not come within the meaning of "depreciable property".

The next layer, the scalpings, is used to even out the base course. Sand and then a top course consisting of chopped rubber or similar material complete the arena.

Over a number of years the top three layers, (the scalpings, the sand and the top surface) will mingle and lose their separate properties. Eventually, it will be necessary to remove and replace these layers. This will not be the case with the base course which is likely to get better and more stable over time.

_Expense item_  
The top surface may degrade relatively quickly as the top three layers mingle. It may be necessary to top up this top surface from time to time as ongoing repairs and maintenance.

Determination PROV21: Tax Depreciation Rates
============================================

Determination PROV21 (2011) sets a provisional depreciation rate for a fleet tracking unit which enables the home base to monitor a vehicle's position.

#### **Fleet tracking unit – Depreciation**

* * *

The Commissioner has set a provisional depreciation rate for a fleet tracking unit.

Fleet tracking units are hardwired into a vehicle and enable the vehicle's home base to monitor the vehicle's position via mobile phone network, or an internet server. The sophistication of a fleet tracking unit can range from a simple tracking unit that shows the location of a fleet vehicle on a map, to more elaborate custom applications that can provide a dashboard-style view of all fleet vehicles on a map plus information about the condition and use of each vehicle, for example, when the vehicle exceeds the speed limit, when a fault occurs in the vehicle, or when scheduled maintenance is due. Fleet tracking units can also include the ability for fleet managers to send and receive text messages to and from the vehicle.

This provisional depreciation rate determination does not apply to plug-n-play GPS map display units used by drivers for navigation purposes.

Depreciation Rate for hydroelectric powerhouses
===============================================

Provisional Determination PROV26 (Mar 2015) sets a provisional depreciation rate for hydroelectric powerhouses.

#### Note to Determination PROV 26

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue sets a provisional depreciation rate for hydroelectric powerhouses by adding a new asset class to the "Power generation and electrical reticulation" industry category.

A hydroelectric powerhouse is integral to the function of a hydroelectric power scheme's purpose of generating hydroelectricity. 

Hydroelectric powerhouses have diverse outward appearances; however there is a relatively consistent internal design, as follows:

*   In most cases, there is an above-ground component to hydroelectric powerhouses which are covered with a form of exterior weather-proofing.  In other cases, the hydroelectric powerhouses are built entirely below-ground;
*   Hydroelectric powerhouses are generally multi-levelled structures with access galleries in order to gain access to the turbines and generators;
*   Reinforced foundations and walls are required in order to carry the water flows through the structure, contain and withstand the forces arising from the operating the turbines and generators, and carry the gantry cranes which are used to remove the turbines and generators for maintenance and/or replacement.

To the extent that the components situated within powerhouses are separate depreciable property they are to be depreciated in line with the general economic rate provided in the "Power Generation and Electrical Reticulation Systems" industry category.  For example, "Turbines (water)" at a rate of 10% DV, based on an estimated useful life of 20 years.

The provisional depreciation rate for hydroelectric powerhouses does not apply to powerhouses used as part of other forms of electricity generation.

Geothermal and thermal powerhouses
==================================

Provisional Determination PROV27 (2012) sets a provisional depreciation rate for geothermal and thermal powerhouses including buildings, turbines, and cranes.

#### Note to Determination PROV 27

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has set a provisional depreciation rate for geothermal and thermal powerhouses by adding new asset classes to the “Power generation and electrical reticulation” industry category and the “Buildings and structures” asset category.

Geothermal and thermal powerhouses are made up of a number of items of depreciable property, including:

*   The powerhouse building – the building itself, including the building’s structural elements (including foundations, pillars and beams), walls, internal floors and roof;
*   Turbines and generators, including any additional or extraordinary foundations that are directly attached to these items of plant and whose sole purpose is to provide the necessary support and stability that the turbines and generators require to function;
*   Gantry cranes, including any crane beams and rails on which the crane travels;
*   Other components of plant that are situated within a geothermal or thermal powerhouse building.

**Geothermal and thermal powerhouse buidling**  
Geothermal and thermal powerhouse buildings meet the criteria of the building test set out in Interpretation Statement _IS 10/02 Meaning of “building” in the depreciation provisions_. The component parts of a building (the structural elements (including the foundations, pillars and beams), walls, floor and roof) will always form part of the building even when they are strengthened to allow items of plant to be attached to the building. This is because the purpose of the component parts of a building is to allow the building to function as a building. For instance, where an air conditioning unit is attached to the roof of a building, the roof remains part of the building and does not form part of the air conditioning unit. Even if the roof were to be strengthened to take the weight of the air conditioning unit, because any building requires a roof, this strengthening would be undertaken to allow the building to remain functioning as a building in the particular setting for which it was designed. Similarly, attaching the gantry crane rails to the building pillars does not mean that these pillars (and their strengthened foundations) will form part of the crane. These remain part of the building and are depreciated accordingly.

Geothermal and thermal powerhouses should be depreciated at a rate of 0%, as set out in the determination below.

**Turbines and generators**  
Turbines and generators are plant and are depreciated in line with the general economic rate provided in the “Power generation and electrical reticulation systems” industry category. This provides for an estimated useful life of 20 years for “Turbines (steam)” and “Generators (steam)” at a rate of 10% DV, based on an estimated useful life of 20 years. In the context of a geothermal or thermal powerhouse, a turbine or generator includes any purpose built plant foundations that are additional to the building’s floor and foundations and that are directly attached to these items of plant in order to provide the necessary support and stability that the turbines and generators require to function.

**Gantry cranes**  
Gantry cranes are plant and are depreciated in line with the general economic rate provided in the “Lifting” asset category. This provides for an estimated useful life of 25 years for “Cranes (overhead travelling)”. In the context of a geothermal or thermal powerhouse, a gantry crane includes all of the components (including the rails that are attached to the powerhouse building) that allow the crane to function, but not those pillars or foundations which are also part of the structure of the building.

**Other components**  
To the extent that other components situated within a geothermal or thermal powerhouse building are separate depreciable property, they are to be depreciated in line with the general economic rate provided in the “Power Generation and electrical Reticulation Systems” industry category.

The provisional depreciation rates for geothermal and thermal powerhouse buildings do not apply to powerhouses used as part of other forms of electricity generation.

Provisional tax becomes even simpler for small businesses
=========================================================

**18 June 2019**

Small businesses from around the country are enjoying a simpler approach to provisional tax – one which sees them only having to pay a bill when they’re making a profit.

The Accounting Income Method or AIM is now into its second year. It’s currently provided through three accounting software providers as part of their package. That platform ensures AIM is tuned into a business’s real-time account information, which in turn helps determine a real-time tax liability.

Richard Owen, small business segment leader at Inland Revenue, says AIM is taking the guess work out of provisional tax.

“Our customers are enjoying the certainty of AIM. There’s no squirreling money away to make sure you’re not caught out at tax time, you simply pay the right amount of tax at the right time.

“AIM also significantly reduces your exposure to penalties and use of money interest, a stress many small businesses are choosing to live without.”

AIM is being used in a wide variety of industries from construction to rural services to hospitality. All that’s required is access to AIM-capable accounting software and most businesses with annual turnover of less than $5 million will be eligible.

“I would definitely encourage business owners to have a conversation with their accountant about whether AIM is right for them,” says Richard Owen.

“Some small businesses may have been wary of being early adopters but AIM has now been heavily user tested and our customers are enjoying the benefits.

“We’re hearing that it’s making provisional tax far more manageable, it’s freeing up cashflow and small business accountants tell us it’s encouraging good financial discipline for their clients.”

**Improving the customer experience**

Inland Revenue has added a few extra features for the second year of AIM to improve the customer experience - the main one is that you can now opt into AIM at any time of the year. Previously existing businesses needed to be set up and ready to go in time for the first filing but now they are free to start using AIM at any time.

In addition, Inland Revenue has made a change so that customers can pay their GST and provisional tax with one payment.

“Accountants made it clear to us that they wanted AIM to be smarter at treating the profits the company pays to shareholder employees throughout the year,” says Mr Owen. “We’ve listened and now AIM gives you two ways to do this through your software and still manage to pay the right amount of tax at the right time.

“That feedback included a strong plea from accountants and tax agents for us to turn off the stream of notifications their clients were receiving. We’ve now made that change and simplified the process to minimise any future confusion.

“AIM is improving all the time but it’s still not a finished product and we will continue to adapt and make improvements. We are extremely grateful for the feedback we’ve had from our early adopters who have highlighted the ways AIM can better align with business processes. This shows us there’s a strong demand for a pay-as-you-go provisional tax option as part of an accounting software package.

“We’re seeing many of the accountants who have taken up AIM in the first year offering it to a wider range of clients. That’s a vote of confidence that we’re heading in the right direction in our goal to simplify provisional tax for small businesses.

**How AIM can work for you**

Inland Revenue’s Richard Owen says AIM is well suited to businesses in their growth phase, particularly start-ups that need to closely manage precious cashflow.

“It’s been interesting to note that there’s been a steady flow of new businesses to AIM, which I think is a sign entrepreneurs are placing a strong importance on getting their tax obligations right from the start.”

Business with seasonal income in particular will find using AIM is an advantage. It removes the need to make provisional tax payments during the less profitable leaner months.

AIM also takes away the difficult task of needing to accurately forecast your income for provisional tax purposes. “Businesses know how hard this is to get right,” says Mr Owen. “There can be a lot riding on the accuracy of those predictions but it’s a problem AIM makes redundant when you can simply pay tax as you go.”

“Every piece of functionality has been designed to make provisional tax easier for small businesses. The last thing we want is for AIM to be creating an ongoing compliance cost burden.

“Like any new process, it takes some getting used to but based on the feedback we’re getting, once you’re set up AIM allows you to focus squarely on running your business and making money.”

AIM is currently available as part of accounting software packages from MYOB, Reckon and Xero.

Provisional tax pooling
=======================

2009 legislative amendments extend tax pooling to reassessments of most taxes and enable pooling funds to be transferred between intermediaries.

_**Sections OB 33(1), RP 17, RP 17B, RP 18(2)(c), RP 18(2B) and RP 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 15N to S, 120C(1), 120OE(1) and 173M of the Tax Administration Act 1994**_

A number of amendments have been made to the provisional tax pooling rules to ensure:

*   the legislation reflects the original policy intent of the rules;
*   to extend tax pooling to reassessments (including voluntary disclosure and resolution of dispute) of most taxes; and
*   to enable pooling funds to be transferred between intermediaries.

### Background

The tax pooling rules were introduced in April 2003 and allow compliant taxpayers to reduce their exposure to use-of-money interest on under-payments as a result of uncertainty about their provisional tax payments by purchasing funds from, or depositing funds with, a tax pooling intermediary.

Tax pooling generally involves a taxpayer depositing money with a tax pooling intermediary. The deposit earns interest. The intermediary deposits that money in his or her pooling account with Inland Revenue. The taxpayer may use the funds (deposit) in the future to pay his or her outstanding tax liabilities or sell the funds to other taxpayers who are clients of that tax pooling intermediary. If the taxpayer sells the funds, the intermediary will facilitate the sale, for a fee. On payment of the fee, the intermediary transfers the funds to the other taxpayer’s income tax account as at the date that the money was originally deposited with the intermediary. Tax pooling allows provisional taxpayers to access money at lower interest rates than if they failed to pay provisional tax on the due date and were subject to use-of-money interest. It also enables taxpayers who have overpaid their tax to get a higher return, from selling the funds, than they would receive from Inland Revenue.

### Key features

The major change to the tax pooling rules are as follows:

*   ensuring the legislation reflects the original policy intent that the only regular tax payments that tax pooling funds can be used for is provisional tax and terminal tax. Pooling funds cannot be used for regular payments of non-income tax obligations such as PAYE, FBT or GST;
*   extending the tax pooling rules to reassessments of most taxes, including voluntary disclosures and resolution of disputes;
*   enabling pooling funds to be transferred between tax pooling intermediaries to foster competition among intermediaries and ensure the integrity of the rules are maintained;
*   requiring pooling funds for payment of provisional or terminal tax liabilities to be accessed within 60 days of the terminal tax date; and
*   enabling all taxpayers to deposit money into a tax pooling account. Previously only provisional taxpayers could deposit money into tax pooling accounts.

### Application date

The changes apply from the date of Royal assent, being 6 October 2009.

### Detailed analysis

##### _Transferring funds between pooling intermediaries_

Pooling funds held with one intermediary can now be transferred to another intermediary while retaining the original deposit date. The transfer must be at the taxpayer’s request (made via their intermediary) and will apply to both existing deposits and future deposits. This will foster competition between intermediaries and also assist intermediaries entering or exiting the pooling rules. Amendments have been made to sections RP 18(2) and RP 18(2B) of the Income Tax Act.

An amendment has been made to section RP 19(1) of the Income Tax Act to enable a tax pooling intermediary to transfer funds from his or her tax pooling account either to the taxpayer or to another intermediary. Previously, a tax pooling intermediary could not transfer funds to another intermediary and retain the original deposit date.

##### _Transfers to be made within 60 days of terminal tax date_

The tax pooling legislation has also been amended (by introducing a new section RP 17B(4) and amending section RP 19(3) of the Income Tax Act) to ensure that taxpayers who want to access funds held by a tax pooling intermediary to meet their provisional tax and/or terminal tax liabilities have 60 days from their terminal tax date to access such funds. This was the original intent of the legislation.

##### _Transfers made after more than 60 days of terminal tax date_

Changes have been made to the way tax pooling funds are treated if a taxpayer accesses funds after the 60-day timeframe. A new section has been introduced (section RP 19(1B) so that pooling funds will first be applied to pay any interest that the taxpayer is liable for and then any remainder is applied to meet the person’s core tax liability. Transfer requests made more than 60 days after the terminal tax date will not be able to be made using backdated effective dates.

##### _Restricting tax pooling for regular tax payments_

The fundamental principle on which tax pooling is based is the reduction of interest in situations when the taxpayer is uncertain of the amount he or she is required to pay on the due date. If there is certainty of liability on the due date, the taxpayer is required to pay that amount and tax pooling is not available.

To reflect this intent, the tax pooling rules have been amended (sections RP 17 and new section RP 17B to ensure that the only regular tax payments that tax pooling funds can be used for are provisional tax and terminal tax. Pooling funds cannot be used for regular payments of non-income tax revenues such as GST, FBT or PAYE, as the amount due is known on the due date.

##### _Extending tax pooling to reassessments (including reassessments resulting from voluntary disclosures and disputes)_

There are other instances, apart from provisional tax, when a taxpayer can be uncertain of their tax liability, namely additional tax payable as a result of a reassessment, including reassessments resulting from a voluntary disclosure or a dispute with Inland Revenue. Changes have been introduced which extend the tax pooling rules to additional tax payable as a result of a reassessment (including from voluntary disclosures and the resolution of a dispute) for most tax types.

New section RP 17B has been introduced to extend the tax pooling rules to include reassessments of most taxes, including reassessments from voluntary disclosures and resolution of disputes.

The provision requires an assessment to be issued before tax pooling can be used. This enables an increased amount of tax, the taxpayer’s original liability, to be identified. There are instances where an original assessment is not issued, such as for PAYE and FBT. The Commissioner is still considering how the legislation will be applied for voluntary disclosures of PAYE, RWT and FBT where an assessment has not been made. Clarification will be provided in an upcoming operational statement.

It is difficult to provide for all possible reassessment scenarios in legislation. Instead, the legislation provides that tax pooling will be available for the increased amount of tax, being the difference between the taxpayer’s previously assessed liability and the amount that results from:

*   the Commissioner amending an assessment under section 113 (Commissioner may at any time amend assessments) of the Tax Administration Act.
*   the Commissioner making a determination under section 119 (Commissioner may determine amount of provisional tax) of the Tax Administration Act.
*   the assessment being made because the person or the Commissioner is deemed under section 89H as having accepted a proposed adjustment; or
*   the person is making a voluntary disclosure.

Taxpayers can use tax pooling funds provided they are requested within 60 days of:

*   the date the amended assessment is issued;
*   for disputes, the date of the resolution of the dispute; or
*   for disputes before the courts, the date on which the court proceedings are finally determined.

The Commissioner considers that tax pooling would be available for the difference between the amount of tax owing at the time the NOPA is issued resulting in the current proceedings and the final assessment. Where a dispute is before the courts, Inland Revenue considers that court proceedings are finally determined by either withdrawing from proceedings as well as a court judgment.

To provide some clarity on the legislation, Inland Revenue considers that tax pooling will be available in the following circumstances. These examples are not exhaustive and Inland Revenue will also be publishing comprehensive operational guidelines on how tax pooling will be determined, which will expand on these examples.

#### Examples of reassessments that do not involve court action

##### Example A

In 2010 the taxpayer files an income tax return for the 2009–10 income year and determines their tax liability to be $100,000. Inland Revenue reassesses the taxpayer for $150,000 under section 89C of the Tax Administration Act. This reassessed amount is disputed by the taxpayer and, following the disputes process, the parties agree on a reassessed amount of $140,000. Tax pooling funds would be available for $40,000, being the difference between the original assessed amount of $100,000 and the final reassessed amount of $140,000. The intervening reassessment is ignored.

##### Example B

In 2012 the taxpayer is reassessed again for their return for the 2009–10 income year under section 89C of the Tax Administration Act. Inland Revenue issues a reassessment increasing the last reassessed amount paid in 2010 of $140,000 to $160,000. Again the taxpayer disputes the reassessment and at the end of the disputes process the assessed amount is increased to $170,000. Tax pooling will be available for $30,000, being the difference between the $140,000 assessed in 2010 and the final reassessed amount of $170,000.

  

#### Examples of reassessments when the disputes is considered by the courts

A company’s 2009 residual income tax is $90,000. On 25 August 2010, following a NOPA, NOR, conference and the exchange of SOPs, Inland Revenue issues a Notice of Assessment increasing the company’s 2009 tax liability to $150,000. The company accepts a tax liability for $115,000, but disputes the remaining $35,000 and challenges the assessment by issuing a statement of claim.

On 24 October 2010 (60 days after the issue of the Notice of Assessment), the company’s tax pooling intermediary asks Inland Revenue to transfer $25,000 to the company’s 2009 income tax account in order to avoid the imposition of UOMI and late payment penalties on the amount of tax the company accepts is owing.

One of the following outcomes to the dispute occurs:

##### Example C

_On 15 November 2010, the company discontinues the court proceedings by filing a notice with the court_.

The company’s tax pooling intermediary has until 14 January 2011 (60 days after the discontinuance) to ask Inland Revenue to transfer up to $35,000 (the deferrable tax) to the company’s 2009 income tax account and backdate it.

##### Example D

_On 15 November 2010, Inland Revenue and the company sign a settlement agreement. The company’s 2009 tax liability is agreed at $125,000. On 17 November 2010, the company discontinues the court proceedings by filing a notice with the court. On 8 December 2010, Inland Revenue issues a Notice of Assessment for $125,000._

The company’s tax pooling intermediary has until 16 January 2011 (60 days after the discontinuance) to ask Inland Revenue to transfer up to $10,000 (the deferrable tax) to the company’s 2009 income tax account and backdate it.

The company could also choose to have its tax pooling intermediary ask Inland Revenue to transfer the above amount by 6 February 2010 (60 days after the issue of the Notice of Assessment). Because 6 February is a Sunday, the intermediary has until the next working day (Monday 7 February) to ask Inland Revenue to transfer the funds. 

The Commissioner considers that the increased amount of tax referred to in section RP 17B(3)(a) is the difference between the amount accepted by the company of $115,000 and the amount subsequently agreed by the parties of $125,000.

##### Example E

_On 23 October 2011, the High Court determines the dispute in favour of the Commissioner, and the company’s 2009 tax liability is $150,000. There is no appeal, and Inland Revenue does not issue a new Notice of Assessment._

The company’s tax pooling intermediary has until 23 December 2011 (60 days after the court determines the proceedings) to ask Inland Revenue to transfer up to $35,000 (the deferrable tax) to the company’s 2009 income tax account and backdate it.

##### Example F

_On 24 October 2011, the High Court determines the dispute in favour of the Commissioner, and the company’s 2009 tax liability is $150,000. There is no appeal. The company subsequently finds a further error in its 2009 tax return. It makes a voluntary disclosure and on 18 November 2011, by agreement with the company, Inland Revenue issues a Notice of Assessment for $190,000._

The company’s tax pooling intermediary has until 17 January 2012 (60 days after the Commissioner issues the Notice of Assessment for an increased amount of tax) to ask Inland Revenue to transfer up to $40,000 (the second increase in the amount of tax) to the company’s 2009 income tax account and backdate it.

##### Example G

_On 24 October 2011, the court determines the company’s 2009 tax liability to be $120,000, which is not appealed. On 17 November 2011, Inland Revenue issues a Notice of Assessment for $120,000._

The company’s tax pooling intermediary has until 16 January 2012 (60 days after the Commissioner issues the Notice of Assessment for an increased amount of tax) to ask Inland Revenue to transfer up to $5,000 (the deferrable tax) to the company’s 2009 income tax account and backdate it.

The Commissioner considers that the increased amount of tax referred to in section RP 17B(3)(a) is the difference between the amount accepted by the company of $115,000 and the amount subsequently determined by the court of $120,000.

These examples illustrate the general principles that the Commissioner will consider in administering section RP 17B of the Income Tax Act. Other relevant factors will need to be taken into account in determining whether pooling funds will be available. Inland Revenue will be issuing operational instructions that will elaborate on these examples.

##### _One taxpayer sourcing tax pooling funds for multiple taxpayers no longer allowed_

As a result of the legislative changes to the tax pooling rules, a practice that Inland Revenue has accepted in the past will change. The practice relates to the transfer of tax pooling funds for multiple taxpayers into one taxpayer’s income tax account and a subsequent request is then made to on-transfer those funds to the “associated” taxpayers at backdated effective dates.

This practice was allowed where the taxpayers were all “associated” and could all have sourced the tax pooling funds individually. In these cases Inland Revenue would process the on-transfer request.

This practice will no longer be allowed as the tax pooling rules only allow taxpayers to use tax pooling to meet their own tax obligations.

Inland Revenue will decline tax pooling transfers if these are sourced by one taxpayer for other taxpayers, or reverse these if this is determined after the funds have been transferred. This may result in the “associated” taxpayer not being able to use tax pooling at backdated effective dates if a tax pooling intermediary cannot request a transfer in the correct taxpayer’s name within the 60-day timeframe allowed.

##### _Other amendments to the Income Tax Act_

There has been some uncertainty over how the term “tax paid” should be interpreted. Section 120C(1) of the Tax Administration Act has also been amended to clarify that “tax paid” means the amount transferred to a taxpayer’s account or a tax pooling account by the original due date for the tax.

For income tax this means the terminal tax date, and for non-income tax revenues this means the original due date for the payment of the tax.

Funds that cannot be sourced on or before the terminal tax date or original due date, as applicable, will first be applied to any interest owing at the effective date of the transfer of those funds and any balance will be applied to the tax owing.

This means taxpayers who cannot source the full amount of increased tax obligations at the terminal tax date or original due date, as applicable, will not be able to source more funds to meet any interest or penalties that they may also be required to pay. This includes the situation where some or all of the funds sourced from a tax pooling account may be applied against interest and penalty obligations.

#### Examples of how penalties and interest apply where tax pooling funds used to meet obligations

##### Example H

In 2010 the taxpayer files an income tax return for the 2009–10 income year and determines their tax liability to be $120,000. On 20 June 2012 Inland Revenue reassesses the taxpayer’s liability at $180,000. The taxpayer sources $20,000 tax pooling funds on each of the 2nd and 3rd provisional tax instalment dates to mitigate interest on their increased income tax obligations. Because no intermediary has funds available at the 1st provisional tax instalment date, the taxpayer sources the remaining $20,000 on the 2nd provisional tax instalment date.

The $20,000 sourced on the 2nd and 3rd instalment dates will be fully applied to the $20,000 owing on each date for the purposes of calculating interest. The other $20,000 also sourced on the 2nd instalment date will be fully applied to the remaining $20,000 provisional tax owing. However interest will have accrued from the day after the 1st provisional tax instalment date to the 2nd provisional tax instalment date.

The taxpayer will not be able to use tax pooling funds at backdated effective dates to meet the interest obligation. The taxpayer will be required to pay the interest and if the funds are sourced from a tax pooling account they cannot be backdated.

##### Example I

A taxpayer files a GST return for the period ended 30 November 2006 and pays the resulting GST of $50,000 on 15 January 2007. On 21 June 2010 the taxpayer’s GST return is reassessed at $80,000 and a Notice of Assessment is issued. A new due date of 21 August 2012 is set to pay the $30,000 increase in GST.

The taxpayer sources $30,000 tax pooling funds with an effective date of 31 January 2007, because no intermediary has funds available at an earlier date. This will mitigate most of the interest that will accrue from the day after the original due date (15 January 2007) and the date of the reassessment (21 June 2010).

The $30,000 will firstly be applied to the interest of $172.01 that has accrued between 16 January and 31 January 2007 ($30,000 x 13.08% / 365 x 16 days). The remaining $29,827.99 will be applied against the $30,000 tax owing. This leaves a balance of $172.01 tax owing, which will accrue further interest until fully paid.

The taxpayer cannot use tax pooling funds at backdated effective dates to pay interest (or penalty) obligations that arise from reassessments. This applies equally to income tax and non-income tax reassessments.

#### _Imputation credit account implications_

When a company deposits money in a tax pooling account, a credit is made to the company’s imputation account at that time. However, if the money in the tax pool is subsequently transferred to pay a reassessed amount of tax that is not income tax, the amendment to section OB 33(1) of the Income Tax Act provides that the imputation account is debited by the amount of the transfer at the time the funds are transferred.

Similarly, when a company taxpayer sells money that it has previously deposited in a tax pooling account, the imputation account is debited by the amount of the funds sold, as this is treated as a refund. The debit to the imputation account arises at the date of sale.

When a company taxpayer’s tax pooling funds are transferred to another pooling intermediary, there are no impacts on the company’s imputation account solely because of such a transfer.

#### _Imputation credit account implications - company purchases funds_

Where a company taxpayer purchases tax pooling funds to meet an income tax obligation, including from a reassessment, the company’s imputation account is credited by the amount of the funds purchased. The credit to the imputation account arises at the effective date of the transfer.

#### _Commissioner’s notification_

The current legislation requires the tax pooling intermediary to provide the Commissioner with details relating to deposits made with the intermediary. On receipt of this information, the Commissioner provides this information back to the intermediary. In practice, the Commissioner does not currently provide the details back to the intermediary. To do so would increase both compliance and administration costs, with no real gain.

Section RP 18(4) has been amended to require simply that the Commissioner confirms receipt of details provided by the pooling intermediary, rather than provide the details back to the intermediary.

#### _Who can deposit money into a tax pooling account_

Currently only provisional taxpayers can deposit money into a tax pooling account. With the extension of the tax pooling rules to reassessments of most taxes, the rules now allow all taxpayers to deposit money into a tax pool as they could be subject to a reassessment of taxes. This should provide a source of funds for tax pooling intermediaries.

#### _Other amendments to the Tax Administration Act_

##### _Interest paid on deposits in tax pooling accounts_

Section 120OE(1) has been amended to ensure that interest is paid by the Commissioner on money deposited in a tax pooling account from the date of deposit until such time as the amount is refunded or transferred.

##### _Renumbering of provisions_

Existing sections 15Q to 15V have been renumbered and are now contained in sections 15N to 15S.

##### _Transfer of excess tax to another taxpayer_

The transfer rules have been amended to enable taxpayers to transfer excess tax to a tax pooling intermediary (section 173M(2)(fb)).

Also, this amendment clarifies that transfers can be made from any tax type to a tax pooling account. The effective date of the transfer will be the date of the request or a later date (not a backdated date).

[Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007](/new-legislation/act-articles/2007-19 "Taxation (KiwiSaver and Company Tax Rate Amendments) Act 2007")

Provisional tax
===============

2007 legislation reduces the tax rate for companies and certain savings vehicles to 30% and caps the top rate for portfolio investment at 30%.

##### Section HL 20 and Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004

The tax rate for companies and certain savings vehicles has been reduced from 33% to 30%. The reduction is consistent with the government's economic transformation goals of increasing productivity and improving New Zealand's international competitiveness.

The top rate for portfolio investment entities has been capped at 30%, instead of the previous 33%, while the tax rate for certain widely held savings vehicles has also been lowered to 30%.

The new tax rates are intended to encourage savings and implement a more neutral tax treatment of different savings entities.

### Background

The changes give effect to announcements made in Budget 2007, to lower the tax rate for companies and certain savings vehicles.

As a result of these changes, a number of transitional and consequential amendments are required to the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to reflect the reduced tax rates. These amendments (excluding provisional tax) are included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Business Taxation, KiwiSaver, and Remedial Matters) Bill, which was introduced into Parliament on 17 May 2007 and was enacted on 17 December 2007.

### Key features

Clause 5 of Schedule 1 has been amended to reduce the company tax rate from 33% to 30%. The definition of "company" includes a unit trust, so this new rate also applies to unit trusts (see Bonus Bonds Trust below).

Clause 1 has been amended to reduce the tax rate on life insurance policyholder income from 33% to 30%.

The definition of "portfolio investor rate" has been amended to reduce the maximum tax rate for portfolio investment entities that are portfolio tax rate entities from 33% to 30%. Consequential amendments have been made to the definition of "prescribed investor rate" and section HL 20(9).

Clause 7 has been amended to reduce the tax rate on group investment funds deriving category A income (which is taxed as if it were a company) from 33% to 30%.

A change has been made to clause 4 (trustee income) to exclude a number of widely held investment vehicles which are ordinarily subject to the 33% trustee tax rate. These vehicles are subject to a 30% tax rate under new clause 8B, which refers to:

*   an approved unit trust to which the Income Tax (Exempt Unit Trusts) Order 1990 applies. The Bonus Bonds Trust is an approved unit trust. The 1990 Order considers the unit trust not to be a company. Income earned by the trust is taxed at the 30% rate under clause 8B;
*   a widely held superannuation fund; and
*   a widely held group investment fund (GIF). This applies to GIFs if they derive category B income or are designated GIFs.

To be a "widely held superannuation fund" or a "widely held GIF" a vehicle must satisfy either:

*   the investor membership requirements that a portfolio investment entity must satisfy (which is generally that the vehicle must have more than 20 members when the vehicle is treated as having one portfolio investor class comprising all the investors); or
*   certain criteria that a qualifying unit trust must satisfy. Generally, the vehicle must be a retail one with at least 100 members. However, the 100-member rule can be relaxed in certain circumstance if the vehicle is genuinely widely held.

Finally, as a result of the change to the company tax rate, the dividend withholding payment rate also reduces from 33% to 30% (section NH 2(1)).

### Application dates

The new tax rates apply from the beginning of the 2008/09 income year, except for portfolio investment entities that do not pay provisional tax and that attribute income to members on a daily or quarterly basis. For these portfolio investment entities, the new maximum rate will apply from 1 April 2008.

[Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-livestock-valuation-assets-expenditure-and-remedial-matters-act-2013 "Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013")

Provisions relating to overseas benefits
========================================

Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 updates provisions on overseas social security-type benefits and pensions.

_Sections CW 28, MB 1, "New Zealand superannuation", "New Zealand superannuitant", and "veteran's pension" in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964_

Some provisions relating to overseas social security-type benefits and pensions (overseas benefits) in the Income Tax Act 2007 have been rationalised to simplify and update them in line with other legislative changes.

### Background

Under section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964, a person's entitlement to a New Zealand benefit is reduced if the person is entitled to, or receives an overseas benefit that is of a similar nature to the New Zealand benefit. This is referred to as the "direct deduction policy". Under this policy, a person's entitlement to a New Zealand benefit is reduced directly on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of the overseas benefit.

The rationale for this direct deduction policy is to ensure that all New Zealand pensioners and beneficiaries receive an equitable level of social security-type benefits, regardless of whether this amount is fully funded by New Zealand or is a combined amount of New Zealand and overseas government-provided benefits.

New Zealand benefits covered by section 70 include New Zealand Superannuation, the veteran's pension and income-tested benefits (such as Jobseeker Support or Sole Parent Support).

Section CW 28(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 2007 exempts certain overseas benefits from income tax to the extent that the direct deduction policy in section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964applies.

The interaction between the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Social Security Act 1964 was considered complex. Some provisions also needed updating to reflect other legislative changes.

### Key features

The amendments rationalise some provisions relating to overseas benefits in the Income Tax Act 2007 so that these provisions are simplified, particularly the interaction with the Social Security Act 1964. The amendments do not reduce any person's entitlements to New Zealand benefits or change the tax treatment of these entitlements.

### Application date

The amendments apply from 17 July 2013, which is the date of enactment of the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013.

### Detailed analysis

Under the new rules, section CW 28(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 2007 exempts from income tax certain overseas benefits to the extent that section 70 of the Social Security Act 1964 applies.

### _Overseas benefits subject to direct deduction_

Under the new rules, section CW 28(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 2007 exempts from income tax an overseas benefit that is subject to the direct deduction policy in section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964 to the extent that the overseas benefit reduces:

*   a New Zealand monetary benefit paid under the SSA; or
*   a New Zealand monetary benefit, other than New Zealand Superannuation or a veteran's pension, paid under the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990.

The tax exemption is intended to equalise the amount a person entitled to a New Zealand benefit receives in their hand irrespective of whether or not they also receive an overseas benefit. The tax exemption is necessary because the rates of New Zealand monetary benefits paid under the Social Security Act 1964, which excludes New Zealand Superannuation and the veterans' pensions, are set in legislation at the net rate and grossed-up for income tax purposes.[1](#01)
 The direct deduction policy therefore reduces the net rate of the New Zealand benefit by a dollar for every gross dollar amount of overseas benefit received.

Note that this exemption does not apply to overseas pensions that are of a similar nature to New Zealand Superannuation and a veteran's pension. The New Zealand monetary benefits paid under the Social Security Act 1964 exclude New Zealand Superannuation and the veteran's pension.[2](#02)
 A person who receives an overseas pension that has an effect of reducing New Zealand Superannuation or a veteran's pension is taxed on the overseas pension amount. This is because the rate of New Zealand Superannuation or the veteran's pension is set in legislation as a gross rate, so the direct deduction policy is reducing the gross rate dollar-for-dollar against the gross amount of overseas benefit.

Section CW 28(2)(a)(i) of the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to no longer refer to monetary benefits paid under Part 1 of the Social Security Act 1964 to reflect changes to that Act. Monetary benefits have been relocated from Part 1 to other parts of the Social Security Act 1964 over the years, and again were restructured as part of the Social Security (Benefit Categories and Work Focus) Amendment Act 2013. Section CW 28(2)(a)(i) of the Income Tax Act 2007 now refers to monetary benefits under the Social Security Act 1964.

### _Special banking option_

Under section 70(3) of the Social Security Act 1964, a special banking option is available for those who receive an overseas benefit from certain countries, namely the United Kingdom, Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, Australia and the Netherlands.[3](#03)
 The special banking option is an alternative deduction method which involves less complex administration and compliance costs around exchange rate movements.

An eligible person may elect into the special banking option to have their overseas benefit paid directly into a special bank account managed by the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). The person does not have access to the funds in this account, but in turn they receive an amount equivalent to the New Zealand benefit. Note that New Zealand benefits that can be subject to the special banking option include New Zealand Superannuation, the veteran's pension and monetary benefits paid under the Social Security Act 1964.

Under the new rules, section CW 28(2)(b) exempts from income tax overseas benefits that are subject to the special banking option arrangement. This tax exemption is intended to prevent double taxation of both the amount of overseas benefit (received by MSD in a special banking option account) and the New Zealand benefit a person receives under the special banking option from MSD. A person who receives from MSD under the special banking option an amount equivalent to the full amount of New Zealand benefit is liable to New Zealand tax on that amount. Exempting the amount of overseas benefit from income tax reflects the fact that the equivalent amount they receive from MSD has been taxed as a PAYE income payment.

The changes enacted simplify the interaction between section CW 28(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 70(4) of the Social Security Act 1964 - that is, to exempt the overseas benefit amount retained by the MSD. The latter part of section CW 28(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 2007 from "but not to the extent …" and the reference to section CW 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007 in section 70(4) of the Social Security Act 1964 have been repealed. Section 70(4) of the Social Security Act 1964 now deems the amount paid out by MSD under the special banking option as a composite benefit. Repealing the reference to section CW 28 in that section means that section 70(4) can be ignored for income tax purposes.

### _Family scheme income_

Section MB 1(2)(a) includes the amount of overseas benefit, which is tax-exempt under section CW 28(2)(a), in a person's family scheme income, which is used to calculate entitlements to various social assistance programmes, including Working for Families tax credits. Although the amount of tax-exempt overseas benefit is not included in a person's taxable income for the calculation and payment of tax, it is available for the person's day-to-day living expenses and is received alongside a reduced amount of New Zealand benefit under section 70(1) of the Social Security Act 1964. It is therefore appropriate to still count these overseas benefit amounts for social assistance purposes.

The amount of overseas benefit subject to the special banking option, which is tax-exempt under section CW 28(2)(b), is not included in a person's family scheme income. The amount of overseas benefit subject to the special banking option is retained by MSD and it is not available for a person's day-to-day living expenses. It is therefore appropriate not to count these overseas benefits for social assistance purposes. For those who apply the special banking option, an amount equivalent to the full amount of New Zealand benefit is already included in the person's taxable income and captured for social assistance purposes under section MB 1(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### _Updating definitions_

Certain definitions in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 have been updated.

References to section 70(3)(b) of the Social Security Act 1964 in paragraph (b)(ii) in the definition of "New Zealand superannuation" and paragraph (b) in the definition of "veteran's pension" in section YA 1 have been repealed. These references were unnecessary because people using the special banking option receive the full amount of New Zealand Superannuation and the veteran's pension under the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Tax 2001 and the War Pensions Act 1954 respectively. The removal of the reference to section CW 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007 in section 70(4) of the Social Security Act 1964 is consistent with this approach.

Also, references to the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 in paragraph (b)(iii) in the definition of "New Zealand superannuation", paragraph (b)(ii) in the definition of "New Zealand superannuitant", and paragraph (c) in the definition of "veteran's pension" in section YA 1 have been repealed. These references were unnecessary because most parts of the Social Welfare (Transitional Provisions) Act 1990 have been repealed.

1Note that the amount of tax for a PAYE income payment that is an income-tested benefit payable or paid under the Social Security Act 1964 is determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in consultation with the chief executive of the Ministry of Social Development. (See section RD 11(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007.)

2 New Zealand Superannuation and the veteran's pension is paid under the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001 and the War Pensions Act 1954 respectively.

1 COMMISSIONS RECEIVED BY LIFE AGENTS ON OWN POLICIES AND FAMILY POLICIES – INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 00/01 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): The issue dealt with by this ruling was covered in public ruling BR Pub 96/9A, published in TIB Volume Eight, No.8, (November 1996). BR Pub 96/9A also dealt with the fringe benefit implications arising from discounted life insurance premiums. These arrangements are now the subject of two separate rulings, with the fringe benefit issue being covered in BR Pub 00/02. A single commentary accompanies both rulings. In addition to the separation of the arrangements into two rulings, some formatting changes have also been made. The period of application of the rulings is from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. BR Pub 96/9A applied up until 31 December 1999. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 3 and CH 3. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is as follows: • The receipt by a life agent of cash commissions on the life agent’s own life policy or family life policy, or the set off of commissions on such policies against premiums payable on the life agent’s own life policy or family life policy. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Cash commissions received by a life agent on the life agent’s own life policy or a family life policy are gross income under section CD 3 (if the life agent is an independent contractor) and section CH 3 (if the life agent is an employee). When a life agent sets off commissions on such policies against premiums payable on these policies, the amount of commission set off is gross income under section CD 3 or CH 3. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004 to the receipt of cash commissions and the set off of commissions, occurring within that period. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of March 2000. 2 Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR Pub 00/01 and BR Pub 00/02 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Rulings BR Pub 00/01 and BR Pub 00/02. The subject matter covered in these Rulings was previously dealt with by BR Pub 96/9A and in TIB Volume Eight, No.8, (November 1996), at page 6. These Rulings apply for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. Background Public Ruling BR Pub 96/9A dealt with the income tax and fringe benefit consequences of life agents who take out life policies on their own lives and on the lives of their families. The period of application for that Ruling expired on 31 December 1999. In short the Ruling concluded that: 1. Cash commissions received by a life agent on the life agent’s own life policy or on a family life policy are gross income; 2. Discounted premiums enjoyed by a life agent or by family members on policies on their respective lives are fringe benefits. The Commissioner has reconsidered his conclusions reached in BR Pub 96/9A and is satisfied that these conclusions are correct. However, instead of reissuing the ruling, he has decided that it is legally appropriate to issue two rulings to cover the two arrangements, i.e. the receipt of commissions and the enjoyment of discounted premiums. These rulings will apply for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. Legislation Section CD 3 states: The gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. Section CH 3 states: All monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income. Section OB 1 defines “employer” and “employee” for the purposes of the FBT rules. “Employee” means: ...a person who will receive, receives, or has at any time received, or who will be, is, or has at any time been entitled to receive, a source deduction payment... 4 “Employer” means: ...a person who will pay, pays, or has at any time paid, or who will be, is, or has at any time been liable to pay, a source deduction payment... “Source deduction payment” is defined in section OB 2(1) as: ...a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument,... or a withholding payment. Section CI 1 defines “fringe benefit”. Under section CI 1(h), a fringe benefit includes any benefit that consists of: Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or...income year,- being, as the case may be...a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee;... Section CI 3 provides the methods for calculating the value of a fringe benefit. When services are provided to an employee, and the services are provided as part of the employer’s business, the fringe benefit is valued in accordance with section CI 3(10)(a): Where the services were provided by the employer of the employee where the employer of the employee, as part of that employer’s business, normally provides such services for payment, the price for which, at the time when the services were so provided to the employee, services identical or similar to those services were customarily provided by the employer of the employee to a member of the general public in the open market in New Zealand on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other: Section GC 15(1) states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, where any benefit which, if it were provided for or granted to an employee would be a fringe benefit, is provided or granted by the employer of the employee,...for or to a person other than the employee of the employer, the employee of the employer and the other person being associated persons, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. For the purposes of section GC 15 “associated person” is defined in section OD 7(1). That section states: For the purposes of this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, at any time associated persons or persons associated with each other are- ... (c) Two persons who are at the time relatives;... “Relative” is defined in section OB 1: (a) Except in the international tax rules, in relation to any person, means any other person connected with the first-mentioned person by blood relationship, marriage, or adoption; and 5 includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit; and for the purposes of this paragraph- (i) Persons are connected by blood relationship if within the fourth degree of relationship: (ii) Persons are connected by marriage if one is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other: (iii) Persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as the child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other: Application of the Legislation 1. Cash commissions received by life agents on their own policies or family policies “Income” is not a term of art and has to be examined in accordance with ordinary concepts and usages (Scott v C of T (1935) 35 SRNSW 215 at page 219). The courts have identified several criteria that are considered to be the hallmarks of receipts of an income nature. The High Court in Reid v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,624 at page 61,629 described the criteria as follows: • Income is something which comes in; and • Income imports the notion of periodicity, re-occurrence and regularity; and • Whether a particular receipt is income depends upon its quality in the hands of the recipient. An important feature of income is that it is something that comes in. This was emphasised in Lambe v IR Commrs (1933) 18 T.C. 212 where Finlay J said at page 217: Of course income may be of various sorts,...but none the less the \[income\] tax is a tax on income. It is a tax on what in one form or another goes into a man’s pocket. That is the general principle. Cash commissions received by life agents on own policies or family policies come in, in the same way that commissions from the sale of policies to unrelated third parties come in. The major determinant in many cases is the periodic nature of the payment. Generally, commission income is periodic in nature. However, this in itself is not enough. It is necessary to consider the relationship between the life insurer and the life agent to determine the quality of the commission in the hands of the life agent. Alternative arguments One possible argument is that commissions received by life agents on their own policies are not income but are the proceeds from mutual transactions. 6 Mutual transactions The general principle of income tax known as mutuality starts from the premise that a person cannot make a profit from trading with himself or herself, or with a body or association of persons of which the person is a member. In Sydney Water Board Employees’ Credit Union Ltd v FC of T (1973) ATC 4,129 Barwick J said: The description “mutuality principle” is used, unfortunately as I think, to express the reason for the conclusion that the return to a taxpayer of a share of the surplus of a fund to which he has contributed in common with others after its use for a purpose agreed between them is not income...What distinguishes the amount refunded in such circumstances from profit or income is that the payment is made out of moneys which are in substance the moneys of the contributors. (At page 4,131.)(emphasis added) Prima facie the profits from mutual transactions are not gross income. There are numerous cases discussing the mutuality principle. Most discuss the situation where a person trades with a body or association of persons of which he or she is a member. There was some discussion of the principle that a person cannot trade with himself or herself in Dublin Corporation v M’Adam 2 T.C. 387 at page 397. The Court stated that: There must be, at least, two parties...If these two parties are identical, in my opinion there can be no trading. No man, in my opinion, can trade with himself; he cannot, in my opinion, make, in what is its true sense or meaning, taxable profit by dealing with himself; and in every case of this description it appears to be a question on the construction of the Act whether the two bodies - the body that supplies and the body or class that has to pay - were either identical, or, upon the true construction of the Act, must be admitted to have been held by the Legislature to be identical... Does the mutuality principle apply? Although the life agent is the person who causes the commission to be paid by taking up the policy on that person’s life or the lives of the person’s family, the commission is not a return of the life agent’s own money. The commission comes from a source outside of the life agent, i.e. from the funds of the life insurer. The life agent is paid the commission for introducing business to the life insurer, not for taking out the policy and paying the premiums. Case law indicates that the mutuality principle only applies when a person trades with himself or herself, i.e. there is only one party to the transaction giving rise to the income. Here there are two parties to the transaction. The commission arises from the sale of a life insurance product by one party (the life insurer) to another party (the life agent). It does not matter that the life insurance product is sold by the life insurer through the life agent. There are still two parties to the transaction. Mutuality principle - conclusion The mutuality principle does not apply to commissions received by life agents on their own policies. Discount on premiums 7 It may also be argued that cash commissions received by life agents on own policies should be regarded as discounts from the premiums payable under the policy and not as gross income. For example, a life agent takes out a policy on her life. The premium is $1,000. The life agent receives a cash commission of $200. The $200 can be seen as a discount, i.e. the ‘real’ cost of the policy is $800. As discussed in the background to the Rulings, this was the view taken in Commissions on Life Insurance sold to Agent’s Family in TIB Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993). The treatment of cash commissions as reductions or discounts from the premiums payable under the policies is not supported by the legislation. The commission payment arises from an arrangement between the life agent and the life insurer. The life agent receives the commission for introducing business to the life insurer, not for taking out the policy and paying the premiums. Conclusion Cash commissions received by life agents on own policies or family policies are gross income under section CD 3 or CH 3. 2. Life agents’ commission is set off Life agents may set off commissions on own policies or family policies against the premiums payable on their own policies. Under section EB 1(1), an amount is deemed to have been derived by a person although it has not actually been paid to, or received by the person, or already become due or receivable, if that amount: ...has been credited in account, or reinvested, or accumulated, or capitalised, or carried to any reserve, sinking, or insurance fund, or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or on the person’s behalf. Case law has established that income is derived under section EB 1 when the taxpayer does not receive a payment of that income, but some other monetary benefit moves to the taxpayer. This has been found to occur when income that would otherwise have been paid to the taxpayer is diverted for uses that are of benefit to the taxpayer (Dunn v C of IR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,245). When life agents set off the commission, the amount of commission is gross income under section CD 3 or CH 3. The commission (which would otherwise have been paid to the agent) is diverted for uses that produce other financial benefit to the life agent, i.e. payment of the premiums on own policies. The practice of setting off commissions on policies may also occur in respect of policies sold to third parties. For example, a life agent sells a policy to an unrelated third party and becomes entitled to a commission. Instead of being paid the 8 commission, the life agent sets the commission off against premiums payable on own policies. Here, the commission, although not paid to the life agent, is derived by the life agent and is therefore gross income. 3. Charging of discounted premiums to life agents on own policies or to members of life agents’ families on family policies It is common for life insurers to allow life agents to receive lower commissions in order to discount premiums to prospective clients. The Commissioner understands that if a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise on the sale of a policy, there is a corresponding reduction in the premiums payable under that policy. The Commissioner also understands that when life agents agree that no commission entitlement will arise on their own policies or on family policies, the premiums payable under those policies are reduced. Life agents who agree that no commission entitlement will arise on policies sold to third parties are not assessable on any notional commission, i.e. the amount of commission that would have been received. As discussed, an important feature of income is that it is something that comes in. When a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise no income comes in. This must also be the case when life agents agree that no commission entitlement arises on their own policies or family policies. As the life agent receives no commission, no income arises. Alternative arguments An important feature of income is that it is something that comes in. When life agents agree that no commission entitlement will arise on their own policies no money comes in. They do not receive a cash commission. However, if a life agent decides to either take the commission, or agree that no entitlement will arise and receive a discounted premium on a policy on the agent’s own life or that of his or her family, the issue of convertibility arises. In particular, does the fact that the life agent can receive the commission in lieu of the discounted premium mean that the discounted premium is convertible into money, and therefore assessable? Case law The principle of convertibility was initially laid down in Tennant v Smith \[1892\] 3 T.C. 158. Tennant involved a bank employee who received a benefit in the form of rent-free accommodation. The issue was whether the accommodation was assessable under Schedule E of the UK legislation (by virtue of the words “salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits payable”). The Court held that the taxpayer would only be taxable if what he received was convertible into money, i.e. was money or money’s worth. Because the taxpayer could not sublet the accommodation or turn it to pecuniary account in any other way, he was not taxed. 9 The principle of convertibility has been discussed and applied by the New Zealand courts on a number of occasions. See C of IR v Parson (No. 2) (1968) NZLR 574, Stagg v Inland Revenue Commissioner (1959) NZLR 1,252, and Dawson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1978) 3 NZTC 61,252. The convertibility test is normally satisfied by demonstrating that the benefit may be sold or exchanged for money. ( In Stagg the value of holiday airfares given to an employee was held not to be assessable income of the employee. The employee could not sell the fares or require the company to give him the equivalent cash value.) However, it is clear from case law that there are other ways in which convertibility can be satisfied. See Abbott v Philbin \[1961\] 2 All E.R. 763 and Heaton (Inspector of Taxes) v Bell \[1969\] 2 All E.R. 70. The principle of convertibility was considered by the New Zealand Supreme Court in Dawson. The taxpayer subscribed for debenture stock under a debenture holders’ colour television plan. Under that plan a person could subscribe for debenture stock and would receive in return a TV free of hire for five years. No interest was payable on the debentures. The Commissioner argued that the use of the TV set was the substitution of one form of a benefit for another, i.e. interest, and that in taking the hire of the set rather than the payment of interest, the taxpayer received a benefit which could be valued in terms of money. McMullin J said at page 61,258: In the view which I take of this matter, it is of some importance to note that Objector did not apply for a television set as an alternative to an interest-bearing investment. It is true that it was open to him initially to choose to invest in interest-bearing stock as, I have no doubt, many other investors did, but he completed his application for a television set and a television set only. The Court held that the benefit that the taxpayer received was that he did not have to pay rental for the TV. That benefit did not constitute income in the ordinary sense because the benefit received by the taxpayer was not in monetary form, nor was it capable of being sold, surrendered, assigned, or mortgaged for money or money’s worth. Arguably Dawson provides some support for the view that the receipt of a discounted premium is convertible into money or money’s worth, the discounted premium being a substitution for the commission. It may be implied from the Court’s comments in Dawson that if the taxpayer had the option of investing and receiving either a TV set or an interest-bearing investment, and in fact received a TV set, the benefit would be convertible into money. However, the better view is that discounted premiums are not convertible into money or money’s worth. 10 The fact that a life agent initially has the choice of receiving a commission, or not receiving a commission and enjoying a discounted premium, is not relevant. The issue of convertibility is considered at the time the taxpayer receives the benefit. If a life agent chooses to receive a commission, no question of convertibility arises as the commission is money. However, when a life agent chooses to receive a discounted premium, it is the discounted premium itself that must be convertible into money or money’s worth. At the time the discounted premium is received it cannot be converted into money. Therefore, the convertibility principle does not apply. Conclusion When life agents receive discounted premiums on own policies or members of their families receive discounted premiums on family policies, the amount of the discount is not gross income of the life agent. 4. FBT and discounted policies A life insurer who provides discounted premiums to life agents on policies on their own lives or on the lives of their families or to members of their families on family policies may be liable to FBT. For the purposes of FBT a life agent is an “employee”, regardless of whether the life agent is an employee or an independent contractor at common law. Employee vs independent contractor The terms “employee”, “employer” and “employment” are defined for FBT purposes by reference to the PAYE system. Section OB 1 defines “employee” for the purposes of the FBT rules as: ...a person who will receive, receives, or has at any time received, or who will be, is, or has at any time been entitled to receive, a source deduction payment... Section OB 2(1) defines “source deduction payment” as: ...a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument,... or a withholding payment. “Withholding payment” is defined in section OB 1 as: ...a payment which is declared by regulations under this Act to be a withholding payment for the purposes of the PAYE rules: Under section 4 of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, all payments of the classes specified in the Schedule to the regulations are withholding payments for the purposes of the PAYE rules. Included in Part A of the Schedule are commissions or other remuneration to insurance agents or sub-agents, or to salesmen. 11 A life agent who is an employee at common law is an “employee” for the purposes of FBT because of receiving a source deduction payment, namely salary and wages. A life agent who is an independent contractor at common law is also an “employee” for the purposes of FBT because of receiving a source deduction payment, namely withholding payments. Discounts on family policies If an employer provides a benefit to an associated person of any of the employer’s employees, i.e. a member of the life agent’s immediate family (and the benefit would have been a fringe benefit if provided to an employee), section GC 15(1) deems the benefit to be a benefit provided to the employee. For the purposes of section GC 15, “associated person” is defined in section OD 7(1). An “associated person” includes two persons who are at the time relatives. A relative of a life agent is any person connected with the life agent: • By blood relationship (if within the fourth degree of relationship); or • By marriage (persons are connected by marriage if one is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other); or • By adoption (persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as the child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other). Is there a fringe benefit? As discussed above, when a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise and enjoys a discounted premium, that discounted premium is not gross income of the life agent. A discounted premium that represents a reduction in charges other than commission is also not gross income. A discount is not regarded as gross income. Income is something that comes in, not something that is saved from going out (see Tennant Lord Halsbury at page 165). The issue then is whether discounted premiums received by life agents on own policies or discounted premiums received by members of their families on family policies constitute fringe benefits. Analysis Section CI 1 defines “fringe benefit” for the purposes of the FBT rules: 12 In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter...or income year, means any benefit that consists of- ... Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or...income year,- being, as the case may be...a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee;... It is clear from these opening words that in order to be a fringe benefit there must be some benefit to the employee, provided or granted by the employee’s employer. A life agent may have a discretion to reduce his or her commission in order to reduce premiums on policies sold to members of the public. In this case it may be argued that when life agents do not charge a commission on their own policies and receive discounted premiums, no benefit arises to the life agents because the benefit is also available to members of the public. If a life agent purchases a life insurance policy at full value, i.e. the full amount of premiums are payable, there is no benefit to the life agent or his or her family. However, when a commission is not charged the full amount of premium is not paid. If a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise, be it on an own policy or a policy sold to a member of the public, the amount of premium payable under the policy is reduced. This reduction in premium is clearly a benefit to the life agent and the public alike. A life agent who enjoys a discounted premium, when the discount represents a reduction in charges other than commission, clearly receives a benefit. The benefit is the receipt of the services of the employer (the life insurance policy) for less than market value. Therefore, discounted premiums received by life agents on own policies and discounted premiums received by members of their families on family policies are fringe benefits under section CI 1(h). Note that sections CI 1(e) and CI 1(f) do not apply to discounts received by life agents (or associated persons) on own policies or family policies. The policies sold by the life agent are not “sick, accident, or death benefit funds” as defined in section CB 5(2) (see CI 1(e)), nor is the discount a “specified insurance premium” as defined in section OB 1. The life insurer does not pay the life insurance premiums of the life agent or the agent’s family on the life agent’s own policies or family policies (see section CI 1(f)). Value of the benefit The Act provides methods for valuing a fringe benefit. 13 Specific provisions exist for determining the value of services provided to an employee when they are provided as part of the employer’s business. Here the benefit is the provision of a life insurance policy at less than market value. The life insurer is in the business of selling such life insurance policies to the general public. Therefore, section CI 3(10)(a) applies to determine the value of the benefit. The extent to which the benefit is subject to FBT will depend on the extent to which the discounts provided to life agents or members of life agents’ family are greater than the discounts available to members of the general public. It is a question of fact whether the price paid for the policy by the life agent is the same as is customarily paid by a member of the general public in the open market on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other. There will be no taxable value if the amount paid by the employee is the same as, or exceeds, the price customarily paid by a member of the general public in the open market on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other. Expenditure on account of an employee The Ruling covers the situation when an employer (the life insurer) provides a benefit to the employee or associated person (the life agent or relative) by discounting the premiums payable by the life agent on the insurance policy. It does not seek to address the situation when the life insurer pays the life insurance premium of a life agent. When a life insurer pays a life agent’s insurance premiums, that expenditure will be expenditure on account of an employee if the employee is liable to pay the insurance premiums. Expenditure on account of an employee is monetary remuneration and is assessable income to the employee. When a life insurer pays a life agent’s insurance premiums, and the life insurer is liable for those premiums, that expenditure is a fringe benefit (unless expressly excluded from the definition of fringe benefit in section CI 1).

The subject matter covered in these Rulings was previously dealt with by BR Pub 96/9A and in TIB Volume Eight, No.8, (November 1996), at page 6. These Rulings apply for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. Background Public Ruling BR Pub 96/9A dealt with the income tax and fringe benefit consequences of life agents who take out life policies on their own lives and on the lives of their families. The period of application for that Ruling expired on 31 December 1999. In short the Ruling concluded that: 1. Cash commissions received by a life agent on the life agent’s own life policy or on a family life policy are gross income; 2. Discounted premiums enjoyed by a life agent or by family members on policies on their respective lives are fringe benefits. The Commissioner has reconsidered his conclusions reached in BR Pub 96/9A and is satisfied that these conclusions are correct. However, instead of reissuing the ruling, he has decided that it is legally appropriate to issue two rulings to cover the two arrangements, i.e. the receipt of commissions and the enjoyment of discounted premiums. These rulings will apply for the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2004. Legislation Section CD 3 states: The gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. Section CH 3 states: All monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income. Section OB 1 defines “employer” and “employee” for the purposes of the FBT rules. “Employee” means: ...a person who will receive, receives, or has at any time received, or who will be, is, or has at any time been entitled to receive, a source deduction payment... 4 “Employer” means: ...a person who will pay, pays, or has at any time paid, or who will be, is, or has at any time been liable to pay, a source deduction payment... “Source deduction payment” is defined in section OB 2(1) as: ...a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument,... or a withholding payment. Section CI 1 defines “fringe benefit”. Under section CI 1(h), a fringe benefit includes any benefit that consists of: Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or...income year,- being, as the case may be...a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee;... Section CI 3 provides the methods for calculating the value of a fringe benefit. When services are provided to an employee, and the services are provided as part of the employer’s business, the fringe benefit is valued in accordance with section CI 3(10)(a): Where the services were provided by the employer of the employee where the employer of the employee, as part of that employer’s business, normally provides such services for payment, the price for which, at the time when the services were so provided to the employee, services identical or similar to those services were customarily provided by the employer of the employee to a member of the general public in the open market in New Zealand on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other: Section GC 15(1) states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, where any benefit which, if it were provided for or granted to an employee would be a fringe benefit, is provided or granted by the employer of the employee,...for or to a person other than the employee of the employer, the employee of the employer and the other person being associated persons, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. For the purposes of section GC 15 “associated person” is defined in section OD 7(1). That section states: For the purposes of this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, at any time associated persons or persons associated with each other are- ... (c) Two persons who are at the time relatives;... “Relative” is defined in section OB 1: (a) Except in the international tax rules, in relation to any person, means any other person connected with the first-mentioned person by blood relationship, marriage, or adoption; and 5 includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit; and for the purposes of this paragraph- (i) Persons are connected by blood relationship if within the fourth degree of relationship: (ii) Persons are connected by marriage if one is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other: (iii) Persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as the child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other: Application of the Legislation 1. Cash commissions received by life agents on their own policies or family policies “Income” is not a term of art and has to be examined in accordance with ordinary concepts and usages (Scott v C of T (1935) 35 SRNSW 215 at page 219). The courts have identified several criteria that are considered to be the hallmarks of receipts of an income nature. The High Court in Reid v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,624 at page 61,629 described the criteria as follows: • Income is something which comes in; and • Income imports the notion of periodicity, re-occurrence and regularity; and • Whether a particular receipt is income depends upon its quality in the hands of the recipient. An important feature of income is that it is something that comes in. This was emphasised in Lambe v IR Commrs (1933) 18 T.C. 212 where Finlay J said at page 217: Of course income may be of various sorts,...but none the less the \[income\] tax is a tax on income. It is a tax on what in one form or another goes into a man’s pocket. That is the general principle. Cash commissions received by life agents on own policies or family policies come in, in the same way that commissions from the sale of policies to unrelated third parties come in. The major determinant in many cases is the periodic nature of the payment. Generally, commission income is periodic in nature. However, this in itself is not enough. It is necessary to consider the relationship between the life insurer and the life agent to determine the quality of the commission in the hands of the life agent. Alternative arguments One possible argument is that commissions received by life agents on their own policies are not income but are the proceeds from mutual transactions. 6 Mutual transactions The general principle of income tax known as mutuality starts from the premise that a person cannot make a profit from trading with himself or herself, or with a body or association of persons of which the person is a member. In Sydney Water Board Employees’ Credit Union Ltd v FC of T (1973) ATC 4,129 Barwick J said: The description “mutuality principle” is used, unfortunately as I think, to express the reason for the conclusion that the return to a taxpayer of a share of the surplus of a fund to which he has contributed in common with others after its use for a purpose agreed between them is not income...What distinguishes the amount refunded in such circumstances from profit or income is that the payment is made out of moneys which are in substance the moneys of the contributors. (At page 4,131.)(emphasis added) Prima facie the profits from mutual transactions are not gross income. There are numerous cases discussing the mutuality principle. Most discuss the situation where a person trades with a body or association of persons of which he or she is a member. There was some discussion of the principle that a person cannot trade with himself or herself in Dublin Corporation v M’Adam 2 T.C. 387 at page 397. The Court stated that: There must be, at least, two parties...If these two parties are identical, in my opinion there can be no trading. No man, in my opinion, can trade with himself; he cannot, in my opinion, make, in what is its true sense or meaning, taxable profit by dealing with himself; and in every case of this description it appears to be a question on the construction of the Act whether the two bodies - the body that supplies and the body or class that has to pay - were either identical, or, upon the true construction of the Act, must be admitted to have been held by the Legislature to be identical... Does the mutuality principle apply? Although the life agent is the person who causes the commission to be paid by taking up the policy on that person’s life or the lives of the person’s family, the commission is not a return of the life agent’s own money. The commission comes from a source outside of the life agent, i.e. from the funds of the life insurer. The life agent is paid the commission for introducing business to the life insurer, not for taking out the policy and paying the premiums. Case law indicates that the mutuality principle only applies when a person trades with himself or herself, i.e. there is only one party to the transaction giving rise to the income. Here there are two parties to the transaction. The commission arises from the sale of a life insurance product by one party (the life insurer) to another party (the life agent). It does not matter that the life insurance product is sold by the life insurer through the life agent. There are still two parties to the transaction. Mutuality principle - conclusion The mutuality principle does not apply to commissions received by life agents on their own policies. Discount on premiums 7 It may also be argued that cash commissions received by life agents on own policies should be regarded as discounts from the premiums payable under the policy and not as gross income. For example, a life agent takes out a policy on her life. The premium is $1,000. The life agent receives a cash commission of $200. The $200 can be seen as a discount, i.e. the ‘real’ cost of the policy is $800. As discussed in the background to the Rulings, this was the view taken in Commissions on Life Insurance sold to Agent’s Family in TIB Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993). The treatment of cash commissions as reductions or discounts from the premiums payable under the policies is not supported by the legislation. The commission payment arises from an arrangement between the life agent and the life insurer. The life agent receives the commission for introducing business to the life insurer, not for taking out the policy and paying the premiums. Conclusion Cash commissions received by life agents on own policies or family policies are gross income under section CD 3 or CH 3. 2. Life agents’ commission is set off Life agents may set off commissions on own policies or family policies against the premiums payable on their own policies. Under section EB 1(1), an amount is deemed to have been derived by a person although it has not actually been paid, or received by the person, or already become due or receivable, if that amount: ...has been credited in account, or reinvested, or accumulated, or capitalised, or carried to any reserve, sinking, or insurance fund, or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or on the person’s behalf. Case law has established that income is derived under section EB 1 when the taxpayer does not receive a payment of that income, but some other monetary benefit moves to the taxpayer. This has been found to occur when income that would otherwise have been paid to the taxpayer is diverted for uses that are of benefit to the taxpayer (Dunn v C of IR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,245). When life agents set off the commission, the amount of commission is gross income under section CD 3 or CH 3. The commission (which would otherwise have been paid to the agent) is diverted for uses that produce other financial benefit to the life agent, i.e. payment of the premiums on own policies. The practice of setting off commissions on policies may also occur in respect of policies sold to third parties. For example, a life agent sells a policy to an unrelated third party and becomes entitled to a commission. Instead of being paid the 8 commission, the life agent sets the commission off against premiums payable on own policies. Here, the commission, although not paid to the life agent, is derived by the life agent and is therefore gross income. 3. Charging of discounted premiums to life agents on own policies or to members of life agents’ families on family policies It is common for life insurers to allow life agents to receive lower commissions in order to discount premiums to prospective clients. The Commissioner understands that if a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise on the sale of a policy, there is a corresponding reduction in the premiums payable under that policy. The Commissioner also understands that when life agents agree that no commission entitlement will arise on their own policies or on family policies, the premiums payable under those policies are reduced. Life agents who agree that no commission entitlement will arise on policies sold to third parties are not assessable on any notional commission, i.e. the amount of commission that would have been received. As discussed, an important feature of income is that it is something that comes in. When a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise no income comes in. This must also be the case when life agents agree that no commission entitlement arises on their own policies or family policies. As the life agent receives no commission, no income arises. Alternative arguments An important feature of income is that it is something that comes in. When life agents agree that no commission entitlement will arise on their own policies no money comes in. They do not receive a cash commission. However, if a life agent decides to either take the commission, or agree that no entitlement will arise and receive a discounted premium on a policy on the agent’s own life or that of his or her family, the issue of convertibility arises. In particular, does the fact that the life agent can receive the commission in lieu of the discounted premium mean that the discounted premium is convertible into money, and therefore assessable? Case law The principle of convertibility was initially laid down in Tennant v Smith \[1892\] 3 T.C. 158. Tennant involved a bank employee who received a benefit in the form of rent-free accommodation. The issue was whether the accommodation was assessable under Schedule E of the UK legislation (by virtue of the words “salaries, fees, wages, perquisites or profits payable”). The Court held that the taxpayer would only be taxable if what he received was convertible into money, i.e. was money or money’s worth. Because the taxpayer could not sublet the accommodation or turn it to pecuniary account in any other way, he was not taxed. 9 The principle of convertibility has been discussed and applied by the New Zealand courts on a number of occasions. See C of IR v Parson (No. 2) (1968) NZLR 574, Stagg v Inland Revenue Commissioner (1959) NZLR 1,252, and Dawson v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1978) 3 NZTC 61,252. The convertibility test is normally satisfied by demonstrating that the benefit may be sold or exchanged for money. ( In Stagg the value of holiday airfares given to an employee was held not to be assessable income of the employee. The employee could not sell the fares or require the company to give him the equivalent cash value.) However, it is clear from case law that there are other ways in which convertibility can be satisfied. See Abbott v Philbin \[1961\] 2 All E.R. 763 and Heaton (Inspector of Taxes) v Bell \[1969\] 2 All E.R. 70. The principle of convertibility was considered by the New Zealand Supreme Court in Dawson. The taxpayer subscribed for debenture stock under a debenture holders’ colour television plan. Under that plan a person could subscribe for debenture stock and would receive in return a TV free of hire for five years. No interest was payable on the debentures. The Commissioner argued that the use of the TV set was the substitution of one form of a benefit for another, i.e. interest, and that in taking the hire of the set rather than the payment of interest, the taxpayer received a benefit which could be valued in terms of money. McMullin J said at page 61,258: In the view which I take of this matter, it is of some importance to note that Objector did not apply for a television set as an alternative to an interest-bearing investment. It is true that it was open to him initially to choose to invest in interest-bearing stock as, I have no doubt, many other investors did, but he completed his application for a television set and a television set only. The Court held that the benefit that the taxpayer received was that he did not have to pay rental for the TV. That benefit did not constitute income in the ordinary sense because the benefit received by the taxpayer was not in monetary form, nor was it capable of being sold, surrendered, assigned, or mortgaged for money or money’s worth. Arguably Dawson provides some support for the view that the receipt of a discounted premium is convertible into money or money’s worth, the discounted premium being a substitution for the commission. It may be implied from the Court’s comments in Dawson that if the taxpayer had the option of investing and receiving either a TV set or an interest-bearing investment, and in fact received a TV set, the benefit would be convertible into money. However, the better view is that discounted premiums are not convertible into money or money’s worth. 10 The fact that a life agent initially has the choice of receiving a commission, or not receiving a commission and enjoying a discounted premium, is not relevant. The issue of convertibility is considered at the time the taxpayer receives the benefit. If a life agent chooses to receive a commission, no question of convertibility arises as the commission is money. However, when a life agent chooses to receive a discounted premium, it is the discounted premium itself that must be convertible into money or money’s worth. At the time the discounted premium is received it cannot be converted into money. Therefore, the convertibility principle does not apply. Conclusion When life agents receive discounted premiums on own policies or members of their families receive discounted premiums on family policies, the amount of the discount is not gross income of the life agent. 4. FBT and discounted policies A life insurer who provides discounted premiums to life agents on policies on their own lives or on the lives of their families or to members of their families on family policies may be liable to FBT. For the purposes of FBT a life agent is an “employee”, regardless of whether the life agent is an employee or an independent contractor at common law. Employee vs independent contractor The terms “employee”, “employer” and “employment” are defined for FBT purposes by reference to the PAYE system. Section OB 1 defines “employee” for the purposes of the FBT rules as: ...a person who will receive, receives, or has at any time received, or who will be, is, or has at any time been entitled to receive, a source deduction payment... Section OB 2(1) defines “source deduction payment” as: ...a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument,... or a withholding payment. “Withholding payment” is defined in section OB 1 as: ...a payment which is declared by regulations under this Act to be a withholding payment for the purposes of the PAYE rules: Under section 4 of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, all payments of the classes specified in the Schedule to the regulations are withholding payments for the purposes of the PAYE rules. Included in Part A of the Schedule are commissions or other remuneration to insurance agents or sub-agents, or to salesmen. 11 A life agent who is an employee at common law is an “employee” for the purposes of FBT because of receiving a source deduction payment, namely salary and wages. A life agent who is an independent contractor at common law is also an “employee” for the purposes of FBT because of receiving a source deduction payment, namely withholding payments. Discounts on family policies If an employer provides a benefit to an associated person of any of the employer’s employees, i.e. a member of the life agent’s immediate family (and the benefit would have been a fringe benefit if provided to an employee), section GC 15(1) deems the benefit to be a benefit provided to the employee. For the purposes of section GC 15, “associated person” is defined in section OD 7(1). An “associated person” includes two persons who are at the time relatives. A relative of a life agent is any person connected with the life agent: • By blood relationship (if within the fourth degree of relationship); or • By marriage (persons are connected by marriage if one is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other); or • By adoption (persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as the child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other). Is there a fringe benefit? As discussed above, when a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise and enjoys a discounted premium, that discounted premium is not gross income of the life agent. A discounted premium that represents a reduction in charges other than commission is also not gross income. A discount is not regarded as gross income. Income is something that comes in, not something that is saved from going out (see Tennant Lord Halsbury at page 165). The issue then is whether discounted premiums received by life agents on own policies or discounted premiums received by members of their families on family policies constitute fringe benefits. Analysis Section CI 1 defines “fringe benefit” for the purposes of the FBT rules: 12 In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter...or income year, means any benefit that consists of- ... Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or...income year,- being, as the case may be...a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee;... It is clear from these opening words that in order to be a fringe benefit there must be some benefit to the employee, provided or granted by the employee’s employer. A life agent may have a discretion to reduce his or her commission in order to reduce premiums on policies sold to members of the public. In this case it may be argued that when life agents do not charge a commission on their own policies and receive discounted premiums, no benefit arises to the life agents because the benefit is also available to members of the public. If a life agent purchases a life insurance policy at full value, i.e. the full amount of premiums are payable, there is no benefit to the life agent or his or her family. However, when a commission is not charged the full amount of premium is not paid. If a life agent agrees that no commission entitlement will arise, be it on an own policy or a policy sold to a member of the public, the amount of premium payable under the policy is reduced. This reduction in premium is clearly a benefit to the life agent and the public alike. A life agent who enjoys a discounted premium, when the discount represents a reduction in charges other than commission, clearly receives a benefit. The benefit is the receipt of the services of the employer (the life insurance policy) for less than market value. Therefore, discounted premiums received by life agents on own policies and discounted premiums received by members of their families on family policies are fringe benefits under section CI 1(h). Note that sections CI 1(e) and CI 1(f) do not apply to discounts received by life agents (or associated persons) on own policies or family policies. The policies sold by the life agent are not “sick, accident, or death benefit funds” as defined in section CB 5(2) (see CI 1(e)), nor is the discount a “specified insurance premium” as defined in section OB 1. The life insurer does not pay the life insurance premiums of the life agent or the agent’s family on the life agent’s own policies or family policies (see section CI 1(f)). Value of the benefit The Act provides methods for valuing a fringe benefit. 13 Specific provisions exist for determining the value of services provided to an employee when they are provided as part of the employer’s business. Here the benefit is the provision of a life insurance policy at less than market value. The life insurer is in the business of selling such life insurance policies to the general public. Therefore, section CI 3(10)(a) applies to determine the value of the benefit. The extent to which the benefit is subject to FBT will depend on the extent to which the discounts provided to life agents or members of life agents’ family are greater than the discounts available to members of the general public. It is a question of fact whether the price paid for the policy by the life agent is the same as is customarily paid by a member of the general public in the open market on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other. There will be no taxable value if the amount paid by the employee is the same as, or exceeds, the price customarily paid by a member of the general public in the open market on ordinary trade terms between buyers and sellers independent of each other. Expenditure on account of an employee The Ruling covers the situation when an employer (the life insurer) provides a benefit to the employee or associated person (the life agent or relative) by discounting the premiums payable by the life agent on the insurance policy. It does not seek to address the situation when the life insurer pays the life insurance premium of a life agent. When a life insurer pays a life agent’s insurance premiums, that expenditure will be expenditure on account of an employee if the employee is liable to pay the insurance premiums. Expenditure on account of an employee is monetary remuneration and is assessable income to the employee. When a life insurer pays a life agent’s insurance premiums, and the life insurer is liable for those premiums, that expenditure is a fringe benefit (unless expressly excluded from the definition of fringe benefit in section CI 1).
1 BAD DEBTS - WRITING OFF DEBTS AS BAD FOR GST AND INCOME TAX PURPOSES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 00/03 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 96/3A, published in TIB Volume 8, No. 10 of December 1996, but this ruling’s period of application is from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2004. Some formatting changes have also been made. BR Pub 96/3A applies up until the end of the 1998-1999 income year. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references to the Income Tax Act are to the Income Tax Act 1994 and all references to the GST Act are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. This Ruling applies in respect of section DJ 1(a)(iii) of the Income Tax Act and section 26(1)(c) of the GST Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the writing off of a debt (or part of a debt) as a bad debt, for income tax and/or GST purposes, in the following circumstances: • An existing debt is owing to the taxpayer; and • The debt is adjudged as “bad” when, having considered the facts objectively, a reasonably prudent business person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid; and • The records kept by the taxpayer comply with the record keeping requirements contained in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the GST Act; and • The bad debt is “written off” in accordance with the accounting and record keeping systems maintained by the taxpayer, involving, at a minimum, write-off: • in the case of a large corporate or business taxpayer who maintains a computerised bad debts system, by an authorised person making the appropriate entry in that system recording the debt as written off; and • in the case of a company (other than one falling within the above class), by an executive or other responsible officer of the company with the authority to do so, making the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the books of account of the company recording the debt as written off; and 2 • in the case of a taxpayer (other than a company) that maintains double-entry accounts, by an authorised person making the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the books of account of the business recording the debt as written off; and • in the case of a taxpayer who is an unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business taxpayer who does not maintain double-entry accounts, by the taxpayer noting, in the bookkeeping records of the taxpayer setting out the amount owed by the bad debtor, that the debt has been written off, and the date of the writing off. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: 1. An income tax deduction is permitted in terms of section DJ 1(a)(iii) of the Income Tax Act. 2. A deduction from GST output tax is permitted in terms of section 26(1)(c) of the GST Act. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 20th day of April 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 00/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/03 (“the Ruling”). Background The Income Tax Act and the GST Act allow taxpayers and/or registered persons a deduction for bad debts if certain criteria are met. Criteria common to both Acts are the requirements that a debt must be both bad and written off before any deduction can be made. The issues that arise when claiming a bad debt deduction are: when a debt is considered bad, and what is required to write off a debt as bad. These issues were previously dealt with in public ruling BR Pub 96/3A and that ruling has been replaced by this Ruling from 1 April 1999. The previous ruling concluded that a debt (or part of a debt) must be both bad and written off before any person can claim an income tax deduction or a deduction from GST output tax (assuming that other legislative requirements in the GST Act and the Income Tax Act are also satisfied). The Ruling sets out the tests to apply in deciding whether or not a debt is “bad” and what is sufficient “writing-off” of a bad debt. Legislation - Income Tax Act Section BD 2(1)(b) allows a deduction for any expenditure or loss incurred by a taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income. However, notwithstanding section BD 2(1)(b), section DJ 1(a) prohibits the deduction of bad debts, except where and to the extent that a number of requirements are met. Section DJ 1 The relevant part of section DJ 1 of the Income Tax Act, in force at the date of commencement of this Ruling (1 April 1999), states: Except as expressly provided in this Act, no deduction is allowed to a taxpayer in respect of any of the following sums or matters: (a) Bad debts, except where and to the extent that,— (i) In the case of a debt which is an amount owing to the taxpayer in respect of a financial arrangement where the accruals rules apply to the taxpayer in respect of the financial arrangement, a deduction is allowed under section EH 5; and 4 (ii) In any case other than that of a debt which is an amount owing to the taxpayer in respect of a financial arrangement where the accruals rules apply to the taxpayer in respect of the financial arrangement, the bad debt is not a loss of capital subject to section BD 2(2)(e); and (iii) The debt is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year; and (iv) In any case where- (A) The taxpayer is a company; and (B) The debt is owed by a company (referred to in this subparagraph as the “debtor”); and (C) The application of the amount giving rise to the debt is taken into account in calculating a net loss (referred to in this subparagraph as the “resultant loss”) of the debtor or any other company funded (directly or indirectly) by the debtor; and (D) Any one or more amounts have been offset under section IG 2 of this Act or section 191A of the Income Tax Act 1976 by the taxpayer (or by any other company which is at any time in the income year in which the resultant loss is incurred in the same group of companies as the taxpayer), in any income year commencing on or after 1 April 1993 and preceding the income year in which the bad debt is written off, in respect of the resultant loss,-- the debt exceeds the aggregate of the amounts so offset. Section DJ 1(a)(iii) sets out one of the requirements to be satisfied to get a bad debt deduction, namely that the debt must be proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year. It is this part of the income tax bad debt deduction provision that is addressed in the Ruling and discussed more fully in the Application of the Legislation section of this commentary. Other section DJ 1(a) requirements (in summary form) that must also be satisfied are: • Section DJ 1(a)(i) - If the debt is an amount owing under a financial arrangement and the accruals rules apply to the taxpayer in respect of the financial arrangement, a deduction must be allowed under section EH 5. However, any such bad debt deduction is still conditional on satisfaction of the section DJ 1(a)(iii) requirement that the debt is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year. \[NOTE: The accruals rules have recently been rewritten by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. Section DJ 1 as set out above has also been amended with effect from 20 May 1999 to take account of consequential changes made by that Act. A more detailed discussion about bad debts that arise where the accruals rules apply, and the changes made by the above Act, appears at the end of this commentary.\]; and • Section DJ 1(a)(ii) - If the debt is not an amount owing in respect of a financial arrangement to which the accruals rules apply, the bad debt must not be a loss of capital that is subject to section BD 2(2)(e); and 5 • Section DJ 1(a)(iv) - If the taxpayer is a company and the debt is owed to that company by another company (“the debtor”) and • The amount giving rise to the debt is taken into account in calculating a loss incurred by the debtor or any other company funded by the debtor; and • Any amounts of that loss have been offset under the group company loss offset provisions in section IG 2, or section 191A of the Income Tax Act 1976, by the taxpayer (or any other company in the same group as the taxpayer in the year the loss is incurred), in any income years from 1993/94 and preceding that in which the bad debt is written off, - the deduction allowed for the bad debt is the amount by which the debt exceeds the total amounts offset. Bad debts recovered Under section CE 1(1)(d), amounts received by a person on account of a bad debt for which a deduction has previously been allowed to the person are included as gross income of the person. Legislation - GST Act Section 26 The relevant part of section 26(1) of the GST Act states: Where a registered person - (a) Has made a taxable supply for consideration in money; and (b) Has furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable and has properly accounted for the output tax on that supply as required under this Act; and (c) Has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person,- that registered person shall make a deduction under section 20(3) of this Act of that portion of the amount of tax charged in relation to that supply as the amount written off as a bad debt bears to the total consideration for the supply: Section 26 is the main provision applying to bad debts for GST purposes. The section applies to registered persons who account for GST on an invoice or hybrid basis. It also applies to registered persons who account for GST on a payments basis when the relevant supply is by way of a hire purchase sale or a door to door sale. 6 Section 26(1) allows a registered person to make a deduction from output tax for that portion of the amount of tax charged in relation to a supply as the amount written off as a bad debt bears to the total consideration for the supply. To claim the deduction, the registered person must satisfy a number of criteria. Section 26(1)(c) sets out one of these, namely that the registered person must have written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person. The other section 26(1) criteria (in summary form) also to be satisfied are that the registered person must have: • Section 26(1)(a) - Made a taxable supply for consideration in money (from which the bad debt arose); and • Section 26(1)(b) - Furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable, and properly accounted for the output tax on the supply. A proviso is effective if goods are supplied under a hire purchase agreement to which the Hire Purchase Act 1971 applies. In this case the registered person makes a deduction from output tax of the tax fraction (being the tax fraction applicable at the time the hire purchase agreement was entered into) of that portion of the amount written off as a bad debt as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement. A special provision exists for registered persons who supply contracts of insurance relating to earthquakes, wars, and fires (see section 26(1A)). Application of the Legislation As indicated earlier, criteria common to both the Income Tax and GST Acts are the requirements that a debt must be both bad and actually written off before any deduction can be made. This section of the commentary is therefore divided into two parts, discussing firstly the tests to apply in deciding whether or not a debt is “bad”, and secondly what is sufficient “writing-off” of a bad debt. First requirement - Debt must be “bad” A debt must be “bad” before it can be written off and before any deduction can be claimed for that debt. Whether or not a debt (or part of a debt) is bad is a question to be determined objectively, rather than a question to be determined by the subjective opinion of any particular individual. The objective test that any person should ask himself or herself in deciding whether or not a debt is bad, is whether a reasonably prudent business person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. 7 This objective test was outlined by Tompkins J in the High Court decision of Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263, at 12,269: The term “bad debt” is not defined in the Act. It, therefore, should be given its normal commercial meaning. It is a question of fact to be determined objectively. A debt becomes a bad debt when a reasonably prudent commercial person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid in whole or in part by the debtor or by someone else either on behalf of the debtor or otherwise. A similar test was outlined by Barber DJ in Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541, at 3,548: Naturally, the debts in question must be “bad” to be written off as bad in terms of s. 106(1)(b). This is a question of fact. Generally, an application of that criterion will not be difficult as the debtor will be insolvent. However, the debtor does not need to be insolvent for the debt to be bad. It is only necessary that there be a bona fide assessment that the debtor is unlikely to make payment of the debt. If there is a clear understanding or arrangement that there be long term credit, and if the taxpayer believes that the terms of the credit will be met, then the debt cannot be treated as bad because it is merely a situation of deferred payment. In my view, as well as the need for the writing off to be made bona fide, the circumstances must indicate to a reasonable and prudent business person that, on the balance of probability, the debt is unlikely to be recovered. This is an objective test. The creditor taxpayer may, of course still hope for recovery and is quite entitled to institute recovery procedures. It is not necessary to have taken recovery or legal steps. ... It does not follow from the taxpayer hoping for or seeking recovery that a debt is not bad. However, usually, when a debt is assessed as bad, in terms of the type of criteria I have outlined, hopes or efforts of recovery will be futile. The decision in Case N69 was cited with approval by Doogue J in the High Court decision of Graham v CIR, Edwards Graham Ltd & Edwards v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,107, at 12,111. As is evident from the quotations above, different wording is used by the High Court in Budget Rent A Car and the TRA in Case N69 to describe the test of when a debt can be considered written off as bad. To summarise these differences, in Budget Rent A Car the words used were “no reasonable likelihood” that the debt (or part of the debt) will be paid, whereas in Case N69 the words used were that “on the balance of probability, the debt is unlikely to be recovered”. Despite the apparent difference between the words used in the tests applied in Case N69 and in Budget Rent A Car, Barber DJ in Case T27 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188, at 8,194 stated that his approach in Case N69 was confirmed in Budget Rent A Car. In saying this Barber DJ first cited his own statement containing the test referred to from Case N69 and immediately followed this by stating: That approach was confirmed in Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263 and on that point Tompkins J said at 12,269: and then citing the objective test from that case included above. Barber DJ regards the “tests” as the same. The Commissioner agrees with this view. 8 At the time of deciding whether a debt is bad, a person will therefore need to have sufficient information to enable a reasonably prudent business person to form the view that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. The facts needing to be gathered depend on the circumstances surrounding any particular case. While no factor is decisive in itself, factors that are likely to be relevant in most instances are: • The length of time a debt is outstanding - the longer a debt is outstanding the more likely it is that a reasonably prudent business person would consider the debt to be bad. • The efforts that a creditor has taken to collect a debt - the greater the extent to which a person has tried (unsuccessfully) to collect a debt, the more likely it is that a reasonably prudent business person would consider the debt to be bad. • Other information obtained by a creditor - a creditor may have obtained particular information about a debtor, e.g. through business or personal networks, that would be a factor in leading a reasonably prudent business person to conclude that a debt is bad. For example, a creditor may know that the debtor is in financial difficulties and has defaulted on debts owed to other creditors. A debtor does not need to be insolvent for a debt to be bad (although this will often be the case). Taxpayer’s opinion A debt becomes a bad debt when a reasonably prudent business person objectively concludes that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. In many instances, a taxpayer’s considered opinion will suffice. However, the Commissioner also recognises that taxpayers have a financial interest in treating a debt as bad. Writing off a debt as bad entitles a taxpayer to: • A deduction in calculating income for income tax purposes, worth up to 39% of the debt, depending on the taxpayer’s marginal income tax rate: • A GST deduction from output tax of the tax fraction of the debt. Because of this, the Commissioner may inquire into the decision to treat a debt as bad in the course of tax audits or other enquiries. It is desirable, therefore, that taxpayers document and retain evidence in relation to their decisions to treat debts as bad to show that they made reasonable decisions. Documentation may include noting down the information from which the decision was made that the debt was bad, and keeping copies of any correspondence relating to the debt. 9 Information required The amount of information required to decide whether a debt is bad depends on the particular circumstances of each case. If the amount involved is small, a reasonably prudent business person is likely to make limited enquiries and take limited recovery action. Particular knowledge or information obtained by a taxpayer may also reduce the need for enquiry. In the final analysis however, the test is always whether the taxpayer has sufficient information to reasonably draw the conclusion that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid, even if further or any recovery action were to be taken. Recovery action A creditor is likely to have taken recovery action in most cases before a deduction for a bad debt is made, although it is not a requirement that such action be taken before a decision is made that a debt is bad. However, it is through taking recovery action that most creditors will form an opinion as to whether a debt is bad. While recovery action is being taken, a debt can only be considered bad to the extent that a reasonably prudent business person would consider there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. In some instances, taking recovery action may carry with it the reasonable expectation of recovery of some part of the amount involved. However, this will not always be the case. The decision to take recovery action and the extent of that action will depend on the circumstances surrounding any particular case. In some cases, the creditor may take no or only limited recovery action because enough information is held to form a reasonable view that the debt is bad. The amount of information needed depends on the circumstances. Conversely, the creditor may take recovery action even when a reasonable view has been formed that the debt is bad. For a number of reasons the creditor might take recovery action even when it is believed that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be recovered. This may be the case, for example, when the creditor has a policy of pursuing debtors to a certain extent to discourage customers defaulting on debt. Provision for doubtful debts Persons in business who provide credit often find it prudent to make some provision for the likelihood that some of their debtors will not pay. This allowance is generally calculated by estimating a percentage on the basis of past history, and applying that percentage to the total amount of debts owed to the business at balance date. Bad debts are individually identifiable debts that are unlikely to be recovered (in practical terms). The provision for doubtful debts is an estimate of the amount that will become 10 bad debts in the future. The Income Tax Act and the GST Act do not allow any deduction for provisions for doubtful debts. Debts that are partially bad In some cases there may be no reasonable expectation that the debt will be fully recovered, but there may be a reasonable expectation of partial recovery. In this case the part that the creditor has no reasonable expectation of recovering is a bad debt. It is only that part of the debt that the creditor is entitled to write off as bad and claim as a deduction for income tax and GST purposes. Examples of when a debt is/is not bad Example 1 A supplier has supplied goods on credit to Mr B. Mr B owes the supplier $2,000 for the goods. The supplier knows that Mr B has left town, and that mail addressed to him is returned marked “Gone No Address”. In this case it is reasonable to assume that the debt will not be recovered. The money owed by Mr B is a bad debt. Example 2 C owes $100,000 to a company. The credit controller for the company has considered the likelihood of default on every loan currently owing to the company. The credit controller has estimated the likelihood of default for C to be 5%, and wants to know if the company can consider $5,000 of that loan (5% of the $100,000 owing) to be a bad debt. Making an estimate of the likelihood of default on debts is not sufficient for a debt (or a percentage thereof) to be bad. It is not reasonable to assume that the debt is bad. Example 3 A local dairy has supplied $64 worth of bread and cigarettes to Mrs D on credit. Mrs D used to call into the shop every other day, but has not called into the shop for eight weeks and the dairy has heard that someone else is living in the house Mrs D used to rent. The $64 is still owing. Given the relatively small amount owing and the information known to the dairy, it is reasonable for the dairy to make no further enquiries. On the basis of the dairy’s information, it can be assumed that the money is unlikely to be recovered. It is a bad debt. However, if the sum involved was somewhat larger, it may be reasonable to expect the dairy to make some further enquiry. 11 Example 4 A solicitor has done work for Mr O and billed him for $1,700. The solicitor is on the Board of Trustees of the school attended by Mr O’s children. The solicitor has sent out a number of reminder bills because the bill is 4-months overdue, but has had no response. Several of the solicitor’s friends and associates have mentioned that Mr O is in financial difficulty and has had one of his vehicles repossessed. The solicitor’s office clerk has noted that Mr O’s name has been cited in the Gazette several times over recent months in respect of court action for unpaid debts. It is reasonable for the solicitor to characterise Mr O’s debt as a bad debt. Example 5 A debtor of Mr F is a company in liquidation. Mr F has given the liquidator notice of a debt of $10,000 owed for goods and services supplied. Mr F is an unsecured creditor. The liquidator has held a meeting of creditors. Mr F attended the meeting and received formal notice of the outcome of the meeting. The liquidator has stated that unsecured creditors will probably receive something between 45 and 50 cents in the dollar. It is reasonable for Mr F to assume that $5,000 of the total debt is bad. He is entitled to write off that part of the debt that is bad in the income year in which he received the formal notice, and to claim a deduction for income tax and GST purposes. Example 6 The same facts exist as in Example 5, but at a later date Mr F receives a letter from the liquidator who advises that the estimate of the likely recovery has been revised. It is now expected that unsecured creditors will be paid between 70 and 75 cents in the dollar. This does not affect the answer given above in Example 5. Also, it has no effect on Mr F’s GST return or income tax return if Mr F has claimed a deduction for the bad debt. If at any stage Mr F receives payment of any part of the 50 cents in the dollar written off, Mr F must: • Include it as gross income in the income tax return for the year in which it is received (this will give rise to an income tax liability unless there are losses to offset against it, and may give rise to a provisional tax liability, depending on the taxpayer’s circumstances); and • Account for GST on the amount recovered in the same proportion as Mr F was allowed a deduction from output tax when the bad debt was written off. Second requirement - Debt must be “written off” 12 The Income Tax Act and the GST Act allow taxpayers and/or registered persons deductions for writing off bad debts. It is not enough that a debt is bad: the bad debt must also be actually written off. Writing off the bad debt is important because this will fix the time at which the deduction can be made. Note that there is no requirement that a debt be written off in the year it becomes bad. As Tompkins J in the High Court decision of Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (supra) at 12,271 stated: A debt is not normally deductible. It does not become a deductible debt if and when it becomes a bad debt. It becomes a deductible debt, if it has been incurred in the production of assessable income, when it is written off. It is the writing off that converts the debt into a deductible debt. It follows that the crucial time is the time of the writing off, not the time the debt becomes a bad debt. It also follows that the income year referred to in s 106(1)(b) is not the year the debt became bad. In my view, the income year referred to is the year during which the bad debt was “actually written off”. There is no provision in the Act that requires the bad debt to be written off in the year the debt became bad. Had that been the intention of the legislature, it would have said so ... Barber DJ in the Taxation Review Authority discussed the requirement to write off bad debts in Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541. Barber DJ said at 3,547: I consider it elementary that the writing off of a debt as bad requires something more than the mere recognition by the taxpayer, or one or more of its executives, that a debt is unlikely to be paid. It could be reasoned that only a decision of the taxpayer to write off a debt is needed, subject to the debt being bad. However, I consider that, in terms of sec 106(1)(b), book-keeping steps must also be taken to record that the debt has been written off. Desirably, the steps would comprise a directors’ resolution, if the taxpayer is a corporate, and appropriate book-keeping entries. However, it would be adequate for a responsible officer or executive of a corporate or business to merely make the appropriate book-keeping entries if he or she has that authority. An unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business would not, of course, have a directorate so that book entries by the trader or his or her manager will suffice. In my view, it is not possible to write off a debt as bad without the making of authorised journal entries in the books of account of the business. In Case T48 (1998) 18 NCTC 8,325 the Taxation Review Authority held that for a private individual trader, as distinct from an incorporated company, words on ledger cards such as “written off” with the relevant date are sufficient to indicate that the debt had been actually written off as bad. The taxpayers did not have to meet any other book- keeping requirements. Taxpayers must therefore be able to clearly show that the debt has been actually written off as bad. Case law indicates that the minimum requirements to satisfy the actually written off as bad test may vary for different classes of taxpayer based on the differing nature and level of sophistication of the taxpayer’s accounting records. However, no matter what form a taxpayer’s books of account or accounting records may take, those existing in respect of a debt owed by a bad debtor must record that the taxpayer, or an authorised person on behalf of the taxpayer, having decided the debt is bad, has written off the debt accordingly. The minimum requirements considered necessary to meet the written off test for various classes of taxpayer are as follows. The bad debt is “written off” in accordance with the 13 accounting and record keeping systems maintained by the taxpayer, involving, at a minimum, write-off: • in the case of a large corporate or business taxpayer who maintains a computerised bad debts system, by an authorised person making the appropriate entry in that system recording the debt as written off; and • in the case of a company (other than one falling within the above class), by an executive or other responsible officer of the company with the authority to do so, making the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the books of account of the company recording the debt as written off; and • in the case of a taxpayer (other than a company) that maintains double-entry accounts, by an authorised person making the appropriate bookkeeping entries in the books of account of the business recording the debt as written off; and • in the case of a taxpayer who is an unincorporated sole trader or small unincorporated business taxpayer who does not maintain double-entry accounts, by the taxpayer noting, in the bookkeeping records of the taxpayer setting out the amount owed by the bad debtor, that the debt has been written off, and the date of the writing off. Further details of the specific form the necessary write off of a bad debt may take in the creditor taxpayer’s books are outlined in the next section of this commentary. It is the writing-off that determines the time when a deduction for a bad debt can be claimed. The necessary writing-off must therefore take place before the end of the income year or GST taxable period in which the bad debt deduction is claimed. Writing- off a bad debt cannot be backdated. Therefore, if there are numerous debts to review, it is important to allow sufficient time for this exercise, as well as for completing all necessary “writing-off” accounting entries before the end of an income year or GST taxable period, to enable any bad debts to be deducted in that year or GST taxable period. In all cases the business records kept by the taxpayer must comply with the requirements of section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and section 75 of the GST Act. Accounts kept by taxpayers Most taxpayers in business keep double-entry accounts. If a person keeps double-entry accounting records, the bad debt must be struck out of the records on which the double- entry accounts are based. If debtors ledgers are maintained, the writing-off will be able to be clearly shown by the appropriate bookkeeping entries having been made in the debtors ledger by authorised persons. Generally, this means that the balance in the debtors ledger for the individual debtor must be reduced by the amount of the bad debt. No matter what processes are followed in the course of preparing a person’s double-entry accounts, it is the completion of the appropriate authorised entry(s) actually writing-off a 14 debt (which it has been decided is bad in accordance with the tests already outlined) that is essential to deductibility. In cases where a taxpayer does not keep double-entry accounting records and/or does not keep a debtors ledger, the person must write the debt off according to the form of records used. This means that whatever the form of records used, those showing the amount owed by the bad debtor must clearly record that the creditor, having made the decision that the debt is bad (in accordance with the tests already outlined), has written the debt off accordingly. Particular examples of bad debts accepted by the Commissioner as having been written off are: • If a taxpayer’s only records of debts are copies of invoices issued, placing the invoice in a “bad debts” file and indicating on the invoice whether all or part of the invoiced amount is bad and the date, is sufficient. • If a taxpayer’s only records of debts are copies of invoices and copies of statements of account issued from a duplicate account book, marking the copy of the final statement sent out “bad debt – written off” (noting the amount of the debt that is bad and the date) is sufficient. Alternatively, it would also be sufficient for the taxpayer to place the relevant invoice in a “bad debts” file indicating on the invoice whether all or part of the invoiced amount is bad and the date this was done. Keeping records for credit control or other purposes For a variety of reasons, a creditor may keep a separate record of bad debts written off. For example, the records may be necessary if the creditor should ever have the opportunity of collecting the debt in the future, or the creditor may want to keep a record of problem customers to avoid future difficulties. As long as these records are quite separate from the accounting base records they will not affect the write-off. If the creditor ceases to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes by removing it from the accounting base records, it is written off. More than one set of accounts Some businesses have more than one set of accounts. For example, a company may prepare: • Financial accounts for financial reporting purposes to satisfy the requirements of the Companies Act 1955 or 1993; and • Management accounts as a basis for management decision-making and control. 15 The sets of accounts may be prepared in quite different ways. For example, statutory requirements are set out in the Financial Reporting Act 1993 for preparing financial reports that are not required when preparing management accounts; and management accounts may be prepared on the basis of estimates for some elements in order to provide very quick reports. When the different sets of accounts rely on the same underlying debtor records, no difficulty arises. As long as the creditor ceases to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes by removing it from the accounting base records, it is written off. However, if the debt is still recognised as an asset in the underlying records, it is not written off. If the different sets of accounts rely on different underlying debtor records (which is very rare), the creditor should refer to the accounts that are relied on to represent the firm’s financial position. For a company, these will be the accounts used to satisfy the company’s financial reporting obligations under the relevant Companies Act. Examples of when a bad debt is/is not written off General facts The following facts apply to all the following examples: • The taxpayer’s income tax balance date is 31 March. • The only question is whether a debt has been written off. All other criteria are satisfied. • The debt is for goods and services supplied for money. • The supply has been included in the taxpayer’s gross income for income tax purposes. In the examples where the taxpayer is a GST registered person, the following additional facts apply: • GST returns are filed on a two-monthly invoice basis. • The supply has been included in a GST return. Example 1 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The debtors ledger is updated on 31 March 1999. The entries made include the journal entry writing off the bad debt. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 1999. Example 2 16 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The debtors ledger is written up on 1 April 1999. The entries written up include the journal entry writing off the bad debt. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 2000. Example 3 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is registered for GST. There is no indication on her underlying debtor records to show the status of the debt. She has claimed a deduction from output tax for the bad debt in her GST return for the taxable period ending 31 January 1999. That return was prepared in February 1999. The taxpayer is not entitled to the deduction from GST output tax. She is not allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the income year ending 31 March 1999. Claiming the deduction from output tax for GST purposes is not a sufficient writing-off of the bad debt. Example 4 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. The taxpayer’s only records of debts owing to him are copies of issued invoices. The taxpayer maintains only rudimentary books of account, and his unpaid debtors are represented by loose-leaf filing of accounts and/or invoices issued in a ring-binder file. When a debt is paid it (the account and/or invoice) is transferred to a separate file. The taxpayer ceases sending accounts for the debt in question in February 1999, putting a line across the copy of the last statement sent out in respect of the debt and marking it “Final” and leaves it in the unpaid debtors’ file. The taxpayer is not entitled to a deduction for the bad debt in the year ended 31 March 1999. Simply marking the last statement issued as “Final” and leaving it in the unpaid debtors’ file does not amount to writing off of the debt. Example 5 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. His only records of debts owing are copies of invoices and statements issued. In February 1999 the taxpayer became aware that a debt was bad. He stopped sending out statements for the debt and took no other action on it. In particular, he sent out no statements on the account in February and March 1999. The taxpayer continued to send out statements on all the other debts owing, including overdue accounts. The taxpayer keeps carbon copies of the statements of account in the duplicate account book from which the statements for issue are prepared. The taxpayer has tagged the final statement sent out in respect of the debt, circling the amount payable and marking it “bad debt - written off - February 1999”. 17 The taxpayer is allowed a deduction for the bad debt in the year ending 31 March 1999. The cessation of statements of account, recorded by their absence in the duplicate account book, and the tagging and marking of the final statement, amount to writing off the debt in his accounting system. Example 6 The taxpayer maintains a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. She wrote up the debtors ledger on 31 March 1999. The entries written up include a journal entry writing off a bad debt. Her accountant prepares her accounts in June 1999. In the course of preparing the accounts, the accountant makes a general ledger entry recognising the bad debt as a result of the debtors ledger entry made by the taxpayer on 31 March 1999. The bad debt is deductible in the year ending 31 March 1999, because the underlying accounting record of the debt was altered to recognise the bad debt on 31 March 1999. Example 7 The taxpayer does not maintain a debtors ledger and is not registered for GST. Her only records of debts owing are copies of invoices issued. On 15 March 1999 she placed the invoice for the debt in question in a file marked “BAD DEBTS” noting on the invoice next to the total amount “debt bad – filed 15/3/99”. The amount of trade creditors in the taxpayer’s balance sheet as at 31 March 1999 includes the bad debt. The taxpayer’s profit and loss statement for the year ending 31 March 1999 includes as income the sale that has become a bad debt. The profit and loss statement does not recognise any expense for bad or doubtful debts. The taxpayer’s income tax return for the year ending 31 March 1999 includes the profit and loss statement and a “tax reconciliation statement” showing the difference between the accounting income and the amount she believes to be income for income tax purposes. The tax reconciliation statement includes a deduction for the bad debt. The taxpayer is not allowed a deduction for the bad debt. Although the debt has arguably been written off in the underlying accounting records, she has not ceased to recognise the debt as an asset for accounting purposes. ACCRUALS RULES General The accruals rules in Subpart EH of the Income Tax Act provide rules for the timing and recognition of income derived and expenditure incurred in respect of “financial arrangements”. 18 The accruals rules have recently been rewritten by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. The amendments made by this Act apply, in general, to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. The changes made in relation to the allowable deductions for bad debts are discussed later in this item. Two general changes made by the amendment Act are: • The creation of divisions of rules, one applying to financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999, and those that were entered into on or after 20 May 1999. These are referred to as Division 1 and Division 2 respectively. • Division 1 financial arrangements are referred to as coming within the accruals rules, while Division 2 financial arrangements are referred to as coming within the accrual rules. The requirement in section DJ 1(a)(iii) that a debt “is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year”, must be satisfied before any deduction can be claimed for a bad debt under the accrual(s) rules (sections EH 6(4) and EH 54(1)). Accordingly, the tests used in deciding whether or not a debt is “bad” and what is sufficient “writing-off” of a bad debt, apply equally to debts for which a bad debt deduction arises under the accrual(s) rules. DIVISION 1: Financial arrangements entered into before 20 May 1999 Although the significant accrual(s) rules changes made by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 apply to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999, the rules as they affect arrangements entered into before that date have also been rewritten. As part of this process, the accruals bad debt deduction provisions, formerly in section EH 5, have been re-enacted as section EH 6. Apart from the inclusion of headings for each sub-paragraph and necessary updating of some references to other new section and subsection numbers referred to, there are no wording changes between the former section EH 5 and the new section EH 6. What is a financial arrangement? A “financial arrangement” is widely defined and means a debt or debt instrument or an arrangement under which a person receives money in consideration for the provision of money to any person, either at a future time, or when an event occurs (or does not occur) in the future. Essentially, a financial arrangement is any transaction that involves deferral of the giving of consideration. Mortgages, bank and other loans, commercial bills, and treasury stock are examples of debt type financial arrangements. Certain specific exceptions are created, and they are designated as “excepted financial arrangements”. This category includes equity type instruments (debentures, shares), insurance contracts, employment contracts, games of chance, short term credit 19 agreements and options. Those debts falling within the “excepted financial arrangement” definition have their deductibility as bad debts considered under section DJ 1(a). The main type of financial arrangement, in relation to bad debts, that is excluded from the Division 1 definition of “financial arrangement”, is likely to be a short term trade credit. Short term trade credits are an “excepted financial arrangement”. “Short term trade credit” is defined as: .... any debt for goods or services where payment is required by the vendor- (a) Within 63 days after the supply of the goods or services; or (b) Because the supply of the goods or services is continuous and the vendor renders periodic invoices for the goods or services, within 63 days after the date of an invoice rendered for those goods or services: Therefore, a short term trade credit is a debt for goods or services owed to a vendor within 63 days after supply or, where the supply is continuous, the vendor expects payment within 63 days after the date an invoice is issued for those goods and services. Arrangements entered into before the introduction of the accruals rules are also excluded from the definition of “financial arrangement”. What this means as far as a deduction for bad debts is concerned is that the deduction for bad debts arising in respect of a short term trade credit is considered under the general bad debt deduction provision in section DJ 1(a) and not under the accruals rules’ section EH 6. Revenue bad debts Section EH 6(1) will only apply in limited circumstances to a cash basis holder. A cash basis holder is a natural person for whom either the total value of all financial arrangements held by that person will not exceed $600,000 or the income derived during the income year from financial arrangements does not exceed $70,000. Furthermore, the difference between the income that would be returned under the accruals rules, and the income returned as a cash basis holder, must not exceed a $20,000 deferral threshold. Section EH 6(1) permits a person to deduct an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement where and to the extent that: • The person derives gross income in respect of the financial arrangement under: • Section EH 1 - one of the methods of calculating accrual income; or • Section EH 3(4) - the adjustment required in any year when a person ceases to be a cash basis holder; or 20 • Section EH 4 - the base price adjustment calculated in the year a financial arrangement matures or is transferred; or • Section EH 8 - the post facto adjustment for financial arrangements which have the effect of defeating the intent and application of the accruals regime; and • The amount written off is attributable to that gross income. In other words, a bad debt comprising income from a financial arrangement previously returned by the taxpayer under the accruals rules is allowed as a deduction under section EH 6(1). The purpose of the base price adjustment is to ensure that all income derived and all expenditure incurred is taken account of for that financial arrangement when it is either sold, matures, is remitted, or transferred. The post facto adjustment is used to recalculate assessable income or any loss incurred in respect of the financial arrangement using the yield to maturity method in certain circumstances where: • any amount payable under the financial arrangement is determined, according to the terms of the financial arrangement, at the discretion of the holder or the issuer, or any other person who is an associated person of the holder or the issuer; and • when exercising this discretion the change in the amounts payable under the financial arrangement does not reflect changes in economic, commodity, industrial or financial indices or banking or commercial rates; and • the making of such a financial arrangement is not a generally accepted commercial practice; and • the effect of the arrangement is to defeat the intent and application of the accruals rules. “Yield to maturity” is a method of spreading income and expenditure over the life of the financial arrangement. Under the Income Tax Act, where the parties to a transaction are in a close relationship with each other they are classed as associated persons: for example relatives, partnerships, and individuals that hold majority interests or voting rights in a company. Association is measured by reference to voting and, where applicable, market value interests, rather than to nominal and paid-up capital. The relationship of association is defined in section OD 7(1). 21 Section EH 6(4) provides that the requirement in section DJ 1(a)(iii), that a debt “is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year”, must still be satisfied before any deduction can be claimed. Capital bad debts Section EH 6(2) provides for the deduction of the capital or principal element of a financial arrangement in certain circumstances. Section EH 6(2) allows a person a deduction for an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement (not being an amount deductible under section EH 6(1)) where: • The person carries on a business comprising the holding or dealing in such financial arrangements and the person is not associated with the person owing the amount written off (see section OD 7 for test of association); or • The financial arrangement is a trade credit and the person carries on the business of dealing in the goods or services for which the trade credit is a debt. “Trade credit” is defined in section OB 1 to mean any debt for goods and services, other than a short term trade credit. As with Revenue bad debts above, section EH 6(4) requires (through section DJ 1(a)(iii)) that a debt “is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been actually written off as a bad debt by the taxpayer in the income year” before any deduction can be claimed. Security payments Under section EH 6(3), if a person receives a security payment for a loss and a deduction is not otherwise allowable for the loss, the person may be allowed a deduction for the loss up to the amount of the security payment. The purpose of section EH 6(3) is to avoid the situation where the person is taxed on the security payment but does not receive a deduction for the loss incurred. A “security payment” means money received by, and that is gross income of, the holder of a security arrangement for any loss suffered because that arrangement is not performed. A “security arrangement” is a financial arrangement that secures the holder against failure of a person to perform their obligations under another arrangement. That other arrangement does not need to be a financial arrangement. A payment made under a guarantee is a security payment. DIVISION 2: Financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999 This section briefly outlines the effect of the changes made by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 in the context of deductions allowed for 22 bad debts under the accrual rules. As stated above, the amendments apply, in general, to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. Allowable deductions for bad debts Deductions for bad debts under the accrual rules are now contained in section EH 54. Section EH 54, by and large, replicates the bad debt deduction provisions from the former section EH 5 (now re-enacted as section EH 6), while the security payments and share loss deduction provisions from these sections are now contained in section EH 55. The most significant changes as they relate to the deduction of bad debts, are: • The cash basis threshold is increased from $600,000 to $1,000,000 and income from investments from $70,000 to $100,000. In addition, the $20,000 deferral threshold, the maximum allowable difference between the income that would be returned under the accruals rules and the income returned as a cash basis holder, has been increased to $40,000. • There is only one excepted financial arrangement for short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services, unless a person elects otherwise, and this is for those agreements where settlement or performance must occur within 93 days. • Deductions are allowed for dealers or providers of goods and services when credit is extended under an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services. Revenue bad debts Section EH 54(2) permits a person to deduct an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement where and to the extent that: • The person derives gross income in respect of the financial arrangement; and • The amount written off is attributable to the income. Capital bad debts Section EH 54(3) provides for the deduction of the capital or principal element of a financial arrangement in certain circumstances. Section EH 54(3) allows a person a deduction for an amount written off as a bad debt in respect of a financial arrangement (not being an amount deductible under section EH 54(2)) where: • The person carries on a business that includes holding or dealing in financial arrangements that are the same or similar; and • The person is not associated with the person owing the amount written off. 23 Bad debts - agreements for sale and purchase of property or services Section EH 54(4) allows a person a bad debt deduction (for an amount that is not allowed as a deduction under section EH 54(2) or (3)) where: • The financial arrangement is an agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services; and • The person carries on a business of dealing in the property or services that are the subject of the agreement. Previous rules applying to trade credits have been integrated with the rules for agreements for the sale and purchase of property, and these have also been extended to apply to the provision of services. As a result of the integration, the bad debt provisions are extended to taxpayers in the business of dealing in the goods or services that are the subject of the agreements for the sale and purchase of property or services. Transitional adjustments As mentioned earlier, the amended accrual rules (Division 2) apply to financial arrangements entered into on or after 20 May 1999. However, under section EH 17 taxpayers are able to elect to apply these new rules to financial arrangements entered into before that date (i.e. Division 1 financial arrangements). This will be useful if taxpayers wish to account for all arrangements on a similar basis. Further details of this option, and other changes to the accruals rules, are included in the full discussion on the amending legislation in TIB Vol.11, No.6 (July 1999).
1 SUPPLIES PAID FOR IN FOREIGN CURRENCY – GST TREATMENT PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 00/04 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 95/12, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 7 (January 1996), but this ruling’s period of application is from 1 March 1999 to 29 February 2004. Some formatting changes have also been made. BR Pub 95/12 applies when the time of supply occurred prior to 1 March 1999. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 2(1) (definition of “money”), 3(1) (definition of “financial services”), 10(2), 14(a), and 77. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the acceptance by a registered person of payment in foreign currency for a taxable supply of goods or services made in New Zealand. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: 1. The value of the taxable supply is the amount of foreign currency converted to New Zealand currency at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. 2. The appropriate exchange rate is the rate offered by a registered bank or a bureau de change at the time of supply. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 March 1999 to 29 February 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of May 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 00/04 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/04 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in this Ruling was previously dealt with by BR Pub 95/12 and in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 7 (January 1996), at page 17. This Ruling applies for the period from 1 March 1999 to 29 February 2004. Background Public Ruling BR Pub 95/12 dealt with the GST consequences of receiving payment in foreign currency for taxable supplies of goods and services made in New Zealand. A number of registered persons, particularly those involved in tourism, accept foreign currency as payment for supplies of goods and services. Often a registered person will offer the customer an “in-house” exchange rate. This exchange rate is less favourable to the customer than other exchange rates. That is, the customer gets less New Zealand currency for the foreign currency than that obtainable at a bank or a bureau de change. The registered supplier will exchange the foreign currency at a bank and receive New Zealand currency. Because the bank exchange rate is better than the exchange rate the registered person gave the customer, the registered person will make a profit on the conversion of the foreign currency. The Ruling considers the GST treatment of such a profit. In particular, the Ruling considers whether the profit is consideration for an exempt supply, or whether the profit is part of the consideration for a taxable supply. Legislation Section 2(1) defines “money”: “Money” includes- (a) Bank notes and other currency, being any negotiable instruments used or circulated, or intended for use or circulation, as currency; and (b) Postal notes and money orders; and (c) Promissory notes and bills of exchange,- whether of New Zealand or any other country, but does not include a collector’s piece, investment article, or item of numismatic interest. Section 3(1) defines “financial services”. Under paragraph (a): For the purposes of this Act, the term “financial services” means any one or more of the following activities: (a) The exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debiting accounts, or otherwise)... Section 14(a) exempts supplies of financial services from GST. Section 10 is the section providing for the value of supply. Section 10(2) states: 3 Subject to this section, the value of a supply of goods and services shall be such amount as, with the addition of the tax charged, is equal to the aggregate of,- (a) To the extent that the consideration for the supply is consideration in money, the amount of the money: Section 77 states: For the purposes of this Act, all amounts of money shall be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency, and in any case where and to the extent that such amount is consideration in money for a supply, that amount shall be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency as at the time of that supply. Application of the legislation Number of supplies When a registered person sells goods and services to a customer who pays in foreign currency, there is only one supply. That supply is the supply of goods and services. A possible alternative view is that there are two supplies in these circumstances: the first supply being a supply of goods and services from the registered person to the customer, the second supply being an exempt supply (under section 3(1)(a) and section 14(a)) of the exchange of currency, also from the registered person to the customer. However, as already stated that is not the position where a sale of goods and services occurs with the customer paying in foreign currency – there is only one supply in this situation. The position is different if a customer, having already completed an exchange of foreign currency for New Zealand currency with a registered person, in a separate transaction then chooses to use that New Zealand currency to purchase goods and services from the same registered person. It will be a question of fact in each case whether there are one or two supplies. In the ordinary commercial situation there can be no reconstruction of the transaction to recharacterise two supplies as one or vice versa, nor is it appropriate to apply principles of economic equivalence to achieve similar results between one supply and two supply situations. When a registered person accepts foreign currency in payment for supplies, there is no exempt supply of the exchange of currency. To be an exchange of currency under section 3(1)(a) one currency must be exchanged for another. Section 3(1)(a) does not cover the situation when currency is exchanged for goods and services. The fact that the registered person will later exchange the currency with a bank or bureau de change does not alter this. The transaction between the bank or bureau de change and the registered person involves an exempt supply of the exchange of currency by the bank or bureau de change to the registered person. There is no such exempt supply from the registered person to the customer paying with foreign currency. 4 In situations where there is only one supply, a supply of goods and services, the value of supply is important, particularly since the registered person usually makes a profit from the low exchange rate. Value of supply When a registered person sells goods and services to a customer, the value of supply is determined using the rules in section 10. Under section 10(2)(a), when consideration for the supply is an amount of money, the value of supply is the amount of money. “Money” is defined in section 2(1) and includes foreign currency. Therefore, when a customer tenders foreign currency as consideration for a supply, the value of supply is the amount of foreign currency. However, section 77 requires all amounts of money tendered in consideration of a supply to be “expressed in terms of New Zealand currency as at the time of that supply”. “Expressed in terms of New Zealand currency” Three interpretations of the phrase “all amounts of money shall be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency” are possible. It could mean that: • The parties must state their transaction, or document it, in New Zealand currency and the supplier returns that amount for GST purposes; or • The supplier must convert foreign currency to New Zealand currency at the current market exchange rate and return that amount for GST purposes; or • The supplier may convert foreign currency to New Zealand currency at the rate agreed between the parties and returns that amount for GST purposes. The first interpretation does not require any type of conversion, whereas the second and third do. The words in section 77 are exactly equivalent to those in section 20(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Section 20(1) had been accepted as embodying the decision of the Privy Council in Payne v Deputy FCT \[1936\] 2 All ER 793 (see, for example, Dixon J in Adelaide Electric Supply Co Ltd v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 557). In the Payne decision, Lord Russell said at page 796 of the judgment: ...the assessable income of the taxpayer must, whatever be the currency in which he derives it, all be expressed in terms of Australian currency; in other words if any portion of his assessable income is derived by him in French or Belgian currency, it must before he can be properly assessed to Australian income tax be converted into its equivalent, at the time it was derived, in Australian currency. In exactly the same way, any income derived by him in British currency must be converted into its equivalent in Australian currency. In short when an Australian statute tells the taxpayer to state his derived income in order that a fraction thereof (i.e., so many pence in the pound of derived income) may be taken as tax, this can only mean that his derived income is to be stated and dealt with in terms of Australian currency. From this it would accordingly follow that the commissioner was right in including the amount of £1,097 in the appellant’s assessment. \[Emphasis added.\] 5 Lord Russell was using the words subsequently adopted in section 20(1) in the sense described above in the second interpretation. Accordingly, the second interpretation of the phrase in section 77 is to be preferred to the first and third interpretations. That is, the phrase “expressed in terms of New Zealand currency” in section 77 requires the amount of foreign currency tendered as consideration for a supply to be converted into an amount of New Zealand currency at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. The above interpretation is also consistent with the use of the same phrase by the New Zealand legislature in the now repealed section KF 2(5) (definition of “effective rate of domestic income tax”). The relevant part of the former section KF 2(5) stated: “Effective rate of domestic income tax”, in relation to a company that is not resident in New Zealand and to an accounting year of that company, means the rate ascertained in accordance with the following formula: a b where- a is the total income tax (expressed in terms of New Zealand currency at the rate of exchange in force on the last day of that accounting year) payable by that company in the country or territory in which it is resident, in respect of the total income derived by it in that accounting year, being the total income upon which the total income tax is levied; and b is that total income (expressed in terms of New Zealand currency at the rate of exchange in force on the last day of that accounting year): \[Emphasis added.\] This definition is an equivalent use of the phrase in section 77, and supports the interpretation that the phrase requires some type of conversion. As already outlined, the decision in Payne supports the interpretation of the phrase in section 77 as requiring the conversion of the foreign currency (tendered as consideration for a supply) at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. Exchange rate applying at the time of supply Section 77 requires the amount of money that is consideration for a supply to be expressed in terms of New Zealand currency “as at the time of that supply”. Section 9 determines the time at which any supply takes place. Section 9(1) states the general rule, i.e. that a supply shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued or the time any payment is received by the supplier. In the circumstances to which the Ruling applies, the time of supply is the time of payment. Accordingly, it is the exchange rate applying at the time of payment that is to be used to convert the foreign currency to $NZ for GST purposes and not an exchange rate applying at the date the registered person converts the foreign currency to $NZ. Nor is the rate of exchange actually obtained on the conversion of the foreign currency able to be used. The Commissioner will accept the exchange rates offered by a registered bank or a bureau de change. 6 In this connection the Commissioner will accept the bank exchange rates of ASB Bank, ANZ, BNZ, National Bank of New Zealand, or WestpacTrust. The Commissioner will also accept the bureau de change exchange rates of Thomas Cook or American Express. The value of supply is not the value of foreign currency tendered as consideration exchanged at the registered person’s low exchange rate. Instead, it is the value of foreign currency tendered as consideration converted at the exchange rate determined by the registered banks and bureaux de change operating in the foreign exchange markets at the time of supply (payment). Examples Example 1 Hotel Guest wishes to exchange some foreign currency for New Zealand currency. Hotel offers him a low exchange rate, which he accepts. Hotel exchanges the foreign currency at a bank and makes a small profit. The profit is consideration for an exempt supply, being the exempt supply of an exchange of currency. Hotel has exchanged New Zealand currency for foreign currency. The consideration for the supply is the difference between the exchange rate Hotel receives from the bank, and the exchange rate Hotel gave Hotel Guest. For example: Approved exchange rate: NZ$1=Foreign$3 or Foreign$1=NZ$0.33 Hotel exchange rate: NZ$1=Foreign$4 or Foreign$1=NZ$0.25 Hotel Guest exchanges Foreign$300 at Hotel exchange rate, and receives NZ$75. Hotel exchanges the Foreign$300 at the bank for the approved exchange rate and receives NZ$100. The NZ$25 profit is consideration for an exempt supply and does not have to be returned for GST purposes. Example 2 Hotel Guest checks out of Hotel and settles his bill using foreign currency. Again Hotel offers him a low exchange rate which he accepts. Hotel exchanges the money at a bank and makes a small profit. The profit on the currency exchange at the bank is part of the consideration for the taxable supply of goods and services by Hotel to Hotel Guest. The value of supply is the amount of foreign currency tendered in consideration for the supply. As the amount of money is foreign currency, it needs to be expressed in amounts of New Zealand currency. That change to New Zealand currency should take place at the approved exchange rate at the time of supply. That means the profit on the currency exchange is part of the consideration for the taxable supply Hotel makes. For example: 7 Exchange rates as above. Bill of NZ$1,000. Hotel Guest tenders Foreign$4,000 to pay the bill. Hotel accepts the Foreign$4,000 in full payment of the bill, at Hotel’s exchange rate. Hotel then exchanges the Foreign$4,000 at the bank for the approved exchange rate and receives NZ$1,333, making a profit of $333 on the currency. This profit is part of the consideration for a taxable supply and should be returned as such for GST purposes.
1 ASSOCIATED PERSONS TEST – TIMING IN RELATION TO GROSS INCOME DERIVED FROM THE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF LAND PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 00/05 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of section CD 1(2). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale or other disposition of land by a taxpayer who is associated with another person. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • For the purposes of determining whether any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of land is included in the gross income of any taxpayer by virtue of paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2), the test of whether a taxpayer and another person are associated persons is applied only at the time of the acquisition of the land. The test of association is not applied at the time of the sale or other disposition of the land. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2003. This Ruling is signed by me on the 14th day of June 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 00/05 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/05 (“the Ruling”). Background Paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2) include within the gross income of a taxpayer any amounts derived from the sale or other disposition of land if the taxpayer, or any other person associated with the taxpayer, carried on certain businesses at the time the land was acquired. For the purposes of section CD 1, associated persons or persons associated with each other are defined in section OD 8(4). Section OD 8(4) was amended by the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act (No 4) 1995 (“the amendments”). The definition was extended to ensure that discretionary beneficiaries fall within the trustee-beneficiary relationships included in the definition. During the course of the related Bill, a submission was made raising the issue of whether the changes to the definition of associated persons would have any effect in relation to land acquired before the changes were made. While the amendments came into force on 17 August 1995 (the date of the Bill’s introduction), the submission queried whether the changes would have any effect in the case of an amount derived from the sale of land acquired before that date. The amendments to the definition would only apply to land acquired before 17 August 1995 if the test of association in paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2) applies at the time the land is disposed of. If the test of association under paragraphs (b) to (d) applies at the time the land is acquired, the amended definition of associated persons would only apply in relation to land acquired after 17 August 1995. The Ruling confirms that the test of association under paragraphs (b) to (d) of section CD 1(2) applies at the time the land is acquired. The changes to the definition of associated persons will therefore only apply to land acquired on or after 17 August 1995. This question is important in general terms (i.e. not just because of the changes made to the definition of associated persons) because in many cases a taxpayer may be associated with a person at the time of acquisition of land, but may not be associated with the person at the time of the sale or disposition of the land (and vice versa). A number of commentators have expressed their view as to the timing of the test of association in section CD 1(2)(b) to (d), but there seems to be uncertainty as to the correct view. This uncertainty stems from the wording and tenses used. The Commissioner’s view is, and always has been, that the test of association is applied at the time the land was acquired. 3 Legislation Section CD 1(1) states: Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land, being an amount to which this section applies, is gross income. Section CD 1(2) sets out the amounts that are included in the gross income of any person under section CD 1(1): For the purposes of subsection (1), the gross income of any taxpayer includes the following amounts – ... (b) Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of dealing in land, and – (i) That land, which was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer, was acquired by that taxpayer for the purpose of that business of dealing in land; or (ii) That land was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within 10 years after the date on which it was acquired by the taxpayer: (c) Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of developing or dividing land into lots, being development or division of the kind (not being work of a minor nature) referred to in paragraph (f), and – (i) That land, which was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer, was acquired by that taxpayer for the purpose of that business of developing or dividing land into lots; or (ii) That land was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within 10 years after the date on which it was acquired by the taxpayer: (d) Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land, where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of erecting buildings, and the taxpayer or that other person carried out, whether before or after the acquisition of that land by the taxpayer, any improvements, not being improvements of a minor nature, to that land (whether by way of erecting a building or otherwise); and (i) That land, which was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer, was acquired for the purpose of that business of erecting buildings; or (ii) That improved land was sold or disposed of by the taxpayer within 10 years after the date on which those improvements were completed. ... \[Emphasis added\] Section OD 8(4) defines “associated persons or persons who are associated” for the purposes of section CD 1. 4 Application of Legislation Paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of section CD 1(2) all use the same phrase in bringing to tax, “Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any land where the taxpayer, or any other person where the taxpayer and that other person are associated persons, carried on, at the time the land was acquired, the business of ...”. The question is raised as to whether the use of the words “are associated persons” means that in order for the provisions to be satisfied the test of association is applied: • At the time of acquisition of the land by the taxpayer: e.g. this requires a person who carried on the business of dealing in land at the time the taxpayer acquired the land to have been associated with the taxpayer at the time the land was acquired (but that person would not necessarily be associated with the taxpayer at the time of disposition); or • At the time of disposition: e.g. this requires a person who carried on the business of dealing in land at the time the taxpayer acquired the land to be associated with the taxpayer at the time the land was disposed of (but that person would not necessarily have been associated with the taxpayer at the time of acquisition); or • At the time of acquisition and at the time of sale or other disposal: e.g. this requires a person who carried on the business of dealing in land at the time the taxpayer acquired the land to have been associated with the taxpayer at the time the land was acquired and also to be associated with the taxpayer at the time the land is disposed of. Plain words On an ordinary reading of the words of the legislation, it seems clear that the phrase “at the time the land was acquired” relates to the carrying on of the relevant business, rather than to the timing of the associated persons test. However, it is not clear as to the point in time that the words “are associated persons” are referring to. The word “are” generally indicates a present tense and, therefore, arguably indicates that the test should be applied at the most recent point in time (i.e. the time of the disposal of the land). However, another reading of the words indicates that the test should be applied at the time of acquisition. The meaning of the words without the presence of an associated person is clear: • An amount will be gross income if: • a taxpayer derives that amount from the sale or other disposition of land, • the taxpayer was carrying on the relevant business when the land was acquired, and • the land was acquired for that business or sold within 10 years of acquisition. 5 There are three elements to the section. First, an amount must be derived from the sale or disposition of land. Second, the taxpayer must have been carrying on the relevant business at the time the land was acquired. Third, the land must have been acquired for that business or sold within 10 years. Arguably the second element is the most important. The fact that the taxpayer was carrying on the relevant business at the time the land was acquired is central to the issue of the taxability of any amount derived on the sale of the land. For example, if the taxpayer were not carrying on a business of dealing in land, any amount derived would not be taxable under section CD 1(2)(b). However, if the taxpayer were carrying on such a business, any amount derived would be taxable if the land was either acquired for the business or sold within 10 years. If the land was acquired for the purpose of a relevant business, it is logical that any amount derived from the sale of the land would be taxable. This is entirely consistent with the fact that any amount derived from a business is gross income under section CD 3. However, where the land was not acquired for the purpose of such a business, any amount derived would still be taxable if the land was sold within 10 years. In this situation, it is simply the fact that the taxpayer carried on the relevant business that leads to the inclusion of the amount derived within gross income. All acquisitions of land by the taxpayer are tainted by the existence of the business, regardless of whether the land is acquired as part of that business. Now consider the effect of the section where an associated person is involved: • An amount will be gross income of a taxpayer if: • the taxpayer derives that amount from the sale or other disposition of land, • an associated person of the taxpayer was carrying on the business of dealing in land when the taxpayer acquired the land, and • the land was sold by the taxpayer within 10 years of acquisition. Again, there are three elements to the section. First, an amount must be derived from the sale or other disposition of the land. Second, an associated person of the taxpayer must have been carrying on the business of dealing in land when the taxpayer acquired the land. Third, the land must have been sold within 10 years of acquisition. In a situation where an associated person is involved, the central focus of the section is even more clearly the fact that a relevant business, such as dealing in land, must have been carried on at the time the land was acquired. As it is the associated person who was carrying on the required business at the time of acquisition, the taxpayer could not have acquired the land for the purposes of the business. In these circumstances the amount derived will only be taxable if the land is sold within 10 years. It is only the existence of the business at the time of acquisition that allows the section to include the amount derived on sale in the taxpayer’s gross income. The taxpayer is effectively tainted by the activities of the associated person at the time the land was acquired. 6 The section, therefore, is concerned with what was happening at the time the land was acquired – was an associated person of the taxpayer carrying on a business of dealing in land? It would seem that in these circumstances it is logical to argue that the associated person must have been associated with the taxpayer when the land was acquired. To separate the associated persons test from the test of the relevant business is an artificial interpretation of the section. Although the section is including in gross income amounts derived on sale, the focus of the section is on the activities of either the taxpayer or the associated person at the time the land was acquired. The time of sale or other disposition of the land is certainly important in the context of section CD 1. The time of the sale of the land is the time at which the application of the section is triggered. However, once the application of the section is triggered by the sale of the land, the focus of the section is clearly on the activities which took place at an earlier time. The mere fact of the sale of the land is insufficient to include any amount derived from that sale in a taxpayer’s gross income. The scheme and purpose of the provisions is not simply to bring to tax amounts derived on the sale of property. There must be some other relevant purpose or intention, some other relevant action on the part of the taxpayer or associated person, or some link with business activities, before any amount will be included in gross income. However, as it is not completely clear on the plain reading of the words that the test is applied at acquisition, relevant case law should be considered. The question as to the relevant time for testing association does not appear to have been directly considered by any New Zealand court. However, there is implicit support for the view that the test of association is applied at the time the land was acquired in some TRA cases. For example, in Case H92 (1986) 8 NZTC 630, the TRA considered whether the objectors were assessable on the profit made on the sale of land, A, under any of sections 65(2)(a) and 67(4)(a), (b) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1976. On concluding that the objectors were not dealers in land at the time the land was acquired, the issue was then whether an associated company, P, was dealing in land when the relevant land was purchased by the taxpayer. The TRA found that the company’s activities did not constitute the business of dealing in land at the time of purchase. Although the TRA did not specifically consider the time at which the parties needed to be associated, the judgment appeared to assume that this was at the time of acquisition. Bathgate DJ said (at page 642): The thrust of cross-examination of the objectors concerning P was to show that it was involved in erecting buildings when A was purchased by the objectors. At that time P and the objectors were associated persons for the purposes of sec 67(4)(b) and (c). \[Emphasis added\] More recently, Case T25 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,160 concerned whether a taxpayer was assessable on the proceeds of the sale of a commercial property. The question to be answered by the TRA was whether, on the date of acquisition by the objector of his interest in the commercial property, the objector carried on any business of developing or dividing land into lots or whether on that date any associated person of the objector (i.e. the CC Partnership or the R Syndicate) carried on such a business. 7 Although the timing of the test of association is not specifically referred to by Barber DJ, his Honour makes it clear that he considers the time of acquisition to be the appropriate time and he proceeds on that basis. When discussing whether the objector was a developer or subdivider as at the date of acquisition of the property, his Honour stated (at pages 8,174 – 8,175): However, as at 17 October 1978 only two relevant projects had been undertaken. One subdivisional project (of residential land) had been completed and the other was a building project so that, at that date, the objector could not be described as carrying on the business of developing or dividing into lots ‘any land’ and nor was any associated person of the objector at that time. I appreciate that the CC Partnership and the R Syndicate each commenced in 1974 and ended in late 1979; but on the crucial date, 17 October 1978, the nature of their activity did not offend s 67(4)(ba). \[Emphasis added\] Barber DJ’s statement that the CC Partnership and R Syndicate ended in 1979 impliedly gives strong support for the proposition that the time for the test of association is at acquisition. In this case the property in question was disposed of in 1988. In these circumstances, if the test of association were to be applied at the time of disposal the above comments by Barber DJ would have been irrelevant. Notwithstanding the above statements, it is clear that the issue of the timing of the test of association was not argued in Case H92 or Case T25. Case law, therefore. provides limited guidance on the interpretation of the words “are associated persons” in the context of land sales. However, case law does indicate that one should be careful in the interpretation of tenses. The use of a tense may be decisive only if it is clear what the tense used relates to. For example, in Maradana Mosque Board of Trustees v Mahmud \[1967\] 1 AC 13, the Privy Council considered a provision that empowered the Minister to make a certain order if satisfied that a school “is being administered” in contravention of the Act. Counsel for the Minister argued that it was permissible to take account of the past running of the school. The Privy Council held that only the current method of administration at the time of the order could be considered. By way of contrast, in Norman v Simpson \[1946\] 1 All ER 74 the United Kingdom Court of Appeal needed to interpret the words “have been” and concluded that the expression could be equated to “are” or “is” in the context before the Court. In that case the use of the words “have been” did not limit the Court to considering only the point in the past at which the sub-letting commenced. In relation to section CD 1(2), it can be argued that the use of the word “are” does not necessarily limit the inquiry to the present time and that it could be interpreted as operating in the past tense. The approach of the courts has been that if the use of a tense is not clear or is ambiguous, other sources such as the statutory context and the scheme and purpose of the legislation will be used as aids in determining the correct interpretation. This approach is also consistent with the Court of Appeal’s approach to statutory interpretation set out in CIR v Alcan New Zealand Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,175. 8 Section GD 9(1) The associated persons test is used in many provisions of the Revenue Acts. Generally, these provisions are unhelpful for present purposes as it is obvious in most cases that the associated persons test relates to only one point in time. However, section GD 9(1) is relevant here because it is closely related to the provisions currently being considered. Section GD 9(1) deals with the situation where a person transfers land to an associated person some time after acquisition. Section GD 9(1) is in the nature of an anti-avoidance provision, and applies where land is transferred from a “transferor” to a “transferee” and the transferor and the transferee “are associated persons”. If the transferee later sells or otherwise disposes of the land, any amount derived from the transaction is gross income of the transferee if that amount would have been gross income of the transferor under section CD 1(2). Section GD 9(1) states: Where – (a) Any land has been transferred from any person (the “transferor”) to any person (the “transferee”); and (b) The transferor and the transferee are associated persons; and (c) The transferee subsequently sells or otherwise disposes of that land and the consideration from that sale or disposition exceeds the cost of the land to the transferee; and (d) If, had the transferor not transferred the land to the transferee but instead had sold or otherwise disposed of the land for the consideration referred to in paragraph (c), that consideration would have been gross income of the transferor under section CD 1 – that consideration shall be deemed to be gross income of the transferee under section CD 1. Thus, section GD 9(1), like section CD 1(2), also uses the phrase “are associated persons” in a context where its meaning could be ambiguous. The section is concerned with the situation of a property being disposed of at a profit or gain, i.e. something that happens in the present and triggers the application of the section. However, the section also refers to the earlier transfer from the transferor to the transferee who “are associated persons”. In section GD 9(1), the words “are associated persons” clearly relate back to the earlier time of the transfer from the transferor to the transferee, rather than the present time of the disposal of the land. The words “are associated persons” are followed by “and the transferee subsequently sells or otherwise disposes of that land”. The use of the word “subsequently” denies any connection to the event of disposal to the words “are associated persons”. The section, therefore, is an example of words in a present tense being used to relate to a past event. Section GD 9(1) clearly supports the conclusion that “are associated persons” does not necessarily mean associated at the most recent point in time, i.e. the time of disposal, but can be interpreted as “were associated persons”. In the case of section GD 9(1), this means looking back to the time of acquisition by the relevant taxpayer, i.e. the transferee. Legislative purpose 9 The use of the associated persons test in section CD 1(2) is essentially for anti- avoidance reasons and aims to stop the use of associated persons who are not carrying on any relevant business. This was referred to in the Parliamentary Debates in 1973 on the Land and Income Tax (Annual) Bill (which contained the predecessor provisions to section CD 1). Mr Munroe (MP, Invercargill) explained the difficulties in applying the then current law on the taxation of profits relating to land and the need for amendment, and stated (NZPD Vol. 386, 1973: 3653): There is a provision in the \[Land and Income Tax\] Act which makes dealing in real or personal property for profit or gain assessable for tax. The Inland Revenue Department has had difficulty with this provision because of interpretations of it by the courts. The courts have tended to take the view before they will uphold an assessment, that as there is no capital gains tax in New Zealand there must be a clear pattern of previous dealings, or the circumstances must be such as to leave an inference that a profit motive was present at the time of purchase. In cases where the taxpayers have been land dealers or builders they have been able to avoid assessment of profits on property deals by claiming quite successfully that the property was held as an investment even if the sale was made shortly after acquisition. In other cases the land dealers or builders have held properties in the names of members of their families or in associate companies for the purpose of avoiding tax on the sale of the properties. \[Emphasis added\] If the intention were to prevent dealers in land using associates (who are not dealers) to acquire the land, one would expect that the relevant association would need to be examined at the time of acquisition. The intention behind the provisions of section CD 1(2) would seem to be to make it more difficult for a person who is carrying on one of the specified businesses to hide behind associated persons. If the test of association applies only at the time of disposal, this would mean that associated person purchasers of land who are “substituted” for land dealers could avoid being taxed where the association was technically terminated immediately before the disposal of the land. Furthermore, if the association test applies only at the time of disposal, it would apply to persons who happen (by way of “accident” or otherwise) to become associated with, for example, a land dealer just prior to their disposing of property where no taxable purpose or connection previously existed. In addition, the anti-avoidance policy would tend to suggest that the possible interpretation of applying the association test at both acquisition and disposal is also incorrect. As such an interpretation would also require the test to be applied at disposal, the concerns expressed above would be equally applicable to that interpretation. Conclusion In paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of section CD 1(2), on an ordinary reading of the words “are associated persons”, the time at which the test of association must be applied is ambiguous. However, the scheme and purpose of the provisions indicate that the correct interpretation is that the test of association is applied at the time the land is acquired by a taxpayer. The Commissioner considers this to be the better view of the law. The test is not applied at the time of sale or other disposition of the land, nor 10 must it be applied at both the time of acquisition and at the time of sale or other disposition.
1 ADVERTISING SPACE AND ADVERTISING TIME SUPPLIED TO NON- RESIDENTS – GST TREATMENT PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 00/06 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 96/10, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 8 (November 1996), but its period of application is from 1 December 1999 to 30 November 2004. Some formatting changes have also been made. BR Pub 96/10 applied up until 30 November 1999. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section 11(2)(e). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the contractual supply of advertising space in a publication, or the supply of advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service), by a GST registered person for and to a non-resident person who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. For the purposes of this Ruling the supply of advertising space or advertising time means the service of communicating an advertising message, and includes all steps involved in providing this service by the supplier of the advertising space or time. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The contractually supplied service of providing advertising space in a publication or advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service), for and to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the service is performed, is not supplied “directly in connection with” any land (or improvement thereto) or moveable personal property situated in New Zealand. Section 11(2)(e) will apply to zero-rate the supply of services, provided that all the other requirements of section 11(2)(e) are satisfied. 2 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 December 1999 to 30 November 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 17th day of July 2000. John Mora Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 00/06 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/06 (“this Ruling”). The subject matter covered in this Ruling was previously dealt with by BR Pub 96/10 that appeared in TIB Vol 8, No 8 (November 1996), at page 13. This Ruling applies for the period from 1 December 1999 to 30 November 2004. Background In July 1994, the High Court delivered its judgment in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221. The case dealt with the circumstances in which a newspaper publisher should account for GST on the services of placing advertisements for non- resident clients. The High Court held that: • To qualify for zero-rating under section 11(2)(e), services must be provided “contractually to” and “beneficially for” a non-resident person. If a New Zealand resident receives the benefit of the advertising services, the services are not zero- rated; and • The provision of advertising space and related services is not supplied directly in connection with the subject matter of the advertisements. Wilson & Horton appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal (Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325). The Court of Appeal held in favour of the taxpayer, and concluded that the supply of advertising space in New Zealand by Wilson & Horton to non-resident clients is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e), irrespective of whether a New Zealand resident also benefits from the supply. The Commissioner did not appeal this decision. Legislation Section 11(2)(e) zero-rates a supply of services when: The services are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are supplied directly in connection with - (i) Land or any improvement thereto situated inside New Zealand; or (ii) Moveable personal property (other than choses in action, and other than goods to which paragraph (ca) of this subsection applies) situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed; - Sections 11(2A) and 11(2B) deal with services that are supplied to non-residents but are received by persons in New Zealand. The sections state: 4 (2A) Subsection (2)(e) does not apply to a supply of services under an agreement that is entered into, whether directly or indirectly, with a person (person A) who is not resident in New Zealand if- (a) The performance of the services is, or it is reasonably foreseeable at the time the agreement is entered into that the performance of the services will be, received in New Zealand by another person (person B), including- (i) An employee of person A; or (ii) If person A is a company, a director of the company; and (b) It is reasonably foreseeable, at the time the agreement is entered into, that person B will not receive the performance of the services in the course of making taxable or exempt supplies. (2B) For the purpose of subsection (2)(e) and (2fa), ‘outside New Zealand’, for a company or an unincorporated body that is not resident, includes a minor presence in New Zealand, or a presence that is not effectively connected with the supply. Section 60 sets out the GST agency provisions. Section 60(2) states: Subject to this section, for the purposes of this Act, where any registered person makes a taxable supply of goods and services to an agent who is acting on behalf of another person who is the principal for the purposes of that supply, that supply shall be deemed to be made to that principal and not to that agent:... Court of Appeal decision The Court of Appeal held that the supply of the publication of advertisements by Wilson & Horton to non-resident clients qualified for zero-rating under section 11(2)(e), irrespective of whether a New Zealand resident obtains a benefit from the supply. “For and to” The Court of Appeal rejected the High Court’s interpretation of “for” in section 11(2)(e), as meaning “beneficially for”. The Court of Appeal questioned whether this “benefit” test was workable. The Court noted that many parties may potentially benefit from an advertisement placed by a non-resident, and that it was unlikely that the legislature would have intended a wide group of possible beneficiaries of a service to determine the GST treatment of the service. In discussing the “for and to” wording in section 11(2)(e), the Court of Appeal examined the possible meanings of “for” that may have been intended by the legislature, and rejected the Commissioner’s interpretation of “for” as meaning “beneficially for”. The Court concluded that “for” in section 11(2)(e) was used for emphasis only. Justice Richardson noted that legislative drafters often convey emphasis through the use of a combination of words and said that (at 12,330): I am inclined to think that the framers of s11(2)(e) employed both expressions to convey emphasis and perhaps to bring out the intent that the contract must be genuine and so the services must be supplied under that contract to and for the other contracting party. As a matter of statutory interpretation, the Court said that section 11(2)(e) would have been worded quite differently if the intent had been to preclude zero-rating, unless a 5 non-resident recipient of a supply was the only person who could benefit from the services supplied. Justice Penlington considered that this result was consistent with one of the underlying themes of zero-rating - the preservation of New Zealand’s competitiveness in world trade. It was also recognised that if advertised merchandise is sold in New Zealand, GST will be imposed on the sale at that time. “Directly in connection with” The Court of Appeal did not discuss whether the supply was made directly in connection with land or moveable personal property in New Zealand for the purposes of section 11(2)(e). The High Court had accepted that the supply of advertising space in a newspaper was not “directly in connection with” the subject matter of the advertising. During the Court of Appeal hearing, the potential argument that the services are supplied directly in connection with the newspapers themselves was also raised. However, the Court of Appeal did not allow the Commissioner to introduce this new line of reasoning, as it would have changed the basis upon which the assessment was made and objected to. The publishing industry has asked the Commissioner to clarify the application of the “directly in connection with” exclusion in section 11(2)(e) in this context. Application of the Legislation The key features of section 11(2)(e) are the phrases “for and to” and “directly in connection with”. “For and to” The Commissioner accepts the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of “for and to” in Wilson & Horton for the purposes of section 11(2)(e). In this context, “for and to” is a composite phrase. “For” simply emphasises “to” and does not connote any requirement that services must be provided for the exclusive benefit of the recipient of the supply. If services are supplied pursuant to a contract with a non-resident and are for that non-resident, section 11(2)(e) will apply to zero-rate the supply regardless of any other benefits also arising to a New Zealand resident (provided that the other requirements of the section are satisfied). The Court of Appeal’s interpretation of “for and to” is not restricted to the supply of advertising space in a newspaper. It also applies to the supply of advertising space in all forms of publication and to the supply of advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service). This Ruling discusses the application of section 11(2)(e) to the supply of advertising space in publications, such as newspapers and magazines. The Ruling also covers the supply of advertising time on radio and television, or by way of any other 6 broadcasting service, e.g. the internet. For the purposes of the Ruling, the supply of advertising space or advertising time means the service of communicating an advertising message, and includes all steps involved in providing this service by the supplier of the advertising space or time. “Directly in connection with” A supply of services to a non-resident will not be zero-rated under section 11(2)(e) if the services are supplied “directly in connection with” any land (or improvement to the land) or moveable personal property (other than choses in action and goods which are referred to in section 11(2)(ca)) situated in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. The Court of Appeal in Wilson & Horton did not discuss the meaning of “directly in connection with” in section 11(2)(e), nor resolve whether advertising space is supplied directly in connection with the newspapers in which advertisements are placed. Case law The determination of whether or not services are supplied “directly in connection with” land or moveable personal property depends on the circumstances in which the services are supplied. In Case E84 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,441, Bathgate DJ considered the meaning of the phrase “in connection with” (it is to be noted that the word “directly” was not used) in the context of section 165 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (section DJ 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994) and noted (at 59,444 and 59,446): It may be that only an empirical and common sense approach to the interpretation of the words can be applied in each particular case to determine where, if at all, the line should be drawn to allow or not allow expenditure ‘in connection with’ an assessment. However I believe that a narrow interpretation of the words ‘... any expenditure ... in connection with ... the assessment ...’ is the correct interpretation ... ... It is a matter of degree whether, on the interpretation of a particular statute, there is a sufficient relationship between subject and object to come within the words “in connection with” or not. It is clear that no hard and fast rule can be or should be applied to the interpretation of the words “in connection with”. Each case depends on its own facts and the particular statute under consideration. In the context of GST, the meaning of “directly in connection with” for the purposes of section 11(2)(a), prior to its amendment in 1988, has been judicially considered by the High Court in Auckland Regional Authority v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,080 and the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) in Case P78 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,532. Before amendment, section 11(2)(a) provided for zero-rating of services supplied “directly in connection with” transportation. The High Court and TRA cases concerned the application of section 11(2)(a) to various charges (landing dues, international terminal charges, and rubbish disposal charges) levied on overseas airlines. The High Court and the TRA adopted similar interpretations of the words “directly in connection with” under section 11(2)(a). The Auckland Regional Authority case summarises the reasoning of the TRA in Case P78 (at 11,084): 7 There, the Taxation Review Authority, Judge Barber, held that “airport dues” were zero-rated for GST because passengers cannot realistically be transported to New Zealand by air unless a plane lands and parks on the tarmac; that charges for those services can be regarded as provided for international passengers who are in a sense “outside New Zealand” until they pass through customs. The services are fundamental to and directly connected with the transportation of passengers; The High Court and the TRA focus on whether a supply of services is fundamental or integral to transportation to determine whether the “directly in connection with” test in section 11(2)(a) is satisfied. This reasoning is not strictly relevant for the purposes of interpreting “directly in connection with” in section 11(2)(e). This is because the focus of section 11(2)(a) was on services directly connected with transportation services, and the identification of a direct connection between a service and another service, and a service and an item of property, involves different considerations. However, the TRA has recently applied the proviso to section 11(2)(e) and considered the words “directly in connection with” in Case S88 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,551. The objector in Case S88 purchased motor vehicles from its non-resident parent company and then sold the vehicles to independent dealers, who on-sold them to the public. The parent company provided a contractual warranty to the objector. The objector agreed with the dealers that if a vehicle was repaired under warranty the objector would reimburse the dealer. The objector would then register a claim with the parent company under the warranty and receive payment pursuant to that claim. The TRA was required to consider whether the repair services provided by the objector pursuant to its contract with the non-resident parent were zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). The TRA concluded that section 11(2)(e) could not apply to zero- rate this supply as the services were supplied “directly in connection with” moveable personal property (the vehicles) situated in New Zealand at the time the services were provided. Although, the TRA did not examine the meaning of “directly in connection with” in great detail, it did state (at 7,558): The moveable personal property in question is the repaired vehicle. There is a direct relationship or connection between the service of the repairs and the vehicle. Accordingly, the said “proviso” to s 11(2)(e) must apply to the facts of this case and prevent the objectors from relying on the zero-rating provisions of s 11(2)(e). The repair service could not be performed but for the existence of the vehicle. \[Please note that Case S88 is currently under appeal by the taxpayer.\] The High Court in Malololailai Interval Holidays New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,137 also considered the words “directly in connection with” in the context of section 11(2)(b). In Case T54 (1998) 18 NZTC 8,410, the TRA considered whether the supply of video services for Japanese honeymoon couples to a Japanese company was zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). The decisions in both of these cases are consistent with the cases mentioned above. 8 Therefore, the case law discussing “in connection with” and “directly in connection with” indicates that the interpretation of the test will be dictated by the particular context involved. The Commissioner considers that the “directly in connection with” proviso in section 11(2)(e) should be interpreted narrowly (Judge Bathgate’s words from Case E84 quoted above support this), and that there must be a clear and direct relationship with moveable personal property or land in New Zealand before a supply will be standard-rated. This is consistent with the approach of the TRA in Case S88 in identifying on the facts of that particular case a “direct relationship or connection” between the repair services and the vehicles under repair. Advertising space and advertising time The supply of advertising space in a publication is the supply of the service of communicating an advertising message, involving all the steps required to achieve communication of the advertisement. This service is not supplied directly in connection with the subject matter of the advertisement. In the words of the High Court in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 (at 11,224): The supply of space and services rendered by Wilson & Horton are directly connected with the advertising but not with the goods advertised. The goods are, as it were, at least one step removed from the services supplied by the newspaper proprietor. The Commissioner agrees with this view. There is no direct relationship or connection between the provision of advertising space and the subject matter of the advertisement. The same reasoning also applies to the supply of advertising space in all types of publication as well as advertising time on radio or television (or other broadcasting service). The supply of advertising space or time in these media cannot be described as “directly in connection with” the advertised commodity. Similarly, when advertising space is supplied in a publication, the services are not supplied directly in connection with the publication in which the advertisements are published. The High Court judgment in Wilson & Horton concluded that the provision of advertising space was supplied directly in connection with (if anything) the advertising itself. The advertised goods were considered to be at least one step removed from the services. The Commissioner considers the same logic applies in respect of a newspaper or other publication. The service of communicating an advertising message is directly connected with that message and not the publication. The publication is at least one step removed from the service and is merely the medium in which the advertising message is publicised. Accordingly, the service is not supplied directly in connection with the publication produced by the publishers. Consequently, the supply of advertising space in either a publication or by way of broadcast will be treated in the same way for GST purposes. The supply will qualify for zero-rating, provided that the services are supplied for and to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Supplies through agents 9 The application of section 60(2) may also need to be considered to determine whether a supply is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). Section 60(2) deems a taxable supply of goods and services made by a registered person to an agent who is acting on behalf of a principal to be a supply made to the principal. Therefore, if a supply of advertising space or time is made to a New Zealand resident person who is acting as an agent for a non-resident principal, section 60(2) deems the supply to be made to the non-resident principal and not the resident agent. Section 11(2)(e) will apply to zero-rate the supply of services, provided that all the other requirements of section 11(2)(e) are satisfied. A common example of this is where a resident advertising agency acts as an agent for a non-resident person in purchasing advertising space or time in New Zealand. Conversely, if a supply is made to a non-resident person who is acting as an agent for a New Zealand resident in relation to the supply, section 11(2)(e) will not apply to zero-rate the supply even if the criteria in section 11(2)(e) are otherwise satisfied. The supply will be deemed to be made to the resident principal and it will not be for and to a non-resident person. Section 11(2A) Section 11(2A) was introduced to deal with situations where services are provided to non-residents and persons in New Zealand receive the performance of these services. An example is where New Zealand educational institutions contract with non- residents to provide education for the non-resident’s children in New Zealand. The section operates to ensure supplies of this type are standard rated for GST purposes. Section 11(2A) will not affect the provision of advertising services to non-residents in the circumstances covered by the arrangement described in this Ruling. The performance of these services is not received in New Zealand by other persons. Examples For the purposes of these examples, it is assumed that: • A person referred to as a resident is a “resident” as defined in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The converse applies to non-residents; and • If the services are supplied to a non-resident, the non-resident is outside New Zealand at the time of performance of the services. Example 1 A UK resident manufacturing company contacts a New Zealand magazine publisher and books advertising space for a newly developed product. The UK company has a GST registered subsidiary in New Zealand that sells the advertised product. 10 The supply of advertising space by the magazine publisher to the UK manufacturer is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). This is because: • The publisher supplies the services contractually for and to a non-resident. The fact that the New Zealand resident subsidiary potentially may benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. • The services are not supplied directly in connection with either the products for sale in New Zealand or the magazines in which the advertisements are shown. Example 2 A US resident distributor of soft drinks contracts for the supply of radio time on a national radio station in New Zealand. The soft drinks are available from all chains of supermarkets throughout New Zealand. The supply of radio time by the New Zealand radio station to the US distributor is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e). This is because: • The radio station supplies its services contractually for and to a non-resident. The fact that New Zealand resident retailers throughout New Zealand may potentially benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. • The services are not supplied directly in connection with the products for sale in New Zealand. Example 3 An Australian computer distributor plans to advertise its product range in New Zealand. The computers will be available through all major computer distributors in New Zealand. The Australian company contacts a New Zealand resident advertising agency to arrange an advertising campaign. The agency, acting in the capacity as agent for the Australian company, purchases air time on a New Zealand resident television channel. The supply of air time by the television station to the Australian company is zero- rated under section 11(2)(e). This is because: • The television channel supplies the air time services contractually for and to a non-resident. Section 60(2) deems the supply to be made to the Australian company, as principal. The New Zealand resident advertising agency receives the supply as agent only. • The fact that New Zealand resident distributors may potentially benefit from the supply through increased sales does not preclude zero-rating. The services are not supplied directly in connection with the products for sale in New Zealand.
1 DEBT FACTORING ARRANGEMENTS AND GST PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 00/07 This is a Public Ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 8(1), 20(3), and 26(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale, by a GST registered person (the “Assignor”) on an invoice basis, to a third party (“the Factor”), on a recourse or non-recourse basis, of an outstanding debt at a price less than the debt’s face value. Debt factoring on a non-recourse basis means that the Factor has no claim back to the Assignor if the debts sold to him or her become doubtful or uncollectable (that is, the Factor assumes all of the risk). In contrast, debt factoring on a recourse basis means that the Factor has some form of claim back to the Assignor if the debts sold to him or her prove to be doubtful or uncollectable, for example under a put option at the transfer price. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The difference between the face value of the debt and the price received from the Factor is not a bad debt for the purposes of section 26. Accordingly, section 26 has no application and the registered person cannot claim an output tax deduction under section 20(3)(a)(iii); and • If a portion of a debt is written-off before it is sold to the Factor, then whether this write-off meets the requirements of section 26(1) depends on whether the amount written off was “bad” according to the conventional tests (outlined in public ruling BR Pub 00/03, entitled “Bad debts – writing off debts as bad for GST and income tax purposes”). 2 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to taxable periods commencing on or after 1 August 2000 to 31 July 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 19th day of July 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 00/07 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/07 (“the Ruling”). Background Section 26 and section 20(3)(a)(iii) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the Act”) allow a registered person to make a deduction from output tax if the registered person has made a taxable supply, returned output tax in respect of that taxable supply, and subsequently written off as a bad debt all or part of the debt. If a registered person factors (i.e. sells) a debt owing for less than its face value to a third party (“the Factor”), the issue arises whether the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor can be an amount written off as a bad debt. This issue was previously dealt with in PIB No 164 (August 1987) at page 27 under the heading “GST and debt collection agencies – debt factoring” and in Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4 under an identical heading. Those statements concluded that if a registered person accounting for GST on an invoice basis subsequently sold a debt for less than its face value, the Commissioner would allow the registered person a bad debt deduction under section 26 for the difference between the debt’s face value and the sale proceeds. The inference being that the difference between the two amounts was a bad debt. Barber DJ in Case T27 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,188 reached a different conclusion from that set out in PIB No 164 and Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4. In particular, the Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) concluded that if a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor is not a bad debt. The Ruling confirms that the Commissioner accepts the view of Barber DJ in Case T27. In particular, it is now the Commissioner’s view that if a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor is not a bad debt. Accordingly, section 26 has no application, and a registered person cannot claim a deduction from output tax under section 20(3)(a)(iii). The Ruling changes and supersedes the earlier policy set out in PIB No 164 and Technical Rulings paragraph 104.9.4. This issue only arises in respect of taxpayers registered for GST on an invoice basis, because taxpayers registered for GST on a payments basis are only required to return, as output tax, any payment received. However, it is noted that the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill includes an amendment to section 26 which, if enacted, will establish parity between the two GST accounting bases. Under the amendment, a registered person who sells a debt to a third party must pay tax on 4 the remaining book value of the debt on the date that the debt is sold if the registered person accounts for tax payable on a payments basis. Legislation Section 8(1) states: Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. Section 9(1) states: Subject to this Act, for the purposes of this Act a supply of goods and services shall be deemed to take place at the earlier of the time an invoice is issued by the supplier or the recipient or the time any payment is received by the supplier, in respect of that supply. Section 20 states: (1) In respect of each taxable period every registered person shall calculate the amount of tax payable by that registered person in accordance with the provisions of this section. ... (3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period- (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax- (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services (not being a supply of secondhand goods to which paragraph (c) of the definition of the term “input tax” in section 2(1) of this Act applies), made to that registered person during that taxable period: (ia) In relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which paragraph (c) of the definition of the term “input tax” in section 2(1) of this Act applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: (ii) Invoiced or paid, whichever is the earlier, pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: (iii) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) or section 26 of this Act; and (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax- (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: (ii) Paid pursuant to section 12 of this Act during that taxable period: 5 (iii) In relation to the supply of goods and services made during that taxable period to that registered person, not being a supply of goods and services to which subparagraph (i) of this paragraph applies: (iv) Calculated in accordance with section 25(2)(b) or section 25(5) of this Act, to the extent that a payment has been made in respect of that amount, or section 26 of this Act; ... The provision relating to bad debts is in section 26, which states: (1) Where a registered person- (a) Has made a taxable supply for consideration in money; and (b) Has furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable and has properly accounted for the output tax on that supply as required under this Act; and (c) Has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person,- that registered person shall make a deduction under section 20(3) of this Act of that portion of the amount of tax charged in relation to that supply as the amount written off as a bad debt bears to the total consideration for the supply: ... Section 3(1) defines “financial services” as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term “financial services” means any one or more of the following activities: (a) The exchange of currency (whether effected by the exchange of bank notes or coin, by crediting or debiting accounts, or otherwise): (b) The issue, payment, collection, or transfer of ownership of a cheque or letter of credit: (c) The issue, allotment, drawing, acceptance, endorsement, or transfer of ownership of a debt security: (d) The issue, allotment, or transfer of ownership of an equity security or a participatory security: (e) Underwriting or sub-underwriting the issue of an equity security, debt security, or participatory security: (f) The provision of credit under a credit contract: (g) The renewal or variation of a debt security, equity security, participatory security, or credit contract: (h) The provision, taking, variation, or release of a guarantee, indemnity, security, or bond in respect of the performance of obligations under a cheque, credit contract, equity security, debt security, or participatory security, or in respect of the activities specified in paragraphs (b) to (g) of this subsection: (i) The provision, or transfer of ownership, of a life insurance contract or the provision of re-insurance in respect of any such contract: (j) The provision, or transfer of ownership, of an interest in a superannuation scheme, or the management of a superannuation scheme: 6 (k) The provision or assignment of a futures contract through a futures exchange: (ka) The payment or collection of any amount of interest, principal, dividend, or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract: (l) Agreeing to do, or arranging, any of the activities specified in paragraphs (a) to (ka) of this subsection, other than advising thereon. Application of the Legislation Under section 26, a registered person can make a deduction under section 20(3)(a)(iii) if that person has: • made a taxable supply for consideration; and • furnished a return in relation to the taxable period during which the output tax on the supply was attributable and has properly accounted for the output tax on that supply as required under the Act; and • written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person. The amount that may be deducted is the amount of GST charged as the amount written off bears to the total consideration for the supply. If the supply is the supply of goods under a hire purchase agreement, the first proviso to section 26 limits the deduction to the portion of the amount written off as the cash price bears to the total amount payable under the hire purchase agreement. Further, section 26 does not apply to a registered person accounting on a payments basis under section 19 or 19A, unless either section 9(2)(b) (door to door sales) or section 9(3)(b) (hire purchase agreements) applies to the supply. Section 26 only applies when the registered person has already accounted for GST on a supply and subsequently “Has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person”. If a registered person factors a debt owing for less than its face value, the issue arises whether the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor can be an amount “written off as a bad debt”. The Commissioner believes that the difference between the face value of the debt and the amount received from the Factor cannot be an amount written off as a bad debt under section 26. Rather than being a bad debt, the discount from face value is simply a result of the process of agreeing the consideration for the debts that is acceptable to both the Assignor and the Factor. The reasons for this view are: 1. Cases considering the meaning of bad debt focus on whether the creditor can recover the outstanding amounts owing. That is, a bad debt arises when the 7 creditor is unable or unlikely to recover the debt owing. If the creditor could recover the full amount owing but chooses not to (as in a debt factoring situation), any “loss” suffered by the creditor is not due to a bad debt. 2. Cases also indicate that for an amount to be written off as a bad debt, a debt must exist at the time the debt is written off. If a registered person factors a debt, no further debt exists between the registered person and debtor, and no amount can be written off as a bad debt. In considering the second of these factors, with regard to recourse debt factoring arrangements (where the Factor has some form of claim back to the Assignor if he or she is unable to collect some of the debts purchased), it is the Commissioner’s view that when a debt is sold by the Assignor on a recourse basis, the title to the debt passes to the Factor unless the Factor exercises a recourse option or right. Therefore, until the recourse is exercised and the debt is transferred back, a bad debt deduction is not available under section 26(1), as after the sale there is no debt owed to the Assignor. However, if the Factor exercises an option or right to transfer some portion of the debt back to the Assignor after the sale then, once this has occurred, a debt exists that is owed to the Assignor that may be able to be written off by the Assignor. Whether it can be written off depends on the application of the ordinary tests for determining whether a debt is bad as noted below, under the heading “Whether the creditor can recover the amount owing”. Whether the creditor can recover the amount owing The term “bad debt” is not defined in the Act. However, in Budget Rent A Car Ltd v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,263 Tompkins J discussed the meaning of bad debt in the context of the Income Tax Act. He stated at page 12,269: When did the debt become bad? The term “bad debt” is not defined in the Act. It, therefore, should be given its normal commercial meaning. It is a question of fact to be determined objectively. A debt becomes a bad debt when a reasonably prudent commercial person would conclude that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid in whole or in part by the debtor or by someone else either on behalf of the debtor or otherwise. Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541 also discusses the meaning of bad debt. In that case the taxpayer was a private limited liability company carrying on the business as a timber merchant. Following the receipt of a letter from one of the company’s debtors, the managing director realised that there was no likelihood of recovery of a debt owing and that the debt should be written off. The taxpayer physically wrote the appropriate entries into the journal and books of the company in May 1988 to write off the debt as at 31 March 1988. The taxpayer claimed a bad debt deduction for the income year ending 31 March 1988, but this was disallowed by the TRA on the basis that the relevant journal entries had not been made by 31 March 1988. The TRA (Barber DJ) discussed the meaning of bad debt and at page 3,548 stated: Naturally, the debts in question must be “bad” to be written off as bad in terms of sec 106(1)(b). This is a question of fact. Generally, an application of that criterion will not be difficult as the debtor will be 8 insolvent. However, the debtor does not need to be insolvent for the debt to be bad. It is only necessary that there be a bona fide assessment that the debtor is unlikely to make payment of the debt. If there is a clear understanding or arrangement that there be long term credit, and if the taxpayer believes that the terms of the credit will be met, then the debt cannot be treated as bad because it is merely a situation of deferred payment. In my view, as well as the need for the writing off to be made bona fide, the circumstances must indicate to a reasonable and prudent business person, that, on the balance of probability, the debt is unlikely to be recovered. This is an objective test. As is evident from the quotations above, different wording is used by the High Court in Budget Rent A Car and the TRA in Case N69 to describe the test of when a debt can be written off as bad. To summarise these differences, in Budget Rent A Car the words used were “no reasonable likelihood” that the debt (or part of the debt) would be recovered, whereas in Case N69 the words used were that “on the balance of probability, the debt is unlikely to be repaid”. The wording used in Case N69 may appear to include two standards into the test. That is, that the debt will not be repaid “on the balance of probabilities” and that the debt is “unlikely” to be repaid. These standards are potentially conflicting as the first of them provides a lower standard than the second. However, the Commissioner considers that the test provided by Barber DJ in Case N69 requires that for a debt to be written off as bad it must be unlikely to be repaid. This is clear from his Honour’s statement at page 3,548 of the judgment: Even if the executives had come to a formal business decision or assessment by 31 March 1988 that the debts were unlikely to be recovered and therefore should be written off as bad debts... \[Emphasis added\] Furthermore, the Commissioner considers that the words “no reasonable likelihood” and “unlikely” have the same meaning. Therefore, on this basis the Commissioner regards the decisions in Budget Rent A Car and Case N69 as applying the same test, and both cases as authority for the conclusion that a reasonably prudent commercial person must determine that there is no reasonable likelihood of recovering a debt before it can be written off as bad. The Commissioner prefers the wording used in Budget Rent A Car as this is the higher authority and this wording is supported by the way in which the High Court applied the test in Graham v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1995) 17 NZTC 12,107. Also adopting this wording removes the risk of misinterpreting the wording of the test in Case N69 as meaning that a debt can be written off as bad if, on the balance of probabilities, it will not be repaid. The emphasis of the discussion above is on the inability of the debtor to pay due to the debtor’s financial position. To reiterate, in order for a debt to be bad, the creditor must have sufficient information to enable a reasonably prudent business person to form the view that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. Case T27 specifically considered the issue in respect of section 26 and debt factoring arrangements. 9 In Case T27 the taxpayer sought a bad debt deduction for the difference between the amount invoiced and amount received from a debt factor, on the basis that the difference was a bad debt. The TRA determined that the debt was not a bad debt, but in actual fact a “good debt”. At page 8,192 the TRA stated: A pivotal submission for the objector is that the discounts it allows the franchiser are bad debts which it may write off as such and, hence, claim an input tax refund for GST purposes under s 26(1) and s 20(3) of the Act. It is also pivotal to the objector’s case that it has been factoring the hireage debts to its franchiser and that such process has constituted the writing off of bad debts regarding the discount. It seems to me that the provision of such a discount could not possibly constitute the incurring of a bad debt by the objector. The essence of the arrangement between the objector and the franchiser is that the hireage debt from the customer is a good debt, but that the objector prefers early payment of that debt and to avoid the administration process and normal risks of its recovery. Moreover, at page 8,194 the TRA reaffirmed its view that such a debt could not be bad. The TRA stated: There were submissions by counsel as to whether a bad debt exists for the purposes of s 26(1) including references to case law. Counsel particularly referred to my decision in Case N69 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,541 where I considered the wording of s 106(1)(b)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 1976 relating to the deductibility of bad debts for income tax purposes. There, I emphasised that a bad debt deduction was only available if the debt was in fact “bad” and had been actually written off. The present case is not a situation where there could be any sensible assessment that the debts (assigned by the objector to the franchiser) were, in any particular sense, bad or uncollectable or unlikely to be paid. Accordingly, the provisions of s 26(1)(c) of the Act are irrelevant to the issues before me. I appreciate that, in terms of my views in Case N69, the objector in the present case had made appropriate journal entries to write off the discounts as bad debts and had, no doubt, done so in good faith, but that was a quite erroneous procedure because, on any objective test, the debts were not bad. Consistent with Budget Rent A Car and Case N69, the TRA appears to take the view that where a creditor chooses to sell a perfectly collectable debt for below its face value, no bad debt can arise. In no way can such a debt be regarded as bad or uncollectable or unlikely to be paid. Accordingly, any difference between the face value of the debt and amount actually received is due to factors other than the debt being a bad debt. In summary, when assessing whether a bad debt exists, the cases indicate that a debt is bad when a reasonably prudent business person would have concluded, based on the information available about the debtor’s ability to repay the debt, that there is no reasonable likelihood that the debt will be paid. In the absence of such a circumstance, if a registered person chooses to sell a debt for below its face value, no bad debt exists and no deduction is available under section 20(3)(a)(iii). Finally in this regard, in response to submissions received on the first draft of the Ruling, it is useful to clarify that in the Commissioner’s view when a portion of debt is written-off on the basis of experience of the collectability of similar types of debts, without investigating the likelihood of each debtor repaying the debt, the requirements of section 26(1) have not been met. This is because case law establishes that, to write-off a debt as bad under section 26(1), reasonable steps must be taken to determine whether that particular debt owed by that particular debtor is likely to be 10 paid (Case P53 (1992) 14 NZTC 4370 and Budget Rent A Car v C of IR (1995) 17 NZTC 12263). Writing-off a portion of debt on this basis involves seeking a deduction for the provision for doubtful debts. As noted in BR Pub 00/03, the GST Act does not allow a deduction for the provision for doubtful debts. Must a debt be in existence at the time it is written off? Case law also indicates that before an amount can be written off as a bad debt, a bad debt must be in existence at the time the amount is written off. In Budget Rent A Car the taxpayer company carried on business in New Zealand as a motor vehicle rental company. A sum of money ($2,767,695.48) was owed to it by an Australian company (BRACS). In May 1989, BRACS developed financial problems and was purchased by a consortium. In July 1990, Budget Rent A Car (“Budget”) entered a deed of covenant with BRACS and covenanted that it would not bring any proceedings against or prove in the liquidation of BRACS for any claim Budget might have. The debt, however, remained outstanding. In November 1990, Budget’s directors wrote off the debt owing by BRACS and claimed a bad debt deduction for the amount. The Commissioner argued that there was no bad debt and no bad debt deduction was allowed. In particular, the Commissioner argued that for there to be a bad debt, there must at the time of the write-off be a debt in existence. As any debt due by BRACS to Budget had been remitted or extinguished by the deed of covenant, no debt thereafter existed and none could be written off. Accepting the Commissioner’s argument in this respect Tompkins J stated at page 12,267: I accept Mr Wood’s submission that for a taxpayer to be entitled to deduct from its assessable income the amount of a bad debt written off, there must at the time of the write off be a debt in existence. If a debt has been effectively released, the effect is to extinguish it or put an end to its existence. Thereafter there cannot be a write off of that debt for tax purposes. This accords with the view expressed by Owen J in Point v FC of T 70 ACT 4021; (1970) 1 ATR 577 at ATC p 4023; ATR p 580. ... The issue therefore becomes whether the parties, when they entered into the deed of covenant and in particular cl 2.1, intended to extinguish the debt. In accordance with the normal canons of contractual interpretation, this is to be determined having regard to the words the parties used, viewed in the light of the surrounding circumstances. However, on the facts Tompkins J found that a debt did exist, and allowed Budget a bad debt deduction. The following Australian case illustrates a similar point. In GE Crane Sales Pty Ltd v FC of T 71 ATC 4268 the High Court of Australia considered a claim by the taxpayer to write off certain bad debts. The Court held that it could not do so because the taxpayer was not a creditor in respect of these debts. Whereas some had been accepted in full satisfaction of a debt owing, the taxpayer’s rights to recover the balance had been extinguished and it could not claim to write off as a bad debt the balance of the amount. Menzies J at page 4,272 expressed the 11 opinion that a taxpayer cannot write off as a bad debt an amount that is no longer a debt. Moreover, at page 4,272 he stated: I have therefore come to the conclusion, both as to the factored debts which were extinguished and those in which the appellant gave up any beneficial interest which it had to the receiver and manager under the scheme of arrangement, that sec. 63 does not apply because at the time the writing off occurred there did not exist, in any sense, debts owing to the appellant. To write off as bad debts amounts which are owing but which cannot be recovered is a sensible commercial exercise and one to which taxation significance is naturally enough given, but to write off a non-existent debt as a bad debt is hardly sensible commercially and, in my opinion, to do so has no significance for the purposes of sec. 63 ... Section 26 requires that the registered person “Has written off as a bad debt the whole or part of the consideration not paid to that person”. Both Budget Rent A Car and G E Crane Sales Pty Ltd indicate that before a debt can be written off a debt must be in existence at the time the debt is written off. Although these cases were determined in an income tax context, the wording of section 26 makes them no less applicable for GST purposes. Accordingly, for section 26 to apply, the registered person must be able to show that at the time of writing off the debt, a debt was then in existence. In terms of non-recourse debt factoring, at the time the debt is sold, the debt between the registered person and debtor is extinguished and replaced with a separate and distinct debt between the Factor and debtor. In such situations no debt exists at the time the amount is written off, which will be after sale of the debt. Therefore, after the sale of the debt to the Factor, no further debt exists and according to both Budget Rent A Car Ltd and G E Crane Sales Pty Ltd no amount can be written off as a bad debt. In terms of recourse debt factoring arrangements (where the Factor has some form of claim back to the Assignor if he or she is unable to collect some of the debts purchased) when a debt is sold by the Assignor on a recourse basis, the title to the debt passes to the Factor unless the Factor exercises a recourse option or right by which the debt can be transferred back to the Assignor. Therefore, after the sale of the debt to the Factor (until the recourse is exercised and the debt is transferred back) no further debt exists, and according to both Budget Rent A Car Ltd and G E Crane Sales Pty Ltd no amount can be written off as a bad debt. However, if the Factor exercises an option or right to transfer some portion of the debt back to the Assignor after the sale then, once this has occurred, a debt exists that is owed to the Assignor that may be able to be written off by the Assignor. Whether it can be written off depends on the application of the ordinary tests for determining whether a debt is bad as noted above, under the heading “Whether the creditor can recover the amount owing”. Writing off the debt before sale to the Factor Several submissions received on the first draft of the Ruling noted that the issue of whether the discount to the Factor might be written off as a bad debt under section 26(1) would not arise if this amount were written off prior to the sale of the debt to the Factor. 12 The Commissioner agrees that this is the case. If a portion of a debt is written off before it is sold to the Factor, then whether the debt is written off as bad according to the requirements in section 26(1) depends on the application of the tests outlined in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/03 entitled “Bad debts – writing off debts as bad for GST and income tax purposes”, see Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 5 (May 2000) at page 5.
1 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (FBT) PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 00/08 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 97/6, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 5 (May 1997), but its period of application is from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2004. For clarification purposes, some minor changes have also been made. BR Pub 97/6 applied to FBT periods commencing after 30 June 1997 and ending before 1 July 1999. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of paragraph (m) of section CI 1 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of a non-monetary benefit by a charitable organisation to an employee of that organisation. In this Ruling, the term “charitable organisation” has the meaning that it has in the Act for the purposes of the FBT rules. That is, in relation to any quarter or (where FBT is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) any income year, any society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund (not being a local authority, a public authority, or a university) to which, in the quarter or income year, section KC 5(1) applies. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • For the purposes of the proviso to section CI 1(m), a non-monetary benefit which is provided to an employee of a charitable organisation is not received by that employee in relation to the carrying on of a business by the charitable organisation if the employee receives the benefit in the course of an activity of the charitable organisation which involves carrying out any of the organisation’s charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes, even if income is received by the organisation in the course of carrying out that activity. • For the purposes of the proviso to section CI 1(m), a non-monetary benefit which is provided to an employee of a charitable organisation is received by that employee in relation to the carrying on of a business by the charitable organisation if the employee receives the benefit in the course of an activity which both: 2 • cannot be characterised as carrying out any of the organisation’s charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes; and • constitutes a profession, a trade, a manufacture, or an undertaking which is carried on for pecuniary profit (even if that profit is to be applied solely for the purposes of the charitable organisation). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 14th day of August 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 00/08 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR 00/08 (“the Ruling”). Background The charitable organisation exemption from fringe benefit tax does not apply to any benefit that is provided by a charitable organisation to an employee in the course of the employee’s employment in a business activity of the charitable organisation. The issue is whether the FBT exemption applies to benefits provided by charitable organisations that carry on their charitable objects in a business-like manner, and which have a record and expectation of making surpluses of income over expenditure. Legislation Section CI 1 defines the term “fringe benefit” for the purposes of the FBT rules. The relevant parts of that section, for the purposes of the Ruling, state: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, means any benefit that consists of - (a) The private use or enjoyment, in relation to the employee ... of a motor vehicle ... (b) The availability for the private use or enjoyment of the employee ... of a motor vehicle ... (c) Any loan that is owing, by the employee,... (d) Any subsidised transport: (e) ... any contribution to any sick, accident, or death benefit fund ... (f) ... any specified insurance premium or any contribution to any insurance fund of a friendly society: (g) Any contribution in relation to an employer of an employee, to any superannuation scheme: (h) Any benefit of any other kind whatever,... being, as the case may be, private use or enjoyment, availability for private use or enjoyment, a loan, subsidised transport, a contribution to a fund referred to in paragraph (e), a specified insurance premium or a contribution to an insurance fund of a friendly society, a contribution to a superannuation scheme, or a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee; but does not include - ... (m) Any benefit that, in any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) any income year, is provided or granted by or on behalf of an employer, being a charitable organisation, to an employee of the employer: Provided that this paragraph shall not apply to any such benefit to the extent that the benefit is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, primarily and principally in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of, any employment, in relation to the employee, that consists of any activity or activities performed by the employee in the carrying on, by the employer, of a business: \[Emphasis added\] 4 “Business” is defined in section OB 1 as including any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit. “Charitable organisation” is defined for the purposes of the FBT rules as: ... any society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund (not being a local authority, a public authority, or a university) to which ... section KC 5(1) applies. Section KC 5(1) applies to certain named institutions (paragraphs (ae) to (bv)), and, more generally, to: (aa) A society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and the funds of which are, in the opinion of the Commissioner, applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand: (ab) A public institution maintained exclusively for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ac) A fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa), by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual: (ad) A public fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): “Charitable purpose” is defined in section OB 1 as including: ... every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community: The Act does not define “benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes”. Application of the legislation The charitable organisation exemption from FBT contained in paragraph (m) of section CI 1 only applies to the extent that the employee does not receive the benefit in the course of the organisation carrying on a business. The Ruling addresses the issue of when a charitable organisation will and will not be carrying on a business for the purposes of the charitable organisation exemption from FBT. “Business” is defined in section OB 1 as including “any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit”. \[Emphasis added\] The Court of Appeal in Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682 considered that underlying the Act’s definition of “business”, and the use of the word in the context of a taxation statute, is the fundamental notion of the exercise of an activity in an organised and coherent way that is directed to an end result - the making of pecuniary profits. The Court said that the existence of a business activity is determined on the basis of the nature of the activity and whether the taxpayer has the intention of 5 making a pecuniary profit in carrying out that activity. The Court stated, at page 61,691: Statements by the taxpayer as to his intentions are of course relevant but actions will often speak louder than words. Amongst the matters which may properly be considered in that inquiry are the nature of the activity, the period over which it is engaged in, the scale of operations and the volume of transactions, the commitment of time, money and effort, the pattern of activity, and the financial results. Many charitable organisations engage in activities on a continuous and ongoing basis, commit time, money and effort to those activities and conduct a large volume of transactions, and so will have these characteristics of a business. The issue is therefore whether a charitable organisation that budgets for, and has a record of making surpluses of income over expenditure has the intention of making a profit. If it is carried on for profit, it will be a “business” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. English cases have held that the fact that a charity makes a profit does not mean that it is carried on “for profit”. In Trustees of the National Deposit Friendly Society v Skegness UDC \[1958\] 2 All ER 601, the House of Lords found that a charity’s objects are to advance the charitable purposes for which it is established. If profit-making is not one of their purposes but is only a means of achieving those purposes, the charity is not carried on “for profit”. In Customs and Excise Commissioners v Bell Concord Educational Trust Ltd \[1989\] 2 All ER 217, the Court held that the question of whether or not an organisation is carried on “for profit” must be answered by reference to the objects for which that organisation is established, as contained in its constitution, and not by reference to the budgeting policy of that organisation. Thus, a charitable organisation that carries on its activities in a business-like manner and which has the intention and record of making surpluses is not carried on “for profit”, unless the organisation’s constitution states that one of its purposes is to make a profit. As such organisations are not carried on “for pecuniary profit”, they are not carrying on a “business” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act and the FBT exemption. The Commissioner considers that Parliament did not intend the word “business” in the proviso to paragraph (m) of section CI 1 to include any charitable organisation which operates in a business-like manner and which intends to make surpluses. Such an interpretation would mean that most successful charitable organisations, in carrying on their charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes, would be carrying on businesses for the purposes of the Income Tax Act and so would be subject to FBT in respect of benefits they provide to their employees. The proviso to the exemption contained in paragraph (m) would apply to most charitable organisations, making them subject to FBT, and the exemption from FBT contained in paragraph (m) would generally not apply. Only those charitable organisations that could show that they did not operate in a business-like manner or did not intend to make surpluses, either in the short or long term, would not be carrying on a business and would be exempt from FBT. The Commissioner considers that this wide 6 interpretation of the word “business” in the proviso to paragraph (m) of section CI 1 is not correct. Instead, the Commissioner considers that the proviso to paragraph (m) of section CI 1 only applies to business activities which are carried on by charitable organisations but which are not, themselves, charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural activities. Such business activities may be conducted to assist the achievement of charitable purposes, and the income produced by them may be applied to the charitable purpose. However, the business activities that the proviso applies to are not the intrinsically charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural activities of the organisation. A distinction between the charitable (i.e. running and administering a charity, and providing charitable services) and the non-charitable purposes of a charity was drawn in Oxfam v City of Birmingham District Council \[1975\] 2 All ER 289. That case concerned section 40 of the United Kingdom General Rate Act 1967 that applied to premises or hereditaments that were occupied by a charity and wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. The House of Lords considered whether Oxfam’s gift shops were on premises wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. The House of Lords found that, although the gift shops were used for purposes that indirectly related to the achievement of the objects of the charity (i.e. selling donated goods to raise money for the charity), the premises were not wholly or mainly used for charitable purposes. In reaching this conclusion, the House of Lords drew a line between the use of premises for purposes which are the charitable purposes of the charity, and the use of premises for purposes which, though purposes of the charity, are not charitable purposes. Lord Cross said (at page 293): The wording of s 40(1) of the 1967 Act shows that the Legislature did not consider that the mere fact that a hereditament in question is occupied by a charity justifies any relief from rates. That is only justified if the hereditament is being used for the ‘charitable purposes’ of the charity. So the first question which arises is: what are the ‘charitable purposes’ of a charity as distinct from its other purposes? The answer must be, I think, those purposes or objects the pursuit of which make it a charity - that is to say in this case the relief of poverty, suffering and distress. Oxfam identifies the fact that a charitable organisation can carry out both charitable and non-charitable activities. However, not all of the “non-charitable” activities carried on by a charitable organisation will constitute business activities. Only benefits provided to employees of a charitable organisation in relation to the carrying on of a business by or on behalf of the organisation will be subject to FBT. The distinction between an organisation carrying out the functions for which the organisation was established and an organisation carrying on a business was examined in Port Chalmers Waterfront Workers Union v CIR; New Zealand Waterfront Workers Union v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,059 (High Court); CIR v Port Chalmers Waterfront Workers Union (1996) 17 NZTC 12,523 (Court of Appeal). That case concerned section 61(23) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 61(23) (section CB 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994) provides an exemption from income 7 tax for the income of a friendly society, except so far as that income is derived from business carried on beyond the circle of its membership. In Port Chalmers, the High Court drew a distinction between a friendly society carrying on a business as a trading organisation and a friendly society discharging its functions as a friendly society. It said that where the friendly society is discharging its functions as a friendly society, it is not carrying on a business even though it may conduct transactions that have a commercial flavour. This distinction was accepted by the Court of Appeal. The Ruling interprets paragraph (m) of section CI 1 as drawing a similar distinction as that drawn in Port Chalmers between the activities of a charitable organisation which discharge the purposes for which the organisation was established (i.e. the discharging of its charitable, benevolent, or philanthropic objects) and the charitable organisation carrying on a business as a trading organisation. A charitable organisation is not carrying on a business for the purposes of paragraph (m) when it discharges its charitable objects, even though it may discharge those purposes in a business-like manner. The effect of the Ruling is that the activities involved in carrying out the charitable objects of a charitable organisation, or directly facilitating the carrying out of the charitable objects (such as fundraising or administrative or clerical activities) will not be treated as being business activities for the purposes of paragraph (m). However, trading activities carried on to raise funds for the charity, which are not themselves the charitable purposes of the charity, will be treated as business activities of the charitable organisation if they satisfy the “business” test set out in the Income Tax Act (i.e. if those activities are carried on for the purpose of making a pecuniary profit). Thus, when a charitable organisation’s employees are engaged in carrying out the charitable purposes of the organisation, any benefits provided to them are not provided in the course of employment in a business activity of the organisation. The benefits will therefore be exempt from FBT under paragraph (m) of section CI 1. However, when a charitable organisation’s employees are engaged in activities of the organisation which are not in themselves charitable, and which constitute business activities of the organisation, any benefits provided to them will be provided in the course of employment in a business activity of the organisation. These benefits will not be exempt from FBT under paragraph (m). An employee may be employed by a charitable organisation in a range of activities, some of which relate to the carrying out of the organisation’s charitable purposes or other non-business activities of the organisation, and some of which are non- charitable business activities. Such an employee may receive benefits from the organisation in connection with both the business and non-business types of activities. Section CI 1(m) exempts benefits provided to employees of charitable organisations from FBT except to the extent that the benefit is received principally or primarily in relation to the employee’s employment in a business carried on by the charitable organisation. 8 The phrase “to the extent that” does not, in this instance, mean that the benefit should be apportioned. In other contexts, it has been held that the words provide for the possibility of apportionment. However, in section CI 1(m) Parliament has also used the phrase “primarily and principally”. This use of “primarily and principally” is inconsistent with the concept of apportionment: rather the phrase means that where the requirement is for the most part true for that element, the section is satisfied completely. There is no need for an apportionment and, consequently, in the context of section CI 1(m), the phrase “to the extent that” is to be interpreted as meaning “where”. Thus, a benefit provided to an employee who engages in both the business and non- business activities of a charitable organisation will only be subject to FBT if the employee receives that benefit principally and primarily in relation to the carrying out of the organisation’s business activities. In other cases the benefit will remain exempt from FBT. As a guide, the Commissioner considers that an employee will receive a benefit principally and primarily in relation to his or her employment in a business activity of the organisation where the benefit arises primarily in connection with such a business activity, rather than in connection with a non-business activity, or where the benefit arises equally in connection with both the business and non-business activities carried out by the employee, but the employee is predominantly employed in the business activities of the employer. Note that the Ruling does not apply to employers that are local authorities, public authorities, or universities. These organisations are excluded from the definition of “charitable organisation” for the purposes of the FBT rules, so the charitable organisation exemption contained in paragraph (m) of section CI 1 does not apply to them. Fringe benefits provided by these organisations will be subject to FBT unless some other exemption applies to them. Examples It will be a question of fact in each case whether the particular activities of a charitable organisation are activities that are not the inherently charitable activities which the organisation was established to carry out, and are also activities which constitute a business for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. The following activities are examples of activities likely to be characterised as not being business activities of the charitable organisation (and, hence, any benefits provided to employees of the organisation in connection with these activities will be exempt from FBT). Note that this is not intended to be an exhaustive list of such activities: • Activities directly related to carrying out the objects of the charity, but which also have an income component. For example: • A school or polytechnic established to provide education that charges fees for the provision of the educational services. 9 • An organisation established to provide assistance to a disabled or disadvantaged group that provides services to those people for payment (e.g. residential accommodation services in return for board). • An organisation established to provide relief and assistance to the poor that runs a secondhand shop in order to provide affordable goods to that group. • Appeals for funds for the charity’s purposes. • Passive investment and management of the funds of the charity, as long as the charitable organisation does not carry on a business of fund investment. • Administration of the above activities. An activity that is carried on by the charitable organisation that does not involve the organisation carrying out its charitable objects, but which involves the sale of goods or services for valuable and adequate consideration on a similar basis to business enterprises carried out by private individuals, and with a view to making a profit, is likely to constitute the organisation carrying on a business. Any benefits provided to employees in connection with such an activity will be subject to FBT under the proviso to paragraph (m). Example 1 A charitable trust has the principal purpose of providing education through a private school. The trust is a charitable organisation for the purposes of the FBT rules, as it is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and its funds are applied wholly or principally for charitable purposes (the advancement of education) within New Zealand. The trust charges tuition fees and has had surpluses of income over expenditure for the last three income years. It provides a car to its school principal for work and private use. The trust is not liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the private use or availability for private use of the car provided to the principal. This is because the benefit is provided by a charitable organisation to an employee who is employed in respect of the charitable organisation carrying out its charitable objects. The employee is not employed in a separate business activity carried on by the school. Example 2 A company conducts a farming business on land adjacent to the school. All the shares in the company are held for the benefit of the school charitable trust referred to in Example 1, and the company’s constitution provides that the assets and profits of the farming business must be applied exclusively to the promotion of the objects of the school charitable trust. The company provides a car to its farm manager for his work and personal use. The company is liable for FBT on the benefit arising from the provision of the car to the 10 farm manager, because the farm manager receives the benefit in relation to his employment in a business (the farm) carried on by the company. Example 3 The same facts exist as in Example 2, except in this case the farming operation is carried out by the company, in a business-like manner, for the purpose of the practical component of the school’s agricultural courses. In this situation the farming operation relates to the carrying on of the educational charitable objects of the school, and the availability of the car for private use by the farm manager is not subject to FBT. Example 4 A polytechnic charitable organisation offers a course on working in the hospitality industry. As part of that course the polytechnic operates a restaurant where the students gain experience in preparing food and waiting on tables. The restaurant is open to the public and patrons pay for their meals. The polytechnic provides the hospitality course supervisor with a van for restaurant use. The van is also available for the supervisor’s private use. The supervisor is employed in carrying out the polytechnic’s charitable purpose of providing education to the students in the hospitality course. Because of this, the van is not provided in relation to the supervisor’s employment in a business carried on by the polytechnic and its availability for private use is not a benefit that is subject to FBT. Example 5 A polytechnic runs a cafeteria that is open to students and the general public. The cafeteria is not operated as part of any polytechnic course. The cafeteria is an activity of the polytechnic that cannot be characterised as carrying out the polytechnic’s charitable purposes of providing education. Further, it is a commercial trading activity carried on with the intention of making a profit. The cafeteria is therefore a business run by the polytechnic. The polytechnic employs a person to prepare food for the cafeteria. Once a week, this employee is also employed by the polytechnic to provide instruction in the hospitality course run by the polytechnic. The employee therefore is employed in both the business operations (the cafeteria) and the charitable activities (providing education in the hospitality course) of the polytechnic. The polytechnic pays for the employee’s membership to an off-campus fitness centre. This benefit arises because of the employee’s employment with the polytechnic, and does not specifically arise in relation to either her employment in the cafeteria or her employment in the hospitality course. However, because the employee’s employment in the cafeteria takes up 80% of her time, the benefit arises principally and primarily in relation to her employment in a business activity of the polytechnic. The benefit is 11 therefore not exempt from FBT under paragraph (m) of section CI 1 and will be subject to FBT.
1 DIRECTORS’ FEES AND GST PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 00/09 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 6(3)(b), 8, and 57(2)(b). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement, occupation, or employment as a director of a company. The engagement may either be by direct contract between the director and the company for whom the person acts as a director, or by a third party appointing, or agreeing to provide, a director to a company. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • If a natural person is engaged as a director and the services are not undertaken as part of carrying on the person’s own taxable activity, the engagement will be excluded from the term “taxable activity” due to the application of section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity: • If a natural person is engaged as a director as part of carrying on his or her taxable activity, the proviso to section 6(3)(b) will apply and the services will be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. If the person is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, the person will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the directorship services: • If a natural person is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company and the person has not accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity: • the engagement of the natural person as a director will be excluded from the term “taxable activity” due to the application of section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity; • the provision by the third party of the services of the natural person director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the third party has not 2 been engaged as a director of a company. If the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that third party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the person’s services as a director of the company: • If a natural person is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company and the engagement is part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity: • the engagement of the natural person director will fall within the proviso to section 6(3)(b) and the services will be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity; • the provision by the third party of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. If the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that third party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the person’s services as a director of the company: • If an employee, as part of his or her employment, is engaged as a director of a third party company by way of a contract between his or her employer and the third party company: • the engagement of the employee will fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso to the section does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on a taxable activity of the employee; • the provision by the employer of the services of a director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the employer is not engaged as a director of a company. If the employer is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that employer will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the employee’s services as a director of the company: • If an employee is engaged by a third party company to be a director of that company, where: the employee is required to account to the employer for the directors fees received; there is no contract between the employer company and the third party company; and where the employee does not undertake the services as part of carrying on his or her own taxable activity: • the engagement as director will be excluded from the term “taxable activity” due to the application of section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity; • if the employer is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, the employer is required to account for GST on the consideration received for the 3 supply of services to the employee, i.e. permitting the employee to be a director. • If a partner in a partnership accepts an engagement as a director of a company as part of the partnership’s business: • the activity of the partner, in accepting the engagement as a director, falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso to the section does not apply as, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership in terms of section 57(2)(b); • the provision by the partnership of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the partnership is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the partner’s services as a director of the company as it is considered to be part of the normal taxable activity of the partnership. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to supplies made within the period 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of August 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) 4 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 00/09 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/09 (“the Ruling”). Background Section 6 defines the term “taxable activity” for the purposes of the Act. Under section 6(1), a person conducts a taxable activity when all of the following characteristics are present: • There is some form of activity. • The activity is carried on continuously or regularly. • The activity involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. Section 6(3) provides certain exclusions from the term “taxable activity”. Under section 6(3)(b), the activities of a salary and wage earner or of a person in receipt of directors’ fees are excluded from the term. Under the proviso to section 6(3)(b), if a person in carrying on a taxable activity accepts any office, any services supplied by that person in holding that office are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Therefore, if a GST registered sole trader who, in carrying on his or her taxable activity, takes on a company directorship, the proviso applies and GST is chargeable on the directors’ fees paid. Public Information Bulletin (PIB) 164 issued in August 1987 contained an item titled “GST on Directors’ Fees”. The item concerned the circumstances in which directors’ fees did and did not attract GST. The item listed indicators that could be used in identifying the correct GST treatment to be applied to directors’ fees. These indicators were: 1. Directors’ fees paid to directors personally, and retained by them. Not subject to GST – excluded from the meaning of taxable activity by section 6(3)(b). 2. Directors’ fees paid to directors personally, but applied by them to their partnership or business income, where the partnership or business is a registered person. Subject to GST – subject to the proviso to section 6(3)(b). 5 3. Directors’ fees paid directly to director’s partnership or company, where that partnership or company is a registered person. Subject to GST – a normal taxable supply. In July 1988 the Department issued PIB 175 containing, at page 26, a further item “GST on Directors’ Fees”, restricting the policy set down in PIB 164. The item advised that the proviso to section 6(3)(b) applies only to a sole trader, e.g. an accountant (being a registered person) who, in carrying on his or her taxable activity, is appointed a director of a company. The statement said that directors’ fees paid to a partner in a partnership or to a shareholder, director, or employee of another company are not therefore subject to GST. The reason given for this interpretation was that, in terms of the Companies Act 1955, a director could only be a natural person. Therefore, directors’ fees either paid to directors on behalf of their companies or partnerships, or paid direct to the company or partnership for directorship services carried out by their employees or partners, do not attract GST under this policy. Inland Revenue published an interpretation statement in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 8, No.4. (September 1996) on “Tax deductions from directors’ fees paid to GST registered persons”. This interpretation statement is also relevant to the subject matter of this Ruling, even though it deals with tax deductions under the Income Tax Act 1994. The statement says, at page 3, that if an employee is acting as a director of a company on behalf of another company, the directors’ fees paid are for services rendered by the employer company. Regulation 4(2) of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (“the Regulations”) states that payments for work done or services rendered by a company are not withholding payments. Therefore, tax deductions are not required to be made from the payments. Similarly, if a company pays directors’ fees to a partnership account in return for the partner performing partnership services, the fees are business income of the partners and the Commissioner will not require tax deductions to be made under section NC 13 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Therefore, if it is the company or partnership that is providing the services of its employee or partner as a director, the question arises as to whether GST should be charged on these services as they would normally be supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity of the company or partnership. This Ruling replaces the policy items on “GST on Directors’ Fees” contained in PIBs 164 and 175. Legislation The definition of the term “person” is contained in section 2(1) of the Act and states: includes a company, an unincorporated body of persons, a public authority, and a local authority Section 2 also contains the definition of “registered person” being: ... a person who is registered or is liable to be registered under this Act. 6 Section 6 states: (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term “taxable activity” means - (a) Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: (b) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the activities of any public authority or any local authority. (2) Anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity shall be deemed to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, for the purposes of this Act the term “taxable activity” shall not include, in relation to any person, - (a) Being a natural person, any activity carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (aa) Not being a natural person, any activity which, if it were carried on by a natural person, would be carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (b) Any engagement, occupation, or employment under any contract of service or as a director of a company: Provided that where any person, in carrying on any taxable activity, accepts any office, any services supplied by that person as the holder of that office shall be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity; or ... (Emphasis added) Section 8(1), dealing with the imposition of goods and services tax, states: Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. Section 57, dealing with unincorporated bodies, states: (1) For the purposes of this section - “Body” means an unincorporated body of persons; and includes - (a) A partnership: (b) A joint venture: (c) The trustees of a trust: “Member” means a partner, a joint venturer, a trustee, or a member of any body: “Partnership” and “partner” have the same meanings as in the Partnership Act 1908. (2) Where a body that carries on any taxable activity is registered pursuant to this Act, - (a) The members of that body shall not themselves be registered or liable to be registered under this Act in relation to the carrying on of that taxable activity; and (b) Any supply of goods and services made in the course of carrying on that taxable activity shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be supplied by that body, and shall be deemed not to be made by any member of that body; and ... (Emphasis added) Section 151(3) of the Companies Act 1993 states: A person that is not a natural person cannot be a director of a company. 7 Application of the Legislation Section 8(1) provides that GST is charged on the supply (but not an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. Therefore, one of the determining features in ascertaining whether there is a liability to account for GST, is the existence of a “taxable activity”. Another determining feature is whether the person is a “registered person”. Section 6(1) defines a “taxable activity” as an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly, and involves or is intended to involve the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. The section also includes within the term “taxable activity” the activities of any public or local authority. Under section 6(2), anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity is deemed to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Paragraphs (a), (aa), (b), (c), and (d) of section 6(3) exclude from the term “taxable activity” such activities as hobbies, employment under a contract of service and engagement as a director of a company, certain Government-type and local authority appointments, and the making of exempt supplies. The proviso to paragraph (b) states that if a person, in carrying on a taxable activity, accepts any office, services supplied by that person in holding that office are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Therefore, if a person is carrying on a taxable activity, and accepts an engagement as a company director in carrying on that taxable activity, the proviso will apply. If it is established that a taxable activity is in existence after applying section 6, the question of whether the person is liable to account for GST will depend on the application of the remaining criteria set down in section 8. One of these criteria is whether the person is a “registered person”, i.e. whether the person is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, which includes whether the taxable activity threshold amount in section 51 has been satisfied. Section 57(2)(b) provides that where a partnership carries on a taxable activity, any supply of goods and services made as part of carrying on that taxable activity are deemed to be supplied by the partnership and not by any of the partners. Section 151(3) of the Companies Act 1993 provides that only a natural person can be a director of a company. 8 The following scenarios illustrate how section 6(3)(b) is applied in respect of a person engaged as a director of a company, i.e. whether a taxable activity is in existence. It is important to note that the Ruling itself deals specifically with section 6(3)(b). If it is established that an activity does not fall within the exclusion from a “taxable activity” set down in that section, the remaining criteria under section 8 must be applied in order to determine the existence of a liability to account for GST. Note that it is the contractual relationship between the parties, founded on a genuine basis, that determines the GST treatment of the relevant transactions (Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325). A. Personal capacity A natural person is engaged as a director of a company in that person’s personal capacity and not as part of carrying on any taxable activity. The activity of this person falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) in that it involves a person who is engaged as a director of a company. The activity is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso does not apply, as the person has not accepted the engagement as part of carrying on a taxable activity. B. Carrying on a taxable activity A natural person is engaged as a director of a company as part of carrying on that person’s taxable activity. The activity of this person falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) in that it involves a person who is engaged as a director of a company. The activity is therefore prima facie excluded from the term “taxable activity”. However, as the person has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on a taxable activity, the proviso deems the services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. If the person is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, the person will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the directorship services. C. Person contracted as a company director A natural person is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company. The person is not undertaking the directorship as part of carrying on any taxable activity. The third party invoices the company for its services in providing it with a director. The engagement of the person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity. The provision by the third party of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) as the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered 9 for GST, that party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the services of the person as a director of the company. D. Person contracted as a company director in carrying on a taxable activity A natural person, as part of carrying on a taxable activity, is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company. The third party invoices the company for providing the services of the director, who in turn invoices the third party for his or her services. The engagement of the person as a director of a company is prima facie excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). However, as the person has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on his or her taxable activity, the proviso to the section deems the directorship services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of his or her taxable activity. The natural person’s liability for GST will therefore depend on satisfying the remaining requirements of section 8. The provision by the third party of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) as the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the person’s directorship services. E. Employee engaged as director An employee of an employer is engaged as a director of a third party company as part of the person’s employment duties. The engagement of this person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as the person has not accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity – the person is merely carrying out his or her employment duties. The provisions of section 6(3)(b) do not apply to the employer who is supplying the services of its employee as the employer is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the employer is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the services of the person as a director of the company. F. Employee required to pay over directors’ fees to employer Sometimes an employee is permitted to accept directorships of third party companies provided the employee accounts to the employer for the fees received. This might occur with family companies. In this type of scenario there would not be a contract between the employer and the third party company. In this situation, the engagement of the person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as the person has not accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity. The employer company, provided it is registered for GST or liable to be registered for GST, will be required to account for GST on the supply of services 10 to the employee. These services could best be described as allowing the employee to undertake directorship duties in work time or permitting the employee to be a director. G. Partner in a partnership engaged as a director A partner in a partnership accepts an engagement as a director of a company as part of the partnership’s business. The engagement of this person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership in terms of section 57(2)(b). Therefore, the partner is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. Section 6(3)(b) does not apply in the case of the partnership as the partnership is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership supplies the services of one of its partners to the company as part of its taxable activity. The partnership will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the partner’s directorship services. Examples Example 1 Taxpayer A, who is not registered for GST, is a partner in a firm of chartered accountants. Company B engages taxpayer A as a director, and pays him fees for his services. Taxpayer A’s appointment as a director is not connected with his involvement in the partnership nor has he accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity. He retains the fees, having received them in his personal capacity. Taxpayer A is engaged as a director of a company, an activity that is excluded from the term “taxable activity” by section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply, as taxpayer A is not providing directorship services as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Taxpayer A is not required to account for GST on the fees received for directorship services. Example 2 Taxpayer B is a human resources consultant in business on her own. She is registered for GST. She accepts a company directorship as part of carrying on her taxable activity, and receives fees for her services. Taxpayer B’s engagement as a director is prima facie excluded from the term “taxable activity” in terms of section 6(3)(b). However, as she has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on her taxable activity, the proviso to the section deems the directorship services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of her taxable activity. She should therefore account for GST on the fees she is paid. 11 Example 3 A GST-registered financial management company supplies the services of one of its specialist employees as a director of another company. Directors’ fees are paid to the company for the services provided. The engagement of the employee as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the employee has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Therefore, the employee is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. Section 6(3)(b) does not apply to the activity of the management company as that company is not engaged as a company director. The fees are paid in consideration of the management company providing the services of one of its employees to the other company. This is a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity of the management company and that company will be required to account for GST on the fees received for this supply. Example 4 A partner of a GST-registered legal partnership is elected on to the board of directors of a client company as a representative of the partnership. The partnership is providing legal advice to the company, which in turn pays fees into the partnership’s account. The engagement of the partner as a director of a company falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso to the section does not apply as, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership in terms of section 57(2)(b). Therefore, the partner is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. The provisions of section 6(3)(b) do not apply to the partnership as it is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees it receives from the company. Example 5 A GST-registered accountant in business on his own is contracted by a consulting firm to take up an engagement as a director of a company with the object of monitoring the company’s financial systems. The engagement of the accountant as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). However, as the person has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on his taxable activity, the proviso to the section deems the directorship services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of his taxable activity. The accountant will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees he receives in respect of these services. The provision by the consulting firm of the services of the accountant does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) as the firm is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the consulting firm is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, it will be required to account 12 for GST on the fees received for the supply of the directorship services of the accountant. Example 6 Company A agrees to one of its employees taking up a directorship position with Company X on the proviso that the employee hands over the directors’ fees payable to the employee by Company X. There is no contract between Company A and Company X. The engagement of the employee as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the employee has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Therefore, the employee is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. If Company A is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, it is required to account for GST on the supply of services, i.e. permitting the employee to be a director of Company X.
1 “COST PRICE OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE” - MEANING OF THE TERM FOR FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (FBT) PURPOSES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 00/10 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CI 3(1) and Schedule 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (and the meaning of “cost price” for the purposes of determining the value of the benefit to the employee). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of a motor vehicle by an employer, who owns the motor vehicle, to an employee for the private use and enjoyment of the vehicle by the employee. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: The “cost price of the motor vehicle” for the purpose of the calculation of fringe benefit tax under section CI 3(1) and Schedule 2 will be determined as follows: • The “cost price of the motor vehicle” will include: • the purchase price of the vehicle (inclusive of goods and services tax (GST)). • the cost of initial registration and licence plate fees (inclusive of GST). • the cost of accessories, components, and equipment (other than “business accessories”) fitted to the vehicle at the time of purchase or at any time thereafter (all costs inclusive of GST). • the cost of sign writing or painting the vehicle in the employer’s colours or style (all charges GST inclusive). • the cost (if any) of transporting the motor vehicle to the place where the motor vehicle is to be first used (all charges GST inclusive). • The “cost price of the motor vehicle” will not include: • the cost of annual vehicle re-licensing fees. 2 • the cost of “business accessories”, fitted to the motor vehicle at the time of purchase or at any time thereafter. • the cost of financing the purchase of the vehicle. For the purposes of this Ruling: • The term “business accessories” means accessories, components, and equipment fitted to the vehicle, required for and relating solely to the business operations to which the vehicle is used, and that are in themselves “depreciable property” for the purposes of the Act. Where powered, they will usually require the vehicle’s power source to operate them, e.g. a two-way radio, roof mounted flashing warning lights, electronic testing/monitoring equipment, etc. • The term “fitted to the vehicle” means permanently affixed to the vehicle. Permanency would not be negated if the accessory were removed from the vehicle on a temporary basis, for repair or maintenance, or on the removal of the accessory at the time of sale or disposal of the vehicle or the accessory itself. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 November 2000 to 31 October 2003. This Ruling is signed by me on the 19th day of September 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 00/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in public ruling BR Pub 00/10 (“the Ruling”). All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background If an employee has the private use or enjoyment, or the availability for private use or enjoyment, of a motor vehicle that is owned by the employer of the employee, the employer must pay FBT on the value of the benefit. The benefit is calculated by reference to the cost price of the vehicle to the employer, not the value of the benefit to the employee. If an employer purchases a motor vehicle to be used by, or to be made available for use by, an employee, a number of costs are incurred in addition to the purchase price of the vehicle for the vehicle to be in a state where it can be used by the employee. Some of the additional costs include: • On-road costs. Under section 5 of the Transport (Vehicle and Driver Registration and Licensing) Act 1986, no motor vehicle can be driven on the road unless: • the motor vehicle is registered; and • the registration plates and a current license issued for the vehicle are affixed and displayed on the vehicle; and • the full amount of the accident compensation levy has been paid. • The cost of transporting the vehicle to the initial place where it is to be used. • The cost of fitted accessories, components, or equipment required for and relating solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used. • The cost of accessories, components, and equipment, such as towbars, roof racks, and stereos, fitted to the car at the time of purchase or at some later time. This Ruling identifies the costs that form part of the “cost price of the motor vehicle” for the purposes of calculating FBT. The Commissioner considers the cost of motor vehicles includes accessories that are permanently affixed to the vehicle. Everything that is permanently affixed to the vehicle, including accessories such as CD players, towbars, and radiotelephone sets, is part of the cost to the employer of making the vehicle available to the employee. Accessories not so permanently affixed are not part of the cost price of the vehicle in the first place and their FBT (or other income tax) status is to be determined separately. However, the Commissioner considers that certain accessories, permanently fitted to the vehicle and relating solely to the business operations for 4 which the vehicle is used, should not be treated as part of the cost of the vehicle for FBT purposes. For example, a radiotelephone set fitted to the vehicle and only able to be used for business purposes would be excluded from the vehicle’s cost price because it is a “business accessory”. On the other hand, a mobile phone is an example of an item considered not to be part of the cost price of the vehicle because it does not meet the test of being permanently affixed to the vehicle. Legislation Section CI 3(1) provides a formula for calculating the value of the fringe benefit that consists of the private use and enjoyment, or the availability for the private use and enjoyment, of a vehicle. This formula is: • y x z when the benefit is subject to FBT on a quarterly basis; and 90 y x z when the benefit is subject to FBT on an income year basis. 365 In these formulae, if the benefit is subject to FBT, (z) is the amount calculated in accordance with Schedule 2. Schedule 2 states: Subject to clause 3, in relation to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable in respect of the vehicle on an income year basis under section ND 4) to any income year, and to any motor vehicle that in the quarter or income year is provided by any person for the private use or enjoyment of an employee or is available for such private use or enjoyment, the value of the benefit that would be able to be enjoyed by the employee, if the employee had unlimited private use or enjoyment or availability for private use or enjoyment of the motor vehicle in that quarter or income year, shall be, - (a) Where the motor vehicle is owned (whether in the person’s own right or jointly with any other person) by that person, 6% or (where fringe benefit tax is payable in respect of the vehicle on an income year basis under section ND 4) 24% of the cost price of the motor vehicle to that person or, as the case may be, those persons: (Emphasis added) (b) Where the motor vehicle is leased or rented by that person from any other person (that person and that other person being associated persons) under a lease or rental agreement that commenced - (i) ... (ii) On or after 23 September 1985, 6% or (where fringe benefit tax is payable in respect of the vehicle on an income year basis under section ND 4) 24% of the cost price of the motor vehicle to the person who is the owner of the motor vehicle at the time the benefit is provided to the employee: (Emphasis added) The definition of “Adjusted tax value” in section OB 1 states: (a) Means, in relation to any depreciable property of a taxpayer and any particular time (and subject to section EG 11, in the case of property in a pool, and to section EG 19(10)(a), in the case of software to which that section applies), the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: bv (base value) - ad (aggregate deductions) 5 where – bv (base value) is – (i) Except where paragraph (ii) or paragraph (iii) or paragraph (iv) of this item applies, the cost of the property to the taxpayer (excluding any expenditure of the taxpayer allowed as a deduction under any provision of this Act or the Income Tax Act 1976 other than sections EG 1 to EG 15 and section EG 18 of this Act or sections 108 to 108N and section 113A of the Income Tax Act 1976): (Emphasis added) Application of the Legislation The determinative factor in the calculation of FBT on motor vehicles is the “cost price of the motor vehicle to that person” (the employer) as contained in Schedule 2. The calculation of fringe benefit tax on the provision of a motor vehicle to an employee is based on the vehicle’s cost price, and not its value to the employee. This was the “test” adopted by Parliament and confirmed in C of IR v Atlas Copco (NZ) Ltd (1990) 12 NZTC 7,327. At pages 7,334 and 7,335 Sinclair J said: The Tenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act clearly states that the value of the benefit is an amount equal to “6% of the cost price of the motor vehicle to that person”, where “that person” is the person providing the benefit. In other words, the schedule expressly states that the value of the benefit is to be calculated by reference to the cost price to the employer. There is no justification in the legislation for defining the term by reference to the value of the benefit to the employee rather than the cost of the benefit to the employer. There is no room for an employee notion to be introduced when construing the Schedule. The above comment is consistent with the intent of Parliament that the cost price of motor vehicles for FBT purposes should equal the cost to the employee, had the employee purchased the vehicle rather than having the vehicle provided by the employer. In introducing the Tax Reform Bill 1990, on the 19 December 1990, the then Minister of Revenue (Hon. Wyatt Creech) said that the amendment to the FBT rules was to ensure that the value of the motor vehicle for FBT purposes included GST. He said that this was to ensure that the FBT “cost price” would equate with the cost that the employee would have had to pay had the employee purchased the vehicle. Meaning of “cost price” “Cost price” is not defined in the Act for the purposes of the FBT rules. It is, therefore, not clear whether it is limited to the purchase price of the vehicle, as some suggest, or whether it includes costs incidental to the purchase, such as on-road costs and the costs of transporting the vehicle to the place where it will be used. The words “cost” and “cost price” are used extensively throughout the Act. Section OB 1 defines these words for a very limited number of sections where the words are used. Examples include: • For the purposes of Part EE (the trading stock rules) “cost” is defined as: 6 In Part EE, for trading stock other than an excepted financial arrangement, means costs incurred in the ordinary course of business to bring the trading stock to its present location and condition including purchase costs and costs of production calculated under sections EE 5 to EE 7. (Emphasis added) • “Cost price” in relation to “specified leases” means: ... the amount of expenditure of a capital nature incurred by the lessor in acquiring and installing that leased asset... (Emphasis added) The significance of these two definitions (even though they have limited application in the Act) is that they both include a reference to costs (“bringing to its present location” and “installing”) that are more than simply the purchase price of the item in question. In the definition of “cost” (for the purposes of the trading stock rules), it could be argued that getting the stock “to its present location” is synonymous with “installing” as used in the definition of “cost price”. “Install” is defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary as “place (heating or lighting etc.) in position for use”. While the two definitions relate to the two different sides of the revenue/capital distinction, they both relate to the assets used in a business. This leads to the view that there may be very little difference (if any) between the terms “cost” and “cost price” as used throughout the Act. This view is supported by the comments of Fullagar J in Australian Jam Co. Pty Ltd v FCT (1953) 10 ATD 220. This case concerned the valuation of trading stock. At 570 the Judge said: The words ‘cost price’ in the section \[relating to the valuation of trading stock\] are perhaps not literally appropriate to goods manufactured, as distinct from goods purchased, by the taxpayer, but I feel no difficulty in reading them as meaning simply ‘cost’. This implies that “price” adds nothing to the meaning of “cost”. “Cost price” is simply “cost”. In commenting on the above citation in an item entitled “Some Aspects of Valuation of Trading Stock for Income Tax Purposes” in the NZ Universities Law Review, Vol. 1 (September 1964), ILM Richardson (now Sir Ivor) said: If “price” adds anything to “cost” it is only in emphasis, in stressing that what is involved is the actual expenditure of money by the taxpayer with relation to the trading stock. In Phillip Morris Ltd v. F.C. of T. 79 ACT 4,352, the Supreme Court of Victoria had to decide what constituted “cost price” for the valuation of cigarettes (trading stock) on hand at the end of an income year under section 31(1) of the Income Tax Act Assessment Act 1936. The Court determined that in respect of manufactured goods: ...t he words “cost price” in that subsection \[section 31(1)\] should be understood as meaning “cost”. Both the above cases (Australian Jam and Phillip Morris) considered section 31(1) of the \[Australian\] Income Tax Assessment Act, which gives taxpayers an option of valuing trading stock at its “cost price”. The wording of the section is very similar to the former New Zealand equivalent - section EE 1(3) prior to amendments that applied from the 1998-99 income year - that is, the same “cost price” option applied to New Zealand taxpayers. It follows that in considering the use of the words “cost 7 price” in New Zealand, the courts would arguably adopt the same position as the Australian courts in the above decisions. Where the words are used in other parts of the Act (including Schedule 2), and there is no specific definition, it is considered that “cost price” should be given a similar interpretation. This means that “cost price” as used in Schedule 2 for FBT purposes also means “cost”. In discussing trading stock, some authorities take the view that “cost price” relates to things purchased, while “cost” relates to things manufactured. For example, in Phillip Morris Jenkinson J said: The statutory conception of “cost price” or, in the case of manufacturer’s stock, “cost” is merely a value at a particular time... (Emphasis added) In Australian Jam, Fullagar J said: The words ‘cost price’ in the section \[relating to the valuation of trading stock\] are perhaps not literally appropriate to goods manufactured, as distinct from goods purchased, by the taxpayer, but I feel no difficulty in reading them as meaning simply ‘cost’. (Emphasis added). In TRA Case S12 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,102, Barber DJ considered what is meant by “its cost price” in relation to the valuation of foals born to broodmares owned by a horse breeder. He determined that the foal’s cost price should include the write-down (depreciation) of the broodmare. At 7,107 he said: ...the Legislature has provided that the breeder or farmer must take progeny into account at “its cost price”. Those words do not seem to me to be a particularly happy choice because “cost price” is normally that which a merchant buys something (refer Sixth Edition of the Concise Oxford Dictionary). The cost is the price to be paid for a thing and the price is the money or other consideration for which a thing is bought or sold. The taxpayer has not purchased the foal but has had the foal created through the mare after servicing from the stallion. However, in their context, the words “its cost price” must be given a sensible interpretation. In the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3rd Edition) a meaning for “cost” is “That which must be given in order to acquire, produce or effect something”. (Emphasis added) In these cases the courts make a distinction between “cost” and “cost price”. “Cost” relating to manufactured goods (the cost of manufacture) and “cost price” relating to goods purchased (the cost of purchase). However, under both the Australian and the former New Zealand trading stock valuation rules there is only one option for valuing trading stock at cost and that is its “cost price”. In terms of the legislation, therefore, both manufacturers of trading stock and purchasers of trading stock are required to value their goods under its “cost price”. So, in the trading stock context at least, “cost price” includes both the terms “cost” and “cost price”. Trading stock context As mentioned above, the trading stock rules changed with effect from the 1998-99 income year. The current definition of “cost” applying to the valuation of trading stock requires the “cost” to include, “any costs incurred in the ordinary course of business to bring the trading stock to its present location and condition including purchase costs and costs of production calculated under sections EE 5 to EE 7”. The effect is that now trading stock must be valued by the taxpayer using generally 8 accepted accounting principals (section EE 5(1)). Effectively, section EE 5(2) says that the trading stock must comply with Financial Reporting Standard No.4 (FRS 4) 1994 (Accounting for Inventories). In FRS 4, the value of inventories (trading stock) is to include: 4.6 “Cost of inventories” is the total of: (a) cost of purchase (as defined in paragraph 4.10 below); (b) costs of conversions (as defined in paragraph 4.13 below); and (c) other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 4.10 “Cost of purchase” includes: (a) import duties and other purchase taxes (other than those subsequently recovered); (b) Transport and handling costs (c) ... (Emphasis added) As this standard applied from 1994 (replacing the previous standard -SSAP 4), presumably FRS 4 could have been used as a guide by taxpayers in valuing trading stock under the former valuation option, “cost price”. That the Commissioner accepted similar calculations to FRS 4 is illustrated by the contents of an item on the valuation of trading stock published in Public Information Bulletin No.82 (December 1974). This item set out the three options available to taxpayers, being cost price, market selling value, or replacement price. It then went on to define “cost” - (note: not “cost price”). In respect of purchases of finished goods the item said: Here the cost should include freight inwards, customs duty, insurance, and sales tax in addition to the actual purchase price of the goods. (Emphasis added) In the context of their use in relation to trading stock, the words “cost” and “cost price” are interchangeable. Depreciation context The only provisions that deal with valuation of capital assets in the Act are the depreciation rules set out in Subpart EG. Generally, business assets are “depreciable property” as defined in section OB1, being property that “might reasonably be expected ...to decline in value ...while used or available for use ...in carrying on a business for the purposes of deriving gross income”. This is provided that the assets are not trading stock, land, financial arrangements, or intangible property. Motor vehicles are “depreciable property” and will qualify for depreciation deductions under Part EG. Under section EG 2(1)(a) depreciation is calculated: • where the diminishing value method is being used, on the “adjusted tax value” of the property. 9 • where the straight-line method is being used, on the “cost of the property” to the taxpayer. “Cost” is not defined in the Act for the purposes of section EG 2. “Adjusted tax value” is defined in section OB 1. The main component of this definition is the “base value” of the property. “Base value” in the majority of cases, especially in respect of property acquired after the beginning of the 1993-94 income year, will be its “cost”. As stated above, as far as trading stock is concerned there appears to be no difference between the use of the words “cost” and “cost price”. The words are interchangeable. If the same applies in respect of the word “cost” used in subpart EG, it could mean that “cost” and “cost price” are interchangeable elsewhere in the Act, e.g. in Schedule 2, in determining the “cost price” of a motor vehicle for FBT purposes. The definition of “cost price”, as it applies to Schedule 2, was discussed in C of IR v Atlas Copco (NZ) Ltd. This case considered whether the “cost price” in respect of motor vehicles was the GST inclusive or exclusive cost. While it was not necessary for the Court to formulate an exhaustive meaning of “cost price”, Sinclair J concluded that the words “cost” and “price” are susceptible to a wide variety of meanings. At page 7,332 Sinclair J referred to expert accounting evidence on the meaning of “cost” and stated: This accords with the expert evidence given by two accountants, Mr John Hagen and Professor David Emanuel. Professor Emanuel cited a number of definitions of “cost” from leading textbooks on accounting: “(a) ‘Costs represent the financial sacrifices which are involved in acquiring or producing assets.’ Ma, Matthews and Macmullan, The Accounting Framework (2 nd Ed, 1987) at p 43. (b) ‘Accountants have placed a great deal of emphasis upon the principle of objective evidence, and nowhere is it more apparent than in accounting for the acquisition of plant and equipment. Cost is used as the valuation method in this instance because it is more easily identified than any other valuation and because it is said to be the sacrifice given up now to accomplish future objectives.’ McCullers and Schroeder, Accounting Theory: Text and Readings (1978) at p 233. (c) ‘We define cost here as the sum of the quantitative representations of the sacrifices necessarily incurred to bring the fixed asset to its place and state of use.’ Most, Accounting Theory (1977) at p 235. (Emphasis added) (d) ‘Cost is thus the economic sacrifice expressed in monetary terms required to obtain a specific asset or group of assets.’ Hendriksen, Accounting Theory (3 rd Ed, 1977) at p 270. (e) ‘Cost is an economic sacrifice, an outflow of wealth, by giving up asset value or incurring liability value.’ Staubus, Activity Costing for Decisions (1988) at p 192.” Professor Emanuel then summarised the position by saying that: “Cost is the economic sacrifice associated with getting the purchased item to its current location and condition.” (Emphasis added) It is interesting to note that here the accountants used the term “cost” rather than “cost price” – the term (as used in Schedule 2) that the Court was considering. This is consistent with the earlier analysis that the words are interchangeable. 10 In Atlas Copco the Commissioner objected to the evidence of the accountants. At page 7,333 the Court said: Counsel for the Commissioner objected to the evidence of the two accountants on the basis that the interpretation of “cost price” is a question of law for the Court, and to rely upon the interpretation of accountants would infringe the “ultimate issue” rule. Moreover, counsel felt that the accountants had mistakenly placed economic substance over legal form in analysing the nature of the payment paid by the purchaser. It is true that defining “cost price” is a question of statutory interpretation and, as such, must be resolved by the Court. Where the meaning of words in a statutory context is unclear or ambiguous, however, the Court may derive some assistance from common business parlance and practice, as well as international standards. Moreover, as I have already discussed, the approach of the accountants accords with both the economic substance and the legal form of the transaction: the GST component of the purchase price which may be recovered by a registered purchaser cannot be considered part of the effective “cost price”. (Emphasis added) Here the Court accepts that where uncertainty in the legislation exists, common business practice can be taken into account in defining terms or words. As sufficient doubt surrounds the use of the words in question, accounting or business usage may be of assistance. In this regard SSAP 28 states in respect of the valuation of Fixed Assets: 4.1 The initial cost of a fixed asset is the value of the consideration exchanged or given up to acquire or create the asset at the location and to put it into the working condition necessary for its intended use. Thus, initial cost includes the invoice price (...), import duties, broker’s or agent’s commissions, legal fees, option costs (...), survey costs, site preparation costs, installation costs..., freight and charges for installation commissioning and testing. (Emphasis added) This standard is consistent with the “expert evidence” given by the accountants in Atlas Copco (as cited above). As mentioned, that case was dealing with the definition of “cost price” in Schedule 2, but the evidence given by the accountants, as well as the definitions in SSAP 28, refer to “cost”. This further strengthens the proposition that no fundamental difference exists between “cost” and “cost price” as used in the Act. Conclusion On the above analysis it is concluded that “cost” and “cost price” as used in the Act are interchangeable. The calculations of both terms, using accepted accounting principles, include costs in addition to what can be termed the “purchase price”. This means that for the purposes of the phrase “cost price of the motor vehicle” in the FBT rules, the “cost price” of a motor vehicle will be more than just its purchase price. What is the “cost price” of a motor vehicle for FBT purposes? When a new motor vehicle is purchased, a number of Government charges have to be paid before the purchaser can use the vehicle on the road. The purchaser may also have accessories fitted to the vehicle at the time of purchase or at a later date. Some of these accessories may be of a non-business nature, such as a towbar, CD player, CNG/LPG conversion, air conditioning, alloy wheels, etc. Generally, unless they are 11 part of a special deal, these accessories will be additional costs to the purchaser. In some instances the purchaser may have a business accessory, e.g. a radio-telephone, fitted to the vehicle at the time of purchase or at a later date. The question to be considered is whether all or any of (the cost of) these items forms part of the “cost price” of the vehicle. Government charges Fees payable at the time of purchase of a new car so that it can be driven on the road include: • Once only payments: registration fee, number plate fee. • Annual (recurring) fees: annual relicencing fee, ACC levy, label fee. It is arguable that without payment of the initial registration and plate fees (as distinct from the recurring annual re-licensing fees) by the employer the vehicle cannot be used immediately. The employer has to pay these costs before the vehicle can be “put on the road” or in a position to be used. This suggests that they are properly to be treated as part of the “cost price” of the car. Support for the view that “cost” includes such items as getting the vehicle “on the road” so that it can be used, is found in the High Court of Australia case of BP Refinery (Kwinana) Ltd v FCT (1960) 8 AITR 113. At page 117, Kitto J in considering the issue of what was included in the term “cost”, said. ... in my opinion, the word “cost” in section 56 (1)(b) bears the meaning which it has in the business life of the community. It seems to me impossible to suppose that the depreciation provisions of the Act are intended to apply only to those simple cases in which the ascertainment of cost is a purely arithmetical process. I interpret it as embracing the whole sum which, according to accepted accountancy practice as applied to the circumstances of the case, ought to be considered as having been laid out by the taxpayer in order to acquire the subject-matter as plant, that is to say installed and ready for use as plant for the purpose of producing assessable income. (Emphasis added) Therefore, the cost of the vehicle must include expenditure making it “ready for use” by the taxpayer. Without payment of the registration and plate fees the vehicle is not ready for the purpose intended. Whether the costs of the initial registration fee and the plate fee form part of the cost of the vehicle is not entirely clear. The Commissioner considers the better view of the law, and the likely intent of Parliament, is that such expenses form part of the cost price of the vehicle, particularly given that they are one-off costs that fall into the “once and for all payments” category (see BP Australia Ltd v FCT (1965) 3 All ER 209) and hence are capital in nature. These fees are intended to make the vehicle able to be used. The remaining fees are annual charges and normal accounting practice would treat them as revenue expenditure, even if they were incurred upon purchase of the vehicle. 12 In summary, the better view is that registration and plate fees are “once and for all” payments, are of a capital nature, make the vehicle able to be used, and are part of the “cost price” of the vehicle. Annual charges (licensing, ACC levy, etc.) are revenue expenditure and not part of the “cost price”. Business accessories Generally, accessories permanently fitted to the motor vehicle are properly to be included as part of the vehicle’s cost. As discussed earlier, accessories, such as stereos, towbars, roofracks, etc., fitted to a vehicle will form part of its cost price. However, some components or equipment fitted to vehicles may be of a purely business nature. The issue arises as to whether such components or equipment should also be included in the “cost price of the vehicle” for FBT purposes. There is no legislative direction on this issue. This may indicate that all accessories, components, or equipment attached to the vehicle form part of its “cost price”. It is arguable, however, that business accessories, components, and equipment fitted to the vehicle should not be treated as forming part of the cost price, where they are required and relate solely to the special business operations for which the vehicle is used, and are in themselves depreciable property for the purposes of the Act, e.g. a two-way radio telephone in a salesperson’s vehicle. Such components or equipment are fitted to the vehicle to facilitate the business use of the vehicle, and may be considered as separate business assets located in the vehicle. Another factor (relevant to this last-mentioned aspect) possibly pointing to the components or equipment as not being part of the cost price, is to consider the nature of the assets and how they are treated by businesses for accounting purposes. For example, it is most likely that components such as two-way radios are accounted for and depreciated separately. The radios can be removed from vehicles, or moved from one vehicle to another, and it seems logical that they be treated as separate assets for depreciation purposes. Note: motor vehicles and radiotelephone equipment are listed separately in Depreciation Determination DEP 1. Two-way radios have their own depreciation rate because they are regarded as assets in their own right and not accessories (to a motor vehicle). They form part of a larger asset, for example, the entire radio telephone network, consisting of radios in vehicles and the central control unit in the employer’s premises. In such circumstances, even though they are a form of accessory or addition to the motor vehicle, they are an asset in their own right and therefore require a separate asset classification. Usually, radio networks are purchased as a package consisting of a number radios (for each vehicle) plus the central control station. To treat the network as part of the cost price of each car would require an apportionment of the overall expense, including installation costs to each vehicle. The Commissioner does not consider this to be a sensible approach. The same could be said of accessories such as roof mounted flashing lights, and electronic monitoring equipment. If these types of assets are added because they are required for and relate solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used, they will be treated similarly to the two-way radio system. 13 Therefore, where business components, such as two-way radios, roof mounted flashing lights, electronic testing or monitoring equipment, etc., are fitted to the vehicle and are paid for by the employer, they do not form part of the “cost price” for FBT purposes. As mentioned earlier, such accessories are business assets of the employer, coming within the definition of “depreciable property” for the purposes of the Act. As previously discussed under the heading “Application of the Legislation”, it was the clear intent of Parliament that the “cost price” for FBT purposes should equal the cost to the employee had the employee purchased the vehicle rather than having it provided by the employer. It follows that if the employee had to pay for the vehicle, the cost to the employee must also include accessories fitted to the vehicle as already discussed. Exceptions are the cost of separately depreciable components or equipment fitted to the vehicle solely to meet the special needs of any business operations for which the vehicle is used. Therefore, the Commissioner considers that business components fitted to the vehicle, which are required for and relate solely to the business operations for which the vehicle is used, and are in themselves depreciable property, should be excluded from the “cost price” of motor vehicles for FBT purposes. This covers assets requiring the vehicle’s power source in order to operate: they are not part of the cost price of the car itself. There may be isolated instances, where the type of business asset mentioned above will unavoidably be used for non-business purposes. The Commissioner considers that any extraordinary and unenvisaged use of the accessory for non-business use over the life of the asset will not in itself negate the purpose of fitting the accessory to be “solely for business purposes” in this context. Cost of non-business accessories Commonly, when a vehicle is purchased the owner asks for certain “extras” or accessories (other than business accessories) to be fitted to the vehicle. If these accessories are not “optioned” (and included in the purchase price), the dealer will charge for their cost and fitting to the vehicle. Such accessories can include: • stereos, towbars, sunroof, roofrack, CNG/LPG conversions, alloy wheels, air- conditioning, electric windows and locking systems, higher specification tyres, etc. Where the vendor charges for any of these accessories, the question arises as to whether they should be added to the “cost price” of the vehicle for FBT purposes. The same issue arises if the accessories are acquired from another person or supplier, or acquired at a later date. Such accessories are of a capital nature and should be added to the vehicles purchase price to arrive at its “cost price”. They are part of the vehicle as a whole and are not 14 generally removed at the time the vehicle is sold or otherwise disposed of. They are either singularly or collectively a “once and for all” payment(s), culminating in the “cost price” of the vehicle that is provided to the employee by the employer for the employee’s “private use and enjoyment”. Under this interpretation, the cost price may vary from period to period, depending on when accessories are added (or in the unlikely or rarer event of an accessory being removed). Therefore, in summary, accessories fitted to a vehicle form part of its “cost price” for FBT purposes (as contemplated in Schedule 2), irrespective of the time they are purchased and fitted to the vehicle. Cost of sign writing or painting the vehicle in the employer’s colours or design It is the Commissioner’s view that costs associated with sign writing and painting the motor vehicle in the employer’s colours, logo, or design are part of the “cost price” of the vehicle for FBT purposes. It was concluded earlier that “cost price” for the purposes of Schedule 2 means something more than the “purchase price” of the motor vehicle. While the cost of sign writing or painting may not add to the value of the motor vehicle, that is not the test. As discussed earlier, the test is the “cost to the employer”, not the “value to the employee”. Some may argue that the costs associated with sign writing and painting the vehicle are primarily of a business nature and should be excluded from the vehicle’s cost price. However, unlike business accessories, the sign writing and painting will generally not be depreciable property and therefore, such costs must be added to the cost of the vehicle. The better view of the law is that the costs are correctly attributable to the vehicle itself and form part of the cost price for FBT purposes. Transporting or freighting the vehicle to its place of use In the above discussion on “cost price”, it is clear that the courts have accepted that the cost of transporting or freighting goods (whether those goods are trading stock or capital assets of the business) to the place where they are to be used is part of the cost of the goods. As mentioned in SSAP 28, the initial cost of fixed assets will include expenditure incurred “to put it (the asset) into the working condition necessary for its intended use”. And in Atlas Copco, “cost is ...associated with getting the purchased item to its current location and condition”. This would include installation costs and freight. The cost of transporting a purchased motor vehicle to the place where it can be used by the taxpayer, is clearly part of its “cost price”, both for FBT and depreciation purposes. For example, the purchase of vehicles direct from a manufacturer or from another source overseas, where the purchaser pays for the cost of transporting the vehicle to New Zealand. It is the Commissioner’s view that these transport costs form part of the “cost price” of the vehicle for FBT purposes. 15 However, these costs only relate to the initial cost of getting the vehicle to the place it will first be used by the employer, after acquisition. Subsequent transport costs of moving the vehicle within New Zealand (say from one branch of the employer’s firm to another) are considered to be part of the normal business operations of the employer and on revenue account. Cost of repairs and maintenance Another issue is the costs of repairs and maintenance of the vehicle and/or accessories, and whether they should be added to the cost price. Generally, repairs and maintenance expenditure on the vehicle or accessories will not increase the vehicle’s “cost price” for FBT purposes. However, if work on the car is more than normal repairs and maintenance, such as replacing the existing motor with one of larger capacity, the question arises whether that alteration will increase the cost price of the vehicle for FBT purposes. If the repair or replacement is considered to be of a revenue nature, and deductible for income tax purposes, the cost price of the vehicle will not increase in value for the calculation of FBT. On the other hand, if the repair or replacement is of a capital nature, the cost price for FBT purposes must be increased by the amount of that capitalisation. Each case will need to be considered on the basis of its own facts applying established capital/revenue distinction rules. If the FBT cost price is increased, the recalculation of FBT (on the increased cost price) will apply from the quarter in which that capital expenditure was incurred. Example 1 Employer A purchases a secondhand motor vehicle as a company car for the use of a salesperson employee. The employee will be travelling long distances, so the employer purchases a CD player and has it fitted to the vehicle. As the employee has the full use of the vehicle for private use and is likely to tow his own trailer from time to time, he asks the employer to purchase and fit a towbar to the vehicle. The employer agrees. The “cost price” of the vehicle for FBT purposes will be the total of the purchase price plus the cost of acquiring and fitting the CD player and the towbar (all costs GST inclusive). Example 2 Employer B is looking for a vehicle to replace an existing vehicle written-off by the firm’s Wellington based accountant. The accountant will be entitled to use the vehicle for private purposes when it is not being used for business purposes. While on a trip to Auckland the employer locates a suitable secondhand car, purchases it, and has it transported to Wellington where the accountant will use it. The “cost price” of the car for FBT purposes will be the purchase price plus the cost of transporting it to Wellington (both costs GST inclusive). Example 3 16 Employer C decides to replace the company’s fleet of cars used by its sales representatives, because of the high cost of maintaining the existing fleet. The sales representatives are permitted to use the vehicles for private use when they are not required for business purposes. Through a contact with a motor vehicle dealer, the company decides to purchase 10 secondhand cars direct from Japan. The employer agrees on a purchase price with a Japanese car dealer and arranges for the vehicles to be shipped to New Zealand. The “cost price” of the vehicles for FBT purposes will be the total of: • the purchase price of the cars, including any costs or commissions paid in Japan or in New Zealand • the cost of transporting the cars to New Zealand • GST and any import or inspection levies payable at the time of importation • the cost of initial registration and licence plate fees, and • the cost of any accessories fitted to the cars at the time of purchase or any time after purchase, either in Japan or in New Zealand. Example 4 Employer D is a forestry contracting firm, and has recently purchased a four-wheel drive motor car for its forestry foreman. The foreman has the full use and enjoyment of the vehicle for private purposes while not working. As with the employer’s other work vehicles, the car is fitted with a radiotelephone used only for communication between the company’s headquarters and its own vehicles. As the radiotelephone is fitted solely for business purposes, and may be considered a separately depreciable business asset located in the vehicle, it does not form part of the cost price of the vehicle for FBT purposes. Example 5 An employee of Employer E is a travelling salesman. When the employer purchased a new vehicle for the employee’s use, a mobile phone kit (mobile phone and car kit) was installed in the car at the employer’s expense. The cost of the mobile phone will be excluded from the cost price of the motor vehicle because it is not “permanently affixed to the vehicle”. Whether use of the mobile phone gives rise to a fringe benefit in its own right must be decided on the facts. Comments on technical submissions received Many comments received in the course of producing this item suggested that the cost of fitted accessories should not be subject to FBT, as they have no inherent benefit for employees. As noted earlier in the ruling commentary, this argument ignores the fact that the statutory test, in the context of motor vehicles, is not the value of the benefit to the employee, but the cost price of the vehicle to the employer. It is considered that the Commissioner’s approach in excluding any such fittings and accessories on the basis of being business assets is arguably a favourable interpretation of the legislation to taxpayers, particularly when compared to the 17 wording in the Australian legislation where such a test has been specifically legislated.
1 DIRECTORS’ FEES AND GST PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 00/11 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections 6(3)(b), 8, and 57(2)(b). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement, occupation, or employment as a director of a company. The engagement may either be by direct contract between the director and the company for whom the person acts as a director, or by a third party appointing, or agreeing to provide, a director to a company. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • If a natural person is engaged as a director and the services are not undertaken as part of carrying on the person’s own taxable activity, the engagement will be excluded from the term “taxable activity” due to the application of section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity: • If a natural person is engaged as a director as part of carrying on his or her taxable activity, the proviso to section 6(3)(b) will apply and the services will be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. If the person is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, the person will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the directorship services: • If a natural person is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company and the person has not accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity: • the engagement of the natural person as a director will be excluded from the term “taxable activity” due to the application of section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity; • the provision by the third party of the services of the natural person director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the third party has not 2 been engaged as a director of a company. If the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that third party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the person’s services as a director of the company: • If a natural person is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company and the engagement is part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity: • the engagement of the natural person director will fall within the proviso to section 6(3)(b) and the services will be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of the taxable activity; • the provision by the third party of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. If the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that third party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the person’s services as a director of the company: • If an employee, as part of his or her employment, is engaged as a director of a third party company by way of a contract between his or her employer and the third party company: • the engagement of the employee will fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso to the section does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on a taxable activity of the employee; • the provision by the employer of the services of a director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the employer is not engaged as a director of a company. If the employer is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that employer will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the employee’s services as a director of the company: • If an employee is engaged by a third party company to be a director of that company, where: the employee is required to account to the employer for the directors fees received; there is no contract between the employer company and the third party company; and where the employee does not undertake the services as part of carrying on his or her own taxable activity: • the engagement as director will be excluded from the term “taxable activity” due to the application of section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity; • if the employer is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, the employer is required to account for GST on the consideration received for the 3 supply of services to the employee, i.e. permitting the employee to be a director. • If a partner in a partnership accepts an engagement as a director of a company as part of the partnership’s business: • the activity of the partner, in accepting the engagement as a director, falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso to the section does not apply as, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership in terms of section 57(2)(b); • the provision by the partnership of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b), as the partnership is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the partner’s services as a director of the company as it is considered to be part of the normal taxable activity of the partnership. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to supplies made within the period 26 October 2000 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 24th day of October 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) 4 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 00/11 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/11 (“the Ruling”). Background Section 6 defines the term “taxable activity” for the purposes of the Act. Under section 6(1), a person conducts a taxable activity when all of the following characteristics are present: • There is some form of activity. • The activity is carried on continuously or regularly. • The activity involves, or is intended to involve, the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. Section 6(3) provides certain exclusions from the term “taxable activity”. Under section 6(3)(b), the activities of a salary and wage earner or of a person in receipt of directors’ fees are excluded from the term. Under the proviso to section 6(3)(b), if a person in carrying on a taxable activity accepts any office, any services supplied by that person in holding that office are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Therefore, if a GST registered sole trader who, in carrying on his or her taxable activity, takes on a company directorship, the proviso applies and GST is chargeable on the directors’ fees paid. Public Information Bulletin (PIB) 164 issued in August 1987 contained an item titled “GST on Directors’ Fees”. The item concerned the circumstances in which directors’ fees did and did not attract GST. The item listed indicators that could be used in identifying the correct GST treatment to be applied to directors’ fees. These indicators were: 1. Directors’ fees paid to directors personally, and retained by them. Not subject to GST – excluded from the meaning of taxable activity by section 6(3)(b). 2. Directors’ fees paid to directors personally, but applied by them to their partnership or business income, where the partnership or business is a registered person. Subject to GST – subject to the proviso to section 6(3)(b). 5 3. Directors’ fees paid directly to director’s partnership or company, where that partnership or company is a registered person. Subject to GST – a normal taxable supply. In July 1988 the Department issued PIB 175 containing, at page 26, a further item “GST on Directors’ Fees”, restricting the policy set down in PIB 164. The item advised that the proviso to section 6(3)(b) applies only to a sole trader, e.g. an accountant (being a registered person) who, in carrying on his or her taxable activity, is appointed a director of a company. The statement said that directors’ fees paid to a partner in a partnership or to a shareholder, director, or employee of another company are not therefore subject to GST. The reason given for this interpretation was that, in terms of the Companies Act 1955, a director could only be a natural person. Therefore, directors’ fees either paid to directors on behalf of their companies or partnerships, or paid direct to the company or partnership for directorship services carried out by their employees or partners, do not attract GST under this policy. Inland Revenue published an interpretation statement in Tax Information Bulletin Volume 8, No.4. (September 1996) on “Tax deductions from directors’ fees paid to GST registered persons”. This interpretation statement is also relevant to the subject matter of this Ruling, even though it deals with tax deductions under the Income Tax Act 1994. The statement says, at page 3, that if an employee is acting as a director of a company on behalf of another company, the directors’ fees paid are for services rendered by the employer company. Regulation 4(2) of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (“the Regulations”) states that payments for work done or services rendered by a company are not withholding payments. Therefore, tax deductions are not required to be made from the payments. Similarly, if a company pays directors’ fees to a partnership account in return for the partner performing partnership services, the fees are business income of the partners and the Commissioner will not require tax deductions to be made under section NC 13 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Therefore, if it is the company or partnership that is providing the services of its employee or partner as a director, the question arises as to whether GST should be charged on these services as they would normally be supplied in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity of the company or partnership. This Ruling replaces the policy items on “GST on Directors’ Fees” contained in PIBs 164 and 175. Legislation The definition of the term “person” is contained in section 2(1) of the Act and states: includes a company, an unincorporated body of persons, a public authority, and a local authority Section 2 also contains the definition of “registered person” being: ... a person who is registered or is liable to be registered under this Act. 6 Section 6 states: (1) For the purposes of this Act, the term “taxable activity” means - (a) Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club: (b) Without limiting the generality of paragraph (a) of this subsection, the activities of any public authority or any local authority. (2) Anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity shall be deemed to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. (3) Notwithstanding anything in subsections (1) and (2) of this section, for the purposes of this Act the term “taxable activity” shall not include, in relation to any person, - (a) Being a natural person, any activity carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (aa) Not being a natural person, any activity which, if it were carried on by a natural person, would be carried on essentially as a private recreational pursuit or hobby; or (b) Any engagement, occupation, or employment under any contract of service or as a director of a company: Provided that where any person, in carrying on any taxable activity, accepts any office, any services supplied by that person as the holder of that office shall be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity; or ... (Emphasis added) Section 8(1), dealing with the imposition of goods and services tax, states: Subject to this Act, a tax, to be known as goods and services tax, shall be charged in accordance with the provisions of this Act at the rate of 12.5 percent on the supply (but not including an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services, on or after the 1st day of October 1986, by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. Section 57, dealing with unincorporated bodies, states: (1) For the purposes of this section - “Body” means an unincorporated body of persons; and includes - (a) A partnership: (b) A joint venture: (c) The trustees of a trust: “Member” means a partner, a joint venturer, a trustee, or a member of any body: “Partnership” and “partner” have the same meanings as in the Partnership Act 1908. (2) Where a body that carries on any taxable activity is registered pursuant to this Act, - (a) The members of that body shall not themselves be registered or liable to be registered under this Act in relation to the carrying on of that taxable activity; and (b) Any supply of goods and services made in the course of carrying on that taxable activity shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to be supplied by that body, and shall be deemed not to be made by any member of that body; and ... (Emphasis added) Section 151(3) of the Companies Act 1993 states: A person that is not a natural person cannot be a director of a company. 7 Application of the Legislation Section 8(1) provides that GST is charged on the supply (but not an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. Therefore, one of the determining features in ascertaining whether there is a liability to account for GST, is the existence of a “taxable activity”. Another determining feature is whether the person is a “registered person”. Section 6(1) defines a “taxable activity” as an activity that is carried on continuously or regularly, and involves or is intended to involve the supply of goods and services to another person for a consideration. The section also includes within the term “taxable activity” the activities of any public or local authority. Under section 6(2), anything done in connection with the commencement or termination of a taxable activity is deemed to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Paragraphs (a), (aa), (b), (c), and (d) of section 6(3) exclude from the term “taxable activity” such activities as hobbies, employment under a contract of service and engagement as a director of a company, certain Government-type and local authority appointments, and the making of exempt supplies. The proviso to paragraph (b) states that if a person, in carrying on a taxable activity, accepts any office, services supplied by that person in holding that office are deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Therefore, if a person is carrying on a taxable activity, and accepts an engagement as a company director in carrying on that taxable activity, the proviso will apply. If it is established that a taxable activity is in existence after applying section 6, the question of whether the person is liable to account for GST will depend on the application of the remaining criteria set down in section 8. One of these criteria is whether the person is a “registered person”, i.e. whether the person is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, which includes whether the taxable activity threshold amount in section 51 has been satisfied. Section 57(2)(b) provides that where a partnership carries on a taxable activity, any supply of goods and services made as part of carrying on that taxable activity are deemed to be supplied by the partnership and not by any of the partners. Section 151(3) of the Companies Act 1993 provides that only a natural person can be a director of a company. 8 The following scenarios illustrate how section 6(3)(b) is applied in respect of a person engaged as a director of a company, i.e. whether a taxable activity is in existence. It is important to note that the Ruling itself deals specifically with section 6(3)(b). If it is established that an activity does not fall within the exclusion from a “taxable activity” set down in that section, the remaining criteria under section 8 must be applied in order to determine the existence of a liability to account for GST. Note that it is the contractual relationship between the parties, founded on a genuine basis, that determines the GST treatment of the relevant transactions (Wilson & Horton v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325). A. Personal capacity A natural person is engaged as a director of a company in that person’s personal capacity and not as part of carrying on any taxable activity. The activity of this person falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) in that it involves a person who is engaged as a director of a company. The activity is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso does not apply, as the person has not accepted the engagement as part of carrying on a taxable activity. B. Carrying on a taxable activity A natural person is engaged as a director of a company as part of carrying on that person’s taxable activity. The activity of this person falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) in that it involves a person who is engaged as a director of a company. The activity is therefore prima facie excluded from the term “taxable activity”. However, as the person has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on a taxable activity, the proviso deems the services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. If the person is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, the person will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the directorship services. C. Person contracted as a company director A natural person is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company. The person is not undertaking the directorship as part of carrying on any taxable activity. The third party invoices the company for its services in providing it with a director. The engagement of the person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as the services are not supplied as part of carrying on the person’s taxable activity. The provision by the third party of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) as the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered 9 for GST, that party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the services of the person as a director of the company. D. Person contracted as a company director in carrying on a taxable activity A natural person, as part of carrying on a taxable activity, is contracted by a third party to take up an engagement as a director of a company. The third party invoices the company for providing the services of the director, who in turn invoices the third party for his or her services. The engagement of the person as a director of a company is prima facie excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). However, as the person has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on his or her taxable activity, the proviso to the section deems the directorship services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of his or her taxable activity. The natural person’s liability for GST will therefore depend on satisfying the remaining requirements of section 8. The provision by the third party of the services of the director does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) as the third party is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the third party is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the person’s directorship services. E. Employee engaged as director An employee of an employer is engaged as a director of a third party company as part of the person’s employment duties. The engagement of this person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as the person has not accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity – the person is merely carrying out his or her employment duties. The provisions of section 6(3)(b) do not apply to the employer who is supplying the services of its employee as the employer is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the employer is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, that party will be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the services of the person as a director of the company. F. Employee required to pay over directors’ fees to employer Sometimes an employee is permitted to accept directorships of third party companies provided the employee accounts to the employer for the fees received. This might occur with family companies. In this type of scenario there would not be a contract between the employer and the third party company. In this situation, the engagement of the person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as the person has not accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity. The employer company, provided it is registered for GST or liable to be registered for GST, will be required to account for GST on the supply of services 10 to the employee. These services could best be described as allowing the employee to undertake directorship duties in work time or permitting the employee to be a director. G. Partner in a partnership engaged as a director A partner in a partnership accepts an engagement as a director of a company as part of the partnership’s business. The engagement of this person as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply as, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership in terms of section 57(2)(b). Therefore, the partner is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. Section 6(3)(b) does not apply in the case of the partnership as the partnership is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership supplies the services of one of its partners to the company as part of its taxable activity. The partnership will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees received for the supply of the partner’s directorship services. Examples Example 1 Taxpayer A, who is not registered for GST, is a partner in a firm of chartered accountants. Company B engages taxpayer A as a director, and pays him fees for his services. Taxpayer A’s appointment as a director is not connected with his involvement in the partnership nor has he accepted the directorship as part of carrying on a taxable activity. He retains the fees, having received them in his personal capacity. Taxpayer A is engaged as a director of a company, an activity that is excluded from the term “taxable activity” by section 6(3)(b). The proviso to the section does not apply, as taxpayer A is not providing directorship services as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Taxpayer A is not required to account for GST on the fees received for directorship services. Example 2 Taxpayer B is a human resources consultant in business on her own. She is registered for GST. She accepts a company directorship as part of carrying on her taxable activity, and receives fees for her services. Taxpayer B’s engagement as a director is prima facie excluded from the term “taxable activity” in terms of section 6(3)(b). However, as she has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on her taxable activity, the proviso to the section deems the directorship services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of her taxable activity. She should therefore account for GST on the fees she is paid. 11 Example 3 A GST-registered financial management company supplies the services of one of its specialist employees as a director of another company. Directors’ fees are paid to the company for the services provided. The engagement of the employee as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the employee has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Therefore, the employee is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. Section 6(3)(b) does not apply to the activity of the management company as that company is not engaged as a company director. The fees are paid in consideration of the management company providing the services of one of its employees to the other company. This is a supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity of the management company and that company will be required to account for GST on the fees received for this supply. Example 4 A partner of a GST-registered legal partnership is elected on to the board of directors of a client company as a representative of the partnership. The partnership is providing legal advice to the company, which in turn pays fees into the partnership’s account. The engagement of the partner as a director of a company falls within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) and is therefore excluded from the term “taxable activity”. The proviso to the section does not apply as, although the partner may be carrying on the taxable activity of the partnership, the services are deemed to be supplied by the partnership in terms of section 57(2)(b). Therefore, the partner is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. The provisions of section 6(3)(b) do not apply to the partnership as it is not engaged as a director of a company. The partnership will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees it receives from the company. Example 5 A GST-registered accountant in business on his own is contracted by a consulting firm to take up an engagement as a director of a company with the object of monitoring the company’s financial systems. The engagement of the accountant as a director of a company is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). However, as the person has accepted the engagement as part of carrying on his taxable activity, the proviso to the section deems the directorship services to be supplied in the course or furtherance of his taxable activity. The accountant will therefore be required to account for GST on the fees he receives in respect of these services. The provision by the consulting firm of the services of the accountant does not fall within the provisions of section 6(3)(b) as the firm is not engaged as a director of a company. Provided the consulting firm is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, it will be required to account 12 for GST on the fees received for the supply of the directorship services of the accountant. Example 6 Company A agrees to one of its employees taking up a directorship position with Company X on the proviso that the employee hands over the directors’ fees payable to the employee by Company X. There is no contract between Company A and Company X. The engagement of the employee as a director is excluded from the term “taxable activity” under section 6(3)(b). The proviso does not apply as the employee has not accepted the office as part of carrying on a taxable activity. Therefore, the employee is not required to account for GST on the supply of the directorship services. If Company A is registered for GST or is liable to be registered for GST, it is required to account for GST on the supply of services, i.e. permitting the employee to be a director of Company X.
1 LEASE SURRENDER PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY A LANDLORD – INCOME TAX TREATMENT Note (not part of ruling): The issue dealt with in this Ruling was covered by Public Rulings BR Pub 97/1 and 97/1A, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 1 (January 1997). The Ruling has been amended to allow for an exception where the surrender of the lease constitutes the surrender of a significant structural asset of the landlord’s business and thus the surrender payment received is a capital amount. In addition, the Ruling clarifies that it only applies to landlords in the business of leasing. The period of application of the Ruling is from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2005. BR Pub 97/1 applied from 1 March 1997 to 30 September 1997 and BR Pub 97/1A from 1 March 1997 to 31 March 2000. PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 00/12 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 3 and CE 1(1)(e). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord from a tenant when the landlord, who is in the business of leasing property, agrees to accept the early termination of the lease. For the purposes of this Ruling, and for the avoidance of doubt, the term “business of leasing” has the same meaning as the term “business of renting”, and means the business of letting property for a rent. The business of leasing property need not be the sole activity or the principal activity of the person. However, the activity must be sufficient, of itself, to amount to a business. This Ruling applies only in respect of landlords in the business of leasing. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • A lease surrender payment received by a landlord in the business of leasing property is gross income as an amount derived from any business. • A lease surrender payment received by a landlord in the business of leasing property may not be gross income as an amount derived from any business if the surrender of the lease is of such significance to the business that it constitutes the loss of a structural asset and the payment is thereby a capital amount. This will be a question of fact and degree to be determined in the particular circumstances of each case. 2 • A lease surrender payment is not gross income under section CE 1(1)(e). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received by such a landlord between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18th day of December 2000. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 00/12 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 00/12 (“the Ruling”). Background The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Rulings BR Pub 97/1 and 97/1A (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 1 (January 1997). The Ruling has been amended to allow for an exception where the surrender of the lease constitutes the surrender of a significant structural asset of the landlord’s business and thus the surrender payment received is a capital amount. The Ruling sets out the tax treatment of lease surrender payments received by a landlord who is in the business of leasing. The Ruling does not apply if the landlord is not in the business of leasing. However, it is to be noted that the fact that a landlord is not in the business of leasing, and is therefore not covered by the Ruling, does not automatically mean that any lease surrender payment received will not be gross income of that landlord. Legislation Under section CD 3, the gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. Section CE 1(1)(e) includes within a person’s gross income: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. Application of the Legislation From any business Under section CD 3, the gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. In the Court of Appeal decision in CIR v City Motor Service Limited; CIR v Napier Motors Limited \[1969\] NZLR 1,010, Turner J considered what was meant by the words “from any business” in a predecessor provision. His Honour stated (at pages 1,017-1,018): I think perhaps I do no more than reach his conclusion using other words when I say that in my opinion in the words “from the business” of the company something more is meant than merely “as a result of the fact that the company was carrying on this business”. I think that from the business must mean from the current operations of the business. The distinction between capital accretions and revenue operations runs all through the law of income tax. ... and remembering that “Income Tax is always a tax on Income” I conclude without difficulty that the words “from any business” in an Income Tax Act must mean “from the current operations of any 4 business” and no more. They are not, in my opinion, apt to include accretions to the capital assets of the taxpayer which, although they may result from the fact of this carrying on business, yet do not arise from the actual current operations of that business.” His Honour went on to consider the decision of the majority of the High Court of Australia in Dickenson v FCT (1958) 98 CLR 460, and then concluded (at page 1,019): But income tax being “always a tax on income”, the crucial question in New Zealand must therefore in result be the same as that in Australia. Is the receipt income or capital? If it is gains or profits from a business, then the question reduces itself to whether these were derived from the current operations of the business, and therefore income, or whether no more can be contended, as regards their connection with the business, than that without the existence of the business they would not have accrued. If no more than this last can be proved, the gains cannot be assessable income, and simply because they are not derived from the current operations of the business. Thus, if a receipt is an amount from a business, it is necessary only to consider whether or not that amount was derived from the current operations of the business in order to determine whether it is within the words “from any business” in section CD 3, i.e. a revenue amount rather than a capital amount. Richardson J summarised it succinctly when delivering the Court of Appeal judgment in AA Finance Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,383 at 11,391 as follows: Whether gains produced in a business are revenue or capital depends on the nature of the business and the relationship of the transactions producing the gain to the conduct of the business. ... A transaction may be part of the ordinary business of the taxpayer or, short of that, an ordinary incident of the business activity of the taxpayer although not its main activity. A gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on the business is thus stamped with an income character. Sometimes the amount will not arise from the ordinary course of carrying on a business. The classic statement covering such situations is that of the Lord Justice Clerk in Californian Copper Syndicate Ltd (Limited and Reduced) v Harris (Surveyor of Taxes) (1904) 5 TC 159 at 165-166: It is quite a well settled principle in dealing with questions of assessment of Income Tax, that where the owner of an ordinary investment chooses to realise it, and obtains a greater price for it than he originally acquired it at, the enhanced price is not profit in the sense of Schedule D of the Income Tax Act of 1842 assessable to Income Tax. But it is equally well established that enhanced values obtained from realisation or conversion of securities may be so assessable, where what is done is not merely a realisation or change of investment, but an act done in what is truly the carrying on, or carrying out, of a business. ... ... What is the line which separates the two classes of cases may be difficult to define, and each case must be considered according to its facts; the question to be determined being – Is the sum of gain that has been made a mere enhancement of value by realising a security, or is it a gain made in an operation of business carrying out a scheme for profit-making? The Californian Copper decision related to profits or gains made outside the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business. The New Zealand Court of Appeal confirmed this in its decision in Wattie & Anor v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,297, when rejecting the argument that the High Court of Australia decision in FCT v The Myer Emporium Ltd (1987) 87 ATC 4,363 had extended the categories of profit or gain that are treated as revenue amounts. 5 The Court of Appeal considered the following oft-quoted extract from Myer: Although it is well settled that a profit or gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on a business constitutes income, it does not follow that a profit or gain made in a transaction entered into otherwise than in the ordinary course of carrying on the taxpayer’s business is not income. Because a business is carried on with a view to a profit, a gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on the business is invested with the profit-making purpose, thereby stamping the profit with the character of income. But a gain made otherwise than in the ordinary course of carrying on the business which nevertheless arises from a transaction entered into by the taxpayer with the intention or purpose of making a profit or gain may well constitute income. Whether it does depends very much on the circumstances of the case. Generally speaking, however, it may be said that if the circumstances are such as to give rise to the inference that the taxpayer’s intention or purpose in entering into the transaction was to make a profit or gain, the profit or gain will be income, notwithstanding that the transaction was extraordinary judged by reference to the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business. Nor does the fact that a profit or gain is made as the result of an isolated venture or a “one-off” transaction preclude it from being properly characterized as income ... . The authorities establish that a profit or gain so made will constitute income if the property generating the profit or gain was acquired in a business operation or commercial transaction for the purpose of profit-making by the means giving rise to the profit. The Court of Appeal in Wattie then continued: Immediately afterwards the Court referred to the decision in Californian Copper Syndicate Ltd v Harris (Surveyor of Taxes), (1904) 5 TC 159 as making the point. But that is simply the classic example of the well recognised assessability of a profit derived from an adventure in the nature of trade or, as it is put in a passage then quoted from Californian Copper, “a gain made in an operation of business in carrying out a scheme for profit making”. At p211 the High Court observed that the important proposition to be derived from Californian Copper Syndicate: “... is that a receipt may constitute income, if it arises from an isolated business operation or commercial transaction entered into otherwise than in the ordinary course of the carrying on of the taxpayer’s business, so long as the taxpayer entered into the transaction with the intention or purpose of making a relevant profit or gain from the transaction.” That seems to be a description of an adventure in the nature of trade, a description well able to be applied to what occurred in Myer itself. A gain from an adventure deliberately entered into with a view to the profit, though perhaps unprecedented for the taxpayer, will constitute income. It is a profit- making scheme. The profit is income in accordance with ordinary concepts. Although the decision in Wattie was appealed to the Privy Council ((1998) 18 NZTC 1,991), counsel accepted the Court of Appeal’s interpretation of Myer as contemplating a profit arising from what is commonly referred to as an adventure in the nature of trade, of the kind illustrated by the decision in Californian Copper. In circumstances where profits or gains are made outside the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business, it is necessary to consider whether such a profit or gain is of a revenue or capital nature. If the gain is made by way of the mere realisation of a capital asset, it will be a capital amount. However, if the gain is made by way of what has become known as “an adventure in the nature of trade”, the gain will be a revenue amount. In summary, therefore, the following statements can be made: 6 • An amount arising in the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business will automatically be treated as having a profit-making purpose and will thus be a revenue amount. • Similarly, an amount arising as an ordinary incident of a taxpayer’s business activity will be a revenue amount. • An amount arising outside the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business will be a revenue amount if it arises from a business operation or commercial transaction with a profit-making purpose, e.g. an adventure in the nature of trade. • An amount arising outside the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business will be a capital amount if it arises from the mere realisation of a capital asset, or if the amount is received in circumstances in which it is not possible to find a measurable profit or gain. The critical question in the present case, therefore, is whether the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord in the business of leasing is a receipt arising in the ordinary course of the landlord’s business or as an ordinary incident of that business activity. Ordinary incident of the business activity of leasing? In the Commissioner’s opinion, the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord is an ordinary incident of the business activity of leasing. The only exception to this is if the surrender payment is received in respect of a lease which is of such significance to the business that it constitutes a structural asset. This will be a question of fact in the particular circumstances of each case. No New Zealand authorities on the taxability of a lease surrender payment received by a landlord exist, and there are very few overseas authorities on this issue. The New Zealand Court of Appeal did consider a lease surrender payment in CIR v McKenzies New Zealand Limited (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233. However, this decision concerned the deductibility for a lessee of a lease surrender payment paid to a lessor. While the decision is considered to be good authority in relation to the deductibility of a lease surrender payment for a lessee, the comments made by the Court in that context cannot automatically be applied to the question of the assessability of such a payment to a lessor. The character of a payment for assessability and deductibility purposes has to be tested in the hands of the particular taxpayer. In the United Kingdom case of Greyhound Racing Association (Liverpool) Ltd v Cooper (1936) 20 TC 373, a lease surrender payment received by a lessor from a lessee was held to be assessable. However, the lessor in that case was not in the business of leasing and the decision was therefore based on different grounds to those discussed in this Ruling. On the facts of that case the Court concluded that the payment was a revenue payment, because it was nothing more than a lump sum payment in place of future rents. In the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision in Case U99 (1987) 87 ATC 602, the Tribunal concluded that a lease surrender payment received by a lessor was a capital amount and not assessable to the lessor. In view of the other authorities discussed in this Ruling, this case is not considered good authority in New Zealand. 7 However, the significant point in relation to the Ruling is that once again the lessor was not in the business of leasing, and the case is therefore of little relevance in the present situation. A Canadian decision that does have greater relevance is the decision in Monart Corporation v Minister of National Revenue \[1967\] CTC 263. The taxpayer in that case owned a large office building. One of its tenants, occupying one-tenth of the leased floor area of the building, gave notice that it was going to vacate and the taxpayer accepted $75,000 to cancel the lease for the remaining six years of its term. The Court concluded that the sum of $75,000 paid to the taxpayer was in lieu of future rent and was also in the nature of profit derived from a property or business of the taxpayer. It was therefore assessable to the taxpayer. Although Canadian and New Zealand law differs on the characterisation of a lease asset, for present purposes it is relevant to note that Dumoulin J in Monart Corporation stated that the taxpayer corporation’s, “raison d’être, and sole pursuit, consist in the business of renting office accommodation”. His Honour then went on to expressly accept the submission of counsel for the respondent that (at page 271): ... the amount received by the Appellant was paid to it for damages suffered or to be suffered as the result of the premature termination of the lease, and that the termination can be considered as a normal incident in the activities of a landlord renting properties. Some guidance on the question of whether a lease surrender payment is a capital or revenue receipt may also be gained from considering cases concerning compensation for termination of agency contracts. An analogy can be drawn between receiving a lease surrender payment (compensation for terminating a lease) and receiving compensation for termination of an agency contract. In Kelsall Parsons & Co. v Commissioners of Inland Revenue (1938) 21 TC 608, the taxpayers carried on business as commission agents for the sale in Scotland of the products of various manufacturers, and entered agency agreements for that purpose. One particular agency was cancelled and the taxpayers were paid £1,500 in compensation. The taxpayers claimed it was a capital amount, whereas the Commissioners claimed it was a revenue amount. The Court upheld the Commissioners’ view. The Lord President, Lord Normand, stated (at pages 619-620): The sum which the Appellants received was, as the Commissioners have found, paid as compensation for the cancellation of the agency contract. That was a contract incidental to the normal course of the Appellants’ business. Their business, indeed, was to obtain as many contracts of this kind as they could, and their profits were gained by rendering services in fulfilment of such contracts. ... It was a normal incident of a business such as that of the Appellants that the contracts might be modified, altered or discharged from time to time, and it was quite normal that the business carried on by the Appellants should be adjustable to variations in the number and importance of the agencies held by them, and to modifications of the agency agreements, including modifications of their duration, which might be made from time to time. ... In parting with the benefit of the contract, moreover, the Appellants were not parting with something which could be described as an enduring asset of the business. The contract would have been terminated in any event as at the 30th September, 1935. 8 In Commissioners of Inland Revenue v Fleming & Co (Machinery) Ltd (1951) 33 TC 57, the taxpayer company carried on the business of agents and merchants for the sale of machinery and explosives; the agency work greatly predominating. In 1948 one of its agencies was cancelled and the company received a sum in compensation. The Court of Session (First Division) held that the sum was a revenue receipt. The Lord President, Lord Cooper, noted (at page 61) that the issue belonged to a type exemplified by a number of earlier cases in which, broadly speaking, the line had been drawn between: ... (a) the cancellation of a contract which affects the profit-making structure of the recipient of compensation and involves the loss by him of an enduring trading asset; and (b) the cancellation of a contract which does not affect the recipient’s trading structure nor deprive him of any enduring trading asset, but leaves him free to devote his energies and organisation released by the cancellation of the contract to replacing the contract which has been lost by other like contracts. Lord Russell explained this distinction further (at page 63): When the rights and advantages surrendered on cancellation are such as to destroy or materially to cripple the whole structure of the recipient’s profit-making apparatus, involving the serious dislocation of the normal commercial organisation, and resulting perhaps in the cutting down of the staff previously required, the recipient of the compensation may properly affirm that the compensation represents the price paid for the loss or sterilisation of a capital asset and is therefore a capital and not a revenue receipt. ... On the other hand when the benefit surrendered on cancellation does not represent the loss of an enduring asset in circumstances such as those above mentioned – where for example the structure of the recipient’s business is so fashioned as to absorb the shock as one of the normal incidents to be looked for and where it appears that the compensation received is no more than a surrogatum for the future profits surrendered – the compensation received is in use to be treated as a revenue receipt and not a capital receipt. It was held that the company’s main business consisted of acquiring agencies, and the diminution or increase in the number of agencies (whether prior to the due date of expiration or not) could be regarded as a normal incident of its business. The structure of the company’s business was not affected. The sum received had to be regarded as compensation for loss of profits and not for loss of a profit earning asset. In Wiseburgh v Domville (Inspector of Taxes) \[1956\] 1 All ER 754 (CA), the taxpayer was a manufacturers’ agent. One agency was determined by the principals without the required notice, and the taxpayer suffered a serious reduction in his earnings. The taxpayer brought an action for damages for breach of the contract and for commission due up to the breach. The action was settled and the taxpayer received £4,000, expressed to be damages for the breach of agreement and costs; the claim for commission having been abandoned. Lord Evershed MR noted that at the time the agency was terminated the taxpayer held only two agencies, although he had held a varying number of agencies during his time as an agent. It was also noted that, “the effect of the loss of this contract, quoad the taxpayer’s agency business, was very substantially to depreciate his earnings”. Nevertheless, his Lordship stated (at pages 758-759): Here, the taxpayer has been carrying on a business which for thirteen years has shown variations in the actual agreements which it has comprehended. The business has suffered something perhaps of a 9 disaster by reason of this quarrel with a valuable customer. But, beyond that, it seems to me it is not right to say that the taxpayer had his undertaking as a sales agent partially destroyed or taken away. ... Harman J., said (\[1955\] 3 All ER at p.551): “The taxpayer was a manufacturers’ agent. He had other agencies from time to time and carried on business as an agent, and one of the incidents of such businesses is that one agency may be stopped and another begun. The fact that an agency was a key agency, and was therefore important to him and represented half of his income, seems to me to be irrelevant.” With the possible exception of substituting “inconclusive” for “irrelevant”, I agree entirely with that statement; and I agree with what the judge said later (ibid.): “... it was a normal incident in this kind of business that an agency should come to an end, and it seems to me that the compensation paid is quite clearly income.” The case of Van den Berghs Ltd v Clark (Inspector of Taxes) \[1935\] All ER 874 concerned payments made under agreements entered between competitor companies (both margarine manufacturers) for the sharing of profits and losses and the regulation of their activities. Following a dispute under the agreements, the taxpayer received a payment of £450,000 as “damages” and in consideration of the termination of the agreements. The House of Lords held that the payment was a capital receipt. Lord MacMillan discussed the case of Atherton v The British Insulated & Helsby Cables Ltd \[1926\] AC 213 and then proceeded to consider the facts before him. He considered that it was important to bear in mind that the taxpayer’s trade was to manufacture and deal in margarine. The payment received was in consideration for the taxpayer giving up its rights under the agreements for the following 13 years. Lord MacMillan said (at page 888) that these agreements: ... were not ordinary commercial contracts made in the course of carrying on their trade; they were not contracts for the disposal of their products or for the engagement of agents or other employees necessary for the conduct of their business; nor were they merely agreements as to how their trading profits, when earned, should be distributed as between the contracting parties. On the contrary, the cancelled agreements related to the whole structure of the appellants’ profit-making apparatus. They regulated the appellants’ activities, defined what they might and what they might not do, and affected the whole conduct of their business. I have difficulty in seeing how money laid out to secure, or money received for the cancellation of, so fundamental an organisation of a trader’s activities can be regarded as an income disbursement or an income receipt. ... In the present case, however, it is not the largeness of the sum that is important but the nature of the asset that was surrendered. In my opinion that asset, the congeries of rights which the appellants enjoyed under the agreements and which, for a price they surrendered, was a capital asset. In Barr, Crombie & Co Ltd v CIR (1945) 26 TC 406, from the formation of a shipping company in 1924, the appellant company managed its ships under certain agreements, the latest of which provided that the appellant company should continue to act as managers for the shipping company for 15 years from 1 January 1936. A clause in the contract provided that if the second company went into liquidation or ceased to trade, then the remuneration owing to the appellant from that day until the date on which it was due to expire would become immediately payable to the appellant. In 1942 this occurred and the appellant received the amount due. The Lord President (Normand) found that the appellant’s business had consisted almost entirely of the agency. For the previous 16 years it had contributed about 84% 10 of the appellant’s income. Upon liquidation of the other company, it lost almost its entire business. Despite the fact that the sum payable was calculated by reference to what the appellant would have received had the company not gone into liquidation, the Lord President found that the sum received was a capital amount. He quoted Lord Buckmaster in the case of Glenboig Union Fireclay Co Ltd v CIR (1922) 12 TC 427 at page 464 where he said: ... although annual payments in the nature of profits may be used as the measure by which to calculate the sum which is to be paid, the resultant sum is not thereby made itself an annual payment or a profit. His Lordship distinguished the case of Kelsall Parsons & Co (above). He regarded the payment before him as being “once and for all”, i.e. the price of the surrender of its only important capital asset. In contrast, in Kelsall, the payment was in return for the loss of a single agency contract out of about a dozen, and the fact that the payment in that case did not represent the whole capital asset of the company was shown by the fact that the next year its profits were no less than they had been before. Another contrasting feature was that in that case there was a single payment for the surrender of profits over one year, as opposed to a payment for the surrender of an agreement while there was still a substantial period to run. Lord President Normand considered the case analogous to Van den Berghs in that the structure of the company was radically affected and its whole character as a business decisively altered. He said: ... where you have a payment for the loss of the contract upon which the whole trade of the Company has been built, where the expected profits of the contract are used to measure the loss of them for a period of future years, and where in consequence of the loss the Company’s structure and character are greatly affected, the payment seems to me to be beyond doubt a capital payment. The leading case in New Zealand, regarding the characterisation of a payment received for cancellation of a contract, is the Court of Appeal judgment of CIR v Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Australasia) Ltd (1992) 14 NZTC 9,101. That case involved the receipt by the taxpayer of $2.25m as consideration for the variation and partial surrender of its rights under a long-term supply contract. The issue was how to characterise the receipt in the hands of the recipient. The Court of Appeal stated that the crucial consideration in the case was whether, on the facts, the 1972 supply and marketing contract was to be characterised as providing an advantage for the enduring benefit of Borthwick’s trade and as forming part of the structure of Borthwick’s marketing operations. The Court of Appeal rejected the Commissioner’s argument that in deciding this issue Justice Gallen had placed too much emphasis on the duration of the marketing rights and too little on its limited impact on the taxpayer’s business as a whole. In applying what it described as being the leading case in which a contract was held to be a structural asset, Van den Berghs Ltd v Clark \[1935\] AC 431, the Court of Appeal stated that “whether a supply and agency contract is structural or revenue turns on the nature and significance of the contract in the operations of the business” (at page 9,105). The Court confirmed that duration, arguably over business share, is significant. Applying the observations of Lord Pearce in BP Australia Ltd v C of T \[1966\] AC 224, the longer the duration, the greater the indication that a structural 11 solution is being sought. The Court, deciding the sum was capital, found on the facts that: • The marketing agreement assured the taxpayer of a long-term source of supply of produce for its marketing business. • The supply of produce replaced the previously held capital asset, i.e. the freezing works, and in that way the agreement was then the framework for making profits from the South Island. • Globally the agreement was of major significance to the taxpayer’s business, i.e. 40% increase in share of NZ lamb kill. • The size of the payment indicated the value and importance of the agreement to the business. An analogy can be drawn between the receipt of compensation for the termination of a contract, and the receipt of a lease surrender payment on the termination of a lease. In general, it is a normal incident of the business of leasing that leases might be modified, altered, or surrendered from time to time and it is quite normal that such a business should be able to take into account such modifications, alterations, or surrenders. In addition, in most cases, in accepting the surrender of a lease, a landlord is not parting with an enduring asset of the business because, as in the case of an agency contract, the lease would have been terminated at some point in the future in any event. The termination of a lease will not generally affect the profit-making structure of a landlord’s business, neither will it involve the loss of an enduring trading asset. In most cases the structure of a landlord’s business is such that it is fashioned to absorb the shock of the termination of a lease as one of the normal incidents of the business. The landlord is left free to devote energy and organisation to replacing the lost lease with a new lease. However, in certain circumstances the surrender of a lease may constitute the loss of an enduring asset of the business and the receipt of a lease surrender payment by the landlord may be a capital amount. This will be a question of fact in any particular case. The cases discussed above indicate that the following principles will apply: • The nature and significance of the lease to the landlord’s business will be crucial. • In determining the significance of a lease, the length of the lease and the size of the payment will be relevant. • If the lease constitutes the whole structure of the profit-making apparatus, the receipt may be on capital account. • If the landlord has several leases as part of its business structure and the receipt relates to only one of them, the general rule is that the receipt will not relate to the 12 capital structure. However, this general rule may not apply if the one lease out of several constitutes a significant part of the business. • The method of calculation of the sum payable is not determinative. It is to be noted, in this regard, that if the facts of a situation suggest that a taxpayer has structured its, or its group’s, affairs in a particular way for the purpose or effect of converting a revenue receipt into a capital receipt, the Commissioner may consider the application of the anti-avoidance provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. Conclusion The receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord in the business of leasing is a normal incident of that business. Such a receipt will therefore constitute gross income within section CD 3 as an amount derived from any business. The only exception to this is where the surrender payment is received in respect of a lease that is of such significance to the landlord’s business that it constitutes a structural asset. This will be a question of fact in the particular circumstances of each case. Although the Ruling deals only with the receipt of a lease surrender payment by a landlord in the business of leasing, it should be noted that the fact that a lease surrender payment is received by a landlord who is not in the business of leasing will not automatically exclude that payment from the landlord’s gross income. It will still be necessary to consider whether the payment is to be included as a revenue amount on some other basis, such as on the basis that the amount arose from an adventure in the nature of trade. Equally, the receipt could be a normal incident of some other business activity of the recipient and thus a revenue receipt. Example 1 Landlord A owns a number of commercial properties, and is in the business of leasing them. She leases one building to Tenant. Landlord A and Tenant execute a lease for 15 years at a rental of $50,000 per annum: the rental being reviewable every five years. The lease provides for one right of renewal for a further 15-year period. Five years into the lease Tenant’s business outgrows Landlord A’s building. Tenant moves the business to another property. Tenant offers to pay Landlord A $200,000 if she will accept a surrender of the lease by Tenant and the cancellation of all Tenant’s obligations under the lease. Landlord A agrees, the lease is cancelled, and Tenant pays Landlord A the $200,000. Under section CD 3, the amount is gross income of Landlord A. Example 2 Landlord Z is a company and is the landlord of a commercial property that was purpose built for a particular tenant. The management of the leasing arrangements takes considerable time and effort and is carried out solely by Landlord Z, which has no other business activities. The lease was for 50 years and has 30 years still to run. 13 The building is now in an unfashionable area and the tenant has to move to survive. There is no possibility of securing a further tenant. The tenant negotiates a lease surrender payment with Landlord Z. Landlord Z is in the business of leasing and is therefore subject to the Ruling. However, the surrender payment is in respect of a significant asset of the Landlord’s business and affects the profit-making structure of the business. The business is not fashioned to absorb the shock of the termination of the lease as a normal incident and neither can a new lease be found. The surrender payment received by Landlord Z will be a capital amount. Section CE 1(1)(e) Section CE 1(1)(e) potentially applies to a lease surrender payment. That section includes within the landowner’s gross income, “premiums or other revenues” derived by a land owner “from any lease”. The words “premiums or other revenues” are potentially wide enough to include a lease surrender payment. However, in the Commissioner’s view, the words “from any lease” imply that the premiums or other revenues arise from a lease that will continue in existence after the payment is made. The words do not cover a situation where the lease is terminated on payment of the surrender payment. Accordingly, section CE 1(1)(e) does not apply. Support for this view is contained in obiter dicta of Richardson J in CIR v McKenzies NZ Ltd (1988) 10 NZTC 5,233 at 5,235, where His Honour said that premiums paid or received on the surrender of a lease were not dealt with in a predecessor section to section CE 1(1)(e). When a landlord’s activity amounts to a business The leading case on the test and criteria for whether a business exists is Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682. In Grieve, Richardson J noted there were two factors in deciding if there was a business: first, whether the taxpayer had an intention to make a profit; second, the nature of the activities carried on. He went on to set out the following factors relevant to the inquiry as to whether a taxpayer is in business: • The nature of the taxpayer’s activities. • The period over which the taxpayer engages in the activity. • The scope of the taxpayer’s operations. • The volume of transactions undertaken. • The commitment of time, money, and effort by the taxpayer. • The pattern of activity. • The financial results achieved by the activity. Ultimately, whether a landlord is in business is a question of fact. In seeking to determine whether a landlord is in business, the Commissioner uses the criteria identified above from the Grieve decision. More recently the question of whether a business existed or not arose in Slater v CIR (1996) 17 NZTC 12,453. The High Court examined, discussed, and approved Grieve and the tests proposed in that case. 14 A taxpayer who is in doubt as to whether or not a leasing activity amounts to a business should contact a tax adviser or Inland Revenue. Case law on whether a landlord’s leasing activity amounts to a business A number of cases consider whether the leasing of property for rents amounts to a business. In L D Nathan Group Properties Ltd v CIR (1980) 4 NZTC 61,602, the taxpayer was the property owning subsidiary of the group. Davison CJ said that the deriving of rents by a company such as the taxpayer was income from a business. This confirms the approach in Smith v Anderson (1880) 15 Ch D 258, CIT v Hanover Agencies Limited \[1967\] 1 All ER 954 (PC), and American Leaf Blending Co Sdn Bhd v Director-General of Inland Revenue \[1978\] 3 All ER 1185 (PC) that companies involved in leasing will readily be held to be in the business of property leasing. However, this classification is not limited to company taxpayers. For example, in Case F111 (1984) 6 NZTC 60,094 the taxpayer owned two houses and a block of five flats. She collected the rents, interviewed tenants and did some of the maintenance and repair work. The TRA was of the view that the taxpayer was in business as a landlord. From these cases, it would appear that leasing a number of buildings is likely to mean the taxpayer is in the business of property leasing. Leasing only one building can also mean the taxpayer is in the business of property leasing, if the requirements of the building mean the landlord is actively and regularly involved with the property (e.g. negotiating new leases, maintenance, renovations, etc.). It is also possible that leasing a single building will not mean the landlord is in the business of property leasing (e.g. when the landlord does not need to have much involvement with the day to day running of the property, or when new lessees, maintenance, or renovation work are rare). It is interesting to note that the cases suggest that the business threshold is lower when the landlord is a company than when the landlord is an individual or individuals. Two Australian cases discussed below found the renting of property did not amount to a business. To the extent that these cases are inconsistent with the cases discussed above they should be ignored, as the above authorities, being Privy Council and New Zealand High Court and TRA cases, are more persuasive authorities in a New Zealand court. In Case 24 (1944) 11 TBRD 85, the taxpayer owned three properties returning rental income of over £10,000. The taxpayer employed a manager who collected and banked rents, attended to repairs and supervised them, and controlled the caretaker and cleaners. However, the taxpayer personally carried out the management of his rent-producing properties and directed policy; attending to the financial arrangements and making decisions regarding repairs. He employed an accountant to prepare accounts. The Board of Review (in a 2-1 decision) found that the taxpayer did not have a business of renting property. In light of subsequent case law, particularly Case F111, this decision is unlikely to be persuasive authority in New Zealand. 15 In Kennedy Holdings & Property Management Pty Ltd v FCT 92 ATC 4,918, the taxpayer co-owned a building that it rented out. It paid its lessee a sum of money to surrender the lease and sought to deduct the sum. The deduction was denied by the Commissioner, and the Federal Court (NSW) upheld the Commissioner’s assessment. The Court found the taxpayer was not carrying on a business. At page 4,921 Hill J said: It cannot be said on the evidence of the present case that the applicant is, for purposes relevant to s.51(1), carrying on a business. The applicant and its co-owner own one property which they lease out and from which they derive rental income. The freehold held in co-ownership is, in such circumstances, the income producing entity, structure or organisation for the earning of the rental income of the co-owners. The freehold is the profit-making structure. Again, there must be some doubt as to the persuasiveness of this case in New Zealand. However, it may be seen as an example of a company owning one building and not needing to undertake much effort in its management, and therefore not being in the business of renting property. Example 3 Landlord B is retired and owns two properties: a family home, and another house rented to an architect for use as an office. The rent is direct credited to Landlord B’s bank account. Landlord B has no day to day involvement with the tenant or the building, and only very rarely needs to arrange for repairs and maintenance to be carried out. The tenant has tenanted the building for five years, and has a further five- year lease over the building. In terms of the Grieve tests, the scope of Landlord B’s operations, the volume of transactions undertaken, the commitment of time, money, and effort by the taxpayer, the pattern of the activity, and so on, all suggest that her renting does not amount to a business. Example 4 Landlord C is in full-time employment, but also owns six houses that he rents out to tenants. Prior to renting out a house, Landlord C totally renovates it. Thereafter, Landlord C carries out any repairs that may be required. He undertakes advertising for new tenants, collection of rents, and associated duties. Landlord C is in the business of renting on the strength of both Case F111 and the Grieve test. Unlike Landlord B above, the nature of Landlord C’s activities, the scope of the operations, the volume of transactions undertaken, and the commitment of time, money, and effort all suggest a business exists.
GST - WHEN THE SUPPLY OF LEASEHOLD LAND IS AN EXEMPT SUPPLY PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 01/01 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law This ruling applies in respect of section 14(1)(ca) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Arrangement to which this ruling applies This ruling applies to the supply of leasehold land, in exchange for rent, by a registered person. This ruling applies to what are generally referred to as ground leases, where the lease or rental payable under the terms of the lease relate solely to the use of land. The ruling does not apply to any leases of land together with improvements associated with that land. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The taxation law applies to the arrangement in the following manner. In respect of the supply of leasehold land by way of rental:  Where the leasehold land that is the subject of the supply is only used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, the supply is exempt from GST;  Where the leasehold land that is the subject of the supply is not used, to any degree, for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, the supply is not exempt from GST;  Where the leasehold land that is the subject of the supply is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land and for another use, the supply is exempt from GST to the extent that the leasehold land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, irrespective of whether the predominant use of the land is for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land;  Where the leasehold land that is the subject of the supply is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land and for another use, the apportionment of the value of the supply between the exempt and non-exempt uses must be made on the basis of allocating that proportion of the supply that is fairly attributable to the exempt supply.  Where a lease is entered into for leasehold land, and that land is to be used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land, the supply of that leasehold land pursuant to the lease (or the relevant portion of the lease) is not exempt until the dwelling has been erected. The words “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” in section 14(1)(ca) refer to any payment made for: • The creation of a leasehold interest in that land, other than a payment of rent; or • The sale of the leasehold interest in the land. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to a supply of leasehold land by way of rental when the time of supply occurs between 1 July 1999 and 31 January 2006. This ruling is signed by me on the 30 th day of March 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 01/01 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/01 (“the ruling”). The ruling is a reissue of public binding ruling BR Pub 96/7, issued on 25 March 1996. The Commissioner’s view, as expressed in this ruling, is not intended to differ from BR Pub 96/7. Any changes between this ruling and the previous ruling are only intended to assist the reader’s understanding. A note as to legislative history This ruling and commentary refers to section 14(1)(ca) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. That section was originally enacted (pursuant to section 12(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1986 and with effect from 3 December 1985, the date of enactment of the principal Act) as section 14(ca). The Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000 amended section 14 and made it section 14(1) (with the subsidiary changes that section 14(ca) became section 14(1)(ca), section 14(c) became section 14(1)(c), etc). This was necessary due to the enactment of the new sections 14(2) and 14(3). In this commentary, sections 14(ca) and sections 14(1)(ca) will consistently be referred to as section 14(1)(ca). Therefore, where necessary references to section 14(1)(ca) should be read as a reference to section 14(ca). Similarly, section 14(1)(c) of the Act should be read as, where appropriate, section 14(c). Background Section 14(1)(ca) exempts from GST the supply of leasehold land by way of rental, to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land. The section expressly excludes from the exemption any grant or sale of the lease of the land. In the Commissioner’s view, section 14(1)(ca) applies to the supply of leasehold land by way of rental when it is supplied separately from any buildings or other improvements to that land. This form of lease is commonly known as a “ground lease”. Under a ground lease the rental is generally based on the unimproved value of the land. In such cases the head lessor owns the land, and the head lessee usually owns the buildings and any other improvements to the land. Section 14(1)(ca) was inserted into the Act \[originally as section 14(ca)\] by section 12(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1986. That amendment was effective from 3 December 1985, being the date of enactment of the principal Act and prior to the commencement of GST. The amendment was enacted to correct a deficiency in the principal Act. In the absence of the amendment, residential lessees of leasehold land would have had to pay GST on their 3 ground lease rental payments. This was seen as inequitable when compared with the position of residential owners of freehold properties, who generally do not pay GST on the acquisition of a private home, and lessees of residential accommodation. The supply of residential rental accommodation is GST exempt under section 14(1)(c). Section 14(1)(ca) was therefore intended to provide an extension to the section 14(1)(c) exemption. There has been some uncertainty regarding the scope and effect of the section 14(1)(ca) exemption. In particular, uncertainty may arise when there is a supply of leasehold land used for both commercial and residential purposes. Doubt has also arisen regarding the meaning of the words “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” in section 14(1)(ca). Hence, public binding ruling 96/7 was issued by the Commissioner to clarify the position. This public binding ruling is not intended to change the Commissioner’s view of section 14(1)(ca) as expressed in that ruling. Rather, any changes are intended to clarify the Commissioner’s view. Legislation Section 14(1) exempts certain supplies from GST. Section 14(1)(ca) exempts: The supply of leasehold land by way of rental (not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land) to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land: Section 14(1)(c) also exempts: The supply of accommodation in any dwelling by way of - (i) Hire; or (ii) A service occupancy agreement; or (iii) A licence to occupy: Section 2 defines “dwelling” as meaning: ... any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof, used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual, together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it; but does not include a commercial dwelling: Section 10(18) states: Where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. Application of the legislation Section 14(1)(ca) exempts “the supply of leasehold land by way of rental ... to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land”. The Commissioner’s view is that this means that to the extent that leasehold land is used, by the lessee, “for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land” the supply of that land is exempt. 4 The term “principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling” refers to the use to which the dwelling, erected on the leasehold land, or a portion of the leasehold land, is being put. It does not refer to the use to which the leasehold land is being put as a whole. Therefore, it is not necessary for the principal purpose to which the leasehold land is being put to be accommodation in a dwelling. It is sufficient if part of the leasehold land is being used for “the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land”. Therefore, in applying section 14(1)(ca) to any ground lease, the use or uses to which the leasehold land is being put must be considered. Such consideration will allow the extent to which the supply of the leasehold land is exempt to be determined. When all the land and any buildings erected on that land are used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling, the full rental in respect of the ground lease is exempt from GST. When all the land and any buildings erected on that land are used for commercial or other non-dwelling purposes, the ground lease is subject to GST. When leasehold land and any building erected on that land are used in part for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling and in part for commercial or other non-exempt purposes, the ground lease is only exempt to the extent that the use to which the leasehold land is being put relates to the provision of accommodation in a dwelling. This requires apportioning the ground lease rental and imposing GST only on that part of the rental that relates to the non-exempt purpose(s). Alternative interpretation It is also arguable that section 14(1)(ca) only exempts the supply of leasehold land when all the land is used for the principal purpose, i.e., more than 50%, of accommodation in a dwelling. The exemption then only applies to the extent that the land is so used. For example, the ground lease rental of land on which a building is situated that is used as to 75% for accommodation and 25% for offices, is exempt from GST as to 75%. However, the ground lease rental of land on which a building is situated that is used as to 25% for accommodation and 75% for offices, is not exempt from GST. While this is an arguable interpretation, the Commissioner considers that it is unduly narrow and restrictive, and that the interpretation that has been adopted (and expressed in the Ruling) better effects the purpose of the section. The Commissioner’s view is that the primary focus of the provision is on that portion of the land that is used for accommodation purposes, rather than, as the alternative interpretation proposes, the predominant use of the land as a whole. To limit the exemption to only those instances where accommodation in a dwelling is the primary, or predominant, use to which the land being put would be to effectively ignore the apportionment requirement. It is considered that the better view is that the purpose of the section is to exempt from GST that element of total use that relates to the principal purpose of accommodation and that this purpose is best effected by a broad interpretation. Apportionment Section 14(1)(ca) is silent as to the correct way to apportion the lease payments in respect of the supply of the leasehold land between the exempt and non-exempt uses. The section only states that the supply is exempt “to the extent” that the use to which the land is being put is 5 the exempt use. Section 10(18) of the Act also deals with the apportionment of consideration between exempt and taxable supplies. However, that section similarly does not specify the basis for determining the apportionment – rather it simply deems the taxable supply to be for that part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. It is the Commissioner’s view that it is not possible to specify a method of apportionment that must be applied in all instances. The appropriate method must be determined on a case by case basis, taking into account the provisions of the lease and bearing in mind that section 14(1)(ca) requires the apportionment to be undertaken taking into account the uses to which the land is being put. The following examples are intended to be indicative only of the approach that may be taken to apportionment: • a six-storey building is erected on leasehold land. Calculated on the basis of the floor area used, 60% was used for offices, 20% for a restaurant and the remaining 20% for residential apartments. The residential apartments are used for the principal purpose of private accommodation in a dwelling. Pursuant to section 14(1)(ca), 20% of the ground lease rental is exempt from GST. • an area of rural leasehold land is used, on an area basis, as to 90% for grazing and 10% for a house and its curtilage. That house is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling. Pursuant to section 14(1)(ca), 10% of the ground lease rental is exempt from GST. In some cases, the ground lease rental may be expressly calculated with reference to the different uses to which the land is to be put. For example:  a person leases ten hectares of rural land. A term of the lease is that one hectare can be used to erect a dwelling, but the remaining nine hectares must be left as pasture. The lease further provides that the pasture is to be leased at the rate of $10 per hectare per week, while the remaining land is leased at $50 per week. While the total rent payable under the lease is $140 per week, $50 will be GST exempt. A grant or sale of the lease of that land The words “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” create an exception to the exemption under the main body of section 14(1)(ca). The words in section 14(1)(ca) “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” refer to any payment made for: • The creation of a leasehold interest in that land, other than a payment of rent; or • The sale of the leasehold interest in the land. Any grant or sale by the head lessor (owner of the land) of a ground lease of that land, where the ground lease is exempt from GST to the extent that it is used for the principal purpose of 6 supplying accommodation in a dwelling, is not exempt from GST. Whether GST is payable on the sale or grant depends on whether the sale or grant is made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the head lessor. Examples The following examples do not form part of the ruling. Example 1 A, a GST registered person, owns a vacant piece of land. She leases that land to S who constructs a building that is used to carry on her business as a drycleaner. The building occupies the entire piece of land, leaving only a narrow alley providing access to the rear entrance. No part of the land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling and therefore no part of the supply from A to S is exempt. Example 2 S constructs an apartment above her drycleaning business and rents it to E. The floor area of the apartment is exactly the same as that of the drycleaners, so 50% of the ground rent charged by A to S is GST exempt. Example 3 S sold her drycleaning business and the building, including the apartment, to E. E negotiated a new ground lease with A. 50% of the ground rent was exempt as it related to the apartment. In addition to the ground lease rental payments, in order to facilitate the negotiation of the new lease E agreed to make a one off payment to A of $5,000. None of that payment is exempt from GST as it relates to the grant of the lease and is excluded from the exemption. 7

Martin Smith General Manager, Adjudication & Rulings Commentary on Public Ruling BR Pub 01/02 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/02 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR 98/1 (TIB Volume Ten, No. 2, February 1998 at page 4 under the heading “Definition of “transitional capital amount”). This Ruling covers the period from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2006. Background The Companies Act 1993 enacted major reforms in the company law area. One of the most significant was the removal of the concept of “paid-up capital”. Consequently the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 was enacted to accommodate the changes to company law. In particular, the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 introduced, with application from 1 July 1994, a definition of “available subscribed capital” for tax purposes. The Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 also repealed section 4A(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 4A(1)(h) allowed the Commissioner to exclude from dividends such amount distributed to a shareholder of the company, as the Commissioner considered just and reasonable where: • The company had reduced the amount of the paid-up capital of the shareholder by writing off with High Court approval, losses incurred by the company; and • The company was subsequently wound up; and • Upon the winding up of the company, an amount (whether in money or money’s worth) was distributed to the shareholder in excess of the amount paid up on the shares of the shareholder. The effect of the repeal of section 4A(1)(h), is that there is no reduction of the “available subscribed capital” of a company when the company has, prior to 1 July 1994, written off losses against paid-up capital. To calculate the available subscribed capital for companies existing prior to 1 July 1994, the “transitional capital amount” must be determined. The terms “available subscribed capital” and “transitional capital amount” are discussed in more detail in TIB Volume Six, No. 6 - Company Law Reform (December 1994). The definition of "transitional capital amount" was amended in 1998 by adding a new paragraph (b) - which does not affect this ruling - and, at the same time, the wording was changed to bring it into line with the current legislative style. In particular the former wording of "aggregate amount of capital" was changed to read "total amount of capital". 2 The Commissioner considers that this wording change does not affect the interpretation of the definition or the calculation of item "j". Legislation Section OB 1 states: “ Transitional capital amount”, of a share in a company means - (a) Unless paragraph (b) applies, the amount calculated using the formula: j + k x m l where j is the total amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 for shares of the same class as the share (whenever issued and including the share), not being \[Emphasis added\] - (i) An amount paid up by a bonus issue made after 31 March 1982 and before 1 October 1988, except if - (A) The date of the acquisition, redemption, other cancellation, or liquidation falls more than 10 years after the date of the bonus issue; or (B) The amount was paid up by way of application of an amount of qualifying share premium; or (C) The relevant time is the time of liquidation of the company; or (ii) An amount paid up by a bonus issue (other than a taxable bonus issue) made on or after 1 October 1988, except if the amount was paid up by way of application of an amount of qualifying share premium; and k is the total of qualifying share premium paid to the company before 1 July 1994 for shares of that class (whenever issued and including the share), not being an amount that is later (but before 1 July 1994) applied to pay up capital on shares in the company; and l is the number of shares of that class (including the share) ever issued before the close of 30 June 1994; and m is the number of shares of that class (including the share) on issue at the close of 30 June 1994: (b) In the case of a company that is a group investment fund to which either section CZ 4A or CZ 4B applies, the value of the superannuation fund interest at the close of business on 31 March 1999. (Emphasis added). Application of legislation The “total amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in factor “j” of the definition of “transitional capital amount” includes all paid-up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company. This allows a company to restore the written-off capital upon liquidation, without the distribution being treated as a dividend to the shareholders. 3 Example 1990 M Ltd issues 1,000 fully paid-up shares at $1 each. 1992 Pursuant to High Court approval, M Ltd writes off $500 (50 cents per share) of paid-up capital from its accumulated losses. 1994 Paid-up capital at 30 June 1994 is $500. 1995 Shareholders decide to liquidate M Ltd. There have been no movements in the capital of M Ltd since the capital reduction in 1992. After the sale of assets the distribution per share will be 75c. Because M Ltd existed before 1 July 1994, its “available subscribed capital” is determined by calculating its “transitional capital amount”. To calculate M’s transitional capital amount, the following formula is used: j + k x m l where- j is paid-up capital at the close of 30 June 1994 $ 500 add back capital reduction $ 500 total capital paid up before 1 July 1994 as defined in the $1,000 Ruling k qualifying share premium assume is 0 l number of shares ever issued before 1 July 1994 1,000 m shares on issue at 1 July 1994 1,000 $1,000 + 0 x 1,000 = $1,000 transitional capital amount 1,000 The available subscribed capital per share cancelled equals $1,000/1,000 = $1 per share. The $0.75 per share distributed is not treated as a dividend as it does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share. 4
1 RENT DEEMED TO BE PAYABLE – DEDUCTIBILITY PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 01/03 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BD 2 and GD 10. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement to which this ruling applies is a “lease” of property (whether real property or personal property), at less than an “adequate rent,” where the property is used by the lessee in the derivation of gross income or exempt income. This ruling applies when the property is owned by any person, any 2 or more persons, or partnership and is leased:  to a “relative” of any of those persons or of any member of the partnership; or  to a “related company”; or  by a company to any person. 2 For the purposes of this Ruling the terms “lease”, “adequate rent”, and “related company” have the meanings attributed to them by section GD 10(4), and “relative” has the meaning attributed to it by section OB 1. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • Rent deemed under section GD 10 to be payable by the lessee to the lessor is expenditure incurred by the lessee for the purposes of section BD 2(1)(b). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to leases entered into within the period 1 February 2001 to 31 January 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 10 th day of April 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 01/03 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/03 (“the ruling”). The ruling is a reissue of public binding ruling BR Pub 97/13, issued on 12 December 1997. The Commissioner’s view, as expressed in this ruling, is not intended to differ from BR Pub 97/13. Any changes between this ruling and the previous ruling are only intended to assist the reader’s understanding. Background Section GD 10 applies to leases, between a lessor and certain specified classes of lessee, where the rent payable under the lease is “less than an adequate rent”. Section GD 10 allows the Commissioner to notionally increase the amount of rent payable by the lessee to the lessor to an amount equal to an “adequate rent” and the section deems the rent thus payable to be gross income of the lessor. Section GD 10 is directed against tax avoidance. It controls the shifting of income between family members to take advantage of different marginal tax rates, but is not limited to familial transactions. Progressive tax scales give advantages to the family unit to spread income, resulting in a reduction in the overall amount of tax paid by that unit, or the rate of tax applying to an income stream. Section GD 10 operates to limit this opportunity when related parties lease income-producing property. The effect of deeming income to be derived, based on a rent that should have been paid rather than what was paid, unwinds any advantage. Section GD 10 applies where property (both personal and real) owned by any person, by any 2 or more persons (whether jointly or in common) or by any partnership is leased:  to a relative of any of those persons;  to a relative of any member of the partnership;  to a related company;  by a company to any person; and the rent is either less than an adequate rent for the property or the lease makes no provision for the payment of rent. Where those circumstances apply, section GD 10 allows the Commissioner to determine an amount of “adequate rent”, being in broad terms an amount of rent considered by the Commissioner to be adequate for the property being leased. This ruling does not consider the basis of such a determination or what is meant by either adequate or inadequate rent. The amount of adequate rent so determined is, pursuant to section GD 10, deemed to be payable by the lessee to the lessor and is deemed to be gross income of the lessor. 4 This ruling considers the position of the lessee and, specifically, whether the adequate rent that is deemed payable by the lessee to the lessor is an allowable deduction of the lessee for the purposes of section BD 2. The ruling concludes that rent deemed to be payable is an expenditure or loss incurred by the lessee under section BD 2(1)(b). It is therefore an allowable deduction if the exclusions in section BD 2(2) do not apply (such as, the exclusion of expenditure to the extent that it is of a private or capital nature, incurred in deriving exempt income, etc). Legislation Section BD 2(1) states: An amount is an allowable deduction of a taxpayer (a) ... (b) to the extent that it is an expenditure or loss (i) incurred by the taxpayer in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, or (ii) necessarily incurred by the taxpayer in the course of carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income, ... . Section GD 10 states: (1) Where any property owned by any person or by 2 or more persons (whether jointly or in common) or by any partnership is leased to a relative of any of those persons or of any member of the partnership or to a related company or by a company to any person and the rent is less than an adequate rent for that property or the lease makes no provision for the payment of rent, - (a) There shall be deemed to be payable under the lease a rent that is equal to an adequate rent for the property, and that rent shall be deemed to be payable by the lessee to the lessor on the days provided in the lease for payment of the rent, or, if no rent is payable under the lease, on such days as the Commissioner determines, and shall be deemed to be gross income derived by the lessor on the days on which the rent is deemed to be payable under this paragraph; and (b) The rent deemed to be payable under paragraph (a) shall be deemed to accrue from day to day during the period in respect of which it is payable, and shall be apportioned accordingly. (2) This section shall apply with respect to any leased property only if and to the extent that it is used by the lessee in the derivation of gross income or exempt income. (3) This section shall apply whether the lease was granted before or after the commencement of the income year. (4) In this section- “Adequate rent”, in relation to any property, means the amount of rent that the Commissioner determines to be adequate for that property during the period in respect of which the determination is made: “Lease” means a tenancy of any duration, whether in writing or otherwise; and includes a sublease; and also includes a bailment; and “lessor” and “lessee” have corresponding meanings: “Related company” means a company that is under the control of the lessor or any relative or relatives of the lessor or any one or more of them, or, where there are several lessors or the lessor is a partnership, under the control of any of the lessors or partners or any relative or relatives of any of the lessors or partners: “Rent” includes any premium or other consideration for the lease. 5 Section OB 1 defines “relative” as: “Relative” – (a) ...in relation to any person, means any other person connected with the first-mentioned person by blood relationship, marriage, or adoption; and includes a trustee of a trust under which a relative has benefited or is eligible to benefit; and for the purposes of this paragraph – (i) Persons are connected by blood relationship if within the fourth degree of relationship: (ii) Persons are connected by marriage if one is married to the other or to a person who is connected by blood relationship to the other: (iii) Persons are connected by adoption if one has been adopted as the child of the other or as a child of a person who is within the third degree of relationship to the other.... Application of the legislation How section GD 10 operates When does the section apply? Section GD 10 operates, in limited circumstances, following a determination by the Commissioner. In order for section GD 10 to apply, the following requirements must be satisfied:  There must be the leasing of property;  The owner of the property must be:  A person (as defined in the Act, and includes a company); or  Any 2 or more persons (whether jointly or in common); or  A partnership.  The lessee must be:  a relative of an owner (where the owner is a natural person); or  a relative of any member of the partnership that owns the property; or  a related company of the owner; or  where the lessor is a company, any person.  Where either the stipulated rent is less than adequate or the lease is silent on the payment of rent; and  The lessee uses the property in the derivation of gross income or exempt income. What leased property is covered? “Property” is not defined for the purposes of section GD 10, but in the Commissioner’s view it includes both real property (land and buildings) and personal property (property other than land and buildings). This is the usual legal meaning of “property”, but the definition of “lease” in section GD 10 also supports this interpretation. “Lease” is defined in section GD 10(4) as a tenancy of any duration, including a sublease, and a bailment. A lease and a tenancy usually only relate to land, i.e. real property. However, a bailment only ever refers to personal property. Therefore, it is clear that section GD 10 is intended to apply to, and the word “property” is meant to refer to, both real and personal property. Who is a relative? 6 “Relative” is defined in section OB 1. A relative is a person connected by “blood relationship”, marriage, or adoption. “Blood relationship” means a relationship within the fourth degree, which is ascertained by counting the relationship steps between the two people. For example, A and B are first cousins, so they are within the fourth degree of relationship, as follows: A – A’s parent (1) – Grandparent (2) – B’s parent (3) – B (4). Any person who marries another person within the fourth degree of relationship automatically assumes the same relationship. For example, B’s spouse is within the fourth degree of relationship to A. Similarly, both A and B’s spouses are within the fourth degree of relationship to each other. Children adopted by a person within the third degree of relationship are also relatives. The deeming effect of section GD 10 If the section applies to a transaction, section GD 10(1)(a) explicitly deems: • An adequate rent to be payable under the lease; • That adequate rent to be payable by the lessee to the lessor on the days provided in the lease for rent payment, or, where no rent is payable under the lease, on such days as the Commissioner determines; and • Rent to be gross income of the lessor derived on the days on which it is deemed to be payable. “Deemed” means adding to the normal meaning of words If the Commissioner determines an adequate rent, the amount of rent payable by the lessee to the lessor is increased by the deeming effect of section GD 10 to reflect the Commissioner’s determination. In a Canadian decision, R v Vermette \[1978\] 2 SCR 838 at page 845, the Court gave a useful description of the legal effect of a deeming provision. It said: A deeming provision is a statutory fiction; as a rule it implicitly admits that a thing is not what it is deemed to be but decrees that for some particular purpose it shall be taken as if it were that thing although it is not or there is doubt as to whether it is. A deeming provision artificially imports into a word or expression an additional meaning which they would not otherwise convey beside the normal meaning which they retain where they are used; it plays a function of enlargement analogous to the word “includes” in certain definitions; however, “includes” would be logically inappropriate and would sound unreal because of the fictional aspect of the provision. In this case, section GD 10 deems an amount of adequate rent to be payable, even though in terms of the contract between the lessor and the lessee it is not. The section then further deems the fictional rent to be payable on specified days and finally deems the rent to be gross income of the lessor. The section applies to a lessee 7 Although the section deems the rent determined by the Commissioner to be gross income of the lessor, it does not expressly state that the deemed rent is deductible by the lessee. The absence of a specified mirror treatment for the lessee could arguably support an interpretation of the section based on the proposition that it does not apply to a lessee. However, in the Commissioner’s view this is not a correct interpretation because: 1. An adequate rent is deemed by the section to be payable under the lease. The section further deems the rent to be payable by the lessee to the lessor; 2. The application of the section is dependent on the lessee’s use of the leased property for the derivation of gross income or exempt income;. 3. Subsection (2) is directly concerned with the use of leased property by the lessee. 4. Section GD 10 was originally introduced as section 17 of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act 1951. Introductory Notes supplied to the Minister on introduction of the Bill said: This clause is designed to cover the position where a taxpayer owning an income producing property, enters into a lease under which a relative becomes entitled to the full rent or income from the property, and is required to pay to the lessor only a nominal or peppercorn rental. ...The provisions of the clause will not be applied to bona fide leases of property, even though the lessee is a relative, and will be operated by the Commissioner only where it is evident that the lease has the effect of transferring income from the taxpayer to a relative. This demonstrates that the purpose of the provision was to prevent income splitting and the consequential reduction of tax paid. Allowing a deduction to the lessee would not negate this purpose. These provisions support the conclusion that section GD 10 is intended to apply to both parties to a transaction. Deeming not limited to section GD 10 The application of the deeming provisions contained in section GD 10 is not limited by the inclusion of any qualification. Elsewhere in the Act, where the effect of a provision is intended to be restricted, such sections contain a qualification such as, “For the purposes of this section...”. The absence of such a qualification indicates that the deeming provisions are intended to have effect over the rest of the Act. In other words, having deemed an amount of adequate rent to be payable by the lessee to the lessor, that rent is payable for the wider purposes of the Act. It is not restricted to only applying to section GD 10. Section BD 2: “incurred” requires a legal obligation to pay An amount is an allowable deduction under section BD 2 only if it is “incurred” by the taxpayer. For the deemed adequate rent to be an allowable deduction, it must have been “incurred” by the lessee. 8 The term “incurred” has been held to mean that the taxpayer has either paid the expenditure or loss, or is otherwise definitively committed to pay it: (see CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351). A taxpayer is said to be definitively committed when a legal obligation to make a payment in the future can be said to have accrued. Section GD 10 does not specifically deem the adequate rent to have been incurred by the lessee. Rather, the section deems the rent to be payable. In Re Howell’s Application \[1972\] Ch. 509, the phrase “payable by way of rent” was interpreted as meaning “... rent the tenant is under an enforceable obligation to pay...”. New Zealand courts have taken the same view. In AM Bisley & Co Ltd v C of IR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,082 at page 5,096, Henry J said: ...that the expenditure is not payable until some future date does not of itself destroy its nature as an existing obligation. Therefore, where an amount is said to be “payable”, it means that the payer has an enforceable obligation to pay the amount, even where that obligation does not crystallise until some future date. Under section GD 10(1)(a), adequate rent is deemed to be payable on the days provided in the lease for payment, or on such days as the Commissioner determines. This means that the Act operates as if there was an obligation to pay the rent. The Commissioner’s view is that by deeming the amount to be payable, that has the same effect as deeming that a legal obligation has been created and therefore as far as section BD 2(1)(b) is concerned an expenditure has been incurred. The obligation in Bisley was an existing legal obligation to make expenditure that became payable on a future date. Thus, there are two types of expenditure that qualify as “incurred”: existing legal obligations payable now, and those that will become payable in the future. For expenditure either to be payable or to become payable, there must be an existing obligation to pay either now or later. Rent deemed to be payable falls within the first category, and is clearly “incurred”. The nexus between expenditure and income is not affected by deeming If the leased property is used in the derivation of gross income, any rental paid by the lessee, including a less than adequate rent, is deductible (unless specifically excluded by section BD 2(2)). The required statutory nexus establishing deductibility is therefore present between the expenditure and the income. A determination by the Commissioner does not alter the quality of that expenditure, but merely alters the amount of the expenditure. Conclusion Rent deemed to be payable under section GD 10 is expenditure incurred by the lessee under section BD 2(1)(b). Examples 9 Example 1 A leases a flat to her daughter B for $10 per week. B then rents it to tenants for $400 per week. A has other income of $50,000 and is on a marginal tax rate of 33c in the dollar. B has no other income and pays 19.5c in the dollar. As B’s tax bracket is lower than A’s, there is less tax being paid overall than if A rented the flat to the tenants directly. The Commissioner may determine that an adequate rent is higher than $10 per week. Section GD 10 will apply to deem the determined rent to be the rent payable by B to A. The adequate rent is deemed to be gross income derived by A. The rent deemed payable is expenditure incurred by B, as there is deemed to be a legal obligation to pay. Example 2 C Ltd, a company, leases a property to X, a charitable body, at an inadequate rental. X uses the property in the derivation of exempt income. A “person” includes a company and an unincorporated body of persons (section OB 1) and therefore X. Section GD 10(1) applies to a lease of property “by a company to any person” at an inadequate rent. Under subsection (2), the section applies to the extent that the property is used by the lessee in the derivation of gross income or exempt income. An adequate rent determined by the Commissioner is therefore deemed payable. Although a deduction is allowed under section BD 2(1), this is denied by section BD 2(2)(b) as the expenditure is incurred in the derivation of exempt income. In this case, C derives gross income in the amount of the adequate rent, but X is unable to claim a matching deduction.
1 ASSESSABILITY OF PAYMENTS UNDER THE EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS ACT FOR HUMILIATION, LOSS OF DIGNITY, AND INJURY TO FEELINGS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 01/04 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling replaces Public Rulings BR Pub 97/3 and 97/3A published in TIB Volume 9, No 3 (March 1997). This new ruling is essentially the same as the previous rulings. The main changes take into account the new employment legislation, update relevant case references, and it clarifies the Commissioner’s approach to out of court settlements where he has some doubt about the amount attributed to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. The ruling applies from 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2005. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 5, CH 3, NC 2, and the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is: • The making of a payment to an employee or former employee for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000; or • The making of a payment to an employee or former employee pursuant to an out of court settlement genuinely based on the employee’s rights to compensation under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000. This Ruling does not, however, apply to such payments that are in reality for lost wages or other income, but which are merely characterised by the parties as being for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings (irrespective of whether such an agreement is signed by a mediator under the Employment Relations Act). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Payments that are genuinely and entirely for compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 are not “monetary remuneration” in terms of the definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Consequently, such payments do not form part of the gross income of the employee under section CH 3. 2 • Such compensation payments are not gross income under ordinary concepts under section CD 5. • There is consequently no liability under section NC 2 for employers or former employers to deduct PAYE from these payments. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received between 1 October 2000 and 30 September 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18th day of April 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 01/04 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/04 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Rulings BR Pub 97/3 and 97/3A published in TIB Volume 9, No 3 (March 1997) at page 7. The Ruling applies for the period from 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2005. Background The Employment Relations Act 2000 provides for a number of remedies when an employee has a personal grievance against a current or former employer. This includes compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the employee. The Employment Relations Act also establishes specialist institutions with exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the rights of parties litigating on employment contracts: the Employment Relations Authority and the Employment Court. The Employment Relations Service of the Department of Labour has jurisdiction to provide mediation services. Section 103(1) of the Employment Relations Act defines “personal grievance” as: For the purposes of this Act, personal grievance means any grievance that an employee may have against the employee's employer or former employer because of a claim— (a) that the employee has been unjustifiably dismissed; or (b) that the employee's employment, or 1 or more conditions of the employee's employment (including any condition that survives termination of the employment), is or are or was (during employment that has since been terminated) affected to the employee's disadvantage by some unjustifiable action by the employer; or (c) that the employee has been discriminated against in the employee's employment; or (d) that the employee has been sexually harassed in the employee's employment; or (e) that the employee has been racially harassed in the employee's employment; or (f) that the employee has been subject to duress in the employee's employment in relation to membership or non-membership of a union or employees organisation. Section 123 of the Employment Relations Act provides a number of remedies available to the Authority or Court when the Authority or Court determines that an employee has a “personal grievance” including: ... (b) the reimbursement to the employee of a sum equal to the whole or any part of the wages or other money lost by the employee as a result of the grievance: (c) the payment to the employee of compensation by the employee's employer, including compensation for - (i) humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the employee; and (ii) loss of any benefit, whether or not of a monetary kind, which the employee might reasonably have been expected to obtain if the personal grievance had not arisen: 4 The Ruling considers whether such payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the employee are “monetary remuneration”. Paragraph (a) of the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section OB 1 states: “Monetary remuneration” ...means any salary, wage, allowance, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer;... Section CH 3 states that “all monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income”. Section CD 5 also states that “the gross income of a person includes any amount that is included in gross income under ordinary concepts”. Application of the Legislation If payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings, under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 are “monetary remuneration”, they would be included under section CH 3 as gross income. They would be included in the calculation of “net income” under section BC 6 and would consequently form part of “taxable income” as calculated under section BC 7. Section OB 1 defines “monetary remuneration” to include any “other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer...”. Payments under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act are a benefit in money. The issue is, therefore, whether these payments are made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of” the recipient. The meaning of “in respect of or in relation to” The phrase “in respect of or in relation to” is capable of having a very wide meaning. For example, in Shell New Zealand Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, the Court of Appeal was dealing with certain lump sum payments made by Shell to employees who transferred at the request of Shell. The Court discussed the definition of “monetary remuneration”. The case concerned the part of the definition of “monetary remuneration” which says: ... emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer. McKay J, delivering the judgment of the Court, said at page 11,306 that: The words “in respect of or in relation to” are words of the widest import. Although McKay J acknowledged that the payments in Shell were not made under the contract of employment in that case, this did not mean that the employees received the payment outside the employment relationship. The learned Judge had earlier referred to the fact that the payments were not expressly provided under the employees’ written employment contracts but were made pursuant to Shell’s employment policy as a matter of discretion. They were still made “because he or she is an employee”. 5 Other cases have also stressed the width of the words “in respect of or in relation to”. In the Queens Bench case of Paterson v Chadwick \[1974\] 2 All ER 772, Boreham J considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in relation to discovery, and adopted the comments of Mann CJ in the Australian case Trustees, Executors & Agency Co Ltd v Reilly \[1941\] VLR 110, where the learned Chief Justice said: The words “in respect of” are difficult of definition but they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation in between the two subject-matters to which the words refer. Similarly, in Nowegijick v The Queen \[1983\] CTC 20 at page 25, the Supreme Court of Canada described the phrase “in respect of” as “probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject-matters”. Context may affect the meaning However, many cases have demonstrated that the meaning to be given to the phrase “in respect of or in relation to” may vary according to the context in which it appears. In State Government Insurance Office v Rees (1979) 144 CLR 549, the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in determining whether the debt due to the Government Insurance Office fell within section 292(1)(c) of the Companies Act 1961-1975 (Q.) as “amounts ... due in respect of workers’ compensation under any law relating to workers’ compensation accrued before the relevant date”. The Court held that amounts which could be recovered by the Government Insurance Office from an uninsured company pursuant to section 8(5) of the Workers’ Compensation Act 1916-1974(Q.) for money paid to workers employed by the uninsured company were not amounts due “in respect of” workers’ compensation under the Companies Act. At page 561 Mason J observed that: ... as with other words and expressions, the meaning to be ascribed to “in respect of” depends very much on the context in which it is found. Stephen J also discussed the meaning of the phrase “in respect of”, noting at pages 553-554 that it was capable of describing relationships over a very wide range of proximity, and went on to say: Were the phrase devoid of significant context, it could, I think, be taken to be descriptive of the relationship between the present indebtedness owed to the State Government Insurance Office and the subject matter of workers’ compensation. However a context does exist which is in my view sufficient to confine the operation of s 292(1)(c) to bounds too narrow to be of service to the appellant. In TRA Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190, certain payments were made to a New Zealand distributor by its overseas parent in relation to repairs which had to be made to cars sold to the New Zealand subsidiary and then sold to dealers. The issue was whether the payments were zero-rated. The definition of “consideration” in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was relevant. Part of the definition of “consideration” states: 6 ...any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services ... The TRA stated at page 6,200 that: A sub-issue is whether the reimbursing payment from the overseas manufacturer (MC) was made “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” the repair work in the sense required by the definition of “consideration” in s 2 of the Act. ... Although the definition of consideration creates a very wide potential link between a payment and a particular supply it is, in any case, a matter of degree, commonsense, and commercial reality whether a payment is direct enough to have the necessary nexus with a service, i.e, whether the link is strong enough. The High Court’s decision on the appeal of Case R34 is CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819. McGechan J said: ...it is necessary there be a genuine connection. The legislature is not to be taken as taxing on an unrealistic or tenuous connection basis. Not all payments to employees are “monetary remuneration” While it is true that an employee would not receive a payment under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act if he or she were not an employee, it would seem clear that this type of “but for” approach to “in respect of or in relation to” is not universally applied in the context of employment, and that not all payments to employees which have a connection with their work are within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. In Fraser v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,356, at page 12,363, Doogue J in the High Court said: There is no dispute that the words “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer” are words of the widest possible scope: see Shell New Zealand Ltd v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 at p 11,306, and Smith v FC of T 87 ATC 4883; (1987) 164 CLR 513; (1987) 19 ATR 274. Mr Harley does, however, submit, correctly, that it does not follow that all payments made are necessarily income and refers, for example, to reimbursement payments. In Shell, McKay J highlighted the fact that the payments in that case were both: • made to the recipients because they were employees; and • paid to compensate for the loss incurred by the employee in having to relocate in order to take up a new position with the employer. Many cases have concluded that, in appropriate circumstances, amounts received were not income, or assessable, even though paid by an employer to an employee. In FC of T v Rowe (1995) ATC 4,691, for example, the taxpayer was employed as an engineer for the Livingston Shire Council. As a result of a number of complaints against him he was suspended. An inquiry was commenced, and he incurred legal costs as a result of engaging counsel to defend himself against dismissal during the course of the inquiry. The taxpayer was cleared of any charges of misconduct but was dismissed a year later. The taxpayer claimed his legal costs as a deduction. Although the Council refused to reimburse the taxpayer for his legal costs, the Queensland government subsequently made an ex gratia payment to him. 7 The Full Federal Court considered, amongst other things, whether the ex gratia payment constituted assessable income. By majority, the Court concluded that the payment was not assessable under section 25(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as income in accordance with ordinary concepts, nor was it assessable under section 26(e) of that Act as being compensation “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to” any employment. Accordingly, Burchett and Drummond JJ (with Beaumont J dissenting) held that the payment was not assessable. Burchett J held that the payment was not a reward for the taxpayer’s services but was a recognition for the wrong done to him. The payments were not remuneration but a reparation, and they were not sufficiently related to the performance of income-earning activities. On the same reasoning, it was too remote from the employment to be caught by section 26(e). Further, the payment was not assessable under section 26(e) because the employer/employee relationship between the Council and the taxpayer was merely part of the background facts against which the ex gratia payment was made. On appeal, the majority of the Full High Court confirmed the Federal Court’s decision: FC of T v Rowe (1997) ATC 4,317. Other cases, relating to wartime service, have also shown that payments made to present or former employees for reasons unconnected with their service as an employee will not necessarily be assessable income on a “but for” basis. In Louisson v Commissioner of Taxes \[1943\] NZLR 1, at page 9 Myers CJ and Northcroft J said of payments made by an employer to a former employee who had enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in World War II: In our opinion, such payments were personal gifts to each of the employees coming within the description in the resolution - gifts made simply as an acknowledgment of personal appreciation of the sacrifice made in the service of the Country by persons whose employment with the company has ceased and who are under no engagement to return to that employment. Similarly, in the Australian case of FCT v Dixon (1954) 5 AITR 443, the taxpayer received payments from his prior employer topping up his military pay. It would appear from the judgment that the Australian Commissioner argued that even a slight relationship to employment was sufficient to satisfy the test in section 26(e) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 \[which made assessable certain sums granted to the taxpayer “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment...”.\]. This argument was rejected by Dixon CJ and Williams J, who stated at page 446 that: We are not prepared to give effect to this view of the operation of s.26(e) ...There can, of course, be no doubt that the sum of £104 represented an allowance, gratuity or benefit allowed or given to the taxpayer by Macdonald, Hamilton and Company. Our difficulty is in agreeing with the view that it was allowed or given to him in respect of, or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of, or services rendered by him ...We are not prepared to give s.26(e) a construction which makes it unnecessary that the allowance, gratuity, compensation, benefit, bonus or premium shall in any sense be a recompense or consequence of the continued or contemporaneous existence of the relation of employer and employee or a reward for services rendered given either during the employment or at or in consequence of its termination. In the same case, at page 450, McTiernan J stated that: The words of paragraph (e) are wide, but, I think, not wide enough to prevent an employer from giving money or money’s worth to an employee continuing in his service or leaving it, without incurring liability to tax in respect of the gift. The relationship of employer and employee is a matter of contract. The contractual 8 relations are not so total and all embracing that there cannot be personal or social relations between employer and employee. A payment arising from those relations may have no connexion with the donee’s employment. These principles have also been applied by the courts in cases involving contracts for services. In Scott v FCT (1969) 10 AITR 367, Windeyer J in the High Court of Australia, considered the meaning of the words “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of or services rendered by him” in section 26(e) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1961. The case concerned a solicitor who received a gift of £10,000 from a grateful client. Windeyer J stated at page 374 that the meaning of the words of the legislation “must be sought in the nature of the topic concerning which they are used”. Windeyer J at page 376 referred to a passage from the judgment of Kitto J in Squatting Investment Co Ltd v FCT (1953) 5 AITR 496, at 524, where Kitto J (speaking of certain English cases) said: The distinction these decisions have drawn between taxable and non-taxable gifts is the distinction between, on the one hand, gifts made in relation to some activity or occupation of the donee of an income-producing character ... and, on the other hand, gifts referable to the attitude of the donor personally to the donee personally. Adopting this as a general principle, his Honour held that the £10,000 was not given or received as remuneration for services rendered and it did not form part of the taxpayer’s assessable income. A recent case discusses the words “in respect of the employment” in the Australian FBT legislation: J & G Knowles & Associates Pty Ltd v FC of T (2000) ATC 4,151. The case concerned interest-free loans to directors of a corporate trustee. Units in the trust fund were held by discretionary family trusts established by the directors. The lower courts were satisfied by a causal relationship, or a discernible and rational link between the loans and each director’s employment. However, the Full Federal Court said that there had to be more than just any causal relationship between the benefit and the employment: the link had to be sufficient or material. The nature and context of the payments Looking at the nature and context of payments contemplated by section 123(c)(i), it is strongly arguable that they do not intrinsically result from the employee and employer relationship. It is true that if the employee were not an employee then there would be no entitlement to receive the payment, but payments under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings are not compensation for services rendered or for actions that occur in the normal course of the employment relationship. They are based on the existence of a personal grievance. Provisions for such compensation can be seen as being included in the Employment Relations Act because the sometimes unequal power of the parties to the employment contract means that such personal grievances may be likely to occur in that setting. It is noteworthy that the Human Rights Act 1993 also includes provisions for dealing with discrimination and sexual harassment of employees, even though that is not “employment legislation” at all. 9 It is also possible to analyse a breach of the terms of the employment contract giving rise to the personal grievance (and the subsequent compensation) as literally being outside the employment contract because of the breach of the terms of the contract. Payments of compensation under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act differ markedly from the situation in Shell v CIR. In that case at page 11,306, McKay J said: It is true ...that the payment is not made under the contract of employment....It is nevertheless paid to an employee only because he or she is an employee, and is paid to compensate for the loss incurred in having to change the employee’s place of residence in order to take up a new position in the company. (Emphasis added) Thus, in the Shell case, the employees received the payments as employees, and in order to compensate for the loss sustained as a result of the employment-related relocation. In the ordinary course, the Commissioner considers genuine payments under section 123(c)(i) to be too remote from the employment relationship to be within the definition of monetary remuneration. The Commissioner considers that the employment relationship in such instances is merely part of the background facts against which the compensation payments are made. The payments are not made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. At first glance, it may be thought that this approach conflicts with the outcome in Case L78 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,451, where Barber DJ held that an ex gratia payment, to compensate for the employer’s failure to give adequate notice of redundancy, was assessable as “monetary remuneration”. However, the result in that case turned substantially on the objector’s evidence as to the receipt being in the nature of “extra wages”. Barber DJ stated at page 1,455 that: The objector himself related the $7,009.52 to extra holiday pay and sick leave. ... At the end of his cross- examination he said that it was “really a bonus” and he regarded $7,009.52 as “extra wages”. The character of the payment must be of a revenue nature. It is not a payment in the nature of capital. I consider that it is clearly within the definition of monetary remuneration in sec 2. There is also the later TRA decision in Case L92 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,530, where Barber DJ again considered the definition of “monetary remuneration”. This case also concerned an employee who was made redundant and an employer who did not comply with the requirement to give adequate notice. Barber DJ held that the payment came within the definition of “monetary remuneration” and was assessable income. However, the Authority did not consider any cases (other than his own previous decision in Case L78) on the correct characterisation of receipts for tax purposes, but rather concentrated upon the need to interpret “monetary remuneration” in a “wide manner” and the fact that the amount was received as compensation for loss of employment. Such compensation is specifically referred to in the definition of monetary remuneration. Recognising that it was possible for some receipts of a capital nature to be assessable income under a specific provision, Barber DJ at page 1,537 stated: 10 In this case, the words in sec 2 “compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” must surely cover not only a revenue type of payment such as a payment for lost wages, but also any other form of compensation for loss of employment. It may also be relevant to observe that both of these TRA decisions concerned settlements under the Industrial Relations Act 1973. This earlier legislation made no specific and separate provision for compensation payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. It is also thought that payments of the type under consideration in this Ruling are to be distinguished from those considered in American cases such as the Commissioner v Schleier 95-USTC 50,309. In that case, the United States Supreme Court held that certain punitive damages were assessable to the recipient employee. However, apart from the differing statutory context in the United States Internal Revenue Code, these damages were punitive because they related to a deliberate breach of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and that Act does not provide for a separate recovery of compensatory damages for pain and suffering or emotional distress. The New Zealand Court of Appeal in Air New Zealand Ltd v Johnston \[1992\] 1 NZLR 159 seemingly rejected the view that humiliation type payments to employees are punitive in nature rather than compensatory. In that case Cooke J held at page 168 that “the emphasis evidently placed by the Labour Court on the punitive aspect does justify, in my opinion, a radical interference with their award.” The award of $135,000 was replaced with one of $25,000, made up of $15,000 for future economic loss and $10,000 for injury to feelings. Income under ordinary concepts Compensation payments genuinely made under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 are not “gross income under ordinary concepts” under section CD 5. Unlike the statutory definition of “monetary remuneration”, section CD 5 can only apply when the payments received are “income” according to ordinary concepts. Although the legislation does not define “gross income under ordinary concepts”, a great number of decided cases has variously identified the concept by reference to such characteristics as periodicity, recurrence, and regularity, or by its resulting from business activities, the deliberate seeking of profit, or the performance of services. Nor do capital receipts form part of “gross income” unless there is a specific legislative provision to the contrary. It is clear that payments under section 123(c)(i) will not generally be made periodically or regularly, or generally recur. Nor as we have seen above, are they compensation for services. And by analogy with common law damages, they are of a capital nature. This point is acknowledged by Barber DJ in Case L92, where he stated at page 1,536 that: I appreciate only too well that it is possible to interpret the evidence as showing that the $7,179.30 was formulated as a payment in the nature of common law damages for human hurt and breach and unfairness... I appreciate that the latter concepts are akin more to payments of capital than to wage revenue. Out of court settlements 11 Sometimes, an employee and an employer negotiate a settlement out of court. The settlement agreement may state that the payment is for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. In return for the employee surrendering his or her rights under the Employment Relations Act, the employer will agree to pay a sum of money. There should be no difference in the tax treatment of the payments dependent on whether or not the parties use the Employment Relations Authority or Employment Court. A payment can be for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the employee whether the Authority or Court are involved or not. Shams The Ruling will not apply to payments which are akin to sham payments. A sham is a transaction set up to conceal the true intention of the parties and is inherently ineffective. The nature of a sham was discussed by Diplock LJ in Snook v London and West Riding Investment Ltd \[1967\] 1 All ER 518 at 528 where he stated: I apprehend that, if it has any meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the “sham”, which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. Richardson J, in the New Zealand case of Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, stated that the “essential genuineness of the transaction is challenged” in a sham situation. It is noteworthy that in the Taxation Review Authority decision Case S 96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603, Judge Barber stated at page 7,606: Of course, seemingly excessive allocations to compensation for feelings injury should be reopened by the IRD. If the parties to an agreement agree to characterise or describe payments as being for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings when they are in reality for lost wages, this transaction would be a sham which would be open to challenge by the Commissioner. Where the Commissioner has some doubt about the amount attributed to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings, he may ask the parties to an agreement what steps they took to evaluate objectively what would be a reasonable amount to attribute to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. This would be so regardless of whether the payment was made as a result of an out of court settlement and whether or not the agreement is signed by a mediator under the Employment Relations Act. Further, as provided by section 18 of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 and section 136(16) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the onus of proof in a hearing regarding the assessability of any such payment would be on the taxpayer.
1 FEDERAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS ACT (FICA) – FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (FBT) LIABILITY PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 01/05 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CI 1 (e), CI 1(g) and CI 1(h). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the deduction of FICA contributions and the paying of these along with the employer contribution, to the United States Federal Government in accordance with the Federal Insurance Contribution Act, by any New Zealand resident employer who is required to do so due to employing a citizen or citizens of the United States of America. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Moneys paid to FICA are not subject to FBT under section CI 1(g), as the contributions are not made to a “superannuation scheme” as defined in section OB 1. • Moneys paid to FICA are not subject to FBT under section CI 1(h), as no benefit is received by the employee in the quarter or income year within the meaning of the FBT rules. • Moneys paid to FICA are not subject to FBT under section CI 1(e), as the FICA scheme has not been approved by the Commissioner for the purposes of section CB 5, and FICA is not a “sick, accident or death benefit fund” as defined in section CB 5(2). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11 th day of May 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 01/05 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/05 (“the Ruling”). Background If a United States Citizen is employed in New Zealand, under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) of the United States of America, employers and employees may be required to contribute a stated percentage of taxable wages paid to the FICA scheme. The employee portion of the FICA contribution must be withheld and paid from each payment of taxable wages, and in addition the employer must pay the employer portion. The FICA establishes two funds. The first is old age, survivors, and disability insurance (OASDI). The second is hospital insurance (HI). The current rate of contribution to the FICA scheme is 7.65%, made up of 6.2% for OASDI and 1.45% for the HI portion. This OASDI/HI rate of 7.65% is imposed on both the employer and the employee, so the employer contribution together with the employee’s withheld amount result in a combined rate of 15.3%. Legislation The relevant meaning of “fringe benefit” is defined in section CI 1 as follows: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, means any benefit that consists of – ... (e) In relation to an employer of an employee, any contribution to any sick, accident, or death benefit fund which has been approved by the Commissioner for the purposes of CB 5: ... (g) Any contribution in relation to an employer of an employee, to any superannuation scheme: (h) Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, - The relevant meaning of “superannuation scheme” is defined in section OB 1 as follows: “Superannuation scheme” means- ... (c) Any arrangement constituted under an Act of the Parliament of New Zealand, other than the Social Security Act 1964, principally for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons; or any similar arrangement constituted under the legislation of any country, territory, state, or local authority outside New Zealand;- and where the superannuation scheme is a trust, any reference in this Act to a superannuation scheme includes a reference to the trustees of that scheme: 3 Application of the legislation The substantive issue is whether the employer is required to pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) on any part of the contributions made to the FICA scheme. The employee contribution is required to be withheld from the employee’s gross income by the employer and is therefore not considered to be a fringe benefit provided by the employer, as it is expenditure on account of the employee. The employer contribution is required to be paid over and above the employee’s gross salary or wages. An issue arises as to whether FBT applies to the employer contribution, as this is a payment by an employer in relation to an employee. Section CI 1(g) Section CI 1(g) concerns whether contributions are made to a “superannuation scheme”, as defined in section OB 1, and therefore attract FBT. Under subsection (c) of that definition, “superannuation scheme” includes: any arrangement constituted under an Act of the Parliament of New Zealand, other than the Social Security Act 1964, principally for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to natural persons; or any similar arrangement constituted under the legislation of any country, territory, state, or local authority outside New Zealand. Therefore, to come within the “superannuation scheme” definition, an arrangement constituted under the legislation of any country or state outside New Zealand, such as FICA, must be similar to an arrangement constituted under New Zealand legislation that has the principal purpose of providing retirement benefits. Two basic or generic types of employee superannuation schemes exist: defined contribution schemes and defined benefit schemes. A defined contribution scheme is one where contributions are defined in advance, usually as a fixed percentage of an employee’s salary, and benefits are determined by the amount of accumulated contributions plus income earned on those contributions. In such schemes the principle of allocated funding is employed, where contributions are invested as a common fund, but separate accounts are opened in respect of each member. Given that there is no beneficial entitlement to any particular amount that has been contributed to the FICA scheme (as the FICA scheme pays a statutorily fixed benefit on the basis of eventual eligibility as opposed to contributions made), it is considered that the FICA is not a sufficiently similar arrangement to a defined contribution scheme. A defined benefit scheme is one that provides benefits based on a predetermined formula, usually relating the benefit level to the number of years of service and, in some cases, the average or recent levels of pay. Such schemes employ unallocated funding, and the employer contribution rate varies in order to meet the cost of providing the defined benefit. While FICA may prima facie appear similar to such a scheme in that it also employs unallocated funding and members contribute a fixed percentage of salary, it is considered the FICA is not sufficiently similar to a generic defined benefit scheme, as the employer’s contribution and employee’s contribution are matched and the rate is contained in statute. This statutorily 4 imposed rate is fixed by the Federal Government of the United States, is involuntary, and an employer who fails to contribute the full amount as set down in statute may be liable for civil or criminal penalties. It is therefore considered that FICA is not a sufficiently similar arrangement to either of these generic schemes (constituted under an Act of the Parliament of New Zealand principally for providing retirement benefits) to be regarded as a superannuation scheme as defined in section OB 1. It is further concluded that the FICA is more similar to the New Zealand Social Security Act 1964, which is explicitly excluded from the definition of “superannuation scheme” as (on the words of the section) are similar arrangements constituted under the legislation of another country. Both schemes are tax funded and are the main government-provided retirement benefit schemes in the respective countries. In addition, both schemes form the basis of the social security systems in the respective countries, providing additional benefits such as those for sickness and disability. This conclusion takes FICA outside the definition of “superannuation scheme”, so contributions to the FICA are not caught by section CI 1(h) as being liable to FBT. Furthermore, contributions to FICA are more like a tax than a contribution to any superannuation scheme, as supported by the words of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act referring to the contributions as an “excise tax” (section 3111(a) and 3111(b)) and the penalties payable for non-payment of contributions that are the same as those for non- payment of federal income tax under the Internal Revenue Code. This view is also supported by an Australian decision, Case 20 CTBR (NS) Vol. 7, 91 that by a majority held employee contributions under the FICA to be in the nature of an income tax, implying that the compulsory employer contribution is likewise more in the nature of a tax. Section CI 1(h) Section CI 1(h) includes as a fringe benefit “any benefit of any other kind whatever”. In addition, a fringe benefit under section CI 1(h) must be a benefit that is: used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee... and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee. The Commissioner considers that the withholding of amounts from employees’ wages or salaries provides no benefit. As to the employer’s contribution, it is considered that in the absence of a beneficial entitlement to a matched contractual amount, no benefit is provided either. It cannot be said that the employee receives a benefit at the point in time the employer makes a contribution to FICA, because it is a compulsory tax, goes into the Federal Government tax pool, and no beneficial sum is “belonging” to the employee. In addition, any eventual benefits from the FICA scheme do not satisfy the combination of requirements in section CI 1(h) to attract FBT liability. 5 It is a contingency whether the taxpayer ever receives any payment back from the Federal Government, as any benefit received depends on an individual meeting the eligibility requirements (entitlement to the old age benefit is based on reaching the age of 62 and being fully insured). If an individual does receive a payment under the FICA scheme (paid as a monthly benefit), the person does so because of his or her United States citizenship and meeting the eligibility criteria etc. The person receives the government mandated amount, as opposed to a sum based on actual contributions made to the scheme. So whilst eligibility in part is due to previous contributions made to FICA (and some of these are made by the employer), and this may be considered, “indirectly, in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee”, if these words are of the widest import, overall, it is considered the nexus or connection between any eventual benefit and the employment of the employee is too remote (especially given that the only nexus is to eligibility at all, and not in any way connected to the quantum of any eventual benefit received). Principally, the reason the benefit is received by the employee is not by virtue of the employee’s employment, but because the employee is a United States citizen. Contributions to the scheme are not made voluntarily, but are compulsorily imposed by the Federal Government of the United States, and are not part of any employment contract or remuneration package. Any amounts received by a United States Citizen from FICA will be received from the Federal Government and not in the course of, or by virtue of, the employment relationship. Such a conclusion is consistent with the outcome of Constable v FC of T (1952) 86 CLR 402, where the High Court of Australia concluded that Constable only became entitled to payments under his scheme as a result of contingencies that had become absolute in the year in question, but that such an event did not give rise to an “allowance, gratuity, compensation, benefit \[...\]” to the employee “in respect of, or for or in relation” to his employment. Accordingly, no benefit is “received by the employee in the quarter or income year” when the employee is being paid, and no sufficient nexus exists between the employer’s requirement to pay funds to the Federal Government of the United States and the ultimate benefit the employee may eventually receive from the government at a later date, if eligible under statute. Section CI 1(e) Section CI 1(e) includes as a fringe benefit: In relation to an employer of an employee, any contribution to any sick, accident, or death benefit fund which has been approved by the Commissioner for the purposes of section CB 5: The Commissioner has not approved the FICA scheme for the purposes of section CB 5. The term “sick, accident, or death benefit fund” is not defined for the purpose of section CI 1(e), but is defined in section CB 5(2) for the purpose of that section. Section CI (1)(e) and section CB 5(2) are interlinked, as section CI (1)(e) requires that a “sick, accident or death 6 benefit fund” be approved by the Commissioner for the purposes of section CB 5. To be approved under section CB 5 such a fund must satisfy the section CB 5(2) definition The FICA scheme is not a “sick, accident, or death benefit fund” as that term is defined in section CB 5(2), as the FICA scheme is not established for the “benefit of the employees of any employer” as required by that definition. FICA is the funding scheme for the provision of United States social security benefits and there is no sufficient nexus between the employer’s requirement to pay funds to FICA and any benefit the employee may eventually receive from the government at a later date, if eligible under statute. Accordingly, any payments made to the FICA scheme are not considered to be subject to fringe benefit tax under section CI (1)(e).
EMPLOYMENT COURT AWARDS FOR LOST WAGES OR OTHER REMUNERATION - EMPLOYERS’ LIABILITY TO MAKE TAX DEDUCTIONS PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 01/06 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling replaces Public Rulings BR Pub 97/7 and 97/7A published in TIB Volume 9, No 6 (June 1997). This new ruling is essentially the same as the previous rulings. The main changes take into account the new employment legislation and tax law amendments, and update relevant case references. The ruling applies from 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2005. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CH 3, EB 1, NC 2, NC 16 , OB 1 (definitions of “employee”, “extra emolument”, “monetary remuneration”, and “shareholder-employee”), and OB 2 (definition of “source deduction payment”). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is an order by the Employment Court or the Employment Relations Authority requiring an employer to make a payment for lost wages or other remuneration to an employee under the Employment Relations Act 2000. The Court or Authority will make such an award when an employee has lost wages or other remuneration as a result of an action by the employer which has been the subject of a personal grievance by the employee against the employer (e.g. unjustifiable dismissal or other unjustifiable action by the employer). An award for lost wages or other remuneration will usually be made under sections 123(b) or 128 of the Employment Relations Act, but may be made under another provision. This Ruling does not apply to an award of compensation for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings made under section 123(c)(i) of the Employment Relations Act. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: A. Monetary remuneration The payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under the Employment Relations Act 2000 is “monetary remuneration” of the employee as defined in section OB 1. As the payment is monetary remuneration, it is gross income of the employee under section CH 3. B. Employer’s liability to make tax deductions from the award The payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under the Employment Relations Act 2000 is an extra emolument and is a “source deduction payment” under section OB 2 (1). The employer must make tax deductions from the payment under section NC 2 and account for those deductions to Inland Revenue in the normal way. If an employer fails to make the required tax deductions from a payment, the employee is liable, under section NC 16, to pay an amount equal to those tax deductions to the Commissioner (and is also required to furnish to the Commissioner an employer monthly schedule showing details of the payment). C. When the payment is derived by the employee Under section EB 1 (1), an employee derives a payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under the Employment Relations Act 2000 when the employee receives the payment, or when the payment is credited to an account or otherwise dealt with on the employee’s behalf. A person who is a shareholder-employee for the purposes of section EB 1 (as defined in sections OB 1 and OB 2 (2)) derives a payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration under the Employment Relations Act 2000, in the income year that the expenditure on that award is deductible to the employer. If the expenditure on the award is not deductible to the employer, the shareholder-employee derives the award in the year of receipt. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received between 1 October 2000 and 30 September 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12 th day of June 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 2 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 01/06 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/06 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Rulings BR Pub 97/7 and 97/7A published in TIB Volume 9, No 6 (June 1997). The Ruling applies for the period from 1 October 2000 to 30 September 2005. The commentary refers to the Income Tax Act 1994, particularly section CH 3 and the concept of “gross income”. Background The Employment Relations Act 2000 provides for a number of remedies when an employee has a personal grievance against a current or former employer. This includes compensation for wages lost by the employee as a result of actions by the employer which are the subject of a personal grievance. Such compensation will usually be awarded under sections 123(b) or 128 of the Act but may be made under another provision. For example, in Cleland v CIR AP 44/00 High Court, Hamilton, 30 April 2001, Hammond J was concerned with the assessability of part of an award made by the Employment Court in 1992. The Employment Court awarded compensation for lost wages up to the date of hearing under the equivalent of section 128 of the Employment Relations Act. An award for lost wages from that date on was made under the equivalent of section 123(c)(ii) which provides for compensation for the loss of a benefit. The law in this area seems to be evolving and while awards for lost wages or other remuneration are now generally made under section 123(b), the Ruling will apply under whatever provision such an award is made. This Ruling confirms the Commissioner’s existing practice in respect of the assessability and deduction of tax from awards for lost wages or other remuneration made under the Employment Relations Act 2000. Legislation Relevant provisions of the Employment Relations Act 2000 Section 103 of the Employment Relations Act 2000 (“the ERA”) defines “personal grievance” as: For the purposes of this Act, “personal grievance” means any grievance that an employee may have against the employee’s employer or former employer because of a claim⎯ (a) that the employee has been unjustifiably dismissed; or (b) that the employee’s employment, or 1 or more conditions of the employee’s employment (including any condition that survives termination of the employment), is or are or was (during 3 employment that has since been terminated) affected to the employee’s disadvantage by some unjustifiable action by the employer; or (c) that the employee has been discriminated against in the employee’s employment; or (d) that the employee has been sexually harassed in the employee’s employment; or (e) that the employee has been racially harassed in the employee’s employment; or (f) that the employee has been subject to duress in the employee’semployment in relation to membership or non-membership of a union or employees organisation. Section 103(3) provides: In subsection (1)(b), unjustifiable action by the employer does not include an action deriving solely from the interpretation, application, or operation, or disputed interpretation, application, or operation, of any provision of any employment agreement. Section 123(b) of the ERA states: Where the Authority or the Court determines that an employee has a personal grievance, it may, in settling the grievance, provide for any 1 or more of the following remedies: ... (b) the reimbursement to the employee of a sum equal to the whole or any part of the wages or other money lost by the employee as a result of the grievance ... Section 128 of the ERA states: (1) This section applies where the Authority or Court determines, in respect of any employee, - (a) that the employee has a personal grievance; and (b) that the employee has lost remuneration as a result of the personal grievance. (2) If this section applies then, subject to subsection (3) and section 124, the Authority must, whether or not it provides for any of the other remedies provided for in section 123, order the employer to pay to the employee the lesser of a sum equal to that lost remuneration or to 3 months’ ordinary time remuneration. (3) Despite subsection (2), the Authority may, in its discretion, order an employer to pay to an employee by way of compensation for remuneration lost by that employee as a result of the personal grievance, a sum greater than that to which an order under that subsection may relate. Section 124 of the ERA states: Where the Authority or the Court determines that an employee has a personal grievance, the Authority or Court must, in deciding both the nature and the extent of the remedies to be provided in respect of that personal grievance,⎯ (a) consider the extent to which the actions of the employee contributed towards the situation that gave rise to the personal grievance; and (b) if those actions so require, reduce the remedies that would otherwise have been awarded accordingly. 4 Application of the Legislation Monetary remuneration An award for lost wages or other remuneration is made to compensate the employee for wages or other remuneration he or she may have lost as a result of an action by the employer which has been the subject of a personal grievance by the employee against the employer. The wages or other remuneration that would have been received if it were not for the personal grievance are “monetary remuneration”. Section OB 1 defines “monetary remuneration” as meaning: ... any salary, wage, allowance, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer ... The words “emolument (of whatever kind) or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer ...” cover an award for lost wages or other remuneration. The payment of the award for lost wages or other remuneration is made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”, even though the payment is made to resolve a personal grievance rather than for services actually performed. A wide interpretation of the words “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service” was endorsed by the Court of Appeal in Shell New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, in response to Shell’s argument that a payment was not made in respect of or in relation to employment because it was not made under a contract of employment. The Court stated that the words “in respect of or in relation to” are words of the widest import. The Court also found that the words “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” were not to be read ejusdem generis with the preceding words, the genus being reward for services. Thus, for the purposes of the definition of “monetary remuneration”, the words “emolument ... or other benefit in money” are not confined to rewards for services. In Shell the Court found it important that the employees were only in a position to receive compensation payments (for changing the employees’ place of employment) because of their employment relationship with the employer. So, although the employees received compensation for the costs of moving rather than payments for services, this was still monetary remuneration. Similarly, the lost wages or other remuneration awarded on the personal grievance claim arise directly out of and as a result of an employee’s employment relationship with the employer. Again, although this is not a payment for services, it is within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. The earlier TRA decisions on the previous legislation also illustrate the wide meaning that may be attributed to the words “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. In Case L92 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,530, Barber DJ considered the term “monetary remuneration” in relation to a payment of compensation for unjustified dismissal under the Industrial Relations Act 1973. The compensation was calculated on the basis of the personal hurt and procedural unfairness suffered by the objector. Barber DJ found that, even though the compensation was damages in nature, 5 it was money received in respect of the objector’s employment. He stated that the words “compensation for loss of office or employment”, “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money” and “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer” have a wide embrace and go beyond the narrower concept of “salary, wage, allowance, bonus gratuity, extra salary” which precede them. On the particular facts of this case he said that “monetary remuneration”, interpreted widely, covered the payment in issue. Barber DJ reached the same conclusion in relation to a similar compensation payment in Case L78 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,451. This case examined the nature of an ex gratia payment made to an employee as a result of a personal grievance claim brought against the employer under section 117 of the Industrial Relations Act 1973 which covered reimbursement for lost wages. The ex gratia payment was made up of six weeks’ holiday pay and pay for untaken sick leave. This holiday and sick leave was not owing to the taxpayer. The payment, which the taxpayer said he regarded as “extra wages”, was held to fall within the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section 2 of that Act. In Case P19 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,127, Barber DJ examined whether a severance payment of $77,598 paid to an objector by his overseas employer was assessable income. The objector was a jockey who entered into a three-year oral contract to ride his employer’s horses. The employer became dissatisfied with the objector’s performance and unilaterally terminated the contract after about 4 months. After negotiation, the matter was settled on the basis that the employer made the severance payment. Barber DJ held that “the severance payment was made as compensation for the objector’s loss of income due to the millionaire having terminated the contractual relationship”. He inferred that “the payment was a top-up of the first year’s minimum income” made to “assist the objector re-build his income earning process” and said that that type of payment “must be revenue in nature”. He stated that: In terms of the definition of “monetary remuneration”, the payment made to the objector must be “compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer;” Although not concerning a Court award, Case P19 supports the proposition that payments made as compensation for loss of income fall within the definition of monetary remuneration. In Case S96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603 and Case U38 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,361 the taxpayers in each case did not dispute that the portion of their compensation payment that was for lost wages was taxable, and this was accepted by the TRA. Doogue J in the High Court decision in Sayer v CIR (1999) 19 NZTC 15,249 also accepted the assessability of the part of a settlement agreement attributed to lost remuneration. In Case U39 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,369 an IRD officer was awarded compensation of $126,000 being $46,000 (loss of wages), $30,000 (humiliation), and $50,000 (loss of benefits) by the Employment Court in 1992. The Commissioner accepted that the humiliation payment was not assessable and assessed the balance of $96,000. 6 Barber DJ readily found that the compensation for lost wages was monetary remuneration, and so was the compensation for loss of benefits. He said (at paragraph 26, p 9,374): Awards made by the Employment Court pursuant to ss 227(c)(ii) above and 229 (for lost income) of the Labour Relations Act 1987 are generally deemed to be “monetary remuneration” and assessable income pursuant to s 65(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Indeed, because awards under s 229 are a reimbursement of, or compensation for, “lost remuneration” for the worker, any such award (in this case $50,000 \[sic\] of the $96,000 in issue) must, obviously, be revenue in character and within the above s 2 (of the Act) definition of “monetary remuneration”, and assessable. (Section 128 of the Employment Relations Act 2000 is the equivalent of section 229 of the Labour Relations Act). In his decision on appeal dated 30 April 2001, Hammond J upheld the TRA’s decision: Cleland v CIR AP44/00 High Court, Hamilton. He found that the reimbursement of lost wages was “monetary remuneration”, saying, at paragraph 41: I cannot see how the loss of wages due up to the date of hearing under s229 ($46,000) is not “monetary remuneration” under s2 of the Income Tax Act 1976. He went on to find that the $50,000 awarded by the Employment Court under section 227(c)(ii) for loss of benefits, which included an element of future wages, was also assessable as “monetary remuneration”. As noted earlier in this commentary, the law in this area seems to have moved on from requiring a division of awards of lost wages between those up to the date of the hearing (under the reimbursement remedy), and those from that date on (under the loss of benefits remedy). Compensation for lost wages, including those that the employee would have been likely to receive over some future period but for the grievance, are generally awarded under section 123(b) of the Employment Relations Act. See for example Trotter v Telecom Corporation of NZ Ltd \[1993\] 2 NZER 659. These cases clearly indicate that an award for lost wages or other remuneration is assessable as monetary remuneration. All monetary remuneration is gross income of the employee. When the employment relationship has ended In some cases the employment relationship of the employer and employee will have ended by the time the employer pays the court award to the employee. The fact that the employment relationship may have ended by the time the employer pays the award does not change the fact that the award is made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service” of the former employee. In Freeman & Ors. v FC of T (1982) 82 ATC 4629 the Supreme Court of Victoria found that a payment is made “in relation to the employment” of a former employee when the entitlement to that payment arises out of the employment or from services performed by the employee before the termination of employment. In Freeman the taxpayers were directors, shareholders, and employees of the appellant company which ceased to carry on business. The next day the business was 7 sold to another company controlled by the taxpayers and carried on business as before. Six months later it was decided that the appellant company should pay to each of the taxpayers certain lump sum payments. The evidence suggested that the source of the greater part of the payments consisted of fees (or “salaries”) received by the appellant company after it ceased carrying on business. The Court found that the payments received by the appellants were assessable income under section 26(e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936-1978. Section 26(e) provided that assessable income included the value to the taxpayer of all allowances, gratuities, compensations, benefits, bonuses and premiums given to him or her in relation directly or indirectly to their employment or services rendered by him or her. Kaye J found that payments out of the income of the appellant company to employees by way of allowances for past services, which had been rendered by them, were within section 26(e). The decision on this aspect of the case was unchanged when the appeal was heard by the Federal Court. Awards for lost wages or other remuneration arise out of the employee’s previous service with the employer. A court award that compensates for lost wages or other remuneration is made as a result of the employee’s service with the employer, and so is made in relation to the employment of the employee. Employer’s liability to make tax deductions from the award for lost wages or other remuneration The Ruling states that the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration is a source deduction payment. Under section NC 2 (1), an employer must make the appropriate tax deduction from every source deduction payment made to an employee. Award is a source deduction payment The definition in section OB 2 (1) of “source deduction payment” includes a payment by way of salary or wages, an extra emolument, or a withholding payment. Section OB 1 defines “extra emolument” as: ... in relation to any person, means a payment in a lump sum (whether paid in one lump sum or in 2 or more instalments) made to that person in respect of or in relation to the employment of that person (whether for a period of time or not), being a payment which is not regularly included in salary or wages payable to that person for a pay period, but not being overtime pay ... An award for lost wages or other remuneration is generally paid in a lump sum. As discussed above, the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration is made to a person in respect of or in relation to the employment of that person. As the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration is made in a lump sum, is in respect of or in relation to employment of a person, and is not a payment of salary or wages, it is an extra emolument. As the payment of the award is an extra emolument, it is included in the definition of “source deduction payment”. 8 A former employee is an “employee” Section NC 2 requires an employer to make tax deductions from source deduction payments to employees. Section OB 1 defines “employee” as a person who receives or is entitled to receive a source deduction payment. As discussed above, the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration constitutes a source deduction payment. A payment can still be “monetary remuneration” and a source deduction payment when it is paid to a former employee. A former employee who is entitled to receive this source deduction payment is also an “employee” for the purposes of section NC 2 (even though he or she may no longer be in an employment relationship with the employer). The appropriate tax deduction Section NC 2 requires the employer to make the appropriate tax deduction from source deduction payments to employees. As the payment of an award for lost wages or other remuneration constitutes an “extra emolument”, the employer must deduct tax at the extra emolument rate as provided for in section NC 2(5) and clause 8 of Schedule 19. (This currently provides a minimum rate of 21 cents in the dollar, or 33 cents or 39 cents in the dollar depending on the recipient’s income level, or on whether the recipient makes an election for a particular rate under section NC 8(1A).) The employer must also: • deduct ACC earner premium and earners’ account levy from the payment; and • account for the deductions to Inland Revenue in the normal way and pay the remaining amount to the employee; and • pay employer premium and residual claims levy in respect of the gross award for lost wages or other remuneration. By deducting tax from the gross award and paying the net sum to the employee, the employer will satisfy the requirements under both the court award and the Income Tax Act. When an employer has deducted tax from a source deduction payment, section NC 19 (a) deems the employer to have paid the amount deducted to the employee. Thus, the employer is deemed to have paid the total amount of the award to the employee for the purposes of satisfying the obligation imposed by the Court or Authority. When the Court or Authority awards a net sum In some cases a Court or Authority may make an award for lost wages or other remuneration net of tax, i.e. the sum that the employee would have received as remuneration after the deduction of tax. Because it is a “source deduction payment”, in such cases the employer would normally “gross up” the award to take account of the PAYE, the ACC earner premium, and the earners’ account levy. The employer is then required to pay the tax on the gross of the net award to Inland Revenue and pay 9 the net award to the employee. In this way the employer would fulfil his or her obligations to both the employee and the Commissioner. If the employer breaches the Court’s or the Authority’s direction to pay the net sum to the employee, the onus will be on the employee to enforce the terms of the award by requiring the employer to pay the employee the full net amount of the award. The required tax deduction must be made from whatever amount is paid to the employee. When an employer fails to make tax deductions Under section 168 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, if the employer fails to make the correct tax deductions from the payment of the award, the unpaid tax deductions become a debt owed by the employer to the Commissioner. The debt is due and payable on the date that the tax deductions were due to be paid to the Commissioner. Where an employer fails to make a deduction, the employee is liable, under section NC 16, to: • furnish the Commissioner with an employer monthly schedule containing particulars of the source deduction payment (i.e. the award) by the 20th of the month following the payment of the award; and • pay the Commissioner a sum equal to the tax deductions that the employer should have made on that source deduction payment (unless the employee is exempted from this requirement) by the 20th of the month following the payment of the award. When the payment is derived by the shareholder-employee Under section EB 1, a person is a shareholder-employee if he or she is a shareholder- employee in a close company and has met the criteria set out in section OB 2 (2). Example 1 An employee is dismissed from her job. She issues proceedings against her former employer alleging unjustifiable dismissal. She seeks reinstatement and damages for wages lost as a result of the unjustifiable dismissal. The Employment Relations Authority orders the employer to reinstate the employee and awards her $27,000, a sum equivalent to the employee’s wages from the time of dismissal to the time of reinstatement, to compensate for the wages lost as a result of the unjustified dismissal. The Authority makes the award for lost wages on 20 March 2001. The employer pays this award to the employee on 10 April 2001. 1. The award for lost wages is derived by the employee in the 2001-02 income year, as this is the year of receipt. 10 2. The employer must deduct tax and ACC earner premium and earners’ account levy from the court award, and pay the following amounts to the employee and Inland Revenue respectively (in the 2002 income year): Award for lost wages $27,000 Less tax at the extra emolument rate, in this case 21% $5,670 Less ACC earner premium.($27,000 x 0.011) $ 297 Total payable to Inland Revenue $ 5,967 Total payable to the employee $21,033 Example 2 The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the Authority awards damages of $27,000 and states that this sum is net of tax. In order to ensure that it pays the employee a net sum of $27,000, the employer “grosses up” the payment by the extra emolument tax rate plus ACC earner premium and levy. The employer should make the following calculations and payments: Award for net lost wages $27,000.00 Divided by 0.779 (1 - 0.21 - 0.011) to give the gross wage $34.659.82 Less tax at the extra emolument rate of 21% $ 7,278.56 Less ACC earner premium ($34,659.82 x 0.011) $ 381.26 Total payable to Inland Revenue $ 7,659.82 Total payable to the employee $27,000.00 In both examples: • The employer must also pay the employer premium and residual claims levy on the gross award. • Any other source deduction payments received by the employee from that employer in the 4 weeks prior to payment of the award must also be taken into account in calculating her annualised salary or wages and determining the appropriate tax deduction rate. • If the employee is required to file an income tax return, she will include the amount of the award for lost wages in her return for the 2001-02 income year and claim the tax paid as a credit. 11
1 MAORI TRUST BOARDS: DECLARATION OF TRUST FOR CHARITABLE PURPOSES MADE UNDER SECTION 24B OF THE MAORI TRUST BOARDS ACT 1955 – INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 01/07 ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 97/8 which was published in TIB Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997). BR Pub 97/8 applied up until 31 March 2001. Therefore this new ruling still relates to the charitable status of trusts established by Maori Trust Boards pursuant to the execution of a declaration of trust, under section 24B(1) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955. However it should be noted that the reissue of BR Pub 97/8 is separate from the government discussion document on taxation issues relating to charities and non-profit bodies (Tax and Charities) which was released for public consultation on 14 June 2001, for comments by the end of July 2001. ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CB 4 (1)(c) and CB 4 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This arrangement is the derivation of income by a trust established by a Maori Trust Board pursuant to the execution of a declaration of trust, under section 24B(1) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, declaring that it stands possessed of any of its property upon trust for charitable purposes. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Where a Maori Trust Board executes a declaration of trust that it shall stand possessed of property for charitable purposes, under section 24B(1) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, the income of such a trust is exempt from income tax under sections CB 4 (1)(c) or CB 4 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994 if: • all of the purposes specified in the declaration of trust are purposes that are specified in sections 24 or 24A of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955; and • the Commissioner is satisfied that, with the exception of the charitable purpose requirement and the public benefit test, all other requirements of charitable status are met; and 2 • the declaration of trust has been submitted to and approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, as required by section 24B(3) of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955. 3 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to income derived by such a Maori Trust Board during income years falling within the period 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2006 (inclusive). This Ruling is signed by me on the 9 th day of July 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 4 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 01/07 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/07 (“the Ruling”). Background Sections CB 4 (1)(c) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1994 provide the following exemptions from income tax for income derived by a charitable trust: • Under section CB 4 (1)(c), income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes or by any institution established exclusively for charitable purposes (except income to which section CB 4 (1)(e) applies). • Under section CB 4 (1)(e), income derived from a business carried on by trustees in trust for charitable purposes or by any institution established exclusively for charitable purposes. Neither exemption is available if any person is able to influence the amount of any private pecuniary benefit from the trust. The exemption under CB 4 (1)(e) only applies to the extent that the charitable purposes are limited to New Zealand. Under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955, a Maori Trust Board may declare that it holds property in trust for charitable purposes. The income of the trust can only be applied for those purposes set out in sections 24 and 24A of that Act and which are specified in the declaration of trust. Section 24B deems the income of such a trust to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994. Income tax exemption - section CB 4 (1)(c) and (e) Section CB 4 (1) provides an exemption from income tax for: ... (c) Any amount derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes or derived by any society or institution established exclusively for charitable purposes and not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual, except where the income so derived is income to which paragraph (e) applies: ... (e) Any amount derived directly or indirectly from any business carried on by or on behalf of or for the benefit to trustees in trust for charitable purposes within New Zealand, or derived directly or indirectly from any business carried on by or on behalf of or for the benefit of any society or institution established exclusively for such purposes and not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. Provided that if those purposes are not limited to New Zealand the Commissioner may apportion the income in such manner as the Commissioner deems just and reasonable between those purposes within New Zealand and the like purposes out of New Zealand, and accordingly only a part of the amount may be exempt income:... Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 Section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 states: 5 (1) Any Board may from time to time, in its discretion, execute under its seal a declaration of trust declaring that it shall stand possessed of any of its property, whether real or personal, upon trust for charitable purposes. (2) Any income derived by the Board from any property to which the declaration relates shall be applied for such purposes referred to in section 24 or section 24A of this Act as may be specified in the declaration of trust; and, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994, any such income shall be deemed to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes. (3) No declaration of trust under this section shall have any force or effect unless it has been approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Sections 24 and 24A specify the purposes for which a Maori Trust Board may apply money. Application of the Legislation Charitable purposes For a trust to be considered charitable for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, it must generally meet the common law requirements of charity. That is, a trust must be established for a “charitable purpose”, and must meet what is known as the “public benefit test”. The term “charitable purpose” is defined in the Income Tax Act, as: ...includes every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community: The Court of Appeal noted in Molloy v CIR (1981) 5 NZTC 61,070 that the definition of charitable purpose in the Income Tax Act does not have the effect of enlarging or altering the ordinary, general law, meaning of charity. This means that it is necessary to refer to general law to determine whether any specific taxpayer, or activity, is charitable. In Commrs of IT v Pemsel \[1891\] AC 531, p.583, Lord Macnaghten determined that all charitable purposes fall within four classes of charity (known as the “Pemsel Heads”), namely: • the advancement of religion; • the relief of poverty; • the advancement of education; and • any other matter beneficial to the community. In addition to falling within one of the “Pemsel Heads”, with the exception of a trust for the relief of poverty, to be charitable in law a trust must be established for the benefit of the community or a sufficiently important class of the community, rather than for the benefit of private individuals. This requirement, which is in addition to the objects of the charity falling within one of the four heads listed above, is known as the public benefit test. The public benefit test has been endorsed and further developed by a large body of case law, including Verge v Somerville \[1924\] All ER 121, Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities Trust Company Limited \[1951\] 1 All ER 31, Davies v Perpetual Trustee 6 Co. (Ltd.) \[1959\] 2 All ER 128 and New Zealand Society of Accountants v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 148. 7 Section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 Section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 was inserted into that Act by section 3 of the Maori Trust Boards Amendment Act 1962. Section 24B permits the establishment of charitable trusts by Maori Trust Boards, and provides a concessionary tax treatment of the income of such trusts. There are two possible interpretations of the meaning of section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act: • The first interpretation is that a declaration can only be made under section 24B(1) if the purposes of the trust are exclusively charitable, i.e. “charitable” being interpreted as the common law meaning of the term. Although section 24B(2) only requires that the income of the trust must be applied for purposes referred to in section 24 and 24A, it follows from this approach that, as the trust must be also charitable, the income can only be applied for section 24 and 24A purposes that are themselves charitable. Such income would therefore be exempt under the provisions of the Income Tax Act. • The second interpretation is that the income of a section 24B trust can be applied for any of the purposes referred to in section 24 or 24A - whether those purposes are charitable under general law or not. However, this approach proceeds upon the basis that any income derived by the trust is deemed by section 24B(2), to the extent that it is applied for purposes specified in sections 24 and/or 24A, to be income derived in trust for charitable purposes for the purposes of the Income Tax Act, and therefore exempt from income tax. This is irrespective of whether the purpose is a purpose that would generally be considered charitable in law. The background papers relating to the introduction of section 24B, including Hansard, indicate that the new section was intended to remedy the concern, at the time, that trusts established by Maori Trust Boards were not considered charitable in terms of both the common law and the income tax legislation. This view of the law was confirmed by the Court in Arawa Maori Trust Board v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1961) 10 MCD 391. In that case Donne S M ruled that a trust established by the Arawa Maori Trust Board was not charitable because: • Many of the purposes specified in section 24 of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 were not charitable purposes under the general law; and • The trust failed the public benefit test because it was for the benefit of a group of persons determined by their bloodline, or whakapapa. The Court determined that such a group of people did not satisfy the public benefit test. Analysis The Commissioner believes the better view of the law to be that contained in the second interpretation, as set out above, and that the first interpretation was not what was intended by Parliament. 8 As has been noted, at the time that section 24B was enacted, it was strongly arguable, taking into account the Court decision in Arawa, that a trust that benefits a specific tribe or iwi, or the members of such a tribe or iwi, cannot be charitable at common law because it will not meet the requirements of the public benefit test. Therefore, it would be arguable that any trust established under section 24B could not be charitable, irrespective of the purposes for which it was established, because Maori Trust Boards are acknowledged by the Maori Trust Boards Act to be for the benefit of iwi and hapu determined on the basis of whakapapa. This would give rise to a situation where, despite the enactment of section 24B, trusts established by Maori Trust Boards would possibly continue to be denied charitable status, and the amendment would have no effective operation. Clearly, this cannot have been the intention of Parliament. Taking this into account, and after considering the available background documents, the Minister’s statement (as recorded in Hansard) and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s practice immediately following the enactment of section 24B, the Commissioner believes that the second interpretation is the correct view of the law. Under this interpretation, section 24B(1) allows a Maori Trust Board to declare that it holds property in trust for charitable purposes, and authorises the Trust Board to settle some of the Trust’s assets to a charitable trust. Section 24B(2) contains two limbs. The first limb states: Any income derived by the Board from any property to which the declaration relates shall be applied for such purposes referred to in section 24 or section 24A of this Act as may be specified in the declaration of trust; ... The Commissioner considers that this limb limits the purposes for which the income of a charitable trust can be applied to those purposes that are referred to in sections 24 and 24A. The purposes for which the income is to be applied must be specified in the declaration of trust. As previously noted, many of the purposes referred to in sections 24 and 24A may not be charitable purposes under common law. In addition, any trust established by a Trust Board is only allowed to apply its income for the benefit of the Trust Board’s beneficiaries, which are restricted, by the Maori Trust Boards Act, to the members of specified iwi. Such a requirement could mean that a trust would fail the public benefit test applied under the common law. However, the second limb of section 24B(2) deems the income of the trust to be “income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes”. The second limb states: and, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994, any such income shall be deemed to be income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes. Therefore, the effect of this section is to deem the income of the trust, even though it is established for purposes that may not be charitable in general law, to be “income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes” for the purposes of the Income 9 Tax Act 1994. This means that the requirements of sections CB 4 (1)(c) and (e) of the Income Tax Act 1994, to the extent that those sections only apply to “income derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes”, have been satisfied. It is, therefore, not necessary for such a trust to satisfy the common law requirements of “charitable purpose” and the “public benefit test”. However, it should be noted that section 24B(2) of the Maori Trust Boards Act only modifies the requirements of the Income Tax Act. It does not apply for any other purposes. Therefore, whatever may be the position of such a trust under common law and irrespective of whether the public benefit test would be failed in other contexts, the Commissioner is satisfied that in this provision Parliament intended for a trust established under section 24B to be treated as being a charitable trust for income tax purposes. The income of such a trust is therefore treated as having been derived for charitable purposes and as such is exempt from income tax under sections CB 4 (1)(c) or (e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Nevertheless, before that exemption can be applied, the requirements of section 24B(3) must be satisfied. That section requires a declaration of trust under section 24B(1) to be approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before it will take effect. The Commissioner must still be satisfied that the constituting documents of the trust meet the legal requirements of a charitable trust, other than the public benefit test discussed above. Approval of charitable trust As has been outlined earlier in this commentary, section 24B(2) of the Maori Trusts Board Act 1955 modifies the general law requirements of a trust established under subsection (1) to the extent that the trust is not required to satisfy the meaning of “charitable purpose” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the public benefit test. However, before such a trust will be approved by the Commissioner under section 24B(3) as wholly exempt from tax, the trust must still meet the other criteria of a charitable trust. For example, the Commissioner must also be satisfied that the declaration of trust provides that: • the charitable activities are restricted to New Zealand; • the rules of the trust cannot be changed in order to allow the income of the trust to be applied to purposes that are not specified in sections 24 or 24A of the Maori Trust Boards Act, or to otherwise affect the charitable nature of the trust; • no person is able to derive a personal pecuniary profit from the trust; • trustees are unable to materially influence their remuneration; • professional services provided by trustees to the trust are provided at commercial rates and that conflicts of interest are avoided; and • upon winding up, any remaining trust assets must be applied for charitable purposes. 10 This is not an exhaustive list of all matters that the Commissioner will consider when deciding whether or not a trust is charitable, and therefore entitled to the tax exemptions under sections CB 4 (1)(c) and (e). When a section 24B trust has previously obtained the approval of the Commissioner, as required by section 24B(3) of the Maori Trust Boards Act, that approval will continue to apply. Approval given by the Commissioner under section 24B(3) cannot be revoked. However, continued tax exemption in respect of the income of the trust is dependent on the trust continuing to apply its income for the purposes specified in the declaration. Comments on technical submissions received prior to the previous public ruling being issued When a draft public binding ruling on this subject was first made available for public comment, a number of submissions were received that disagreed with the views expressed in that draft ruling. In particular, those submissions noted that the Commissioner did not appear to have taken into account the use of a deeming provision in section 24B. That view, that the deeming provision effectively creates a charitable trust where one would not exist under general charitable law, was incorporated into the previous ruling and has been included in this ruling. A number of commentators also disagreed with the Court decision in Arawa and the general position of trusts for the benefit of iwi under the public benefit test. That issue was referred to in the commentary to the previous ruling, and is referred to in this commentary in so far as it is relevant to the issue being considered. While the Commissioner did consider the position of such trusts generally in an interpretation paper (IP3168) which went out for public consultation in January 2000 that matter has been put on hold pending the outcome of the recently released government discussion document on taxation issues relating to charities and non profit bodies. A submission was also received that argued that the Commissioner was not legally able to issue a binding ruling on the effect of a declaration made under a provision of an Act other than one of the Inland Revenue Acts. The Commissioner was, and is, of the view that he is able to issue this Ruling because it relates to the consequences of such a declaration under the income tax law and, in particular, to the application of sections CB 4 (1)(c) and CB 4 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. In the context of the previous ruling, Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu asked for the ruling to be expanded to deal specifically with its specific circumstances. The Ngai Tahu Trust Board executed a declaration of trust pursuant to section 24B in 1975. That Trust Board was dissolved by the Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu Act 1996, which also established the Runanga. All of the assets and liabilities of the former trust board were vested in the new Runanga. Section 30(1)(c) of the Te Runanga O Ngai Tahu Act provides: 30. Taxes and duties⎯(1) For the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts (as defined in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994) and any other enactment that imposes or provides for the collection of any tax, levy, or other charge,⎯ (c) Notwithstanding the dissolution of the Ngaitahu Maori Trust Board by this Act, any 11 income derived by Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu from any property to which a declaration of trust made by the Ngaitahu Maori Trust Board under section 24 B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955 and dated the 24 th day of March 1975 relates shall, if applied for the purposes specified in the declaration, be deemed, for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994, to be income derived by Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu in trust for charitable purposes. The Commissioner remains of the view that, notwithstanding the fact that the Trust Board has been dissolved and no longer exists, section 30(1)(c) provides that any income derived from property that was subject to the original declaration, to the extent that it is applied for the purposes specified in the declaration, shall be treated for tax purposes as being derived in trust for charitable purposes. This means that the income of the trust created under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act will continue to be exempt for tax purposes. Similar provisions may apply to other section 24B trusts established by Trust Boards that have since been dissolved. Application of this Ruling Section 91DA(1)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires the Commissioner to state the period for which a public binding ruling applies. The Commissioner has determined that this public ruling will apply to income derived by approved trusts during income years falling within the period 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2006, inclusive. Examples Example 1 A Maori Trust Board executes a declaration of trust under section 24B of the Maori Trust Boards Act 1955. The declaration provides that the trust will hold certain assets upon trust for charitable purposes. The declaration specifies that the income of the trust will be applied by making grants to reimburse any dental costs incurred by any of the beneficiaries, being members of the iwi. The declaration is submitted to the Commissioner who is satisfied that the purpose for which the trust’s income will be applied is a purpose specified in section 24 of the Maori Trust Boards Act (section 24(2)(a)(iii) “The promotion of health ... by providing, subsidising, or making grants for medical, nursing, or dental services”) and that there are adequate provisions in the Trust Deed to prevent the Trust’s income and assets from being used for other purposes. The Commissioner will therefore approve the declaration and the income of the trust will be exempt from income tax under sections CB 4 (1)(c) and CB 4 (1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994. 12 Example 2 A Maori Trust makes a declaration under section 24B for the same purpose as described in Example 1. The Commissioner is satisfied that the purpose for which the Trust’s income is to be applied is a purpose that is specified in either section 24 or section 24A of the Maori Trust Boards Act. However, it is found that the declaration does not prohibit the trustees from materially influencing the amount of remuneration that they receive. The declaration also does not provide for the disbursement of assets, upon winding up, to other charitable entities or purposes. The Commissioner will therefore decline approval until such time as the declaration is amended in such a manner to satisfy the Commissioner’s requirements.
1 FORESTRY RIGHTS – SECONDHAND GOODS GST INPUT TAX DEDUCTION PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 01/08 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 98/5 which was published in TIB Volume Ten, No. 12, December 1998. BR Pub 98/5 applies up until 30 September 2001. This new ruling takes into account minor changes to the legislation since BR Pub 98/5 was issued, and the commentary has been expanded. Its period of application is from 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2006. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of the section 2(1) definition of “secondhand goods”, section 3A(1)(c) definition of “input tax”, and section 20(3). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the supply to a GST registered person of a “forestry right” (as defined in the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983) by way of sale in the following circumstances: • The sale is not a taxable supply; and • The right is situated in New Zealand at the time of supply; and • The right is acquired by the registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies; and • The right has been used by at least one prior owner for its intrinsic purpose. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • A forestry right is a secondhand good for which an input tax deduction is available within the section 2(1) definition of “secondhand goods”, section 3A(1)(c) definition of “input tax”, and section 20(3). 2 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 October 2001 to 30 September 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 3 rd day of September 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication and Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 01/08 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusion reached in public ruling BR Pub 01/08 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in public ruling BR Pub 98/5 (Tax Information Bulletin Volume Ten, No. 12, December 1998 at page 43, under the heading “Forestry Rights – secondhand goods GST input tax deduction”). This Ruling extends that coverage to 30 September 2006. Background We had been asked to clarify whether a GST registered person who buys a forestry right by way of a non-taxable supply may make a secondhand goods input tax deduction. It had been unclear whether a forestry right can be a secondhand good. Legislation Section 2 of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 (“FRRA”) defines “forestry right” (for the purposes of that Act): Forestry right means a right created in accordance with this Act: Section 2A of the FRRA deals with the creation of forestry rights. It states: 2A Creation of forestry rights (1) A forestry right may be created by the proprietor of land⎯ (a) By creating in accordance with subsection (3); or (b) By granting to any other person; or (c) By reserving to the proprietor on the sale of the land,⎯ the right to⎯ (d) Establish, maintain, and harvest; or (e) Maintain and harvest,⎯ a crop of trees on that land. (2) The forestry right may also⎯ (a) Grant or reserve rights of access and rights of construction and use of tracks, culverts, bridges, buildings, and other works and facilities if those rights are ancillary to and necessary for the purposes of subsection (1): (b) Provide for charges, payments, royalties, or division of the crop or the proceeds of the crop,⎯ whether or not such rights or provisions are coupled with an obligation. (3) Despite any enactment or rule of law, the proprietor may, in accordance with this section, create a forestry right for the proprietor. (4) No right created under this section is capable of conferring a right of exclusive possession of the land. Section 3(1) of the FRRA states: Notwithstanding any rule of law or equity to the contrary, every forestry right shall be deemed to be a profit à prendre. 4 Section 2(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 defines “goods”: “Goods” means all kinds of personal or real property; but does not include choses in action or money. Section 3A(1)(c) defines “input tax” in relation to secondhand goods: (1) Input tax, in relation to a registered person, means⎯ .... (c) an amount determined under subsection (3) after applying subsection (2). Section 20(3) allows deductions from output tax, and states: (3) Subject to this section, in calculating the amount of tax payable in respect of each taxable period, there shall be deducted from the amount of output tax of a registered person attributable to the taxable period⎯ (a) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on an invoice basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax⎯ ... (ia) In relation to the supply of secondhand goods to which section 3A(1)(c) of the input tax definition applies, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during that taxable period: ... (b) In the case of a registered person who is required to account for tax payable on a payments basis or a hybrid basis pursuant to section 19 of this Act, the amount of input tax⎯ (i) In relation to the supply of goods and services made to that registered person, being a supply of goods and services which is deemed to take place pursuant to section 9(1) or section 9(3)(a) or section 9(3)(aa) or section 9(6) of this Act, to the extent that a payment in respect of that supply has been made during the taxable period: Application of the Legislation Under sections 2(1), 3A, and 20(3), seven conditions must be met before the purchase of a forestry right by a GST registered person will permit a secondhand goods input tax deduction: • Forestry rights must be “goods” as defined in section 2(1). • The supply of a forestry right must be by way of sale. • The supply of the forestry right must be a non-taxable supply. • The sale must involve payment in the taxable period for which an input tax deduction is sought. • The forestry right must be secondhand. • The forestry right must be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. 5 • The forestry right must be situated in New Zealand at the time of sale. The following paragraphs consider some of these requirements. “Goods” The Commissioner considers that a forestry right (as defined in section 2 of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983) is a “good” for GST purposes. “Goods” means all real and personal property but does not include choses in action. Section 3(1) of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 deems forestry rights to be profits à prendre. A profit à prendre is a right to take something off another person’s land. A profit à prendre is an interest in land. It is not a chose in action because the rights under a profit à prendre are of a possessory nature, whereas a chose in action can only be enforced by action. An example of a “chose in action” is the granting of a licence at a boat marina. The benefits arising from the licence cannot be obtained by taking possession of the licence, but by action against a licensor who refuses to honour the licence. On the other hand, a forestry right, which can be enforced by taking possession, is real property and a “good” for GST purposes. “Sale” A secondhand goods input tax deduction is only available if there is a supply by way of sale. Forestry rights are a form of transferable property right, like other profits à prendre, and may be sold. It will be a question of fact whether there has been a sale rather than a lease or sub-grant of a forestry right. Because of the definition of “input tax” in section 3A, a secondhand goods input tax deduction is available only where there is a sale (section 3A(2)). The sale must be by way of a non-taxable supply for an input tax deduction to be available. “Payment” An input tax deduction is only available to the extent that there has been payment for the goods in the relevant taxable period. Therefore, if there is a sale by instalments, input tax deductions are available only in the taxable period in which each instalment is paid. “Secondhand” The forestry right must be “secondhand” before an input tax deduction is available. The Commissioner considers that land is a secondhand good. This is supported by case law, e.g. Case N13 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,105. The Court of Appeal decision in Coveney v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,193 appears to have confirmed this view, notwithstanding earlier obiter dicta that land may not be a secondhand good in L R McLean v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,211 (CA) and King v Bennetts (1994) 16 NZTC 11,370. 6 However, when a specific interest in land, like a forestry right, is newly created, it is a unique mix of rights distinct from the original land over which it was created. Accordingly, the original creation of a forestry right cannot be a sale of secondhand goods. The forestry right is a new item of property. Before a forestry right can be a secondhand good, at least one prior owner must have made use of the right for its intrinsic purpose, L R McLean v CIR (CA), being some exercise of the rights conferred by the forestry right. A forestry right is a bundle of rights giving its owner the right to either: • establish, maintain and harvest; or • maintain and harvest, a crop of trees on that land. The forestry right will be considered a secondhand good so long as the prior owner has used the forestry right for its intrinsic purpose, namely has exercised some of the rights provided under that forestry right (for example the prior owner has established, maintained and/or harvested a crop of trees). Examples Example 1 Purchaser is a GST registered person who intends to enter the forestry industry in a small way. On 1 July 2000 she buys a forestry right from Supplier, who is not registered for GST. Supplier had bought the right 18 months earlier from a farmer who had decided not to diversify into forestry. Supplier had used the right on a small scale to remove a small amount of timber. The purchase price is $20,000 payable in four quarterly instalments. The first payment is made on 1 August 2000. Purchaser is entitled to a secondhand goods input tax deduction because the forestry right was disposed of by sale, the seller was unregistered (non-taxable supply), the forestry right was secondhand, and Purchaser acquired the right for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. In Purchaser’s next GST return (for the two months ending 31 August 2000) she should deduct as input tax the tax fraction of the amount of the first instalment ($5,000). Accordingly, she may deduct $555.55. Example 2 The same facts as example 1 above, but neither the Supplier nor any other previous owner has harvested any trees but the Supplier has used the existing forestry right to plant a crop of trees on the land. Once again a secondhand goods credit would be available as the Supplier has used the forestry right for one of its intrinsic purposes, being the right to establish a crop of trees.
1 TAXABILITY OF PAYMENTS UNDER THE HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 1993 FOR HUMILIATION, LOSS OF DIGNITY, AND INJURY TO FEELINGS PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 01/09 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Note (not part of ruling): This ruling replaces Public Ruling BR Pub 98/2 published in TIB Volume 10, No 3 (March 1998). This new ruling is essentially the same as the previous ruling. The main changes update relevant case law references and clarify the Commissioner’s approach to out of court settlements where he has some doubt about the amount attributed to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feeling. The ruling applies from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2006. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 5, CH 3, and the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is: • The payment of an award of damages to a complainant or aggrieved person by the Complaints Review Tribunal for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 for breaches of Part 2 of that Act where the complaint involves an employer/employee relationship; or • The making of a payment to a complainant or aggrieved person for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings pursuant to an out of court settlement genuinely based on the complainant’s rights to damages under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 for breaches of Part 2 of that Act where the complaint involves an employer/employee relationship. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Payments for damages that are genuinely and entirely awarded for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 are not “monetary remuneration” in terms of the definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Consequently, such payments do not form part of the gross income of the employee under section CH 3. 2 • Payments for damages that are genuinely and entirely awarded for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 are not gross income under ordinary concepts under section CD 5. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply to payments received between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2006. This Ruling is signed by me on the 7 th day of November 2001. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 01/09 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 01/09 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Ruling BR Pub 98/2 published in TIB Volume 10, No 3 (March 1998) at page 31. The Ruling applies for the period from 1 April 2001 to 31 March 2006. Background Under the Human Rights Act 1993 people can make a complaint to the Human Rights Commission (“the Commission”) regarding breaches of that Act. If the Commission is unable to settle the complaint, the matter may proceed to the Complaints Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”). The Human Rights Act 1993 provides protection for people in areas of public life against discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, religious or ethical belief, race, colour, ethnic or national origins, age, disability, political opinion, employment status, family status, and sexual orientation. The Tribunal is an independent body that hears and determines complaints that have been made to the Human Rights Commission, the Race Relations Office, the Privacy Commissioner, and the Health and Disability Commissioner which have been unable to be resolved. The Tribunal has the power of a court similar to the District Court, and its decisions can be enforced in the District Court if parties fail to comply with its orders or directions. Legislation Section 86(1) and (2) of the Human Rights Act provides a number of remedies for the Tribunal when the Tribunal determines that a breach of any of the provisions of Part 2 of the Human Rights Act has been committed: (1) In any proceedings before the Complaints Review Tribunal brought by the Proceedings Commissioner or the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person, the plaintiff may seek such of the remedies described in subsection (2) of this section, as he or she thinks fit. (2) If in any such proceedings the Tribunal is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the defendant has committed a breach of any of the provisions of Part II of this Act, it may grant one or more of the following remedies: (a) A declaration that the defendant has committed a breach of this Act: (b) An order restraining the defendant from continuing or repeating the breach, or from engaging in, or causing or permitting others to engage in, conduct of the same kind as that constituting the breach, or conduct of any similar kind specified in the order: (c) Damages in accordance with section 88 of this Act: 4 (d) An order that the defendant perform any acts specified in the order with a view to redressing any loss or damage suffered by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person as a result of the breach: (e) A declaration that any contract entered into or performed in contravention of any of the provisions of Part II of this Act is an illegal contract: (f) Relief in accordance with the Illegal Contracts Act 1970 in respect of any such contract to which the defendant and the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person are parties: (g) Such other relief as the Tribunal thinks fit. Section 88(1) of the Human Rights Act provides the circumstances in which damages may be awarded under the Act, including damages payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings: In any proceedings under sections 83(1) or section 83(4) of this Act, the Tribunal may award damages against the defendant for a breach of any of the provisions of Part II of this Act in respect of any one or more of the following: (a) Pecuniary loss suffered as a result of, and expenses reasonably incurred by the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person for the purpose of, the transaction or activity out of which the breach arose: (b) Loss of any benefit, whether or not of a monetary kind, which the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person might reasonably have been expected to obtain but for the breach: (c) Humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the complainant or, as the case may be, the aggrieved person. Part 2 of the Human Rights Act sets out what constitutes “unlawful discrimination” under that Act. Section 21 sets out the general prohibited grounds of discrimination, and sections 22 to 74 go on to deal with discrimination in specific situations. The Ruling considers whether such payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to the feelings of the employee are “monetary remuneration”. Paragraph (a) of the definition of “monetary remuneration” in section OB 1 states: “Monetary remuneration” ...means any salary, wage, allowance, bonus, gratuity, extra salary, compensation for loss of office or employment, emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer;... Section CH 3 states that “all monetary remuneration derived by a person is gross income”. Section CD 5 also states that “the gross income of a person includes any amount that is included in gross income under ordinary concepts”. Application of the Legislation If payments for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings, under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 were “monetary remuneration”, they would be included under section CH 3 as gross income. They would be included in the calculation of “net 5 income” under section BC 6, and would consequently form part of “taxable income” as calculated under section BC 7. Section OB 1 defines “monetary remuneration” to include any “...other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer...”. Payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 are a benefit in money. The issue is, therefore, whether these payments are made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of” the recipient. While many of the categories of discrimination in Part 2 of the Human Rights Act 1993 may relate, directly or indirectly, to an employer/employee relationship, it is clear that many of them are intended to apply to much wider situations. Consequently, in many instances of complaints under the Human Rights Act, payments awarded will be completely outside any employment relationship and will clearly not be “in respect of or in relation to employment”. In such cases payments under section 88(1)(c) will not fall within the definition of “monetary remuneration” and will not be included in the gross income of the taxpayer under section CH 3. The Ruling does not consider such situations. However, it is likely that complaints heard by the Tribunal under the Human Rights Act 1993 often will involve an employee/employer relationship. The question to be answered in the Ruling, therefore, is whether payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 where the complaint involves an employee/employer relationship are made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. The meaning of “in respect of or in relation to” The Court of Appeal has endorsed a very wide meaning of the phrase “in respect of or in relation to”. In Shell New Zealand Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303, where lump sum payments had been made by Shell to employees who transferred at the request of Shell, the Court discussed the relevant part of the definition of “monetary remuneration”. McKay J, delivering the judgment of the Court, said at page 11,306: The words “in respect of or in relation to” are words of the widest import. Although McKay J acknowledged that the payments in Shell were not made under the contract of employment in that case, this did not mean that the employees received the payment outside the employee relationship. The learned Judge had earlier referred to the fact that the payments were not expressly provided under the employees’ written employment contracts, but were made pursuant to Shell’s employment policy as a matter of discretion. They were still made “because he or she is an employee”. Other cases have also stressed the width of the words “in respect of or in relation to”. In the Queens Bench case of Paterson v Chadwick \[1974\] 2 All ER 772, Boreham J considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in relation to discovery, and adopted the comments of Mann CJ in the Australian case Trustees, Executors & Agency Co Ltd v Reilly \[1941\] VLR 110, where the learned Chief Justice said: 6 The words “in respect of” are difficult of definition but they have the widest possible meaning of any expression intended to convey some connection or relation in between the two subject-matters to which the words refer. Similarly, in Nowegijick v The Queen \[1983\] CTC 20 at page 25, the Supreme Court of Canada described the phrase “in respect of” as “probably the widest of any expression intended to convey some connection between two related subject-matters”. Recently, other New Zealand cases (Case U38 (2000) 19 NZTC 9,361 and CIR v Kerslake (2001) 20 NZTC 17,158) have considered the phrase “in respect of or in relation to”. Both cases are consistent with the authorities cited above in this commentary. Context may affect the meaning However, many cases have demonstrated that the meaning to be given to the phrase “in respect of or in relation to” may vary according to the context in which it appears. In State Government Insurance Office v Rees (1979) 144 CLR 549, the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the phrase “in respect of” in determining whether the debt due to the Government Insurance Office fell within section 292(1)(c) of the Companies Act 1961-1975 (Q.) as “amounts ... due in respect of workers’ compensation under any law relating to workers’ compensation accrued before the relevant date”. The Court held that amounts which could be recovered by the Government Insurance Office from an uninsured company pursuant to section 8(5) of the Workers’ Compensation Act 1916-1974(Q.) for money paid to workers employed by the uninsured company were not amounts due “in respect of” workers’ compensation under the Companies Act. At page 561 Mason J observed that: ... as with other words and expressions, the meaning to be ascribed to “in respect of” depends very much on the context in which it is found. Stephen J also discussed the meaning of the phrase “in respect of”, noting at pages 553- 554 that it was capable of describing relationships over a very wide range of proximity, and went on to say: Were the phrase devoid of significant context, it could, I think, be taken to be descriptive of the relationship between the present indebtedness owed to the State Government Insurance Office and the subject matter of workers’ compensation. However a context does exist which is in my view sufficient to confine the operation of s 292(1)(c) to bounds too narrow to be of service to the appellant. In TRA Case R34 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,190, certain payments were made to a New Zealand distributor by its overseas parent in relation to repairs which had to be made to cars sold to the New Zealand subsidiary and then sold to dealers. The issue was whether the payments were zero-rated for GST purposes. The definition of “consideration” in section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 was relevant. Part of the definition of “consideration” states: ...any payment made or any act or forbearance, whether or not voluntary, in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of, the supply of any goods and services ... 7 The TRA stated at page 6,200 that: A sub-issue is whether the reimbursing payment from the overseas manufacturer (MC) was made “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of” the repair work in the sense required by the definition of “consideration” in s 2 of the Act. ... Although the definition of consideration creates a very wide potential link between a payment and a particular supply it is, in any case, a matter of degree, commonsense, and commercial reality whether a payment is direct enough to have the necessary nexus with a service, i.e, whether the link is strong enough. The High Court’s decision on the appeal of Case R34 is CIR v Suzuki New Zealand Ltd (2000) 19 NZTC 15,819, which was later upheld by the Court of Appeal. In the High Court McGechan J said: ...it is necessary there be a genuine connection. The legislature is not to be taken as taxing on an unrealistic or tenuous connection basis. In Cleland v CIR (2001) 20 NZTC 17,086, the High Court has also recently considered the matter. At issue was the tax treatment of sums awarded to Mr Cleland by the Employment Court for a personal grievance he brought against his employer. The Employment Court awarded a total amount of $126,000 to Mr Cleland. This comprised $46,000 for loss of wages, $50,000 for loss of benefits, and $30,000 for humiliation. There was no issue regarding the amount paid for humiliation before Hammond J in the High Court, and accordingly he made no comment on this amount. He concluded that the amount paid for lost wages was therefore assessable as “monetary remuneration”. In respect of the further amount of $50,000, Hammond J concluded that it was compensation for loss of office or employment. In order to reach this conclusion Hammond J had to consider whether the amount was “in respect of or in relation to” Mr Cleland’s employment or service. Hammond J referred to the Court of Appeal decision in Shell and noted that those words are to be interpreted widely. Counsel for the taxpayer relied heavily on the Full Federal Court decision in Rowe. Hammond J stated at paragraphs 46 to 48 of his judgment: The award is clearly a “rolled up” one by the Employment Court in respect of or in relation to Mr Cleland’s past employment. ... As a sub-part of the argument, it was said for Mr Cleland that, because the award was calculated on future wages and benefits, it was not compensation for (past) loss of office or employment. That is not the test. The test is whether the wages and benefits actually awarded arose out of Mr Cleland’s employment. It does not at all follow that, because the award was made relating to a period after the termination of the employment, it was not made in respect of, or in relation to, the employment. As Mr Almao said, “compensation for loss of office or employment by its very nature encompasses future benefits; benefits that an employee might have received had his or her employment continued”. Not all payments to employees are “monetary remuneration” Not all payments to employees that have a connection with their work are within the definition of “monetary remuneration”. In Fraser v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,356, at page 12,363, Doogue J in the High Court said: 8 There is no dispute that the words “emolument (of whatever kind), or other benefit in money, in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer” are words of the widest possible scope: see Shell New Zealand Ltd v C of IR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,303 at page 11,306, and Smith v FC of T 87 ATC 4883; (1987) 164 CLR 513; (1987) 19 ATR 274. Mr Harley does, however, submit, correctly, that it does not follow that all payments made are necessarily income and refers, for example, to reimbursement payments. In FC of T v Rowe (1995) ATC 4,691 the taxpayer was employed as an engineer for the Livingston Shire Council. As a result of a number of complaints against him he was suspended. An inquiry was commenced, and he incurred legal costs as a result of engaging counsel to defend himself against dismissal during the course of the inquiry. The taxpayer was cleared of any charges of misconduct but was dismissed a year later. The taxpayer claimed his legal costs as a deduction. Although the Council refused to reimburse the taxpayer for his legal costs, the Queensland government subsequently made an ex gratia payment. The Full Federal Court considered, amongst other things, whether the ex gratia payment constituted assessable income. By majority, the Court concluded that the payment was not assessable under section 25(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 as income in accordance with ordinary concepts, nor was it assessable under section 26(e) of that Act as being compensation “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to” any employment. Accordingly, Burchett and Drummond JJ (with Beaumont J dissenting) held that the payment was not assessable. Burchett J held that the payment was not a reward for the taxpayer’s services but was a recognition for the wrong done to him. The payments were not remuneration but a reparation, and they were not sufficiently related to the performance of income-earning activities. On the same reasoning, it was too remote from the employment to be caught by section 26(e). Further, the payment was not assessable under section 26(e) because the employer/employee relationship between the Council and the taxpayer was merely part of the background facts against which the ex gratia payment was made. On appeal, the majority of the Full High Court confirmed the Federal Court’s decision: FC of T v Rowe (1997) ATC 4,317. In the Australian case of FCT v Dixon (1954) 5 AITR 443, the taxpayer received payments from his prior employer topping up his military pay. It would appear from the judgment that the Australian Commissioner argued that even a slight relationship to employment was sufficient to satisfy the test in section 26(e) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 \[which made assessable certain sums granted to the taxpayer “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment...”.\]. This argument was rejected by Dixon CJ and Williams J, who stated at page 446 that: We are not prepared to give effect to this view of the operation of s.26(e) ...There can, of course, be no doubt that the sum of £104 represented an allowance, gratuity or benefit allowed or given to the taxpayer by Macdonald, Hamilton and Company. Our difficulty is in agreeing with the view that it was allowed or given to him in respect of, or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of, or services rendered by him ...We are not prepared to give s.26(e) a construction which makes it unnecessary that the allowance, gratuity, compensation, benefit, bonus or premium shall in any sense be a recompense or consequence of the continued or contemporaneous existence of the relation of employer and employee or a reward for services rendered given either during the employment or at or in consequence of its termination. In the same case, at page 450, McTiernan J stated that: 9 The words of paragraph (e) are wide, but, I think, not wide enough to prevent an employer from giving money or money’s worth to an employee continuing in his service or leaving it, without incurring liability to tax in respect of the gift. The relationship of employer and employee is a matter of contract. The contractual relations are not so total and all embracing that there cannot be personal or social relations between employer and employee. A payment arising from those relations may have no connexion with the donee’s employment. These principles have also been applied by the courts in cases involving contracts for services. In Scott v FCT (1969) 10 AITR 367, Windeyer J in the High Court of Australia considered the meaning of the words “in respect of, or for or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment of or services rendered by him” in section 26(e) of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act 1936-1961. The case concerned a solicitor who received a gift of £10,000 from a grateful client. Windeyer J stated at page 374 that the meaning of the words of the legislation “must be sought in the nature of the topic concerning which they are used”. Windeyer J at page 376 referred to a passage from the judgment of Kitto J in Squatting Investment Co Ltd v FCT (1953) 5 AITR 496, at 524, where Kitto J (speaking of certain English cases) said: The distinction these decisions have drawn between taxable and non-taxable gifts is the distinction between, on the one hand, gifts made in relation to some activity or occupation of the donee of an income- producing character ... and, on the other hand, gifts referable to the attitude of the donor personally to the donee personally. Adopting this as a general principle, his Honour held that the £10,000 was not given or received as remuneration for services rendered and it did not form part of the taxpayer’s assessable income. A recent case discusses the words “in respect of the employment” in the Australian FBT legislation: J & G Knowles & Associates Pty Ltd v FC of T (2000) ATC 4,151. The case concerned interest-free loans to directors of a corporate trustee. Units in the trust fund were held by discretionary family trusts established by the directors. The lower courts were satisfied by a causal relationship, or a discernible and rational link between the loans and each director’s employment. However, the Full Federal Court said that there had to be more than just any causal relationship between the benefit and the employment: the link had to be sufficient or material. The nature and context of the payments The words “in respect of or in relation to” have been given a very wide meaning to classify most payments made by an employer as monetary remuneration. There must also be a sufficient or material relationship between the payment and the employment. Under the Employment Relations Act 2000 (“ERA”) it is true that if an employee were not an employee then there would be no entitlement to receive the payments under section 123(1)(c)(i) of the ERA for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings. However, those payments are not compensation for services rendered or for actions that occur in the normal course of the employment relationship. They are based on the existence of a personal grievance. Under section 88 of the Human Rights Act, damages may be awarded by the Tribunal for a breach of any of the provisions of Part 2 of that Act. As discussed above, breaches of Part 2 will not necessarily be in an employee/employer situation. If a claim is brought in 10 the Tribunal which does not involve an employee and employer relationship it is clear that payment under section 88(1)(c) cannot be described as monetary remuneration. Where the complaint brought before the Tribunal does occur in the context of an employee/employer relationship, the connection of the employment relationship with payments under the Human Rights Act is tenuous. The Human Rights Act is not “employment legislation”, although it may often operate in the employment context. Payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act for humiliation, loss of dignity, and injury to feelings are not compensation for services rendered or for actions that occur in the normal course of the employment relationship. Rather the payments would be in the nature of reparation for a wrong done to the complainant and so would not be in respect of employment. Payments of damages awards under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act 1993 differ markedly from the situation in Shell v CIR. In that case at page 11,306, McKay J said: It is true ...that the payment is not made under the contract of employment....It is nevertheless paid to an employee only because he or she is an employee, and is paid to compensate for the loss incurred in having to change the employee’s place of residence in order to take up a new position in the company. (Emphasis added) Thus, in the Shell case, the employees received the payments as employees, and in order to compensate for the loss sustained as a result of the employment-related relocation. The Commissioner considers payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act to be too remote from the employment relationship to be within the definition of monetary remuneration. If a complaint is brought in the Tribunal which involves an employee and an employer, the employment relationship in such instances is merely part of the background facts against which the damages payments are made. The payments are not made “in respect of or in relation to the employment or service of the taxpayer”. Income under ordinary concepts Payments for damages made under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act are not “gross income under ordinary concepts” under section CD 5. Although the legislation does not define “gross income under ordinary concepts”, a great number of cases have identified the concept by reference to such characteristics as periodicity, recurrence, and regularity, or by its resulting from business activities, the deliberate seeking of profit, or the performance of services (Scott v C of T (1935) 35 SR (NSW) 21 and Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176). It is clear that payments under section 88(1)(c) will not generally be made periodically or regularly, or generally recur. Nor as we have seen above, are they compensation for services. Capital receipts do not form part of “gross income” unless there is a specific legislative provision to the contrary. And by analogy with common law damages, damages payments under section 88(1)(c) of the Human Rights Act are of a capital nature as Barber DJ acknowledged in Case L92, where he stated at page 1,536 that: 11 I appreciate only too well that it is possible to interpret the evidence as showing that the $7,179.30 was formulated as a payment in the nature of common law damages for human hurt and breach and unfairness... I appreciate that the latter concepts are akin more to payments of capital than to wage revenue. Out of court settlements The Commission endeavours to settle disputes between parties and sometimes, the parties negotiate a settlement before the dispute is referred to the Tribunal. The settlement agreement may state that the payment is for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. In return for the complainant or aggrieved person surrendering his or her rights under the Human Rights Act, the other party will agree to pay a sum of money. There should be no difference in the tax treatment of the payments dependent on whether or not the parties use the Tribunal. A payment can be for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to the feelings of the complainant or aggrieved person whether the Tribunal is involved or not. Shams The Ruling will not apply to payments which are akin to sham payments. A sham is a transaction set up to conceal the true intention of the parties and is inherently ineffective. The nature of a sham was discussed by Diplock LJ in Snook v London and West Riding Investment Ltd \[1967\] 1 All ER 518 at 528 where he stated: I apprehend that, if it has any meaning in law, it means acts done or documents executed by the parties to the “sham”, which are intended by them to give to third parties or to the court the appearance of creating between the parties legal rights and obligations different from the actual legal rights and obligations (if any) which the parties intend to create. Richardson J, in the New Zealand case of Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, stated that the “essential genuineness of the transaction is challenged” in a sham situation. It is noteworthy that, in the Taxation Review Authority decision, Case S 96 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,603, Judge Barber stated at page 7,606: Of course, seemingly excessive allocations to compensation for feelings injury should be reopened by the IRD. If the parties to an agreement agree to characterise or describe payments as being for humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings when they are in reality for lost wages, this transaction would be a sham which would be open to challenge by the Commissioner. Where the Commissioner has some doubt about the amount attributed to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings, he may ask the parties to an agreement what steps they took to evaluate objectively what would be a reasonable amount to attribute to humiliation, loss of dignity, or injury to feelings. This would be so regardless of whether the payment was made as a result of an out of court settlement and whether or not the agreement is settled by the Human Rights Commissioner under the Human Rights Act. The onus of proof regarding the taxability of any such payment would be on the taxpayer.
1 SUBSIDISED TRANSPORT PROVIDED BY EMPLOYERS TO EMPLOYEES – VALUE FOR FRINGE BENEFIT TAX PURPOSES PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 02/01 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 99/2 which was published in TIB Volume 11, No. 5 (May/June 1999). Its period of application is from 1 July 2002 to 1 July 2007. Some formatting and other minor changes have been made. BR Pub 99/2 applied up until 30 June 2002. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CI 1, CI 2(1), CI 3(6), CI 4(1), CI 4(4), and the definition of “subsidised transport” in section OB 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of: • Transportation or entitlement to transportation to an employee by the employer of that employee, where that employer carries on a business that consists of or includes transportation of the public; or • Transportation or entitlement to transportation to an employee by a person with whom the employer of that employee has entered into an arrangement for the provision of that transportation or entitlement to transportation, where that employer carries on a business that consists of or includes transportation of the public. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • Where transportation or entitlement to transportation is provided by the employer to an employee, the value of the benefit for fringe benefit purposes is 25% of the highest amount charged by the employer to the public for transportation or entitlement to transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion. • Where transportation or entitlement to transportation is provided to an employee by a third party with whom the employer has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided or granted to the employee, the value of the benefit for fringe benefit purposes is the greater of: 2 • 25% of the highest amount charged by the third party to the public for transportation or entitlement to transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; or • The amount that the employer is so liable to pay or has so paid to the third party for the benefit being provided by the third party. In the definition of “subsidised transport” in section OB 1, “class” refers to the classes of transportation available, such as first, business, or economy class; “extent” refers to transportation with the same departure and destination points; and “occasion” refers to the time of carriage. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 2002 to 1 July 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 13th day of September 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 3 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 02/01 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 02/01 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in BR Pub 99/2, which applied up until 30 June 2002. In this commentary, the terms “transport” and “transportation” include both transportation and entitlement to transportation. Background Employers who are in the business of providing transportation to the public may provide transportation to their staff, either free or at a price lower than that paid by the public. These employers may also enter into arrangements with third parties to provide the employers’ staff with either free transportation or transportation at a price lower than that paid by the public. If the provision of this transportation falls within the definition of “subsidised transport”, it is a fringe benefit. The employer will be liable to pay fringe benefit tax in accordance with the FBT rules. This Ruling applies where an employer, who carries on a business that consists of or includes transportation of the public, provides transportation to an employee of that employer, or enters into an arrangement with another person for transportation to be provided or granted by that person to an employee of the employer. Legislation Section CI 1 states: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) income year, means any benefit that consists of— ... (d) Any subsidised transport: ... (h) Any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee in the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) income year, — being, as the case may be, private use or enjoyment, availability for private use or enjoyment, a loan, subsidised transport, a contribution to a fund referred to in paragraph (e), a specified insurance premium or a contribution to an insurance fund of a friendly society, a contribution to a superannuation scheme, or a benefit that is used, enjoyed, or received, whether directly or indirectly, in relation to, in 4 the course of, or by virtue of the employment of the employee (whether that employment will occur, is occurring, or has occurred) and which is provided or granted by the employer of the employee; but does not include ... “Subsidised transport” is defined in section OB 1: “Subsidised transport”, in the FBT rules, means the provision, in any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) income year, by an employer, being a person who carries on a business that consists of or includes the transportation, for hire or reward, of persons who are members of the general public, to an employee of the employer of carriage or entitlement to carriage in the course of the transportation (not being transportation in a motor vehicle) where the amount (if any) paid by the employee of the employer in respect of the carriage or entitlement to carriage is less than the amount that is the highest amount charged, in the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) income year in which the provision occurs, by the employer of the employee for the provision by that employer, to persons who are members of the general public, of carriage or, as the case may be, entitlement to carriage that is of the same class and extent and on or for the same occasion or occasions as the class and extent and occasion or occasions of the carriage or the entitlement to carriage first mentioned in the definition. The main valuation provision for subsidised transport is section CI 3(6), which states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, the value of any fringe benefit, being a benefit that consists of subsidised transport provided in any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) income year, by an employer, shall be the greater of— (a) 25% of the amount that, in relation to the subsidised transport so provided is, within the meaning of the definition of “subsidised transport”, the highest amount charged by the employer: (b) The amount that the employer is so liable to pay or has so paid for the benefit being provided. Section CI 4(1) states: Subject to this section, for the purposes of the FBT rules the taxable value of any fringe benefit provided by the employer of the employee in any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) in any income year shall be the value of that fringe benefit, reduced by— (a) The amount (if any) paid by the employee (or, where section GC 15(1) applies, by the associated person) in relation to the quarter or the income year for the receipt or enjoyment of that fringe benefit (not being an amount paid for the acquisition or improvement by the employee or associated person of an asset the receipt or enjoyment of which does not constitute the fringe benefit), except where the fringe benefit is an employment related loan: Section CI 4(4) states: Where any fringe benefit of the kind referred to in paragraph (d) or paragraph (h) of the definition of “fringe benefit” in section CI 1 results from any expenditure incurred by an employer in respect of accommodation or transportation provided for or to an employee, and— (a) That expenditure is incurred in relation to travel undertaken by the employee to enable the employee to perform the duties of the employee’s employment and is not incurred directly (whether wholly or in part) in respect of or in relation to— 5 (i) The providing by the employer of the employee, to or for the employee, of any period of leave or vacation: (ii) The taking by the employee of any such period of leave or vacation: (iii) The providing of any transport for the purposes of the providing by the employer of the employee or the taking by the employee of any such period of leave or vacation; and (b) Had the fringe benefit not resulted from that expenditure, that expenditure would not have been less in amount,— the taxable value of that fringe benefit shall be nil. In relation to benefits provided by third parties, section CI 2(1) states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, where a benefit is provided for or granted to an employee by a person with whom the employer of the employee has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided or granted, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. The definition of an “arrangement” is provided in section OB 1: “Arrangement” means any contract, agreement, plan or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. Application of the Legislation The legislative provisions concerning the valuation of subsidised transport provided to employees are uncertain in their application. This Ruling sets out how the Commissioner will interpret these provisions. Subsidised transport may be provided to an employee by the employee’s employer or by a third party that has an arrangement with the employer to provide the employee with a benefit. These two situations are discussed separately below. Subsidised transport provided by the employer The valuation of subsidised transport provided by an employer to an employee of that employer is provided for in section CI 3(6). This requires the value to be the greater of: • 25% of the highest amount charged by the employer to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; and • the amount that the employer is liable to pay or has so paid for the benefit being provided. Some commentaries on the value of subsidised transport refer to the cost to the employer of providing the transportation. This has caused confusion about whether costs incurred by an employer itself in providing transportation to an employee, such 6 as the cost of food and fuel on an airline, should be taken into account in the second limb of section CI 3(6). It is the Commissioner’s view that section CI 3(6)(b) was inserted into the valuation provision to provide for the situation where the transport is provided by a third party and the employer pays more to the third party for the transport than 25% of the highest fare. Previously, the valuation provision referred only to 25% of the highest fare. The words “liable to pay or has so paid” in section CI 3(6)(b) do not refer to the cost to the employer. Paragraph (b) of section CI 3(6) only applies when an employer actually pays a third party to provide transportation for its employees. This situation is discussed below. If an employer provides transportation itself, there will generally be no amount that the employer is liable to pay, as the employer does not charge itself for the employee’s transportation. While the employer may incur costs in providing the transportation, these are not to be taken into account in determining the value of the benefit. In summary, it is the Commissioner’s view that, where the transportation is provided by an employer to an employee of that employer, the value of the benefit is 25% of the highest fare charged to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion. The meaning to be given to the “highest fare”, “class”, “extent”, and “occasion” is discussed below. Subsidised transport provided by a third party that has an arrangement with the employer The valuation of subsidised transport provided by a third party that has an arrangement with the employer to provide transport to an employee of that employer is also provided for in section CI 3(6). The interpretation of this section is problematic. This is in part due to the effect of section CI 2(1). Under section CI 2(1), if an employer has entered into an arrangement with another person to provide a benefit to an employee of that employer, the benefit is deemed to be provided by the employer. Interpreting section CI 3(6) without reference to section CI 2(1), the benefit is valued as the greater of: • 25% of the highest amount charged by the employer to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; and • the amount that the employer is liable to pay or has so paid for the benefit being provided. If the employer offers the same transportation to the public that was arranged to be provided to the employee by the third party, an amount will be charged by the employer to the public for the same transportation. In this instance, the benefit will be the greater of the two options. However, in the majority of cases, the employer will not provide the same transportation to the public as that arranged with the third party to be provided for the 7 benefit of the employee. In this instance, there is no amount charged by the employer to the public for that transportation. The value of the benefit depends on the amount paid by the employer for the third party to provide the benefit. That is, it is only paragraph (b) of section CI 3(6) that is relevant. However, section CI 2(1) affects this interpretation. This section deems a benefit provided to an employee by a person with whom the employer has an arrangement to be provided by the employer. Reading section CI 3(6) in conjunction with section CI 2(1) may require ascertaining the highest amount charged by the third party to the public and the amount that the third party is liable to pay or has so paid. That is, reading the word “employer” in section CI 3(6) as the third party. In other words, the highest amount charged by the employer refers to the highest amount charged by the third party, and the amount the employer is liable to pay or has so paid is a reference to the amount that the third party is liable to pay or has so paid. On the same reasoning that an employer does not charge itself for providing transportation to its employees, the third party does not charge itself for providing transportation to employees of the employer. Accordingly, the value of the benefit depends on the amount charged by the third party to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion. Therefore, only paragraph (a) of section CI 3(6) is relevant here. Alternatively, section CI 2(1) may not require reading the word “employer” in section CI 3(6) as the third party. If this approach is taken, section CI 3(6) would be interpreted in the same manner as above where no account was taken of section CI 2(1). That is, it is only paragraph (b) of section CI 3(6) that is relevant here. The above interpretations, with and without reference to section CI 2(1), with the exception of the limited instance where the employer provides the same transportation service to the public as that provided to the employee by the third party, deny the requirement that the benefit be valued at the greater of two options of any meaning. However, combining the results from the two interpretations would give this requirement meaning in all circumstances. For example, the value of the benefit is the greater of: • 25% of the highest amount charged by the third party to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; and • the amount that the employer is liable to pay or has so paid for the benefit being provided by the third party. It is acknowledged that this approach, which interprets the word “employer” in a different manner under each limb of section CI 3(6), is inconsistent with a strict literal interpretation of the section. However, it is the Commissioner’s view that, as the wording used in the legislation is less than ideal, this is the better approach where a benefit is provided by a third party. In summary, it is the Commissioner’s view that if transportation is provided to an employee by a third party with whom the employer has entered into an arrangement 8 for that benefit to be provided or granted to the employee, the value of the benefit is the greater of: • 25% of the highest fare charged by the third party (with whom the employer has an arrangement) to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; and • the price the employer paid or is liable to pay to the third party with whom the employer has an arrangement for the benefit being provided. If the employer is not required to pay the third party with whom the employer has an arrangement, i.e. there is no price paid or payable by the employer for the benefit, the benefit is valued at 25% of the highest fare charged to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion. That is, only paragraph (a) of section CI 3(6) has relevance in this situation. Other issues Carriage and entitlement to carriage A benefit arises on the provision to an employee of carriage or an entitlement to carriage. “Carriage” refers to the actual carriage on the particular transport, whereas “entitlement to carriage” refers to a specific right to carriage in the future. For example, a bus pass and an airline ticket are both entitlements to carriage. They both provide the employee with a future right to carriage. If the employee is not entitled to claim a specific right to carriage, e.g. because certain conditions must be met before the entitlement to carriage arises, there is no entitlement to carriage unless those requirements are fulfilled. For example, if an employee is provided with a standby ticket which is subject to the limitation that carriage will only be provided if special loading requirements are met, no entitlement to carriage arises until these requirements have been fulfilled and the employee is entitled to the future right to carriage. The employee may then choose whether or not to use the entitlement to carriage. No benefit to the employee will arise if the special conditions that the ticket is subject to are not fulfilled as no entitlement to carriage or carriage will have arisen. Special conditions that employees may be subject to can be distinguished from intrinsic limitations that everyone is subject to, such as there being available seats on a bus when using a bus pass, for example. An employee with a bus pass has an entitlement to carriage, even though he or she may not gain carriage on the first bus that comes along because it happens to be full. In other words, the availability of seats is not a special condition that must be fulfilled before the entitlement to carriage arises, but a limitation inherent in bus travel to which everyone is subject. This situation can be contrasted with a standby fare, where certain conditions must be fulfilled before the entitlement to carriage arises at all. That is, where an employee is told that he or she will receive an entitlement to carriage or carriage provided certain conditions are first met. 9 A further issue that has been raised in relation to entitlement to carriage is the suggestion that entitlement to carriage refers only to carriage with restrictions attached. The example was given of standby type restrictions. The Commissioner does not agree with this interpretation. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, no entitlement to carriage will arise until any prerequisites to there being a specific right to future carriage have been satisfied. Special conditions or restrictions attached to a ticket are taken into account in the legislation by the use of a 25% basis for calculating the value of the benefit. This percentage reflects that employees may be subject to special standby type conditions, and therefore the value of the benefit should not be based on the full fare paid by the public. The benefit to the employee arises on the provision of the carriage or entitlement to carriage. It is irrelevant if the entitlement to carriage is not subsequently used by the employee. A benefit does not arise when a carriage is taken pursuant to an entitlement to carriage. For example, say an employee has been provided with a bus pass that entitles her to “free” carriage. A member of the public who has purchased a similar pass will also be provided with carriage without having to pay any more. No benefit arises to the employee in this situation. As neither the employee nor the member of the public is charged for the actual carriage, the employee does not receive the carriage for an amount less than the amount charged to the public. The legislation does not tax the one benefit as an “entitlement to carriage” and then subsequently as “carriage”. Further, such carriage would not constitute a fringe benefit under section CI 1(h), being “\[a\]ny benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee ... ”, as carriage consequent upon an entitlement to carriage cannot be considered a benefit additional to the benefit conferred by the entitlement to carriage. Such carriage is not the provision of a new benefit, but rather the utilisation of a benefit already in existence. A transportation benefit will not come within the “subsidised transport” definition if the same transportation is not sold to the public. This is because the employee would not be getting transportation at a lesser amount than is charged to the public. If the service is not sold to the public, there can be no charge to the public. However, such a benefit could come within section CI 1(h) as “any benefit of any other kind”. Highest fare charged The definition of “subsidised transport” in section OB 1 refers to the provision of carriage or entitlement to carriage where: ... the amount (if any) paid by the employee ...is less than the amount that is the highest amount charged ... by the employer ... to ... the general public, of carriage or ... entitlement to carriage that is of the same class and extent and on or for the same occasion or occasions as the class and extent and occasion or occasions of the carriage or the entitlement to carriage ... In determining the value of the subsidised transport, section CI 3(6) then refers in paragraph (a) to: 10 ... 25% of the amount that, in relation to the subsidised transport so provided is, within the meaning of the definition of “subsidised transport”, the highest amount charged by the employer ... Accordingly, section CI 3(6) requires that the value of the benefit be determined according to the highest amount charged to the public for carriage or entitlement to carriage that is of the same class, extent, and occasion. It is the Commissioner’s view that “class” refers to the classes of travel available, such as first, business, or economy class, as that term is used in the travel industry. The Commissioner does not accept that standby is a class of travel. To include standby fares as a class is to confuse “class” with fares. The special conditions attached to a standby fare have been compensated for by valuing the benefit at only 25% of the amount charged to the public. It was stated in the second reading of the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No 2) (NZPD Vol 461, 1985: 3722) that “The exemption effectively recognises that the true benefit enjoyed by the employee is somewhat less than the full value of the fare”. Further, “extent” refers to travel with the same departure and destination points, and “occasion” refers to the time of carriage. It is arguable that the relevant fare is the highest fare charged during the quarter for travel of the same class and extent. However, this interpretation denies the word “occasion” in the definition of “subsidised transport” of any meaning. Both “quarter” and “occasion” need to be given meaning. It is arguable that the inclusion of the reference to “quarter” means the highest fare charged in the quarter, as it was the intention of the legislation that the fare be the highest fare charged in the quarter. However, such an intent is not made clear in the legislation and this interpretation deprives “occasion or occasions” of any meaning. It is submitted that the words “in the quarter” are a reference to the fact that FBT is charged on a quarterly basis. This view is supported by the fact that the words “in the quarter” are followed by “or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 14) income year”. This appears to be a reference to the time that FBT is determined. The words “quarter or income year” are repeated throughout the legislation. Apart from the legislative intent, there is no evidence that “quarter or income year” have any greater meaning in this part than they do in any other part. There are differing views on what “occasion” means. The ordinary meaning of “occasion” is the time of occurrence of a particular event or happening. In this situation the particular event or happening is the carriage. Therefore, it would be consistent with this meaning to use the highest fare charged on the actual transportation as that is the time that the carriage occurs. It would not be consistent with the ordinary meaning of “occasion” to define it as the day that the actual travel takes place or as the time or season that the employee is allowed to travel. The better meaning to be given to “occasion or occasions” is the actual time of carriage. This is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “occasion”. In relation to an entitlement to carriage, the relevant occasion is the period of time for which the entitlement to carriage is valid. For example, if the provision is of a bus pass that entitles the employee to carriage on a bus for a period of a month, the relevant value of the benefit is the highest fare charged to the public for that bus pass 11 in that month period. If the entitlement to carriage is a ticket for carriage in the future, such as an airline ticket, the relevant value is the highest fare charged to the public for that particular transportation. The Commissioner is of the view that the legislation requires the highest fare charged for the actual transportation to be used in valuing the benefit. However, it has been submitted that in some circumstances it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to determine this figure. Accordingly, the Commissioner will accept the highest published market fare that the employer or third party, with whom the employer has entered into an arrangement for the provision of the benefit, ever charges for the service as evidence of the highest fare charged for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion by the employer or third party. For example, this could be by reference to the Air Tariff Worldwide Fares published by the Air Tariff Publishing Company. However, it is acknowledged that at times there are fares that are published but never charged to the public. Such fares would not satisfy this criterion. The highest actual fare charged is to be used where available in preference to the highest published market fare. Further, the Commissioner acknowledges the compliance costs involved in complying with the valuation provisions in relation to the occasion of the transportation. Accordingly, the Commissioner will allow the use of the highest publicised market fare charged, in the particular day, week, or month in which the occasion occurs, for transportation of the same class and extent as the value to be attributed to the benefit. Arrangement Section CI 2(1) refers to an employer that “has entered into an arrangement” with a third party concerning the provision of benefits by the third party to employees of the employer. An “arrangement” is defined in broad terms in the Act to mean “any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable) ...”. Case law indicates that an “arrangement” includes an understanding between two or more persons in relation to an agreed course of action that may not be enforceable in law. However, it must be an arrangement “for that benefit to be so provided or granted”. An employer that merely allows a third party to place promotional materials offering travel in the staff-room, for example, would probably have entered into an arrangement with that third party, but it would not be an arrangement for the provision of a benefit to the employee. It is necessarily a question of fact and degree in any given situation. Any understanding between an employer and a third party to provide a benefit to employees of the employer could constitute an arrangement to which section CI 2(1) applies. If the arrangement provides for the third party to provide numerous and ongoing benefits to employees of the employer, the employer would need a system in place to ensure that it is aware of exactly what benefits are being provided to its employees. Employee contributions 12 Under section CI 4(1), if an employee pays an amount for the receipt or enjoyment of subsidised transport provided by that employee’s employer, the value of the benefit provided is reduced by that amount. That is, once the benefit is valued according to section CI 3(6), any amount paid by the employee for that benefit is to be deducted from that amount. This is illustrated in the examples below. Examples Example 1 An airline employee takes an overseas holiday on his employer’s airline. He travels economy class. The highest price charged to the public for a ticket on that flight in economy class, with the same departure and destination points, is $650. The employee pays $200. Highest fare charged to the public for the same flight $650 25% of this highest fare $162.50 As the employee pays more than the value of the benefit ($200 compared to $162.50), the taxable value of the benefit is nil and no FBT is payable by the employer. Example 2 An airline employee takes a holiday overseas on an airline that has an agreement with her employer. The highest price charged to the public for travel of the same class, extent, and occasion is $650. Under the agreement the employee’s airline pays $325 to the airline that carries the employee. Highest fare charged to the public for the same flight $650 25% of this highest fare $162.50 Price paid or payable by the employer $325 The price paid by the employer is greater than 25% of the highest fare charged for the flight. As the employee does not make any contribution, the taxable value of the benefit is $325. If the employee pays the employer $200, that amount would be deducted from $325 and the taxable value of the benefit would be $125. Expenditure in relation to travel undertaken in performance of employee’s duties Section CI 4(4) applies in relation to fringe benefits of the kinds referred to in CI 1(d) (subsidised transport) and CI 1(h) (any benefit of any other kind whatever, received or enjoyed by the employee), which result from expenditure incurred in respect of accommodation or transportation provided for or to an employee. Where the Commissioner is satisfied that: (a) the expenditure is incurred in relation to travel undertaken by the employee in the performance of employment duties, and is 13 not incurred directly (whether wholly or in part) in respect of or in relation to the provision or taking of leave or vacation, and (b) had the fringe benefit not resulted from the expenditure, the expenditure would not have been less in amount, section CI 4(4) provides that the taxable value of the fringe benefit will be nil. For instance, travel expenses arising from a work trip may fall within the definition of “subsidised transport” and constitute a fringe benefit, but that benefit will not have a taxable value, because the expenditure would have been incurred in relation to travel undertaken in the performance of the employee’s employment duties, and had the fringe benefit not resulted from the expenditure, that expenditure would not have been less in amount. Another example of how section CI 4(4) may operate is where an employee takes leave in conjunction with a work trip. For example, an airline employee is flown from Wellington to Auckland to attend a work conference, and subsequent to the conference takes a week of annual leave in Auckland. As the expenditure by the employer was not incurred directly in respect of or in relation to the leave taken by the employee, and the expenditure would not have been less had the fringe benefit not resulted from it (ie. presuming there were no seasonal price variations resulting in an increased cost in flying the employee back to Wellington a week after the conference finished), the value of the fringe benefit would be nil.
1 DISPOSITIONS WHERE THE TRANSFEROR RESERVES OR RETAINS A BENEFIT OR ADVANTAGE IN REAL PROPERTY — GIFT DUTY AND INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS Note (not part of Rulings): The nine rulings BR Pub 02/02 – 02/10 replace both public ruling BR Pub 96/1 and public ruling BR Pub 96/2A. BR Pub 96/1 was published in TIB Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996), and applied up until 31 March 1999. BR Pub 96/2A was published in TIB Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996), and applied up until the end of the 1998-99 income year. Rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 cover the application of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and the Income Tax Act 1994 to nine different arrangements. Some of the conclusions in those earlier rulings have changed as a result of the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297. The rulings and commentary also supersede the view given in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in TIB Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997). Nine separate binding rulings have been issued covering both the income tax and gift duty implications of similar but separate arrangements. This provides greater certainty to taxpayers over a range of possible arrangements. However, a single commentary applies to all nine rulings. 2 DISPOSITION OF REAL PROPERTY FOR INADEQUATE CONSIDERATION WHERE FOLLOWING A GRANT OF A LIFE ESTATE THE BALANCE IS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER PERSON – GIFT DUTY AND INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 02/02 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to either the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA) or the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). This Ruling applies in respect of section 70 of the EGDA and section CE 1 (1)(e) of the ITA. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor grants a life estate (including a lease for life) to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. For the purposes of this Ruling: • A “person” includes a person or persons acting in their capacity as trustees of a trust. • An interest in land referred to as a “lease for life” is an estate in land giving exclusive possession and enduring for the life of a particular person. It excludes a periodic tenancy. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The life estate (including a lease for life) granted by the transferor is a retention and not a reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. • The retention of the life estate (including a lease for life) does not give rise to gross income to the transferor or the transferee under section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA. 3 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of November 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 02/02 TO 02/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 (“the Rulings”). The commentary deals first with the gift duty implications under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 of each of the arrangements in the public rulings, and secondly with the income tax implications under the Income Tax Act 1994. These rulings are all variations on a theme, where a transferor wishes to transfer real property but wishes still to have some interest in the property. An example is a person who transfers a house to a family trust, keeping the right to occupy the property. These rulings cover different ways in which this can be achieved, and specify situations in which the transactions will give rise to a liability for gift duty and income tax and the situations in which they will not. All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA), the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA), or the Property Law Act 1952 (PLA). PART ONE: GIFT DUTY Background The rulings are concerned with the situation where someone gives away some property that is subject to gift duty, and takes something back from the gift. Section 70(2) of the EGDA prevents the value of any benefit or advantage reserved from a gift, being deducted from the value of the dutiable gift. If the transferor reserves an interest in the property, the transferor is assessed for gift duty on the value of all of the property transferred, including the interest reserved. The aim of section 70(2) is to prevent the transferor arguing that the liability for gift duty is reduced. Without section 70(2), the transferor might argue that when an 4 interest in property gifted has been reserved, the transferee has given value to the transferor for the gift in the form of an interest in the property gifted. If the transferor reserves part of the property transferred, that part of the property is included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. Property is reserved if, under the arrangement, some of the property gifted is to be given back. If the transferor retains part of some property and transfers the rest of the property, the part of the property retained is not included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. It is important, therefore, to distinguish between reservations and retentions, as apparently similar transactions are treated quite differently. The analysis in this commentary particularly focuses on the distinction between reservation and retention. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. The previous ruling on this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/1, applied to dispositions of real property made between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1999. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996). An issue arising from the previous ruling, which was discussed in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), is dealt with in this commentary, and so is superseded by this commentary. Because of recent developments in the law on reservations and retentions, particularly the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297, which came after the previous ruling, the Commissioner’s view of the law has been refined to reflect that decision. Another change from the previous ruling is that the Commissioner now considers that there needs to be a gift for section 70 to apply. The Commissioner no longer takes the view that section 70 can apply to create a gift. These points are discussed in the commentary. In other respects the law relating to the gift duty aspects, and the Commissioner’s view of that law, has not changed. The arrangements In order to provide for a comprehensive range of situations, the Commissioner has developed nine separate arrangements, BR Pub 02/02-02/10. These arrangements are dispositions of property for inadequate consideration where: 1. A transferor grants a life estate to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 2. A transferor grants a lease to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 5 3. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a life estate back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 4. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a lease back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 5. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a licence to occupy back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 6. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and transfers the balance of the property to another person. 7. A transferor grants him or herself a life estate and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 8. A transferor grants him or herself a lease, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 9. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. It is important to recognise that with section 70(2) of the EGDA such seemingly minor differences in arrangements may significantly change the parties’ respective rights and obligations, and the revenue law implications. The words “grant” and “transfer” are often used interchangeably. For the purposes of this commentary, “grant” refers to the conveyance of the carved-out estate (such as the life interest or lease) and “transfer” refers to the conveyance of the balance of, or reversionary interest in, the property. Some of these arrangements may apply to taxpayers other than individuals. The arrangements specifically include trustees. Because of the nature of the arrangements, the focus is on individuals and trusts, although the same reasoning may apply in some instances to other entities. Other references Note that generally speaking, gift duty is payable only when the value of the total amount of gifts made in a year exceeds $27,000. The Commissioner has published two booklets, Gift duty IR 194 (April 2002), explaining the general features of gift duty, and Gift duty – A guide for practitioners IR 195 (May 1999) which covers some issues in more detail. These are available from Inland Revenue offices or through the website at www.ird.govt.nz. The Commissioner has also published items on various aspects of gift duty in the Tax Information Bulletins. Summary of conclusions 6 The following bullet points summarise the different ways of transferring interests in property, the Commissioner’s view of whether there is a reservation or retention, and therefore whether section 70(2) of the EGDA applies. In each of these situations, the property must be disposed of for inadequate consideration. • Where a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later transfers the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, there is no reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA and the section does not apply. The most obvious example is a person who grants him or herself a life estate or a lease, and then subsequently disposes of the balance of his or her interest to another person. The life estate or lease is, in law, a distinct interest in the property separate from the balance of or reversionary interest in the property that is transferred and is not part of the gift. Gift duty is concerned with what is gifted. The focus is on the balance transferred, not the life estate or lease that the transferor kept throughout (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). • Where a transferor transfers property to another person, and the parties intend that all the property rights in the property be transferred and then later an interest be granted back, there is a reservation by the transferor of the interest granted back to him or her. If the transfer of the property is a dutiable gift, the transferor would not be able to deduct the value of the reserved interest from the value of the gift, because of the operation of section 70(2) of the EGDA (BR Pub 02/04-02/06). • Where a transferor grants a property right to him or herself, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest of the property to a transferee, it is considered that there is no reservation of a benefit for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. A simultaneous transfer will include the situation where it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interest was to be given away, but because of conveyancing rules, the transfer had to be effected by a transfer of all of the property, and then the net property interest being transferred back. In this situation, nothing has been reserved out of the subject matter of the gift. This point was stated in the 1999 House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the Commissioner has incorporated the point in the rulings and in this commentary. It is, however, consistent with the New Zealand case Commissioner of Stamps v Finch (1912) 32 NZLR 514 (CA) (BR Pub 02/07-02/10). Legislation Gift duty is imposed under the EGDA by part IV of that Act. The key definitions and provisions relating to gift duty follow. Section 2(2) defines “gift” as: “Gift” means any disposition of property, wherever and howsoever made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition: 7 Provided that where the consideration in money or money’s worth is inadequate, the disposition shall be deemed to be a gift to the extent of that inadequacy only. “Disposition of property” is also defined in section 2(2): “Disposition of property’’ means any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity; and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this definition, includes— ... Therefore, for a gift to exist, there must be a disposition of property without fully adequate consideration. A gift exists only to the extent of the inadequate consideration. Section 61 of the EGDA imposes gift duty on dutiable gifts, at rates set out in section 62. Section 63 provides a definition of dutiable gift. A gift is a dutiable gift if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand, or the property which is the subject of the gift is situated in New Zealand. Under section 66 of the EGDA, a gift is valued at the date it is made. Section 67 allows the Commissioner to value property in such manner as he thinks fit, subject to restrictions in sections 68A-G, 69 and 70. Section 70 of the EGDA states: (1) For the purposes of this section- “Ascertainable” means ascertainable as at the date of the disposition to the satisfaction of the Commissioner: “Benefit or advantage” means any benefit or advantage whether charged upon or otherwise affecting the property comprised in the disposition or not, and whether— (a) By way of any estate or interest in the same or any other property; or (b) By way of mortgage or charge; or (c) By way of any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not; or (d) By way of any contract for the benefit of the person making the disposition; or (e) By way of any condition or power of revocation or other disposition; or (f) In any other manner whatever;— but does not include any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not, if and so far as the annuity or payment— (g) Is of a fixed or ascertainable amount in money payable over a fixed or ascertainable period, or for life, or at a fixed or ascertainable date or dates, or on demand; and (h) Is secured to the person making the disposition— (i) By a mortgage or charge over the property comprised in the disposition; or (ii) By an agreement for the sale and purchase of land comprised in the disposition; or (iii) By an agreement in writing to lease land comprised in the disposition; or (iv) By deed,— in each case executed by the person acquiring the beneficial interest under the disposition. 8 (2) Where any disposition of property is, in whole or in part, a dutiable gift, and is made in consideration of, or with the reservation of, any benefit or advantage to or in favour of the person making the disposition, no deduction or allowance shall be made in respect of that benefit or advantage in calculating the value of the dutiable gift. (3) Notwithstanding anything in section 78 of this Act, the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or alteration of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which this section applies, if application in writing is made by the parties to the instrument within 6 months after the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. On evidence to his satisfaction being produced of any such cancellation or alteration, the disposition shall not constitute a dutiable gift except to the extent to which the transaction as altered constitutes a dutiable gift. Therefore, after imposing gift duty the Act provides a valuation regime, including certain prohibitions for deductions when valuing property. Section 76 allows relief for gift duty for the subsequent gift of a reserved benefit where section 70(2) has applied. The section states: When the donor of a dutiable gift to which section 70 of this Act applies (in this section referred to as the original gift) subsequently makes a dutiable gift of the whole or any part of the benefit or advantage (as defined in that section) created or reserved on the making of the original gift, there shall be deducted from the gift duty otherwise payable in respect of that subsequent gift (so far as that gift duty extends) an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a - x c b where— a is the value of that benefit or advantage comprised in that subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is the less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Application of the legislation The object of section 70(2) Section 2(2) of the EGDA states that a gift is only a gift to the extent of the amount of the inadequacy of consideration. Section 70(2) requires that any amount “reserved” to the donor of a gift is not to be taken into account as being consideration. This means that in determining the inadequacy of consideration, any reservation is not included as consideration. The intention behind section 70(2) was discussed by Chapman J of the Court of Appeal in Finch: If a donor could give a farm or a house to his son, and take back some kind of estate or interest in or charge representing part of the value of some other kind of property of the son, such as a life estate or mortgage, it would be easy to annihilate the taxable value of the gift: therefore that device is barred. This view is also taken in Adams and Richardson’s Law of Estate and Gift Duty (5th ed., 1978, Wellington, Butterworths), in which the authors say (p 205): 9 Section 70 is aimed at certain types of benefit or advantage which, if they were taken into account as a consideration in calculating the value of a gift, might be used to make a gift appear to be a grant for valuable consideration, thus avoiding or at least postponing the gift duty. These statements indicate that the policy behind section 70(2) is to prevent donors from arguing that the amount of a gift should be reduced by the value of anything reserved from a disposition of property, with a consequent reduction in the amount of gift duty payable. Instead, a gift with a reservation is valued without taking into account the value of the reservation. Section 70 only applies to gifts Section 70 does not operate to create a gift. Section 70 only applies to a gift. If the consideration, including any benefit or advantage reserved is not inadequate, section 70 does not apply. If the total consideration is inadequate, section 70 applies, and the reserved amount is not deducted in determining the amount of the gift. So if property worth $100 with a reservation of $40 is transferred, and the transferee gives consideration of $100, there is no gift and section 70 does not apply. If, instead, property worth $100 with a reservation is transferred and the transferee gives consideration of $90, there is a gift and section 70 applies. The amount of the gift is $10. As section 70 applies, the value of the gift is not reduced to reflect the reservation. This view was taken by the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Stamps v Finch. At p 318, Stout CJ said: In interpreting this section 9 \[of the Death Duties Amendment Act 1911, now section 70(2)\] it has to be noted that the section begins by stating “when any gift”. The transaction has to be a gift. If it was an out and out sale it could not be construed as a gift. In a previous statute, namely section 6 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1895, the provision was very different. That section began thus: “In order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of duties by family arrangements or otherwise, the definition of ‘deed of gift’ in section 7 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1891 is hereby extended to include every deed or instrument whereby any person directly or indirectly conveys, transfers or otherwise disposes of property to or for the benefit of any person connected with him by blood or marriage,” etc. There is in this section 9, no definition of what a gift means. In such a case the Court must ascertain if the word “gift” is interpreted in the Act itself. ... If for example it had declared that what was not a “gift” was to be deemed a gift, as was the case in section 6 of the Act of 1895, then the Court would have been bound to interpret section 9 as charging duty on a disposition of property that was not in effect a gift. But there is no such provision in section 9. In this passage, Stout C.J. notes that section 9 (now section 70) only applies if there is a gift without its operation. He then contrasts the section with the previous “very different” wording of the provision which did not require that there is first a gift before the section applied. This earlier form of the section was applied in In re Deans (1910) 29 NZLR 1089. In that case a widow transferred various lands to her four children. In consideration, they paid her some annuities. The actuarial value of the annuities was equivalent to 10 the capital value of the land. The section was held to apply and the value of the annuities was ignored. Gift duty was charged on the capital value of the land. Chapman J said at p 1,098: It is argued that this is still limited to transactions which are gifts in some sense. The contrary is, however, plainly declared when the clause refers to transfers made “in consideration or with the reservation” of any benefit or any advantage to or in favour of the transferor or his nominee in that or any other property in the shape of an annuity or benefit of the like class. Adams and Richardson say in Law of Death and Gift Duties in New Zealand at p 205: Before s 70(2) can apply there must first be a disposition of property which is “in whole or in part a dutiable gift”. If the consideration for a disposition is fully adequate there is no dutiable gift and consequently the section does not apply. But if the consideration is inadequate, even to the smallest degree, there is a dutiable gift involved and s 70(2) can be applied. How section 70(2) works The purpose of section 70(2) is to prevent the value of a gift subject to gift duty being reduced if the transferee gives a part of the gifted property back to the person making the gift. For example, a person might gift her house but agree with the recipient that the recipient will later give the transferor the right to continue to live in the house until she dies. If not for section 70(2), the transferor might then claim that the amount of gift duty payable should be reduced. The transferor might argue that the value of the gift is not the value of the house, but the value of the house reduced by the value of the life interest the transferee has agreed to. In these circumstances, section 70(2) will apply so that the value of the life interest is not treated as consideration from the transferee to the transferor. Therefore, in determining whether or not the transferee has given adequate consideration, and whether section 70(2) applies, the following three-step analysis is required: • Identify the property that the transferor transfers to the transferee. Does the transferor transfer all the property to the transferee with the transferee granting some property back to the transferor (a reservation of the part given back), or does the transferor transfer only part of his or her property to the transferee, and retain part of the property (a retention of the part not given)? • Identify the value of the property transferred to the transferee. • Identify the consideration given by the transferee for that property (the value of any benefit reserved by the transferor is included as consideration in determining whether the consideration given by the transferee for the property transferred is inadequate). If the transferee’s consideration for the property is less than the value of the property, the definition of “gift” in section 2(2) is triggered, and assuming the general requirements in section 63 are met, there is a dutiable gift. The dutiable value of the gift is the difference between the value of the property gifted, less any consideration 11 given. However, at this step, section 70 provides that the value of any interest reserved is not treated as consideration in determining the amount of the dutiable gift. The first of the three steps in the bullet points is very important, because section 70(2) will apply when there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from property, and not when there is a retention. Difference between retaining an interest and reservation of a benefit or advantage The focus of the arrangements in the public rulings is on the distinction between a reservation of property, and a retention of property. Case law has established that section 70(2) applies if there is a “reservation” of a benefit or advantage to the transferor, but not where there has been a retention of some property. “Reservation” is not defined in the EGDA. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed. 1999) defines “reservation”. The most appropriate definition is: 3 a right or interest retained in an estate being conveyed. The definition implies that a reservation is something kept or retained while an estate is conveyed. The fact that the right or interest must be kept in the estate “being conveyed” may suggest that the reservation of the interest should occur at the same time as the conveyance. While this dictionary definition may convey the ordinary usage of the word “reservation”, the cases dealing with estate and gift duty legislation (including overseas equivalent legislation) have held (as discussed below) that “reservation” has a very narrow, technical meaning. Whether or not there is a reservation will depend on the particular transaction entered into. In the Court of Appeal case Lees v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,079, Richardson J stated the test for whether there is a reservation (in the context of section 12, a provision related to estate duty), at p 6,081: The test in that regard is whether the disponor disposed of the whole interest reserving an interest out of that which was disposed of, or whether the disponor disposed of a particular interest and merely retained the remaining interest in the property. In Finch, the only New Zealand case on section 70(2) or its predecessors, Chapman J in the Court of Appeal drew the same distinction: ... I do not find that any of the language is apt to describe something which is not and never was reserved out of the gift or the value of the gift, but is an independent item of property retained by the donor. These statements emphasise the importance of the distinction between a reserved interest and one that is merely retained. While it may be quite proper in ordinary usage to say that they are both reserved and retained, it is clear from the case law that, legally, the difference is an important one, particularly in terms of section 70(2). 12 In Finch, the Commissioner of Stamps assessed gift duty on the transfer of an undivided moiety (i.e. half share) of land to the transferor’s two sons as tenants in common in equal shares. The transferor retained the remaining moiety. The value of the whole land was about £2,200, each moiety being worth just less than £1,100. The sons paid the father £100 in cash to ensure the value of the gift was less than £1,000, which at that time was the exemption level for gift duty. The Commissioner assessed gift duty on the whole value of the land, arguing that the moiety the transferor retained was a reservation of a benefit or advantage in the land. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued that if the gift was only the moiety transferred, the £100 was a reservation of a benefit or advantage. The transferor argued that the moiety retained was not a reservation of a benefit, nor was the £100 payment. The five judges in the Court of Appeal all found for the transferor on both counts. All agreed that the transferor had not “reserved” a benefit or advantage in the land by retaining his moiety. The Court held that there is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given, not the entire estate from which the interest came. A number of Australian and United Kingdom cases discuss whether there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from the disposition of property. Two (originating from Australia) concern estate duty rather than gift duty, but they do discuss the meaning of “reservation”. In Oakes v New South Wales Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1953\] 2 All ER 1563 (PC), the Privy Council considered a case where the transferor declared by deed of trust that he held farmland on trust for his children. He used the profits for the children’s maintenance and education. He also claimed remuneration for his work as trustee, which he was entitled to do under the trust deed. The Privy Council held that the remuneration to the transferor was a “benefit or advantage”, even though it was provided for in the trust deed and that, therefore, there was a reservation of a benefit within the meaning of the section. Lord Reid stated at p1567: In their Lordships’ judgment, it is now clear that it is not sufficient to bring a case within the scope of these sections, to take the situation as a whole and find that the settlor has continued to enjoy substantial advantages which have some relation to the settled property: it is necessary to consider the nature and source of each of these advantages and determine whether or not it is a benefit of such a kind as to come within the scope of the section. Lord Reid also confirmed the distinction between “reservation” and “retention” at p 1571 where he said: The contrast is between reserving a beneficial interest and only giving such interests as remain, on one hand, and, on the other hand, reserving power to take benefit out of, or at the expense of, interests which are given... Lord Reid is saying that when a transferor has retained a pre-existing interest, this is not the same as a reservation of a benefit. The Court’s opinion was consistent with previous authority including Earl Grey v Attorney-General \[1900\] AC 124; \[1900-3\] All ER Rep 268 (HL). 13 Applying these same principles, a number of Australian and United Kingdom cases have found, on the facts, that there was not a reservation from the disposition of property. One of these is Munro v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) \[1934\] AC 61; \[1933\] All ER Rep 185 (PC). In that case the transferor entered into a partnership with his six children, and the partnership farmed the transferor’s land. Four years later he gifted a portion of the land to each of the children. On the transferor’s death the Commissioner attempted to assess death duty on the gifted land. The Privy Council held that the gifted property could not be brought back into the deceased’s estate. In the speech of the Privy Council, Lord Tomlin said (p188 of the All ER Rep report): It is unnecessary to determine the precise nature of the right of the partnership at the time of the transfers. It was either a tenancy during the term of the partnership or a licence coupled with an interest. In either view what was comprised in the gift was, in the case of each of the gifts to the children and the trustees, the property shorn of the right which belonged to the partnership, and ... the benefit which the donor had as a member of the partnership in the right to which the gift was subject was not ... a benefit referable in any way to the gift. This finding is consistent with Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd \[1943\] AC 425; \[1943\] 1 All ER 525 (PC) and Re Cochrane \[1906\] 2 IR 200 (CA). Simultaneous transfers The case law discussed so far has distinguished between a reservation, where some property is gifted and then an interest in that property is gifted back; and a retention, where a transferor creates an interest out of some property which he or she owns, and gifts the balance or reversionary interest in that property. Recent case law has raised the issue of whether there is a reservation or a retention when an interest is created in property (for example, a life estate in the property) and the balance or reversionary interest is transferred at the same time, or in terms of the legal theory in relation to conveyancing transaction, shortly afterwards. These cases, which will be discussed below, are the House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the United Kingdom High Court and Court of Appeal decisions in Nichols. New Zealand courts have held that what is in effect a simultaneous transaction, is not a reservation. In Finch, as discussed above, a father transferred an undivided half share in land. The Court of Appeal did not explicitly conclude that the transfers were simultaneous. However, the facts do not disclose any action on the part of the father to grant his half to himself before transferring the other half to his sons. He did not retain something he always had. He had owned the fee simple in the land, and after the transfer, he owned a different estate in the land which was a half share as a tenant in common. The father’s moiety appears to have been created at the same time as the other moiety was transferred to the sons. Therefore, the transfers can be viewed as simultaneous transfers. The Court concluded that there was no reservation of a benefit or advantage, because no interest was granted back to the donor. The father had not reserved an interest out 14 of property that was given, but had retained an independent item of property which was not given to his sons. The only New Zealand case where the transfers have explicitly been held to be simultaneous is Lees. In that case, the transferor created a life interest and transferred the reversionary interest in the property by documents executed on the same day. The Court held that there was a reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, the case was concerned with a different provision from section 70(2). Section 12(1)(b) (now repealed) of the EGDA concerned estate duty, and allowed the reservation of a benefit to accompany the disposition of property. It has been noted in some cases that the meaning of this phrase is unclear (Overton’s Trustees v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 872), and may be inconsistent with the meaning of the word “reservation” in the context of gift duty. In that statutory context, the Court held that a simultaneous transfer is a reservation. The case is relevant to section 70, however, not for that finding, but because it was held that transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The Ingram case – when is a transfer simultaneous? The English courts have more recently considered the issue of simultaneous transfers, in the trilogy of cases involving Lady Ingram. The High Court decision (\[1995\] 4 All ER 334) was appealed to the Court of Appeal (\[1997\] 4 All ER 395), which resulted in a further appeal to the House of Lords. The judgments in the case focused on the meaning of “reservation” in section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK). That provision states that a gift that comes within it will be a “gift with reservation” and may be subject to inheritance tax. The test is whether or not the property gifted continues to be enjoyed by the donor in any way. In the original (High Court) decision, it was concluded that the transfers were simultaneous and, therefore, there was no reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, a majority of the Court of Appeal held that there was a grant back and a reservation. The House of Lords held that the transfers were simultaneous, and that there was no reservation. The facts In the Ingram case the transaction was structured as follows: 29 March – Lady Ingram transfers property absolutely to her solicitor. 29 March – solicitor declares he holds the property on trust for Lady Ingram and is acting on her direction. 30 March – solicitor grants Lady Ingram two 20-year rent free leases. 31 March – solicitor transfers property (subject to the leases) to the two sons and grandson of Lady Ingram (the trustees). 31 March – the trustees declared themselves to be the trustees of a settlement of the property for the benefit of certain beneficiaries. Lady Ingram is not a beneficiary. 15 The House of Lords observed that the series of transactions was structured, in part, to make the benefit to Lady Ingram a retention rather than a reservation so that inheritance tax would not be payable. However, in practice, this was more difficult in the United Kingdom than it would be in New Zealand. The United Kingdom has no equivalent provision to section 49 of the NZ Property Law Act 1952, allowing a lease to be granted to oneself. As Lady Ingram was unable to grant a lease to herself, it was necessary for her to transfer the property to someone else – her solicitor – so he could grant the lease to her. The reasoning of the House of Lords The House of Lords held that there was no reservation. The Law Lords held that section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) only applied where the benefit was derived from the interest given away. They held that, in this case, the trustees and beneficiaries had never had anything more than the freehold of the property subject to the lease. This property (the freehold less the leasehold interests) was not enjoyed by Lady Ingram in any way. She enjoyed only the leasehold interests. There was no reservation because the interest retained by Lady Ingram had been defined with the necessary precision, whether the leases were technically valid or not. Her intention was evidenced by the documents that gave effect to the transaction. The Court of Appeal had held that the leases were not valid, and so the whole property must have transferred to the transferees and then a reservation was made back to Lady Ingram. The Court of Appeal also said that even if the leases were valid, that it is not conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence until the lessor has acquired the freehold interest. Therefore, the gift must have comprised the freehold interest and the lessor must have then given a lease back. The House of Lords concluded that the leases granted by the solicitor to Lady Ingram were valid. However, the Law Lords also stated that they did not need to decide the validity of the leases in order to decide the case. They stated that, even if the leases were not valid, it was clear that the intention of the parties was for Lady Ingram to keep the leasehold rights and only give the other rights in the property away. This intention was evidenced by the documents. Lord Hoffman recognised that under conveyancing law, the whole property must pass before a lease can be granted. However, his Lordship considered that conveyancing form could not apply to make the transfer a reservation when it would otherwise not be. Lord Hoffman stated that (p 303): It is true that as a matter of conveyancing, no lease can come into existence until the freehold has been vested in the intended lessor. But s. 102 is concerned not with conveyancing but with beneficial interests. It uses words like ‘enjoyment’ and ‘benefit’. In A-G v Worrall 1 \[1895\] QB 99 at p. 104, a case on a predecessor of s. 102, Lord Esher MR began his judgment with the words: ‘It has been held that in cases of this kind the Court has to determine what the real nature of the transaction was, apart from legal phraseology and the forms of conveyancing.’ If one looks at the real nature of the transaction, there seems to me no doubt that Ferris J \[in the High Court\] was right in saying that the trustees and beneficiaries never at any time acquired the land free of Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. The need for a conveyance to be followed by a lease back is a mere matter of conveyancing form. As I have said, she could have reserved a life interest by a unilateral 16 disposition. Why should it make a difference that the reservation of a term of years happens to require the participation of another party if the substance of the matter is that the property will pass only subject to the lease? Lord Hoffman considered it important to look at the real nature of the transaction and not just the conveyancing form. The rights and obligations of each party should be examined to determine whether or not the transactions are within the section. The Law Lords decided that it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interests be given away. They considered that the way the section was written focused on benefits. They held that Lady Ingram did not receive any benefits from the net property interest, but only from the leases, which were not part of the subject matter of the gift. At no time did the donees hold the property free from Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. Therefore, she was not within the provision as she had not reserved a benefit out of the property the subject of the gift. The Law Lords identified three aspects of the transaction which persuaded them that this was a situation where the transferor only ever intended that the net property interest be transferred, and not the whole property with a subsequent grant back. First, the House of Lords noted that Lady Ingram had defined very precisely the rights she intended to give away. She had never intended to grant the lease to the trustees, only the freehold shorn of the leasehold interests. Secondly, the creation and existence of the leases was not dependent on the concurrence of the trustees and beneficiaries. It was never intended that the trustees would receive the whole property and then grant a lease back. This finding was supported by the fact that Lady Ingram had gone to such lengths to grant the lease before transferring the balance of the property. Thirdly, because of the first two reasons, the House of Lords looked at the equitable rights and obligations of the parties, assuming that the leases were not valid. The Law Lords stated that equity would give Lady Ingram a right to the leases. Where the intention of the parties is clear that it was intended that the transfers be simultaneous, or it was intended that some rights never be given away, then this would give rise to equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. Therefore, in equity, the trustees were regarded as never having received the leasehold interests. From the moment they received the property they were subject to an equitable obligation to grant the leases. The only part of the property they ever received was the freehold less the leasehold interests. Therefore, the subject matter of the gift was the property shorn of the leasehold interests. These equitable rights would arise from the time of transfer. They would have the effect of making the transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding that in legal theory or under conveyancing rules, the whole property would need to be transferred prior to there being a grant back. This means that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous where there is (at least under legal theory) a grant back of a right. The effect of Ingram 17 Following Ingram (HL), in a situation where the parties to the transactions never intend that the leasehold interests should be part of the subject matter of the gift, and they structure the arrangement with the necessary precision so that equitable rights arise simultaneously, the law will give effect to the parties’ intention. The transaction should not be viewed as involving an instant of time for property to be transferred and then an interest granted back, in order that conveyance formality be met. The House of Lords in Ingram stated that the need for an instant of time was only necessary for conveyancing theory, whereas the particular provision under consideration was more concerned with the rights, benefits and obligations that resulted from the transactions, and with determining enjoyments and benefits of the property interests. The Commissioner’s view is that section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. Discounting the notion of an instant of time between the transfer and the grant back has the result that some transfers, previously considered to be a post transfer grant back, would now be considered to be simultaneous transfers. It could be argued that the reasoning of the House of Lords judgments in Ingram is more sensible than the law as it was before the decision, because the law now will not require such fine distinctions to be made. Before Ingram (HL), if a transferor attempted to retain an interest at the same time property was transferred, there was a potential gift duty liability, whereas if the transferor’s interest in the land was created a moment before the transfer, there was no potential liability. The House of Lords held that all of these types of transactions (where the transferor wishes to give away property rights while retaining some right of occupation), in circumstances where the transferor defines precisely the rights he or she wishes to give away, have the same end result and that, therefore, there should be no reservation. The Nichols case In coming to its conclusion, the House of Lords endorsed the approach of Walton J in the High Court decision of Nichols v IRC (\[1973\] STC 278). That case concerned a father who wished to gift the family home and surrounding land to his son. However, the parents wished to continue living on the property. Therefore, they arranged for the property to be transferred to the son, and for the son to execute a lease in their favour. Walton J in the High Court held that in principle, where property passes which has an immediate equitable obligation on the transferee to grant a lease back, the transaction can amount to a retention of the leasehold interest. Walton J considered that there is no legal impediment to regarding simultaneous transactions as only giving the transferee the property shorn of the leasehold interest. The House of Lords agreed with this approach, and not the Court of Appeal decision in Nichols which had reversed Walton J’s judgment. The House of Lords in Ingram considered it was conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence before the lessor acquires the leasehold interest. A simultaneous transfer is not always a retention However, a simultaneous transfer and grant back will not always be outside the scope of section 70(2). Lord Hoffman in the House of Lords indicated that if the leasehold 18 interest held by Lady Ingram had contained benefits that she did not have before the property was transferred, then it may not be possible for the transfer to be a retention of the leasehold. Lord Hoffman took this point from the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols. Although the House of Lords disapproved of the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols, the disagreement was on the central issue of whether a simultaneous transfer and a lease back could be a retention. In Nichols, a father had given his son his land, and as part of that transaction, the son was required to give a lease back. Under the lease, the son gave a covenant to undertake any repairs. The Court of Appeal held that existence of the covenants made the transaction a reservation, and it could not be a retention. The right to have the buildings repaired under the covenant did not exist before the transfer, and therefore could not be something not given (p 285). A retention must be a retention of property that the transferor had prior to the transfer of the balance of the property. If, for example, the transferor has a leasehold interest as a result of a transfer of property, and the leasehold interest gives the transferor rights that he or she did not already have, then that leasehold interest could not have been something retained. It can only be something given by someone else. Therefore, if the transferor has a property interest as a result of a transfer that he or she could not have had before the transfer, then the transaction will be a transfer with a grant back, and will be a reservation. Other points to come from the House of Lords judgment in Ingram The House of Lords judgment held that it is possible in England to create a property interest prior to transferring the balance of the property, by the use of a nominee. Prior to this decision, it had been the view that it was not possible to retain an interest to oneself in England because of the common law rule that one can not grant a property interest to oneself (Rye v Rye \[1962\] 1 All ER 146). That rule has been overridden (at least partly) in New Zealand by section 49 of the Property Law Act 1952. The judgments of both Lord Hutton and Lord Hoffman concluded that, at least in English law, it was possible for a nominee to grant a lease to his or her principal. The implication is that a transferor can now retain a property interest prior to transfer, through the use of a nominee. Following the House of Lords decision, it seems that the British Parliament decided that legislation was the only way to ensure clarity. As a result of the case, amendments have been made to add new sections into the Finance Act 1986 (UK), setting out specifically and in great detail when a gift will be a “gift with reservation” and when it will not. In the Budget Press Release of 9 March 1999 it was declared that: Loopholes which result in the avoidance of inheritance tax are to be closed ... the changes which confirm the Government’s determination to stamp out tax avoidance, relate to what is often referred to as making a ‘gift with reservation’. This is when, for example, someone gives away his/her house but continues to live in the property. The change restores the tax position as it was understood to be prior to the House of Lords’ ruling in the case of Ingram v IRC. 19 The Commentary to the Bill also stated that it was a specific anti-avoidance measure designed to counter Ingram-type schemes, and that no attempt was being made to rewrite the basic wording of the gift with reservation rules. Meaning of “reservation” in section 70(2) after Ingram The law established by the cases The cases discussed above establish that: • Property is retained when the transferor retains an interest in property and disposes of the balance or reversionary interest in the property (Lees). • Property is reserved when the transferor disposes of the whole interest and reserves an interest out of that which was disposed of (Lees). • The case of Finch distinguishes between a reservation and a retention of a benefit or advantage. There is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given. There is merely a retention of the benefit or interest if the benefit or interest is held before the transfer of the balance of the property, or if the grant and transfer occur at the same time. See also Munro, Oakes, and Ingram. • The House of Lords decision in Ingram recognises that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The House of Lords concluded that when the transfers are simultaneous, in circumstances where it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property be disposed of, there will be no reservation. This is because the transferor will have received no benefit arising from the subject matter of the gift. • The House of Lords judgment in Ingram stated that the courts should look at the intention of the parties to the transaction. The House of Lords held that section 102 of the United Kingdom Finance Act, a comparable provision to New Zealand’s section 70(2), is concerned with the transfer of benefits and advantages, not the transfers of property which must take place for legal reasons. Sometimes equitable rights will come into effect which will make transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding the requirements of the rules of conveyancing that there be a certain sequencing of transactions. The parties’ intentions will be evidenced by the documents of the transaction. • Simultaneous transfers will include the situation where the transferring of the legal rights does not happen precisely at the same time, where the transfers are part of the one transaction, provided that it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property is transferred, and provided also that equitable rights arise simultaneously (Nichols (HC) and Ingram (HL)). • If an apparently simultaneous transfer results in the donor having an interest in property that includes rights that he or she did not have before the transfer, the 20 transfer will be a reservation, and not a retention of property the transferor already had (Nichols (CA) and Ingram (HL)). Which types of real property do the rulings apply to? The rulings apply to real property. Real property includes dwelling houses, farms and commercial buildings. After the previous ruling was issued, the Commissioner was asked whether the arrangements only apply to dwelling houses. In a “Question we’ve been asked” item, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), the Commissioner gave the view that real property includes all forms of real property. The Commissioner’s view on this issue has not changed. Application of section 70(2) to the specific arrangements Pre-transfer grant of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy A pre-transfer grant occurs where the transferor creates an interest in the property and grants that interest to him or herself before transferring the rest of the property interest to a third party (for example, a family trust). If the separation of the interest occurs before the transfer to the other person, the subsequent transfer is treated as the transfer of one interest while retaining another. If an arrangement is a pre-transfer grant, it does not involve a reservation of interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the property transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Life interests granted to oneself The Property Law Act 1952 (PLA) gives the transferor authority to grant a life estate to him or herself. Under section 49 of the PLA, the transferor may transfer an estate or interest in land to him or herself individually or jointly with others. Section 66A of the PLA provides that covenants in a transfer by the transferor to him or herself (under section 49 of the PLA) are enforceable. Example 1 A creates a life estate in a property, and then transfers the balance of the property to the trustees of his family trust. A’s property is worth $175,000. The value of the life estate is $60,000. The price for the reversionary interest is $100,000. This is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. Section 70(2) does not apply. There is a gift because the consideration paid by the trust ($100,000 for property worth $115,000) for the interest in reversion is inadequate. The Commissioner will assess A for gift duty on the $15,000 gifted under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds 21 and requirements are met. However, section 70(2) does not apply to include the $60,000 life interest in the dutiable amount, because that interest was retained by the transferor and not gifted to the transferor. Leasehold interests granted to oneself A transferor can grant a lease to him or herself in New Zealand. At common law a person could not grant a lease to him or herself, In re Nichol \[1931\] NZLR 718, 727, Rye v Rye \[1962\] AC 496; 1 All ER 146. However, because a lease is an estate or interest in land, this rule has been abrogated in New Zealand by sections 49 and 66A of the PLA (Harding v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 337; 2 NZTC 61, 145). At common law, when the same person owned the freehold and the leasehold interest in a property, a merger of the interests occurred and the lesser interest (the lease) ceased to exist. In equity, merger depended on the intention of the parties. Section 30 of the PLA adopts the equitable rule, so there will only be merger where the parties intend it to occur. Usually, when a person creates a lease and grants it to him or herself, the intention is for the estates to remain separate. Example 2 B creates a lease for fifty years in her own favour over her property, and then transfers the balance of the property to her only child, C. B’s property is worth $250,000. The value of the lease is $100,000. The value of the balance of the property is $150,000. The price to be paid for the balance is $90,000. This price is outstanding, as an unsecured debt owed by C to B. There is a gift under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The gift is the amount of $60,000, being the inadequacy of consideration for the property transferred worth $150,000, less the $90,000 paid. Accordingly, there is potentially gift duty payable on the $60,000. Section 70(2) has no application because there is no reservation from the disposition of property to C. Therefore, the Commissioner will not include the $100,000 value of the lease in the dutiable value of the gift. Licences to occupy purported to be granted to oneself However, the provisions of the PLA do not extend to a licence to occupy. A licence, unlike a lease, is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose. As Gresson P said in Baikie v Fullerton- Smith \[1961\] NZLR 901, 906 in a land law context, a licence is basically an authority that prevents the individual to whom it is granted from being regarded as a trespasser on someone else’s property. Therefore, a licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. In the absence of comparable provisions to sections 49 and 66A of the PLA applying to licences, a landowner cannot license him or herself to be a licensee. 22 The arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 is the situation where a transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy before transferring the remaining property interest. The purported grant of the licence will be invalid for conveyancing purposes, and all the rights in the property will be transferred to the transferee. One of two results will occur. Firstly, the transferee could keep ownership of all the rights to the property. If all property rights are kept, there will be no grant back to the transferor (at any time) and no reservation. However, gift duty will be payable to the extent of the inadequacy of the consideration. Secondly, the transferee could transfer the licence back to the transferor once the third party has been granted the rights in the property. This is acceptable in land law. Under land law, the grant back would take place after the transfer. This is the situation covered in BR Pub 02/07. Following Ingram (HL), the Commissioner considers that this second situation should not be analysed as a post-transfer grant. Ingram established that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) is on the transfer of benefits as a result of the transaction. In the Commissioner’s view, section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. So although a transfer is invalid under legal conveyancing theory, it still may create equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. In this situation, if the intention of the parties was that the licence be taken out of the property before the transfer, then following the equitable maxim “equity, regarding as done what ought to be done”, effect will be given to such an agreement for the transfer of land, and equitable rights and obligations will accrue to each party with effect from the moment of transfer. In this situation, the transferee never acquires the property free from the obligation to transfer back the licence the transferor intended to retain. The result will be that from the moment of the transfer, the transferor will have an equitable right to the licence and the transferee will have an equitable obligation to grant it. This has the effect of making the transfers simultaneous. If the transaction is simultaneous, it will not be a reservation subject to section 70(2). (The other arrangements which are simultaneous transfers are discussed below.) The documents to the transaction will be evidence of the intention of the parties (as in Ingram (HL)). They should be used to ascertain what the parties intended was to be the subject matter of the gift. The first situation mentioned above, where the transferee does not grant a licence back, is not similar in nature to the other arrangements ruled on. Therefore, the Commissioner has not ruled on that arrangement. Summary of the consequences of pre-transfer grants Where a pre-transfer grant of a life estate or a lease occurs, there is no reservation of a benefit under section 70(2) (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). Therefore, the amount of the life estate or lease is not included in the amount of the gift. 23 A licence to occupy cannot be structured as a pre-transfer grant. The result will either result in no licence, or a simultaneous transfer. Neither of these will be a reservation. Simultaneous transfers are discussed more under a following heading. Post-transfer grant back of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy A post-transfer grant back occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee subject to the transferee granting an interest (any of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy) back to the transferor. If an arrangement is a gift involving a post-transfer grant, it will be a reservation of an interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) will apply, and accordingly the duty payable will be calculated on the value of the whole of the property transferred, without deducting the value of the reservation, less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04-02/06. Example 3 A transfers property worth $200,000 to B, as she is going overseas for three years and no longer wants to have property in New Zealand. B pays A $100,000 for the property. However, A and B agree that B will grant A a lease for the property when she returns, in three years time. The lease has a value of $50,000. A and B have documents drawn up to this effect. In this case, it is clearly the intention of the parties that the whole property interest is transferred, and at a later time a lease be granted back. The gift is the difference between the value of the property ($200,000) and the consideration paid ($100,000). The value of the lease is a reservation, and so is not deducted from the value of the gift. Example 4 D has decided to transfer ownership of her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the property for the rest of her life . She intends to transfer the full property interest to the trustees of the trust, and at a later stage, for the trustees to grant her a licence to occupy. In accordance with this arrangement, the trustees later grant D a licence to occupy. The documents are consistent with the parties’ intentions. The property has a market value of $200,000. The licence to occupy is valued in accordance with the provisions of the EGDA at $50,000. The transfer price of the property is $100,000, which D leaves owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The property is disposed of without fully adequate consideration ($150,000 compared with the market value of $200,000), so the Commissioner will assess D for gift duty under section 61 assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The licence is a reservation, because under the arrangement, it is transferred back out of the property gifted. Section 70(2) applies, so the value of the licence is not deducted from the value of the gift. The amount on which gift duty is calculated is $100,000 (being the licence reserved and the extent of the inadequate consideration). 24 Simultaneous transfers of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy Life estates and leases A simultaneous transfer of property occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee and simultaneously the transferee grants back an interest in that property (whether a life estate or a lease). As discussed earlier, the House of Lords in Ingram considered that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986, the comparable section to New Zealand’s section 70(2), was on the benefits actually reserved, and not the legal form of the transactions. Where it is clearly the intention of the parties that the net property interest only be transferred, but conveyancing rules would say that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back, the transferor has equitable rights in the interest transferred back from the moment the first transfer is made. It is not necessary to regard there being an instant of time between the transfers, even though it may be required in conveyancing theory. Therefore, the transfers will be simultaneous, and there will be no reservation. If an arrangement is a simultaneous transfer and grant, no reservation of interest by the transferor is involved. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the estate transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/08 and BR Pub 02/09. Licences to occupy and other transactions intended to be pre-transfer grants As mentioned above under pre-transfer grants, it is not possible for land owners to grant themselves a licence to occupy their land. Therefore, if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy and then transfers the balance of the land to someone else, that transaction will not, in terms of conveyancing law, be a pre- transfer grant. However, following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, where it is the intention of the parties that only the net property interest is to be given away, conveyancing rules should not mean that the transaction is carried out in some other way. Where rights cannot be validly self-granted, but it was clearly the intention of the parties that those rights should not be part of the transfer, equity will give effect to those rights as though they were valid from the time of transfer. If the original transfer is invalid for some other reason, this reasoning may also apply. The effect of this is that grants of rights that cannot be validly self-granted will often now be simultaneous transfers rather than post-transfer grants back. Therefore, in the case of the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07, it is not possible to grant a licence to oneself. However, the parties’ intention to transfer only the net property is evidenced by the documents in which the transferor attempts to grant the licence to him or herself. If that was the parties’ intention, equity will demand that the transferee grant the licence back. These equitable rights will arise from the moment of transfer. 25 Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 will now be treated as a simultaneous transfer rather than a post-transfer grant back, if it is the parties’ intention, evidenced by the documents and the circumstances of the transfer, that only the net property interest transfers. Consequently, it will be a retention of the licence and not a reservation. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is similar to the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is the situation where the parties intend that the transferor will grant a licence to him or herself simultaneously as the balance of the property is granted to someone else. Even though the parties attempt to make the transaction simultaneous, it still amounts to an attempt to grant oneself a licence, and legally the transaction will consist of property passing and a licence being granted back. The documents relevant to the attempt to grant a licence to him or herself will be evidence that only the net property interest was intended to pass. In the Commissioner’s view, Ingram applies, and this arrangement will be treated as a simultaneous transfer of the licence and the net property, and it will be a retention and not a reservation. On the other hand, if it is clear from the documents that the whole property interest was intended to be the subject-matter of the gift followed by a grant back, and there is no intention for an interest to be retained, then equity will not intervene to create rights and obligations as between the parties, and there will be a post-transfer grant back. In this situation, there is a reservation of a benefit to the donor. Transactions that may appear to be post-transfer grants may be simultaneous transfers It may in some situations be difficult to distinguish between a simultaneous transfer and a post-transfer grant. Both may involve the same legal steps of property transferring and a lesser interest transferring back. The essential difference between the two is that in a simultaneous transfer, the parties only ever intend the net property interest to pass. In a post-transfer grant, the parties intend the whole property to pass, and the lesser interest subsequently to pass back. The documents relevant to the transaction will be important in establishing the legal nature of the transaction and the parties’ intention. Requirements of a simultaneous transfer needed to satisfy the Commissioner The Commissioner will be satisfied that a simultaneous transfer amounts to a retention (i.e. pre-transfer grant) and not a reservation (i.e. a post-transfer grant), if there is sufficient evidence that the parties never intended that the whole property in question pass to the transferee. This evidence would usually include the following elements, taken from Ingram (HL). • The transferor defines very precisely the rights he or she intends to give away. • The documents relevant to the transaction support the claim that the parties intend that only part of the property, as defined, is to be given away. 26 • There is never a time, in equity, when the transferee holds the whole property free of the interest that the transferor seeks to retain. • The retention is not dependent on the concurrence of the transferee\[s\], including beneficiaries where the property is transferred to a trust. • The transferor does not receive an interest in the property that includes something more than he or she previously had, e.g. covenants by the transferor/lessor to repair the property. Summary of simultaneous grants Where there is a simultaneous grant and transfer (BR Pub 02/07-02/10) there is no reservation. Example 5 H wishes to provide for her children by making sure that they will own her house when she dies. She draws up a document, which gifts the house to the children while at the same time creating a life estate for herself. It was always intended, as evidenced by the documents, that the life estate be created and kept by H. She does not gain any extra rights that she did not have before the gift. The house is worth $250,000 and the amount of the life estate is estimated to be $45,000. The amount of the life interest will not be a reservation within the meaning of s 70(2), meaning that H will only be liable for gift duty under section 63 on the amount that is given away, being $205,000. Other sections of the EGDA affecting reservations Sliding value clauses Commonly, documents evidencing the disposition of property provide that the consideration shall be a fixed amount or such higher amount as the Commissioner accepts will not give rise to a gift for gift duty purposes. If: • the consideration is bona fide; and • the obligation to pay it is fulfilled; and • the consideration is a genuine attempt to approximate the market value of the property; the Commissioner accepts that where section 70(2) might otherwise apply, and the parties use the sliding value clause to increase the consideration so there is no gift, gift duty will not be payable. 27 Amendment of documents Under section 70(3), the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or amendment of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which section 70 applies. Application in writing must be within six months of the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. Documents that are amended or redrawn will be reconsidered to see whether section 70(2) applies to them. Valuation of retained interests Section 66 of the EGDA requires every dutiable gift to be valued as at the date of the making of the gift. Section 67 gives the Commissioner a general discretion as to how property is valued, subject to sections 68A to 68G, 69 and 70, which include methods for valuing particular property. Particularly relevant to this commentary are sections 68A and section 68F. Section 68A prescribes how land is valued. Section 68F provides that the tables of life expectancies in the Second Schedule to the Act are used to value life interests, except in one instance. The Commissioner has some discretion in determining the life expectation of a person suffering from a terminal illness. In practice, in determining the life expectancy of a person suffering from a terminal illness, the Commissioner will generally use Table D. Table D gives the present value of an annuity or other interest for a period other than life, or expectant on an event other than death. The Commissioner will generally apply it for the period which the Commissioner accepts as the actual or expected life expectancy of the person. When there is more than one transferor, and all are entitled to a life estate or a lease for life, the value of the right should take account of the longest remaining life expectancy of the transferors. The value of the right relates to the time the transferees are out of possession of the property. If all transferors have a right of occupation until their respective deaths, the discount of the property’s value to the transferees relates to the longest expected occupation of any of the transferors. Subsequent gift of reserved benefit Where gift duty has been paid on a gift valued under section 70, any gift duty on a subsequent gift of the benefit or advantage reserved, or any part of it, may be reduced, under section 76. A deduction from the gift duty on the subsequent gift is calculated as follows: a x c b Where: a is the value of the benefit or advantage comprised in the subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is less; and 28 b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. 29 Example 6 Assume A transfers property worth $42,000 to B and reserves a life interest in it. $ 42,000.00 $ A is a male aged 48 years at date of transfer. The present value of income on capital of $1 for life for a male aged 48, from Table A is 0.71201. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.71201 x $42,000 = $29,904.42 The value of the reservation is therefore 29,904.42 And the value of the balance of the gift is 12,095.58 A has to pay gift duty on both under Sec 70 - value of the balance of the gift 12,095.58 - value of the reservation 29,904.42 Total value of Gift 42,000.00 Duty on $42,000 on $36,000 at set rate 450.00 on $6,000 at 10% 600.00 1,050.00 Assume 10 years later A surrenders the life interest. The property previously worth $42,000 is now worth $48,000. A is now aged 58 years at the date of surrender. The present value of income on capital of $1 for the life of a male age 58 from Table A is 0.57617. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.57617 x $48,000 = $27,656.16 A makes another gift of $30,000 at the same time. The aggregate gift is therefore: 30,000.00 57,656.16 Duty on $57,656 is calculated as follows: on $54,000 at the set rate 2,250.00 on $3,656 at 20% 731.20 Gross gift duty 2,981.20 Section 76 applies to give relief for the gift duty already paid. The gross gift duty is reduced by the relief given under section 76 where: (a) is original gift of reservation $29,904.40 subsequent gift value of reservation $27,656.16 whichever is less (b) value of the original gift $42,000 (c) gift duty on the original gift $1,050 27,656.16 x 1,050.00 = $691.40 42,000.00 Maximum relief under section 76 = $691.40 Apportionment of the gift duty between the two gifts Gift $30000 = 30,000 x 2,981.20 = $57,656 1,551.20 Gift $27656 = 27,656 x 2,981.20 = $1,430.00 57,656 Less relief under section 76 1,430.00 691.40 738.60 30 $738.60 Gift duty collectable on subsequent gift 2,289.80 PART TWO: INCOME TAX Background Section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA includes within a person’s gross income all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: • any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or • the grant of a right to take profits of the land. This section considers the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangements. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999. The previous ruling and commentary on the income tax aspects of this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/2A, applied to dispositions of real property made up until the end of the 1998-1999 year. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996). The Commissioner’s view of the income tax aspects of the arrangements has not changed from the expired rulings. However, more analysis is provided to support aspects of the Commissioner’s view. Summary of conclusions Pre-grant transfer If a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later grants the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, the interest kept by the transferor does not constitute gross income of the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-grant transfer If a transferor transfers property to another person, reserving an interest in the property which the transferee later grants back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income under section CE 1(1)(e). The transferee will derive gross income if the transferee grants a lease or a licence back to the transferor, and an amount is derived by the transferee which is attributable to the lease or licence. Simultaneous transfer If a transferor grants him or herself a property interest, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest to another person, the interest granted to the transferor does not constitute gross income to the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). 31 Legislation Under section CE 1(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994, a person’s gross income includes: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land . Section OB 1 contains definitions for the purposes of the Act. Section OB 1 begins: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— “Lease”, “leasehold estate” and “estate” are defined in section OB 1: “Lease” — (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate: ... “Leasehold estate” includes any estate however created, other than a freehold estate: ... “Estate”, or “interest”, in relation to land, means any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and includes any right to the possession of land or to the receipt of the rents or profits from the land, or to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the land, whether immediate or through a trustee, or otherwise; but does not include a mortgage: Application of the legislation Section CE 1(1)(e) deems a person’s gross income to include all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from any lease or licence affecting the land. Amounts derived from certain transfers of land, where an interest in land is transferred back to the transferor, may be included in gross income. Pre-transfer grant of an interest in land Where a lease or a licence is created before land is transferred, an income tax liability will not arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If a transferor obtains an interest in land transferred before the balance or reversionary interest in the land is transferred, the transferee does not derive gross income as a result of the transaction. He or she never owns the interest that the transferor keeps, 32 so does not derive income from that land. Therefore, he or she cannot derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from that lease or licence as a result of the transfer. Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferor The transferor also does not derive income from the transaction. The transferor does not derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from a lease, licence, easement, or profits from his or her land. Instead, the owner has simply kept an interest in the land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Example 7 Taxpayer A creates a lease in a property, and then transfers the reversionary interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s house is worth $175,000. The value of the lease is $60,000. The price to be paid for the reversionary interest is $175,000 less the $60,000. This price of $115,000 is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A or the trustees for income tax under section CE 1(1)(e) on the $60,000 value of the lease. Section CE 1(1)(e) does not apply because neither A nor the trustees derive any rent, fines or premiums from the lease. Licences to occupy A transferor can grant him or herself a life interest or lease over land, before disposing of the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person. However, it is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to him or herself. A licence is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and to use it for a particular purpose. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Consistent with the conclusions relating to gift duty, the Commissioner will treat a purported grant to oneself of a licence as a simultaneous transfer. This point is discussed further below. Post-transfer grant back of an interest in land Where land is transferred subject to a lease or a licence later being transferred back, an income tax liability may arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If the transferor transfers land, and reserves an interest in the land by receiving a grant of an interest from the transferee, section CE 1(1)(e) may apply to any gross amount derived by the transferee in relation to that transaction. There are three parts to section CE 1(1)(e) that are relevant to the arrangements: 33 • There must be a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. • The income must be derived by a land owner. • The income must be derived from a lease or a licence. Requirement 1 – amounts that are “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues” Section CE 1(1)(e) will apply if, by granting an interest back to the transferor, the transferee derives an amount that is within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The arrangements potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e) (the arrangements in BR Pub 02/5 and BR Pub 02/06) are concerned with situations where property is gifted for inadequate consideration, subject to an interest being granted back to the transferor by the transferee. If the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the interest granted by the transferee back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income if the other two requirements of section CE 1(1)(e) are met (which are discussed below). An amount is derived even if there is no direct payment Income is derived by the transferee, even though there may be no payment made to the transferee. Under section EB 1(1) of the ITA, a person derives income, even where it has not been received, when an amount has been, for example, credited in account or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or behalf. A netting off of obligations is an example of this, and so the transferee “derives” the income. So the amount in the following situations may be income to the transferee: • the transferor reduces the price (if any) payable by the transferee for the initial transfer of property; or • the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the lease or licence granted back to the transferor. Whether the amounts derived under the lease or licence arrangements are rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues The amounts derived under the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06 will be subject to section CE 1(1)(e) if they are within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The words of the section are now examined to see when amounts derived under the arrangements are within these words. The lease arrangement in BR Pub 02/05 is discussed first. “Rent” has been characterised as the contractual sum payable for the use of the leased premises: United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley BC \[1978\] AC 904. A similar definition was used in Samuel v Salmon \[1945\] 2 All ER 520. Rent does not only relate to leases. For instance, the term “rent” or “rent-charge” may be used when a purchaser of land pays periodic sums rather than a lump sum for the land. A “fine” is 34 technically a sum of money payable by the tenant on the renewal of a lease (Hinde, McMorland & Sim, para. 5.086), but is sometimes loosely used to refer to a premium (B G Utting & Co Ltd v Hughes \[1939\] 2 All ER 126). A “premium” is a lump sum paid for the acquisition of a lease by a lessee: Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 at p 197. In King v Earl Cadogan \[1915\] 3 KB 485, at p 492, Warrington J said that ... a premium is a payment representing the capital value of the difference between the actual rent and the best that otherwise might be obtained... It is in fact the purchase money which the tenant pays for the benefit which he gets under the lease. The amount derived under the lease arrangement, that is potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e), arises when one person transfers property to another, and the transferee grants a lease back, and there is either: • a reduction by the transferor of the price of the property first transferred; • a reduction of a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • any other payment by the transferor to the transferee; where the amount is attributable to the lease granted back to the transferor. This payment arises where the transferor transfers property to another person and the other person later grants a lease back to the transferor. Under this arrangement, it is not specified whether the consideration is a premium, i.e. a payment for the acquisition of the lease, or rent, i.e. a payment made for the use of the property, or a fine, i.e. a payment for the renewal of a lease. A premium is a payment for the granting of a lease. In the arrangement, it is specifically stated that the amount is attributable to the lease granted back. In the Commissioner’s view, the payment under the arrangement is best characterised as consideration for the granting of the lease and is therefore a premium. The amount may also be rent, especially if it is quantified on the basis of the current value of rental payments appropriate to the value of the use of the land under the lease. It is least likely to be a fine, because the arrangement involves the granting of a new lease, and not the renewal of a lease. However, if “fine” also means premium, it may be a fine. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the amount derived under the arrangement is either a premium or rent, or a payment for both. Premiums and rents cover between them any payment for the granting of a lease and any payment made during the lease for the use of the property. The amount must be either one of these two types of amounts. Therefore, an analysis of the words of the section supports the conclusion that a one- off payment for a lease is a premium and/or rent. Section CE 1(1)(e) also applies to amounts of goodwill. The Commissioner considers that the amounts derived under the arrangements are clearly not payments of goodwill. Goodwill is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and 35 connection of a business: Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co’s Margerine Ltd \[1901\] AC 217. There is no business element in the arrangements. Other revenues If the amount derived is not a rent, fine, or a premium, the Commissioner’s view is that the amount derived under the arrangement comes within “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). The issue in interpreting these words is whether “other revenues” means amounts that are revenue in nature. The amounts derived under the arrangements are lump sums received in relation to the transfer of ownership of interests in land. If “revenues” in the context of section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature, then it could be argued that the amounts derived under the arrangement are capital in nature and not subject to the section. The ordinary meaning of “revenues” and dictionary definitions suggest that “revenues” means revenue in nature (see the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10 th ed., 1999). The issue, which is discussed next and under the following headings, is not the meaning of “revenues” in isolation, but its meaning in the context of section CE 1(1)(e). Miller v IRC The meaning of “revenues” as used in section 88(1)(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (which was the same as section CE 1(1)(e)) was considered in Miller v IRC 10 AITR 122 (SC). The Court was concerned with a payment received by a land owner for two purposes. It was paid for the right to remove coal from the land owner’s land. It was also accepted by the owner as payment in full satisfaction of compensation for damage to the land, which would otherwise be payable under a previous agreement. Henry J made the following comment: The word “revenue” in its ordinary import in relation to the owner of land connotes the incomings which arise therefrom: London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority, London and North-Eastern Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority (1933) 150 LT 361 (HL) per Lord Tomlin at p 367. His Honour held that the monthly payments payable to the objector came within the words “other revenues” because they were paid for the use of land. This finding suggests that the purpose of the section is to capture payments made for the use of land. In finding that the payment was not compensation, and so the section could apply, it could be argued that the case also supports the view that section 88(d) (and section CE 1(1)(e)) only applies to payments that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner’s view is that the case does not go that far. The key finding was that the payments were made for the use of land, and so were within the section. Although Henry J said that a payment for compensation would not be within the section, he did not go so far as to rule out the possibility that capital payments may be within section CE 1(1)(e). 36 In considering the meaning of “revenue” in Miller, Henry J referred to the House of Lords decision in London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co. The House of Lords said that the word “revenue” in relation to a business means those incomings of the business which are the products of or are incidental to the normal working of the business. It is arguable that London, Midland & Scottish Railway Co is authority for the proposition that “revenues” means amounts received in the course of a business. However, in the Commissioner’s view, London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co is not direct authority for the meaning of “revenues” in the context of section 88(1)(d), i.e. CE 1(1)(e), as the statutory contexts are quite different. In London Midland, Lord Tomlin was defining “revenue” in relation to a business. Section CE 1(1)(e) is concerned with amounts derived for the use of land. Even the form of the word is different – “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) and “revenue” in the Railways Act. In summary, although there are arguably indications in Miller and London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co that “revenue” in section CE 1(1)(e) may mean revenue in nature, in the Commissioner’s opinion Miller establishes only that payments for the use of land are within the section. Henry J in Miller did not hold that capital payments could never come within the section. The context of the section The context of the word “revenues” within section CE 1(1)(e) supports the conclusion that the intention is to capture a wide range of payments related to the use of land, and that the section is not limited to payments that are revenue in nature. “Revenues” is preceded by the words “rents, fines, premiums”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the common theme of the specific words listed is that they are payments made in relation to land. This approach is supported also by considering the other words in the section: (e) All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. The section clearly deals with payments for rights relating to land. Types of interests in land or rights relating to land are listed, and further, these interests or rights are only included if they affect the land. In discussing goodwill in Romanos Motel Limited v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435, the Court of Appeal said that the aim of the section is to include in income receipts from land (p 438). The opening words of the section “rents, fines, premiums” are not linked because they are revenue in nature. Clearly premiums are generally capital in nature. Goodwill, which forms part of this group of words by coming within parentheses after “other revenues”, is also usually capital in nature. Given that, it can be concluded that Parliament intended to include at least some capital payments in the section. The Australian High Court in Clarke v FC of T (1932) 6 ALJ 241 interpreted the comparable Australian section as having the broad intention to capture all payments derived from a lease. 37 Case T8 Case T8 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,044 arguably supports the view that “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature. Barber DJ held on the facts that a payment paid by a lessee was not an option payment but a payment to obtain a lease. Given this finding, in his opinion it was a premium or other revenue derived by the owner of land from a lease affecting the land, and within section 65(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section CE 1(1)(e)). His Honour made the following comment about section 65(2)(e): Also, if the $22,000 was genuinely part of a sale of realty transaction, then s 65(2)(e) would not apply because it assesses revenue from land and not capital derived or relating to land. Barber DJ could be interpreted as taking the view that the section is aimed at amounts that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner considers in making this comment, his Honour was not asserting that section 65(2)(e) (section CE 1(1)(e)) only assesses revenue and not capital. Clearly some capital items are assessed under section CE 1(1)(e) – premiums are generally capital in nature, as the Privy Council said in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, at p 13,999, and goodwill is generally capital in nature. The Commissioner considers that this comment is best interpreted as meaning that the section does not apply to income from the sale of land. If the amount received by the taxpayer had been for an option to purchase the motel, then it would have been for the sale of an interest in land, and such a fee would probably not be within section CE 1(1)(e). Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, Barber DJ’s comment is not authority that no capital payments are caught within section CE 1(1)(e). Commentators’ views The Report of the Taxation Review Committee 1967 (usually known as the “Ross Report”) said that the section treats goodwill as being equivalent to additional rent calculated over the term of the lease but payable at the commencement of the lease. Similarly the Valabh Committee in its December 1989 report Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital said: Section 65(2)(g) \[now section CE 1(1)(e)\] is an attempt to avoid allowing taxpayers to transform lease payments (which would generally be taxable payments received on revenue account) into a non-taxable receipt received on capital account. For that reason, section 65(2)(g) includes in assessable income premiums as well as goodwill received by a lessor. ... These provisions demonstrate how it has been found necessary to move the traditional capital/revenue boundary to hinder the ability of taxpayers to transform otherwise assessable income into income on capital account which would not be subject to tax. These commentators consider that the policy intention is to include in section CE 1(1)(e) payments that are revenue in nature but disguised as capital. Note that that intention does not mean that the section is restricted to capturing disguised rent. The 38 Court of Appeal in Romanos rejected the submission by counsel that only disguised rents for the lease of land, as opposed to a payment for what is really a lease of the goodwill of a business, are taxable under the section. As the Valabh Committee says, a decision has been made to include capital payments in section CE 1(1)(e). Thus the Ross and Valabh Committees considered that genuine premiums and goodwill payments, as well as attempts to disguise rent as premiums or goodwill, are within section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to the issue of whether only receipts that are revenue in nature are income under section CE 1(1)(e) The Commissioner’s opinion is that section CE 1(1)(e) is intended to capture amounts that are paid in relation to use of land, and that payments that have capital attributes may be included in section CE 1(1)(e). The words of the section and the decision in Miller, in particular, support this view. Romanos and Clarke also support the view that the intention of the section is to include in income payments for the use of land. The arguments that would support the contrary view are that Miller is not conclusive authority that “revenues” means incomings and not income in nature. The authority relied on by Henry J – London Midland and Scottish Rail Co. - appeared to find that “revenue” means revenue in nature. In the Commissioner’s view, the contrary arguments are less persuasive than the arguments supporting the view that “revenues” means incomings from land and includes receipts of a one-off nature. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that the amounts derived under the lease arrangement are not excluded from the words “other revenues” on the basis that payments that are capital in nature are not included in those words. Reliance on the case of Capel v CIR In the commentary to BR Pub 96/2A, the following was stated: A payment for buying a licence to occupy, or a lease, would also normally be considered a capital sum. However, Romanos and Capel are authority for the proposition that such a payment is included within the term “premiums, or other revenues”. The main issue in Capel was whether any of a number of goodwill payments received by a taxpayer setting up burger bar businesses, was for goodwill attached to a site, or for personal goodwill. Romanos Motel had established that only goodwill attached to a site is included within section CE 1(1)(e) (then section 88 1(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954). The Commissioner now relies primarily on the arguments already discussed, which support the conclusion that capital payments that are not specifically included within section CE 1(1)(e), are in fact intended to be included in the section. Capel does gives some support for this view, in that the Court held that a payment that is capital in nature was within section CE 1(1)(e). Similarly the Court of Appeal in Romanos held that a capital payment for goodwill was subject to section CE 1(1)(e). 39 Comments on technical submissions received Submissions received included two arguments that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to amounts that are revenue in nature. The first of these is that section CE 1 uses both the words “income” and “revenues” leading to the inference that to distinguish these two words, “revenues” must be taken to mean revenue in nature. The Commissioner prefers the view that the word “income” at the beginning of the section is part of the defined term “gross income”, and so inferences cannot be drawn from the use of the word in section CE 1(1)(e). The term gross income is used in the Act as a machinery provision to ensure that the provisions of the Act combine to identify a taxpayer’s taxable income. When the section was first enacted, the term “assessable income” was used for the same purpose. Therefore, the term “gross income” should be viewed as a defined term used for a specific purpose, and the substantive meaning of the word “income” is not relevant in determining the meaning intended for “revenues”. The second argument is that the Income Tax Act treats premiums and fines as revenue items. Previously, premiums and fines could be deducted under section EZ 6. The Commissioner does not consider that an examination of section EZ 6 assists in the interpretation of section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to whether amounts derived under the arrangement involving a lease are subject to section CE 1(1)(e) In summary, the conclusions are that the amounts derived in relation to a lease (the fourth arrangement) are subject to section CE 1(1)(e), because • The amount is rent or a premium; or • The amount is included within “other revenues” because it is an incoming from land, and • The statutory intention is to capture a wide range of amounts derived from a lease, and • The words “other revenues” do not mean other things that are revenue in nature; instead, they mean incomings from land. Is the licence arrangement subject to section CE 1(1)(e)? The discussion so far has related to the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangement involving a lease. The other arrangement to which section CE 1(1)(e) applies involves a licence – the arrangement in BR Pub 02/06. The words listed in section CE 1(1)(e) – “rents, fines, premiums” apply most commonly to leases and not licences. That raises the issue of whether the amount derived under the licence arrangement is subject to the section. 40 The first point to note is that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to certain receipts derived by the owner of land from “any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land”. Clearly, the section applies to licences. The arrangement involving a licence is described in the ruling as follows: The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor transfers property to another person and under the arrangement the other person later grants a licence back to the transferor out of the property transferred: • where:  the transferor reduces the price of the property first transferred; or  the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or  the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and • the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the licence granted back to the transferor. In summary, an amount is paid under the arrangement as consideration for the licence granted back to the transferor. Are the payments derived under the arrangement included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e)? The Commissioner considers that an amount derived in respect of a licence is included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). For the reasons discussed above in relation to the lease agreement, the Commissioner does not consider that the words “other revenues” means “revenue in nature”. Instead, the Commissioner considers that these words are intended to mean amounts derived in relation to the use of land. Requirement 2 – the income must be derived by a land owner The discussion has been about the first requirement of section CE 1(1)(e), that is, whether there are “rent, fines, premiums, or other revenues” under the arrangements. The second requirement is that income must be derived by an owner or land. In the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06, a transferee granting either a lease or a licence back to the transferor is the owner of the land out of which that interest is granted. Requirement 3 – income derived from a lease or a licence If the transferee grants the transferor a lease or a licence, and the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the lease or licence, then the requirement that the income is derived from any lease or licence is satisfied. Accordingly, the transferee is subject 41 to income tax on an amount equal to the value of the amount attributable to the grant of the lease or licence. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06. Example 8 Taxpayer B has decided to transfer her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the house for the rest of her life . She transfers the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees subsequently grant B a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The house is transferred for $175,000, reduced by $50,000 to $125,000 to take into account the value of the licence to occupy. The $125,000 is left owing by the trustees as a debt repayable on demand. The trust has derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e) of $50,000, being the value of the licence to occupy. Life estate If the transferee grants the transferor a life estate, the transferee is not subject to section CE 1(1)(e). The reason is that section CE 1(1)(e) only applies to leases, licences, easements affecting land, and the grant of a right to take profits from land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04. Lease for life Generally, an arrangement referred to as a ‘lease for life’ is not a lease, but a life estate. An essential characteristic of a lease is that is has a certain term: Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body \[1992\] 3 All ER 504. A lease that is based on the duration of a person’s life does not have a duration that is certain. It is a freehold estate in the nature of a life estate – see Amalgamated Brick & Pipe Co Ltd v O'Shea (1966) 1 NZCPR 580. In some instances, what is referred to as a lease for life may have a certain duration, and therefore will be a lease. For example, a lease expressed to be for say 200 years or for the life of A, is a valid lease. Although it is not known when A will die, and that A will die before 200 years have passed and the lease will terminate at A’s death, the lease has in law a certain duration. A tenancy with the power of each party to determine the tenancy at the end of any period by giving the appropriate notice, called a periodic tenancy, is a lease because any particular term can be made certain, even though it is impossible at the outset of the tenancy to say for what period the terms will last: Amalgamated Brick. Example 9 42 C and D decide to transfer their home to a family trust. They wish to ensure that they have a right to occupy the house for the rest of their lives . They transfer the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees later grant C and D life estates in the property. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $250,000. The life estates are worth $75,000. The price of the house is $250,000, which C and D leave owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The debt is reduced by $75,000 upon the grant of the life estates. The trust will not have derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e), because the grant of a life estate is not income derived from a lease, licence, easement, or the right to take profits from land. Post-transfer grants – income tax implications for the transferor There are no income tax implications for the transferor under section CE 1(1)(1). Section CE 1(1)(e) applies to rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived from land. When a transferor transfers land, the person no longer owns the land, so cannot receive any rents, fines or so on from it. Any amount paid by the transferee for the transfer, in the arrangements covered by the rulings, will be consideration for a sale of land. Simultaneous transfer of a lease or a licence Where the grant and the transfer of a lease or a licence occur simultaneously, no income tax liability under section CE 1(1)(e) will arise as a result of the transaction. Purported grant of a licence to oneself The Commissioner’s view is that if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence, whether before or at the same time as the property is transferred to the transferee, that action should be interpreted as an intention to retain rights over the property before the transfer of the balance of the property. Following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, discussed above in relation to gift duty, the Commissioner considers that this situation should be treated as a simultaneous transfer. Simultaneous transfers–- implications for the transferee The transferee is the owner of the property interest transferred from the transferor. Where the transfers are simultaneous, the transferee does not grant anything out of the interest he or she receives, as he or she receives the property interest at the same time as it becomes subject to the obligation to grant an interest in the land back to the transferor. Accordingly, the transferee does not receive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues as a result of receiving the property interest. As this commentary has explained, a simultaneous transfer includes the situation where the requirements of conveyancing mean that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back. Such a situation will be 43 treated as simultaneous, when the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the documents and surrounding circumstances, is for the transferor to retain an interest in the property transferred, and for the transferee never to obtain the property free of the transferor’s interest. Simultaneous transfers – implications for the transferor The transferor does not have an income tax liability, because the transferor does not derive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues from a lease or a licence in respect of the property kept or the property transferred. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/07-02/10. Spreading income When a taxpayer derives income under section CE 1(1)(e), section EB 2(1) of the ITA allows the person to apportion that income between the income year in which it is derived and up to five subsequent income years.
DISPOSITION OF REAL PROPERTY FOR INADEQUATE CONSIDERATION WHERE FOLLOWING A GRANT OF A LEASE THE BALANCE IS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER PERSON – GIFT DUTY AND INCOME TAX IMPLICATIONS Note (not part of Rulings): The nine rulings BR Pub 02/02 – 02/10 replace both public ruling BR Pub 96/1 and public ruling BR Pub 96/2A. BR Pub 96/1 was published in TIB Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996), and applied up until 31 March 1999. BR Pub 96/2A was published in TIB Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996), and applied up until the end of the 1998-99 income year. Rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 cover the application of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and the Income Tax Act 1994 to nine different arrangements. Some of the conclusions in those earlier rulings have changed as a result of the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297. The rulings and commentary also supersede the view given in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in TIB Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997). Nine separate binding rulings have been issued covering both the income tax and gift duty implications of similar but separate arrangements. This provides greater certainty to taxpayers over a range of possible arrangements. However, a single commentary applies to all nine rulings. PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 02/03 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to either the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA) or the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). This Ruling applies in respect of section 70 of the EGDA and section CE 1 (1)(e) of the ITA. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor grants a lease for a term to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. For the purposes of this Ruling, a “person” includes a person or persons acting in their capacity as trustees of a trust. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The lease granted by the transferor is a retention and not a reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. • The retention of the lease does not give rise to gross income to the transferor or the transferee under section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of November 2002. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULINGS BR PUB 02/02 TO 02/10 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public rulings BR Pub 02/02-02/10 (“the Rulings”). The commentary deals first with the gift duty implications under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 of each of the arrangements in the public rulings, and secondly with the income tax implications under the Income Tax Act 1994. These rulings are all variations on a theme, where a transferor wishes to transfer real property but wishes still to have some interest in the property. An example is a person who transfers a house to a family trust, keeping the right to occupy the property. These rulings cover different ways in which this can be achieved, and specify situations in which the transactions will give rise to a liability for gift duty and income tax and the situations in which they will not. All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA), the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA), or the Property Law Act 1952 (PLA). PART ONE: GIFT DUTY Background The rulings are concerned with the situation where someone gives away some property that is subject to gift duty, and takes something back from the gift. Section 70(2) of the EGDA prevents the value of any benefit or advantage reserved from a gift, being deducted from the value of the dutiable gift. If the transferor reserves an interest in the property, the transferor is assessed for gift duty on the value of all of the property transferred, including the interest reserved. The aim of section 70(2) is to prevent the transferor arguing that the liability for gift duty is reduced. Without section 70(2), the transferor might argue that when an interest in property gifted has been reserved, the transferee has given value to the transferor for the gift in the form of an interest in the property gifted. If the transferor reserves part of the property transferred, that part of the property is included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. Property is reserved if, under the arrangement, some of the property gifted is to be given back. If the transferor retains part of some property and transfers the rest of the property, the part of the property retained is not included in determining whether or not there is a dutiable gift, and whether or not section 70(2) applies. It is important, therefore, to distinguish between reservations and retentions, as apparently similar transactions are treated quite differently. The analysis in this commentary particularly focuses on the distinction between reservation and retention. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2005. The previous ruling on this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/1, applied to dispositions of real property made between 1 April 1996 and 31 March 1999. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 8 (February 1996). An issue arising from the previous ruling, which was discussed in a “Question we’ve been asked” item in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), is dealt with in this commentary, and so is superseded by this commentary. Because of recent developments in the law on reservations and retentions, particularly the House of Lords decision in Ingram v IRC \[1999\] 1 All ER 297, which came after the previous ruling, the Commissioner’s view of the law has been refined to reflect that decision. Another change from the previous ruling is that the Commissioner now considers that there needs to be a gift for section 70 to apply. The Commissioner no longer takes the view that section 70 can apply to create a gift. These points are discussed in the commentary. In other respects the law relating to the gift duty aspects, and the Commissioner’s view of that law, has not changed. The arrangements In order to provide for a comprehensive range of situations, the Commissioner has developed nine separate arrangements, BR Pub 02/02-02/10. These arrangements are dispositions of property for inadequate consideration where: 1. A transferor grants a life estate to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 2. A transferor grants a lease to him or herself, and then subsequently transfers the balance of the property to another person. 3. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a life estate back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 4. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a lease back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 5. A transferor transfers the property to another person, and under the arrangement that other person later grants a licence to occupy back to the transferor out of the property transferred. 6. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and transfers the balance of the property to another person. 7. A transferor grants him or herself a life estate and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 8. A transferor grants him or herself a lease, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. 9. A transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy, and simultaneously transfers the balance of the property to another person. It is important to recognise that with section 70(2) of the EGDA such seemingly minor differences in arrangements may significantly change the parties’ respective rights and obligations, and the revenue law implications. The words “grant” and “transfer” are often used interchangeably. For the purposes of this commentary, “grant” refers to the conveyance of the carved-out estate (such as the life interest or lease) and “transfer” refers to the conveyance of the balance of, or reversionary interest in, the property. Some of these arrangements may apply to taxpayers other than individuals. The arrangements specifically include trustees. Because of the nature of the arrangements, the focus is on individuals and trusts, although the same reasoning may apply in some instances to other entities. Other references Note that generally speaking, gift duty is payable only when the value of the total amount of gifts made in a year exceeds $27,000. The Commissioner has published two booklets, Gift duty IR 194 (April 2002), explaining the general features of gift duty, and Gift duty – A guide for practitioners IR 195 (May 1999) which covers some issues in more detail. These are available from Inland Revenue offices or through the website at www.ird.govt.nz. The Commissioner has also published items on various aspects of gift duty in the Tax Information Bulletins. Summary of conclusions The following bullet points summarise the different ways of transferring interests in property, the Commissioner’s view of whether there is a reservation or retention, and therefore whether section 70(2) of the EGDA applies. In each of these situations, the property must be disposed of for inadequate consideration. • Where a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later transfers the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, there is no reservation for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA and the section does not apply. The most obvious example is a person who grants him or herself a life estate or a lease, and then subsequently disposes of the balance of his or her interest to another person. The life estate or lease is, in law, a distinct interest in the property separate from the balance of or reversionary interest in the property that is transferred and is not part of the gift. Gift duty is concerned with what is gifted. The focus is on the balance transferred, not the life estate or lease that the transferor kept throughout (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). • Where a transferor transfers property to another person, and the parties intend that all the property rights in the property be transferred and then later an interest be granted back, there is a reservation by the transferor of the interest granted back to him or her. If the transfer of the property is a dutiable gift, the transferor would not be able to deduct the value of the reserved interest from the value of the gift, because of the operation of section 70(2) of the EGDA (BR Pub 02/04-02/06). • Where a transferor grants a property right to him or herself, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest of the property to a transferee, it is considered that there is no reservation of a benefit for the purposes of section 70(2) of the EGDA. A simultaneous transfer will include the situation where it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interest was to be given away, but because of conveyancing rules, the transfer had to be effected by a transfer of all of the property, and then the net property interest being transferred back. In this situation, nothing has been reserved out of the subject matter of the gift. This point was stated in the 1999 House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the Commissioner has incorporated the point in the rulings and in this commentary. It is, however, consistent with the New Zealand case Commissioner of Stamps v Finch (1912) 32 NZLR 514 (CA) (BR Pub 02/07-02/10). Legislation Gift duty is imposed under the EGDA by part IV of that Act. The key definitions and provisions relating to gift duty follow. Section 2(2) defines “gift” as: “Gift” means any disposition of property, wherever and howsoever made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition: Provided that where the consideration in money or money’s worth is inadequate, the disposition shall be deemed to be a gift to the extent of that inadequacy only. “Disposition of property” is also defined in section 2(2): “Disposition of property’’ means any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity; and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this definition, includes— ... Therefore, for a gift to exist, there must be a disposition of property without fully adequate consideration. A gift exists only to the extent of the inadequate consideration. Section 61 of the EGDA imposes gift duty on dutiable gifts, at rates set out in section 62. Section 63 provides a definition of dutiable gift. A gift is a dutiable gift if the donor is domiciled in New Zealand or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand, or the property which is the subject of the gift is situated in New Zealand. Under section 66 of the EGDA, a gift is valued at the date it is made. Section 67 allows the Commissioner to value property in such manner as he thinks fit, subject to restrictions in sections 68A-G, 69 and 70. Section 70 of the EGDA states: (1) For the purposes of this section- “Ascertainable” means ascertainable as at the date of the disposition to the satisfaction of the Commissioner: “Benefit or advantage” means any benefit or advantage whether charged upon or otherwise affecting the property comprised in the disposition or not, and whether— (a) By way of any estate or interest in the same or any other property; or (b) By way of mortgage or charge; or (c) By way of any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not; or (d) By way of any contract for the benefit of the person making the disposition; or (e) By way of any condition or power of revocation or other disposition; or (f) In any other manner whatever;— but does not include any annuity or other payment, whether periodical or not, if and so far as the annuity or payment— (g) Is of a fixed or ascertainable amount in money payable over a fixed or ascertainable period, or for life, or at a fixed or ascertainable date or dates, or on demand; and (h) Is secured to the person making the disposition— (i) By a mortgage or charge over the property comprised in the disposition; or (ii) By an agreement for the sale and purchase of land comprised in the disposition; or (iii) By an agreement in writing to lease land comprised in the disposition; or (iv) By deed,— in each case executed by the person acquiring the beneficial interest under the disposition. (2) Where any disposition of property is, in whole or in part, a dutiable gift, and is made in consideration of, or with the reservation of, any benefit or advantage to or in favour of the person making the disposition, no deduction or allowance shall be made in respect of that benefit or advantage in calculating the value of the dutiable gift. (3) Notwithstanding anything in section 78 of this Act, the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or alteration of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which this section applies, if application in writing is made by the parties to the instrument within 6 months after the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. On evidence to his satisfaction being produced of any such cancellation or alteration, the disposition shall not constitute a dutiable gift except to the extent to which the transaction as altered constitutes a dutiable gift. Therefore, after imposing gift duty the Act provides a valuation regime, including certain prohibitions for deductions when valuing property. Section 76 allows relief for gift duty for the subsequent gift of a reserved benefit where section 70(2) has applied. The section states: When the donor of a dutiable gift to which section 70 of this Act applies (in this section referred to as the original gift) subsequently makes a dutiable gift of the whole or any part of the benefit or advantage (as defined in that section) created or reserved on the making of the original gift, there shall be deducted from the gift duty otherwise payable in respect of that subsequent gift (so far as that gift duty extends) an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: a - x c b where— a is the value of that benefit or advantage comprised in that subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is the less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Application of the legislation The object of section 70(2) Section 2(2) of the EGDA states that a gift is only a gift to the extent of the amount of the inadequacy of consideration. Section 70(2) requires that any amount “reserved” to the donor of a gift is not to be taken into account as being consideration. This means that in determining the inadequacy of consideration, any reservation is not included as consideration. The intention behind section 70(2) was discussed by Chapman J of the Court of Appeal in Finch: If a donor could give a farm or a house to his son, and take back some kind of estate or interest in or charge representing part of the value of some other kind of property of the son, such as a life estate or mortgage, it would be easy to annihilate the taxable value of the gift: therefore that device is barred. This view is also taken in Adams and Richardson’s Law of Estate and Gift Duty (5th ed., 1978, Wellington, Butterworths), in which the authors say (p 205): Section 70 is aimed at certain types of benefit or advantage which, if they were taken into account as a consideration in calculating the value of a gift, might be used to make a gift appear to be a grant for valuable consideration, thus avoiding or at least postponing the gift duty. These statements indicate that the policy behind section 70(2) is to prevent donors from arguing that the amount of a gift should be reduced by the value of anything reserved from a disposition of property, with a consequent reduction in the amount of gift duty payable. Instead, a gift with a reservation is valued without taking into account the value of the reservation. Section 70 only applies to gifts Section 70 does not operate to create a gift. Section 70 only applies to a gift. If the consideration, including any benefit or advantage reserved is not inadequate, section 70 does not apply. If the total consideration is inadequate, section 70 applies, and the reserved amount is not deducted in determining the amount of the gift. So if property worth $100 with a reservation of $40 is transferred, and the transferee gives consideration of $100, there is no gift and section 70 does not apply. If, instead, property worth $100 with a reservation is transferred and the transferee gives consideration of $90, there is a gift and section 70 applies. The amount of the gift is $10. As section 70 applies, the value of the gift is not reduced to reflect the reservation. This view was taken by the Court of Appeal in Commissioner of Stamps v Finch. At p 318, Stout CJ said: In interpreting this section 9 \[of the Death Duties Amendment Act 1911, now section 70(2)\] it has to be noted that the section begins by stating “when any gift”. The transaction has to be a gift. If it was an out and out sale it could not be construed as a gift. In a previous statute, namely section 6 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1895, the provision was very different. That section began thus: “In order to prevent the avoidance or evasion of duties by family arrangements or otherwise, the definition of ‘deed of gift’ in section 7 of the Stamp Acts Amendment Act, 1891 is hereby extended to include every deed or instrument whereby any person directly or indirectly conveys, transfers or otherwise disposes of property to or for the benefit of any person connected with him by blood or marriage,” etc. There is in this section 9, no definition of what a gift means. In such a case the Court must ascertain if the word “gift” is interpreted in the Act itself. ... If for example it had declared that what was not a “gift” was to be deemed a gift, as was the case in section 6 of the Act of 1895, then the Court would have been bound to interpret section 9 as charging duty on a disposition of property that was not in effect a gift. But there is no such provision in section 9. In this passage, Stout C.J. notes that section 9 (now section 70) only applies if there is a gift without its operation. He then contrasts the section with the previous “very different” wording of the provision which did not require that there is first a gift before the section applied. This earlier form of the section was applied in In re Deans (1910) 29 NZLR 1089. In that case a widow transferred various lands to her four children. In consideration, they paid her some annuities. The actuarial value of the annuities was equivalent to the capital value of the land. The section was held to apply and the value of the annuities was ignored. Gift duty was charged on the capital value of the land. Chapman J said at p 1,098: It is argued that this is still limited to transactions which are gifts in some sense. The contrary is, however, plainly declared when the clause refers to transfers made “in consideration or with the reservation” of any benefit or any advantage to or in favour of the transferor or his nominee in that or any other property in the shape of an annuity or benefit of the like class. Adams and Richardson say in Law of Death and Gift Duties in New Zealand at p 205: Before s 70(2) can apply there must first be a disposition of property which is “in whole or in part a dutiable gift”. If the consideration for a disposition is fully adequate there is no dutiable gift and consequently the section does not apply. But if the consideration is inadequate, even to the smallest degree, there is a dutiable gift involved and s 70(2) can be applied. How section 70(2) works The purpose of section 70(2) is to prevent the value of a gift subject to gift duty being reduced if the transferee gives a part of the gifted property back to the person making the gift. For example, a person might gift her house but agree with the recipient that the recipient will later give the transferor the right to continue to live in the house until she dies. If not for section 70(2), the transferor might then claim that the amount of gift duty payable should be reduced. The transferor might argue that the value of the gift is not the value of the house, but the value of the house reduced by the value of the life interest the transferee has agreed to. In these circumstances, section 70(2) will apply so that the value of the life interest is not treated as consideration from the transferee to the transferor. Therefore, in determining whether or not the transferee has given adequate consideration, and whether section 70(2) applies, the following three-step analysis is required: • Identify the property that the transferor transfers to the transferee. Does the transferor transfer all the property to the transferee with the transferee granting some property back to the transferor (a reservation of the part given back), or does the transferor transfer only part of his or her property to the transferee, and retain part of the property (a retention of the part not given)? • Identify the value of the property transferred to the transferee. • Identify the consideration given by the transferee for that property (the value of any benefit reserved by the transferor is included as consideration in determining whether the consideration given by the transferee for the property transferred is inadequate). If the transferee’s consideration for the property is less than the value of the property, the definition of “gift” in section 2(2) is triggered, and assuming the general requirements in section 63 are met, there is a dutiable gift. The dutiable value of the gift is the difference between the value of the property gifted, less any consideration given. However, at this step, section 70 provides that the value of any interest reserved is not treated as consideration in determining the amount of the dutiable gift. The first of the three steps in the bullet points is very important, because section 70(2) will apply when there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from property, and not when there is a retention. Difference between retaining an interest and reservation of a benefit or advantage The focus of the arrangements in the public rulings is on the distinction between a reservation of property, and a retention of property. Case law has established that section 70(2) applies if there is a “reservation” of a benefit or advantage to the transferor, but not where there has been a retention of some property. “Reservation” is not defined in the EGDA. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (10 th ed. 1999) defines “reservation”. The most appropriate definition is: 3 a right or interest retained in an estate being conveyed. The definition implies that a reservation is something kept or retained while an estate is conveyed. The fact that the right or interest must be kept in the estate “being conveyed” may suggest that the reservation of the interest should occur at the same time as the conveyance. While this dictionary definition may convey the ordinary usage of the word “reservation”, the cases dealing with estate and gift duty legislation (including overseas equivalent legislation) have held (as discussed below) that “reservation” has a very narrow, technical meaning. Whether or not there is a reservation will depend on the particular transaction entered into. In the Court of Appeal case Lees v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,079, Richardson J stated the test for whether there is a reservation (in the context of section 12, a provision related to estate duty), at p 6,081: The test in that regard is whether the disponor disposed of the whole interest reserving an interest out of that which was disposed of, or whether the disponor disposed of a particular interest and merely retained the remaining interest in the property. In Finch, the only New Zealand case on section 70(2) or its predecessors, Chapman J in the Court of Appeal drew the same distinction: ... I do not find that any of the language is apt to describe something which is not and never was reserved out of the gift or the value of the gift, but is an independent item of property retained by the donor. These statements emphasise the importance of the distinction between a reserved interest and one that is merely retained. While it may be quite proper in ordinary usage to say that they are both reserved and retained, it is clear from the case law that, legally, the difference is an important one, particularly in terms of section 70(2). In Finch, the Commissioner of Stamps assessed gift duty on the transfer of an undivided moiety (i.e. half share) of land to the transferor’s two sons as tenants in common in equal shares. The transferor retained the remaining moiety. The value of the whole land was about £2,200, each moiety being worth just less than £1,100. The sons paid the father £100 in cash to ensure the value of the gift was less than £1,000, which at that time was the exemption level for gift duty. The Commissioner assessed gift duty on the whole value of the land, arguing that the moiety the transferor retained was a reservation of a benefit or advantage in the land. Alternatively, the Commissioner argued that if the gift was only the moiety transferred, the £100 was a reservation of a benefit or advantage. The transferor argued that the moiety retained was not a reservation of a benefit, nor was the £100 payment. The five judges in the Court of Appeal all found for the transferor on both counts. All agreed that the transferor had not “reserved” a benefit or advantage in the land by retaining his moiety. The Court held that there is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given, not the entire estate from which the interest came. A number of Australian and United Kingdom cases discuss whether there is a reservation of a benefit or advantage from the disposition of property. Two (originating from Australia) concern estate duty rather than gift duty, but they do discuss the meaning of “reservation”. In Oakes v New South Wales Commissioner of Stamp Duties \[1953\] 2 All ER 1563 (PC), the Privy Council considered a case where the transferor declared by deed of trust that he held farmland on trust for his children. He used the profits for the children’s maintenance and education. He also claimed remuneration for his work as trustee, which he was entitled to do under the trust deed. The Privy Council held that the remuneration to the transferor was a “benefit or advantage”, even though it was provided for in the trust deed and that, therefore, there was a reservation of a benefit within the meaning of the section. Lord Reid stated at p1567: In their Lordships’ judgment, it is now clear that it is not sufficient to bring a case within the scope of these sections, to take the situation as a whole and find that the settlor has continued to enjoy substantial advantages which have some relation to the settled property: it is necessary to consider the nature and source of each of these advantages and determine whether or not it is a benefit of such a kind as to come within the scope of the section. Lord Reid also confirmed the distinction between “reservation” and “retention” at p 1571 where he said: The contrast is between reserving a beneficial interest and only giving such interests as remain, on one hand, and, on the other hand, reserving power to take benefit out of, or at the expense of, interests which are given... Lord Reid is saying that when a transferor has retained a pre-existing interest, this is not the same as a reservation of a benefit. The Court’s opinion was consistent with previous authority including Earl Grey v Attorney-General \[1900\] AC 124; \[1900-3\] All ER Rep 268 (HL). Applying these same principles, a number of Australian and United Kingdom cases have found, on the facts, that there was not a reservation from the disposition of property. One of these is Munro v Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) \[1934\] AC 61; \[1933\] All ER Rep 185 (PC). In that case the transferor entered into a partnership with his six children, and the partnership farmed the transferor’s land. Four years later he gifted a portion of the land to each of the children. On the transferor’s death the Commissioner attempted to assess death duty on the gifted land. The Privy Council held that the gifted property could not be brought back into the deceased’s estate. In the speech of the Privy Council, Lord Tomlin said (p188 of the All ER Rep report): It is unnecessary to determine the precise nature of the right of the partnership at the time of the transfers. It was either a tenancy during the term of the partnership or a licence coupled with an interest. In either view what was comprised in the gift was, in the case of each of the gifts to the children and the trustees, the property shorn of the right which belonged to the partnership, and ... the benefit which the donor had as a member of the partnership in the right to which the gift was subject was not ... a benefit referable in any way to the gift. This finding is consistent with Commissioner of Stamp Duties (NSW) v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd \[1943\] AC 425; \[1943\] 1 All ER 525 (PC) and Re Cochrane \[1906\] 2 IR 200 (CA). Simultaneous transfers The case law discussed so far has distinguished between a reservation, where some property is gifted and then an interest in that property is gifted back; and a retention, where a transferor creates an interest out of some property which he or she owns, and gifts the balance or reversionary interest in that property. Recent case law has raised the issue of whether there is a reservation or a retention when an interest is created in property (for example, a life estate in the property) and the balance or reversionary interest is transferred at the same time, or in terms of the legal theory in relation to conveyancing transaction, shortly afterwards. These cases, which will be discussed below, are the House of Lords decision in Ingram, and the United Kingdom High Court and Court of Appeal decisions in Nichols. New Zealand courts have held that what is in effect a simultaneous transaction, is not a reservation. In Finch, as discussed above, a father transferred an undivided half share in land. The Court of Appeal did not explicitly conclude that the transfers were simultaneous. However, the facts do not disclose any action on the part of the father to grant his half to himself before transferring the other half to his sons. He did not retain something he always had. He had owned the fee simple in the land, and after the transfer, he owned a different estate in the land which was a half share as a tenant in common. The father’s moiety appears to have been created at the same time as the other moiety was transferred to the sons. Therefore, the transfers can be viewed as simultaneous transfers. The Court concluded that there was no reservation of a benefit or advantage, because no interest was granted back to the donor. The father had not reserved an interest out of property that was given, but had retained an independent item of property which was not given to his sons. The only New Zealand case where the transfers have explicitly been held to be simultaneous is Lees. In that case, the transferor created a life interest and transferred the reversionary interest in the property by documents executed on the same day. The Court held that there was a reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, the case was concerned with a different provision from section 70(2). Section 12(1)(b) (now repealed) of the EGDA concerned estate duty, and allowed the reservation of a benefit to accompany the disposition of property. It has been noted in some cases that the meaning of this phrase is unclear (Overton’s Trustees v CIR \[1968\] NZLR 872), and may be inconsistent with the meaning of the word “reservation” in the context of gift duty. In that statutory context, the Court held that a simultaneous transfer is a reservation. The case is relevant to section 70, however, not for that finding, but because it was held that transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The Ingram case – when is a transfer simultaneous? The English courts have more recently considered the issue of simultaneous transfers, in the trilogy of cases involving Lady Ingram. The High Court decision (\[1995\] 4 All ER 334) was appealed to the Court of Appeal (\[1997\] 4 All ER 395), which resulted in a further appeal to the House of Lords. The judgments in the case focused on the meaning of “reservation” in section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK). That provision states that a gift that comes within it will be a “gift with reservation” and may be subject to inheritance tax. The test is whether or not the property gifted continues to be enjoyed by the donor in any way. In the original (High Court) decision, it was concluded that the transfers were simultaneous and, therefore, there was no reservation of a benefit to the transferor. However, a majority of the Court of Appeal held that there was a grant back and a reservation. The House of Lords held that the transfers were simultaneous, and that there was no reservation. The facts In the Ingram case the transaction was structured as follows: 29 March – Lady Ingram transfers property absolutely to her solicitor. 29 March – solicitor declares he holds the property on trust for Lady Ingram and is acting on her direction. 30 March – solicitor grants Lady Ingram two 20-year rent free leases. 31 March – solicitor transfers property (subject to the leases) to the two sons and grandson of Lady Ingram (the trustees). 31 March – the trustees declared themselves to be the trustees of a settlement of the property for the benefit of certain beneficiaries. Lady Ingram is not a beneficiary. The House of Lords observed that the series of transactions was structured, in part, to make the benefit to Lady Ingram a retention rather than a reservation so that inheritance tax would not be payable. However, in practice, this was more difficult in the United Kingdom than it would be in New Zealand. The United Kingdom has no equivalent provision to section 49 of the NZ Property Law Act 1952, allowing a lease to be granted to oneself. As Lady Ingram was unable to grant a lease to herself, it was necessary for her to transfer the property to someone else – her solicitor – so he could grant the lease to her. The reasoning of the House of Lords The House of Lords held that there was no reservation. The Law Lords held that section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) only applied where the benefit was derived from the interest given away. They held that, in this case, the trustees and beneficiaries had never had anything more than the freehold of the property subject to the lease. This property (the freehold less the leasehold interests) was not enjoyed by Lady Ingram in any way. She enjoyed only the leasehold interests. There was no reservation because the interest retained by Lady Ingram had been defined with the necessary precision, whether the leases were technically valid or not. Her intention was evidenced by the documents that gave effect to the transaction. The Court of Appeal had held that the leases were not valid, and so the whole property must have transferred to the transferees and then a reservation was made back to Lady Ingram. The Court of Appeal also said that even if the leases were valid, that it is not conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence until the lessor has acquired the freehold interest. Therefore, the gift must have comprised the freehold interest and the lessor must have then given a lease back. The House of Lords concluded that the leases granted by the solicitor to Lady Ingram were valid. However, the Law Lords also stated that they did not need to decide the validity of the leases in order to decide the case. They stated that, even if the leases were not valid, it was clear that the intention of the parties was for Lady Ingram to keep the leasehold rights and only give the other rights in the property away. This intention was evidenced by the documents. Lord Hoffman recognised that under conveyancing law, the whole property must pass before a lease can be granted. However, his Lordship considered that conveyancing form could not apply to make the transfer a reservation when it would otherwise not be. Lord Hoffman stated that (p 303): It is true that as a matter of conveyancing, no lease can come into existence until the freehold has been vested in the intended lessor. But s. 102 is concerned not with conveyancing but with beneficial interests. It uses words like ‘enjoyment’ and ‘benefit’. In A-G v Worrall 1 \[1895\] QB 99 at p. 104, a case on a predecessor of s. 102, Lord Esher MR began his judgment with the words: ‘It has been held that in cases of this kind the Court has to determine what the real nature of the transaction was, apart from legal phraseology and the forms of conveyancing.’ If one looks at the real nature of the transaction, there seems to me no doubt that Ferris J \[in the High Court\] was right in saying that the trustees and beneficiaries never at any time acquired the land free of Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. The need for a conveyance to be followed by a lease back is a mere matter of conveyancing form. As I have said, she could have reserved a life interest by a unilateral disposition. Why should it make a difference that the reservation of a term of years happens to require the participation of another party if the substance of the matter is that the property will pass only subject to the lease? Lord Hoffman considered it important to look at the real nature of the transaction and not just the conveyancing form. The rights and obligations of each party should be examined to determine whether or not the transactions are within the section. The Law Lords decided that it was the intention of the parties that only the net property interests be given away. They considered that the way the section was written focused on benefits. They held that Lady Ingram did not receive any benefits from the net property interest, but only from the leases, which were not part of the subject matter of the gift. At no time did the donees hold the property free from Lady Ingram’s leasehold interest. Therefore, she was not within the provision as she had not reserved a benefit out of the property the subject of the gift. The Law Lords identified three aspects of the transaction which persuaded them that this was a situation where the transferor only ever intended that the net property interest be transferred, and not the whole property with a subsequent grant back. First, the House of Lords noted that Lady Ingram had defined very precisely the rights she intended to give away. She had never intended to grant the lease to the trustees, only the freehold shorn of the leasehold interests. Secondly, the creation and existence of the leases was not dependent on the concurrence of the trustees and beneficiaries. It was never intended that the trustees would receive the whole property and then grant a lease back. This finding was supported by the fact that Lady Ingram had gone to such lengths to grant the lease before transferring the balance of the property. Thirdly, because of the first two reasons, the House of Lords looked at the equitable rights and obligations of the parties, assuming that the leases were not valid. The Law Lords stated that equity would give Lady Ingram a right to the leases. Where the intention of the parties is clear that it was intended that the transfers be simultaneous, or it was intended that some rights never be given away, then this would give rise to equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. Therefore, in equity, the trustees were regarded as never having received the leasehold interests. From the moment they received the property they were subject to an equitable obligation to grant the leases. The only part of the property they ever received was the freehold less the leasehold interests. Therefore, the subject matter of the gift was the property shorn of the leasehold interests. These equitable rights would arise from the time of transfer. They would have the effect of making the transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding that in legal theory or under conveyancing rules, the whole property would need to be transferred prior to there being a grant back. This means that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous where there is (at least under legal theory) a grant back of a right. The effect of Ingram Following Ingram (HL), in a situation where the parties to the transactions never intend that the leasehold interests should be part of the subject matter of the gift, and they structure the arrangement with the necessary precision so that equitable rights arise simultaneously, the law will give effect to the parties’ intention. The transaction should not be viewed as involving an instant of time for property to be transferred and then an interest granted back, in order that conveyance formality be met. The House of Lords in Ingram stated that the need for an instant of time was only necessary for conveyancing theory, whereas the particular provision under consideration was more concerned with the rights, benefits and obligations that resulted from the transactions, and with determining enjoyments and benefits of the property interests. The Commissioner’s view is that section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. Discounting the notion of an instant of time between the transfer and the grant back has the result that some transfers, previously considered to be a post transfer grant back, would now be considered to be simultaneous transfers. It could be argued that the reasoning of the House of Lords judgments in Ingram is more sensible than the law as it was before the decision, because the law now will not require such fine distinctions to be made. Before Ingram (HL), if a transferor attempted to retain an interest at the same time property was transferred, there was a potential gift duty liability, whereas if the transferor’s interest in the land was created a moment before the transfer, there was no potential liability. The House of Lords held that all of these types of transactions (where the transferor wishes to give away property rights while retaining some right of occupation), in circumstances where the transferor defines precisely the rights he or she wishes to give away, have the same end result and that, therefore, there should be no reservation. The Nichols case In coming to its conclusion, the House of Lords endorsed the approach of Walton J in the High Court decision of Nichols v IRC (\[1973\] STC 278). That case concerned a father who wished to gift the family home and surrounding land to his son. However, the parents wished to continue living on the property. Therefore, they arranged for the property to be transferred to the son, and for the son to execute a lease in their favour. Walton J in the High Court held that in principle, where property passes which has an immediate equitable obligation on the transferee to grant a lease back, the transaction can amount to a retention of the leasehold interest. Walton J considered that there is no legal impediment to regarding simultaneous transactions as only giving the transferee the property shorn of the leasehold interest. The House of Lords agreed with this approach, and not the Court of Appeal decision in Nichols which had reversed Walton J’s judgment. The House of Lords in Ingram considered it was conceptually possible for a lease to come into existence before the lessor acquires the leasehold interest. A simultaneous transfer is not always a retention However, a simultaneous transfer and grant back will not always be outside the scope of section 70(2). Lord Hoffman in the House of Lords indicated that if the leasehold interest held by Lady Ingram had contained benefits that she did not have before the property was transferred, then it may not be possible for the transfer to be a retention of the leasehold. Lord Hoffman took this point from the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols. Although the House of Lords disapproved of the Court of Appeal judgment in Nichols, the disagreement was on the central issue of whether a simultaneous transfer and a lease back could be a retention. In Nichols, a father had given his son his land, and as part of that transaction, the son was required to give a lease back. Under the lease, the son gave a covenant to undertake any repairs. The Court of Appeal held that existence of the covenants made the transaction a reservation, and it could not be a retention. The right to have the buildings repaired under the covenant did not exist before the transfer, and therefore could not be something not given (p 285). A retention must be a retention of property that the transferor had prior to the transfer of the balance of the property. If, for example, the transferor has a leasehold interest as a result of a transfer of property, and the leasehold interest gives the transferor rights that he or she did not already have, then that leasehold interest could not have been something retained. It can only be something given by someone else. Therefore, if the transferor has a property interest as a result of a transfer that he or she could not have had before the transfer, then the transaction will be a transfer with a grant back, and will be a reservation. Other points to come from the House of Lords judgment in Ingram The House of Lords judgment held that it is possible in England to create a property interest prior to transferring the balance of the property, by the use of a nominee. Prior to this decision, it had been the view that it was not possible to retain an interest to oneself in England because of the common law rule that one can not grant a property interest to oneself (Rye v Rye \[1962\] 1 All ER 146). That rule has been overridden (at least partly) in New Zealand by section 49 of the Property Law Act 1952. The judgments of both Lord Hutton and Lord Hoffman concluded that, at least in English law, it was possible for a nominee to grant a lease to his or her principal. The implication is that a transferor can now retain a property interest prior to transfer, through the use of a nominee. Following the House of Lords decision, it seems that the British Parliament decided that legislation was the only way to ensure clarity. As a result of the case, amendments have been made to add new sections into the Finance Act 1986 (UK), setting out specifically and in great detail when a gift will be a “gift with reservation” and when it will not. In the Budget Press Release of 9 March 1999 it was declared that: Loopholes which result in the avoidance of inheritance tax are to be closed ... the changes which confirm the Government’s determination to stamp out tax avoidance, relate to what is often referred to as making a ‘gift with reservation’. This is when, for example, someone gives away his/her house but continues to live in the property. The change restores the tax position as it was understood to be prior to the House of Lords’ ruling in the case of Ingram v IRC. The Commentary to the Bill also stated that it was a specific anti-avoidance measure designed to counter Ingram-type schemes, and that no attempt was being made to rewrite the basic wording of the gift with reservation rules. Meaning of “reservation” in section 70(2) after Ingram The law established by the cases The cases discussed above establish that: • Property is retained when the transferor retains an interest in property and disposes of the balance or reversionary interest in the property (Lees). • Property is reserved when the transferor disposes of the whole interest and reserves an interest out of that which was disposed of (Lees). • The case of Finch distinguishes between a reservation and a retention of a benefit or advantage. There is a reservation when a benefit or advantage is reserved from the interest actually given. There is merely a retention of the benefit or interest if the benefit or interest is held before the transfer of the balance of the property, or if the grant and transfer occur at the same time. See also Munro, Oakes, and Ingram. • The House of Lords decision in Ingram recognises that the transfers may sometimes be simultaneous. The House of Lords concluded that when the transfers are simultaneous, in circumstances where it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property be disposed of, there will be no reservation. This is because the transferor will have received no benefit arising from the subject matter of the gift. • The House of Lords judgment in Ingram stated that the courts should look at the intention of the parties to the transaction. The House of Lords held that section 102 of the United Kingdom Finance Act, a comparable provision to New Zealand’s section 70(2), is concerned with the transfer of benefits and advantages, not the transfers of property which must take place for legal reasons. Sometimes equitable rights will come into effect which will make transfers simultaneous, notwithstanding the requirements of the rules of conveyancing that there be a certain sequencing of transactions. The parties’ intentions will be evidenced by the documents of the transaction. • Simultaneous transfers will include the situation where the transferring of the legal rights does not happen precisely at the same time, where the transfers are part of the one transaction, provided that it was never the intention of the parties that the whole property is transferred, and provided also that equitable rights arise simultaneously (Nichols (HC) and Ingram (HL)). • If an apparently simultaneous transfer results in the donor having an interest in property that includes rights that he or she did not have before the transfer, the transfer will be a reservation, and not a retention of property the transferor already had (Nichols (CA) and Ingram (HL)). Which types of real property do the rulings apply to? The rulings apply to real property. Real property includes dwelling houses, farms and commercial buildings. After the previous ruling was issued, the Commissioner was asked whether the arrangements only apply to dwelling houses. In a “Question we’ve been asked” item, published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 9, No 8 (August 1997), the Commissioner gave the view that real property includes all forms of real property. The Commissioner’s view on this issue has not changed. Application of section 70(2) to the specific arrangements Pre-transfer grant of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy A pre-transfer grant occurs where the transferor creates an interest in the property and grants that interest to him or herself before transferring the rest of the property interest to a third party (for example, a family trust). If the separation of the interest occurs before the transfer to the other person, the subsequent transfer is treated as the transfer of one interest while retaining another. If an arrangement is a pre-transfer grant, it does not involve a reservation of interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the property transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Life interests granted to oneself The Property Law Act 1952 (PLA) gives the transferor authority to grant a life estate to him or herself. Under section 49 of the PLA, the transferor may transfer an estate or interest in land to him or herself individually or jointly with others. Section 66A of the PLA provides that covenants in a transfer by the transferor to him or herself (under section 49 of the PLA) are enforceable. Example 1 A creates a life estate in a property, and then transfers the balance of the property to the trustees of his family trust. A’s property is worth $175,000. The value of the life estate is $60,000. The price for the reversionary interest is $100,000. This is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. Section 70(2) does not apply. There is a gift because the consideration paid by the trust ($100,000 for property worth $115,000) for the interest in reversion is inadequate. The Commissioner will assess A for gift duty on the $15,000 gifted under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. However, section 70(2) does not apply to include the $60,000 life interest in the dutiable amount, because that interest was retained by the transferor and not gifted to the transferor. Leasehold interests granted to oneself A transferor can grant a lease to him or herself in New Zealand. At common law a person could not grant a lease to him or herself, In re Nichol \[1931\] NZLR 718, 727, Rye v Rye \[1962\] AC 496; 1 All ER 146. However, because a lease is an estate or interest in land, this rule has been abrogated in New Zealand by sections 49 and 66A of the PLA (Harding v CIR \[1977\] 1 NZLR 337; 2 NZTC 61, 145). At common law, when the same person owned the freehold and the leasehold interest in a property, a merger of the interests occurred and the lesser interest (the lease) ceased to exist. In equity, merger depended on the intention of the parties. Section 30 of the PLA adopts the equitable rule, so there will only be merger where the parties intend it to occur. Usually, when a person creates a lease and grants it to him or herself, the intention is for the estates to remain separate. Example 2 B creates a lease for fifty years in her own favour over her property, and then transfers the balance of the property to her only child, C. B’s property is worth $250,000. The value of the lease is $100,000. The value of the balance of the property is $150,000. The price to be paid for the balance is $90,000. This price is outstanding, as an unsecured debt owed by C to B. There is a gift under section 61, the section which imposes gift duty, assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The gift is the amount of $60,000, being the inadequacy of consideration for the property transferred worth $150,000, less the $90,000 paid. Accordingly, there is potentially gift duty payable on the $60,000. Section 70(2) has no application because there is no reservation from the disposition of property to C. Therefore, the Commissioner will not include the $100,000 value of the lease in the dutiable value of the gift. Licences to occupy purported to be granted to oneself However, the provisions of the PLA do not extend to a licence to occupy. A licence, unlike a lease, is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and use it for a particular purpose. As Gresson P said in Baikie v Fullerton- Smith \[1961\] NZLR 901, 906 in a land law context, a licence is basically an authority that prevents the individual to whom it is granted from being regarded as a trespasser on someone else’s property. Therefore, a licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. In the absence of comparable provisions to sections 49 and 66A of the PLA applying to licences, a landowner cannot license him or herself to be a licensee. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 is the situation where a transferor purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy before transferring the remaining property interest. The purported grant of the licence will be invalid for conveyancing purposes, and all the rights in the property will be transferred to the transferee. One of two results will occur. Firstly, the transferee could keep ownership of all the rights to the property. If all property rights are kept, there will be no grant back to the transferor (at any time) and no reservation. However, gift duty will be payable to the extent of the inadequacy of the consideration. Secondly, the transferee could transfer the licence back to the transferor once the third party has been granted the rights in the property. This is acceptable in land law. Under land law, the grant back would take place after the transfer. This is the situation covered in BR Pub 02/07. Following Ingram (HL), the Commissioner considers that this second situation should not be analysed as a post-transfer grant. Ingram established that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986 (UK) is on the transfer of benefits as a result of the transaction. In the Commissioner’s view, section 70(2) should be interpreted the same way. So although a transfer is invalid under legal conveyancing theory, it still may create equitable rights and obligations as between the parties. In this situation, if the intention of the parties was that the licence be taken out of the property before the transfer, then following the equitable maxim “equity, regarding as done what ought to be done”, effect will be given to such an agreement for the transfer of land, and equitable rights and obligations will accrue to each party with effect from the moment of transfer. In this situation, the transferee never acquires the property free from the obligation to transfer back the licence the transferor intended to retain. The result will be that from the moment of the transfer, the transferor will have an equitable right to the licence and the transferee will have an equitable obligation to grant it. This has the effect of making the transfers simultaneous. If the transaction is simultaneous, it will not be a reservation subject to section 70(2). (The other arrangements which are simultaneous transfers are discussed below.) The documents to the transaction will be evidence of the intention of the parties (as in Ingram (HL)). They should be used to ascertain what the parties intended was to be the subject matter of the gift. The first situation mentioned above, where the transferee does not grant a licence back, is not similar in nature to the other arrangements ruled on. Therefore, the Commissioner has not ruled on that arrangement. Summary of the consequences of pre-transfer grants Where a pre-transfer grant of a life estate or a lease occurs, there is no reservation of a benefit under section 70(2) (BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03). Therefore, the amount of the life estate or lease is not included in the amount of the gift. A licence to occupy cannot be structured as a pre-transfer grant. The result will either result in no licence, or a simultaneous transfer. Neither of these will be a reservation. Simultaneous transfers are discussed more under a following heading. Post-transfer grant back of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy A post-transfer grant back occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee subject to the transferee granting an interest (any of a life interest, a lease or a licence to occupy) back to the transferor. If an arrangement is a gift involving a post-transfer grant, it will be a reservation of an interest by the transferor. Section 70(2) will apply, and accordingly the duty payable will be calculated on the value of the whole of the property transferred, without deducting the value of the reservation, less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04-02/06. Example 3 A transfers property worth $200,000 to B, as she is going overseas for three years and no longer wants to have property in New Zealand. B pays A $100,000 for the property. However, A and B agree that B will grant A a lease for the property when she returns, in three years time. The lease has a value of $50,000. A and B have documents drawn up to this effect. In this case, it is clearly the intention of the parties that the whole property interest is transferred, and at a later time a lease be granted back. The gift is the difference between the value of the property ($200,000) and the consideration paid ($100,000). The value of the lease is a reservation, and so is not deducted from the value of the gift. Example 4 D has decided to transfer ownership of her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the property for the rest of her life . She intends to transfer the full property interest to the trustees of the trust, and at a later stage, for the trustees to grant her a licence to occupy. In accordance with this arrangement, the trustees later grant D a licence to occupy. The documents are consistent with the parties’ intentions. The property has a market value of $200,000. The licence to occupy is valued in accordance with the provisions of the EGDA at $50,000. The transfer price of the property is $100,000, which D leaves owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The property is disposed of without fully adequate consideration ($150,000 compared with the market value of $200,000), so the Commissioner will assess D for gift duty under section 61 assuming other gift duty thresholds and requirements are met. The licence is a reservation, because under the arrangement, it is transferred back out of the property gifted. Section 70(2) applies, so the value of the licence is not deducted from the value of the gift. The amount on which gift duty is calculated is $100,000 (being the licence reserved and the extent of the inadequate consideration). Simultaneous transfers of a life estate, a lease, or a licence to occupy Life estates and leases A simultaneous transfer of property occurs where the transferor transfers property to a transferee and simultaneously the transferee grants back an interest in that property (whether a life estate or a lease). As discussed earlier, the House of Lords in Ingram considered that the focus of section 102 of the Finance Act 1986, the comparable section to New Zealand’s section 70(2), was on the benefits actually reserved, and not the legal form of the transactions. Where it is clearly the intention of the parties that the net property interest only be transferred, but conveyancing rules would say that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back, the transferor has equitable rights in the interest transferred back from the moment the first transfer is made. It is not necessary to regard there being an instant of time between the transfers, even though it may be required in conveyancing theory. Therefore, the transfers will be simultaneous, and there will be no reservation. If an arrangement is a simultaneous transfer and grant, no reservation of interest by the transferor is involved. Section 70(2) does not apply, and accordingly any duty payable will be based on the value of the balance or reversionary interest in the estate transferred less the amount of any consideration paid. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/08 and BR Pub 02/09. Licences to occupy and other transactions intended to be pre-transfer grants As mentioned above under pre-transfer grants, it is not possible for land owners to grant themselves a licence to occupy their land. Therefore, if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence to occupy and then transfers the balance of the land to someone else, that transaction will not, in terms of conveyancing law, be a pre- transfer grant. However, following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, where it is the intention of the parties that only the net property interest is to be given away, conveyancing rules should not mean that the transaction is carried out in some other way. Where rights cannot be validly self-granted, but it was clearly the intention of the parties that those rights should not be part of the transfer, equity will give effect to those rights as though they were valid from the time of transfer. If the original transfer is invalid for some other reason, this reasoning may also apply. The effect of this is that grants of rights that cannot be validly self-granted will often now be simultaneous transfers rather than post-transfer grants back. Therefore, in the case of the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07, it is not possible to grant a licence to oneself. However, the parties’ intention to transfer only the net property is evidenced by the documents in which the transferor attempts to grant the licence to him or herself. If that was the parties’ intention, equity will demand that the transferee grant the licence back. These equitable rights will arise from the moment of transfer. Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07 will now be treated as a simultaneous transfer rather than a post-transfer grant back, if it is the parties’ intention, evidenced by the documents and the circumstances of the transfer, that only the net property interest transfers. Consequently, it will be a retention of the licence and not a reservation. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is similar to the arrangement in BR Pub 02/07. The arrangement in BR Pub 02/10 is the situation where the parties intend that the transferor will grant a licence to him or herself simultaneously as the balance of the property is granted to someone else. Even though the parties attempt to make the transaction simultaneous, it still amounts to an attempt to grant oneself a licence, and legally the transaction will consist of property passing and a licence being granted back. The documents relevant to the attempt to grant a licence to him or herself will be evidence that only the net property interest was intended to pass. In the Commissioner’s view, Ingram applies, and this arrangement will be treated as a simultaneous transfer of the licence and the net property, and it will be a retention and not a reservation. On the other hand, if it is clear from the documents that the whole property interest was intended to be the subject-matter of the gift followed by a grant back, and there is no intention for an interest to be retained, then equity will not intervene to create rights and obligations as between the parties, and there will be a post-transfer grant back. In this situation, there is a reservation of a benefit to the donor. Transactions that may appear to be post-transfer grants may be simultaneous transfers It may in some situations be difficult to distinguish between a simultaneous transfer and a post-transfer grant. Both may involve the same legal steps of property transferring and a lesser interest transferring back. The essential difference between the two is that in a simultaneous transfer, the parties only ever intend the net property interest to pass. In a post-transfer grant, the parties intend the whole property to pass, and the lesser interest subsequently to pass back. The documents relevant to the transaction will be important in establishing the legal nature of the transaction and the parties’ intention. Requirements of a simultaneous transfer needed to satisfy the Commissioner The Commissioner will be satisfied that a simultaneous transfer amounts to a retention (i.e. pre-transfer grant) and not a reservation (i.e. a post-transfer grant), if there is sufficient evidence that the parties never intended that the whole property in question pass to the transferee. This evidence would usually include the following elements, taken from Ingram (HL). • The transferor defines very precisely the rights he or she intends to give away. • The documents relevant to the transaction support the claim that the parties intend that only part of the property, as defined, is to be given away. • There is never a time, in equity, when the transferee holds the whole property free of the interest that the transferor seeks to retain. • The retention is not dependent on the concurrence of the transferee\[s\], including beneficiaries where the property is transferred to a trust. • The transferor does not receive an interest in the property that includes something more than he or she previously had, e.g. covenants by the transferor/lessor to repair the property. Summary of simultaneous grants Where there is a simultaneous grant and transfer (BR Pub 02/07-02/10) there is no reservation. Example 5 H wishes to provide for her children by making sure that they will own her house when she dies. She draws up a document, which gifts the house to the children while at the same time creating a life estate for herself. It was always intended, as evidenced by the documents, that the life estate be created and kept by H. She does not gain any extra rights that she did not have before the gift. The house is worth $250,000 and the amount of the life estate is estimated to be $45,000. The amount of the life interest will not be a reservation within the meaning of s 70(2), meaning that H will only be liable for gift duty under section 63 on the amount that is given away, being $205,000. Other sections of the EGDA affecting reservations Sliding value clauses Commonly, documents evidencing the disposition of property provide that the consideration shall be a fixed amount or such higher amount as the Commissioner accepts will not give rise to a gift for gift duty purposes. If: • the consideration is bona fide; and • the obligation to pay it is fulfilled; and • the consideration is a genuine attempt to approximate the market value of the property; the Commissioner accepts that where section 70(2) might otherwise apply, and the parties use the sliding value clause to increase the consideration so there is no gift, gift duty will not be payable. Amendment of documents Under section 70(3), the Commissioner may permit the cancellation or amendment of any instrument creating or evidencing a disposition of property to which section 70 applies. Application in writing must be within six months of the date of the instrument, or within such extended time as the Commissioner thinks fit to allow in the special circumstances of the case. Documents that are amended or redrawn will be reconsidered to see whether section 70(2) applies to them. Valuation of retained interests Section 66 of the EGDA requires every dutiable gift to be valued as at the date of the making of the gift. Section 67 gives the Commissioner a general discretion as to how property is valued, subject to sections 68A to 68G, 69 and 70, which include methods for valuing particular property. Particularly relevant to this commentary are sections 68A and section 68F. Section 68A prescribes how land is valued. Section 68F provides that the tables of life expectancies in the Second Schedule to the Act are used to value life interests, except in one instance. The Commissioner has some discretion in determining the life expectation of a person suffering from a terminal illness. In practice, in determining the life expectancy of a person suffering from a terminal illness, the Commissioner will generally use Table D. Table D gives the present value of an annuity or other interest for a period other than life, or expectant on an event other than death. The Commissioner will generally apply it for the period which the Commissioner accepts as the actual or expected life expectancy of the person. When there is more than one transferor, and all are entitled to a life estate or a lease for life, the value of the right should take account of the longest remaining life expectancy of the transferors. The value of the right relates to the time the transferees are out of possession of the property. If all transferors have a right of occupation until their respective deaths, the discount of the property’s value to the transferees relates to the longest expected occupation of any of the transferors. Subsequent gift of reserved benefit Where gift duty has been paid on a gift valued under section 70, any gift duty on a subsequent gift of the benefit or advantage reserved, or any part of it, may be reduced, under section 76. A deduction from the gift duty on the subsequent gift is calculated as follows: a x c b Where: a is the value of the benefit or advantage comprised in the subsequent gift, either at the date of the gift, or at the date of the original gift, whichever is less; and b is the value of the original gift; and c is the amount of gift duty paid on the original gift. Example 6 Assume A transfers property worth $42,000 to B and reserves a life interest in it. $ 42,000.00 $ A is a male aged 48 years at date of transfer. The present value of income on capital of $1 for life for a male aged 48, from Table A is 0.71201. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.71201 x $42,000 = $29,904.42 The value of the reservation is therefore 29,904.42 And the value of the balance of the gift is 12,095.58 A has to pay gift duty on both under Sec 70 - value of the balance of the gift 12,095.58 - value of the reservation 29,904.42 Total value of Gift 42,000.00 Duty on $42,000 on $36,000 at set rate 450.00 on $6,000 at 10% 600.00 1,050.00 Assume 10 years later A surrenders the life interest. The property previously worth $42,000 is now worth $48,000. A is now aged 58 years at the date of surrender. The present value of income on capital of $1 for the life of a male age 58 from Table A is 0.57617. The present value of the life interest is therefore 0.57617 x $48,000 = $27,656.16 A makes another gift of $30,000 at the same time. The aggregate gift is therefore: 30,000.00 57,656.16 Duty on $57,656 is calculated as follows: on $54,000 at the set rate 2,250.00 on $3,656 at 20% 731.20 Gross gift duty 2,981.20 Section 76 applies to give relief for the gift duty already paid. The gross gift duty is reduced by the relief given under section 76 where: (a) is original gift of reservation $29,904.40 subsequent gift value of reservation $27,656.16 whichever is less (b) value of the original gift $42,000 (c) gift duty on the original gift $1,050 27,656.16 x 1,050.00 = $691.40 42,000.00 Maximum relief under section 76 = $691.40 Apportionment of the gift duty between the two gifts Gift $30000 = 30,000 x 2,981.20 = $57,656 1,551.20 Gift $27656 = 27,656 x 2,981.20 = $1,430.00 57,656 Less relief under section 76 1,430.00 691.40 738.60 $738.60 Gift duty collectable on subsequent gift 2,289.80 PART TWO: INCOME TAX Background Section CE 1(1)(e) of the ITA includes within a person’s gross income all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from: • any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land; or • the grant of a right to take profits of the land. This section considers the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangements. The new rulings and commentary apply from 1 April 1999. The previous ruling and commentary on the income tax aspects of this matter, Public Ruling BR Pub 96/2A, applied to dispositions of real property made up until the end of the 1998-1999 year. It was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 8, No 10 (December 1996). The Commissioner’s view of the income tax aspects of the arrangements has not changed from the expired rulings. However, more analysis is provided to support aspects of the Commissioner’s view. Summary of conclusions Pre-grant transfer If a transferor grants an interest in property to him or herself, and later grants the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person, the interest kept by the transferor does not constitute gross income of the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-grant transfer If a transferor transfers property to another person, reserving an interest in the property which the transferee later grants back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income under section CE 1(1)(e). The transferee will derive gross income if the transferee grants a lease or a licence back to the transferor, and an amount is derived by the transferee which is attributable to the lease or licence. Simultaneous transfer If a transferor grants him or herself a property interest, and simultaneously transfers the balance or reversionary interest to another person, the interest granted to the transferor does not constitute gross income to the transferee or the transferor under section CE 1(1)(e). Legislation Under section CE 1(1)(e) of the Income Tax Act 1994, a person’s gross income includes: All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land . Section OB 1 contains definitions for the purposes of the Act. Section OB 1 begins: In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires,— “Lease”, “leasehold estate” and “estate” are defined in section OB 1: “Lease” — (a) Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (d), (e), and (f) means a disposition that creates a leasehold estate: ... “Leasehold estate” includes any estate however created, other than a freehold estate: ... “Estate”, or “interest”, in relation to land, means any estate or interest in land, whether legal or equitable, and whether vested or contingent, in possession, reversion, or remainder; and includes any right to the possession of land or to the receipt of the rents or profits from the land, or to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the land, whether immediate or through a trustee, or otherwise; but does not include a mortgage: Application of the legislation Section CE 1(1)(e) deems a person’s gross income to include all rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived by a land owner from any lease or licence affecting the land. Amounts derived from certain transfers of land, where an interest in land is transferred back to the transferor, may be included in gross income. Pre-transfer grant of an interest in land Where a lease or a licence is created before land is transferred, an income tax liability will not arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If a transferor obtains an interest in land transferred before the balance or reversionary interest in the land is transferred, the transferee does not derive gross income as a result of the transaction. He or she never owns the interest that the transferor keeps, so does not derive income from that land. Therefore, he or she cannot derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from that lease or licence as a result of the transfer. Pre-transfer grants – implications for the transferor The transferor also does not derive income from the transaction. The transferor does not derive a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue from a lease, licence, easement, or profits from his or her land. Instead, the owner has simply kept an interest in the land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/02 and BR Pub 02/03. Example 7 Taxpayer A creates a lease in a property, and then transfers the reversionary interest to the trustees of his family trust. A’s house is worth $175,000. The value of the lease is $60,000. The price to be paid for the reversionary interest is $175,000 less the $60,000. This price of $115,000 is outstanding as an unsecured debt owed by the trust to A. The Commissioner will not assess A or the trustees for income tax under section CE 1(1)(e) on the $60,000 value of the lease. Section CE 1(1)(e) does not apply because neither A nor the trustees derive any rent, fines or premiums from the lease. Licences to occupy A transferor can grant him or herself a life interest or lease over land, before disposing of the balance or reversionary interest in the property to another person. However, it is not legally possible for a transferor to grant a licence to occupy to him or herself. A licence is not an estate or interest in land. A licence is a personal permission to enter land and to use it for a particular purpose. A licence must be granted from a licensor to a licensee. Consistent with the conclusions relating to gift duty, the Commissioner will treat a purported grant to oneself of a licence as a simultaneous transfer. This point is discussed further below. Post-transfer grant back of an interest in land Where land is transferred subject to a lease or a licence later being transferred back, an income tax liability may arise under section CE 1(1)(e). Post-transfer grants – implications for the transferee If the transferor transfers land, and reserves an interest in the land by receiving a grant of an interest from the transferee, section CE 1(1)(e) may apply to any gross amount derived by the transferee in relation to that transaction. There are three parts to section CE 1(1)(e) that are relevant to the arrangements: • There must be a rent, fine, premium, or other revenue. • The income must be derived by a land owner. • The income must be derived from a lease or a licence. Requirement 1 – amounts that are “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues” Section CE 1(1)(e) will apply if, by granting an interest back to the transferor, the transferee derives an amount that is within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The arrangements potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e) (the arrangements in BR Pub 02/5 and BR Pub 02/06) are concerned with situations where property is gifted for inadequate consideration, subject to an interest being granted back to the transferor by the transferee. If the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the interest granted by the transferee back to the transferor, the transferee may derive gross income if the other two requirements of section CE 1(1)(e) are met (which are discussed below). An amount is derived even if there is no direct payment Income is derived by the transferee, even though there may be no payment made to the transferee. Under section EB 1(1) of the ITA, a person derives income, even where it has not been received, when an amount has been, for example, credited in account or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or behalf. A netting off of obligations is an example of this, and so the transferee “derives” the income. So the amount in the following situations may be income to the transferee: • the transferor reduces the price (if any) payable by the transferee for the initial transfer of property; or • the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the lease or licence granted back to the transferor. Whether the amounts derived under the lease or licence arrangements are rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues The amounts derived under the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06 will be subject to section CE 1(1)(e) if they are within the words “rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues”. The words of the section are now examined to see when amounts derived under the arrangements are within these words. The lease arrangement in BR Pub 02/05 is discussed first. “Rent” has been characterised as the contractual sum payable for the use of the leased premises: United Scientific Holdings Ltd v Burnley BC \[1978\] AC 904. A similar definition was used in Samuel v Salmon \[1945\] 2 All ER 520. Rent does not only relate to leases. For instance, the term “rent” or “rent-charge” may be used when a purchaser of land pays periodic sums rather than a lump sum for the land. A “fine” is technically a sum of money payable by the tenant on the renewal of a lease (Hinde, McMorland & Sim, para. 5.086), but is sometimes loosely used to refer to a premium (B G Utting & Co Ltd v Hughes \[1939\] 2 All ER 126). A “premium” is a lump sum paid for the acquisition of a lease by a lessee: Regent Oil Co Ltd v Strick \[1965\] 3 All ER 174 at p 197. In King v Earl Cadogan \[1915\] 3 KB 485, at p 492, Warrington J said that ... a premium is a payment representing the capital value of the difference between the actual rent and the best that otherwise might be obtained... It is in fact the purchase money which the tenant pays for the benefit which he gets under the lease. The amount derived under the lease arrangement, that is potentially subject to section CE 1(1)(e), arises when one person transfers property to another, and the transferee grants a lease back, and there is either: • a reduction by the transferor of the price of the property first transferred; • a reduction of a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or • any other payment by the transferor to the transferee; where the amount is attributable to the lease granted back to the transferor. This payment arises where the transferor transfers property to another person and the other person later grants a lease back to the transferor. Under this arrangement, it is not specified whether the consideration is a premium, i.e. a payment for the acquisition of the lease, or rent, i.e. a payment made for the use of the property, or a fine, i.e. a payment for the renewal of a lease. A premium is a payment for the granting of a lease. In the arrangement, it is specifically stated that the amount is attributable to the lease granted back. In the Commissioner’s view, the payment under the arrangement is best characterised as consideration for the granting of the lease and is therefore a premium. The amount may also be rent, especially if it is quantified on the basis of the current value of rental payments appropriate to the value of the use of the land under the lease. It is least likely to be a fine, because the arrangement involves the granting of a new lease, and not the renewal of a lease. However, if “fine” also means premium, it may be a fine. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the amount derived under the arrangement is either a premium or rent, or a payment for both. Premiums and rents cover between them any payment for the granting of a lease and any payment made during the lease for the use of the property. The amount must be either one of these two types of amounts. Therefore, an analysis of the words of the section supports the conclusion that a one- off payment for a lease is a premium and/or rent. Section CE 1(1)(e) also applies to amounts of goodwill. The Commissioner considers that the amounts derived under the arrangements are clearly not payments of goodwill. Goodwill is the benefit and advantage of the good name, reputation and connection of a business: Inland Revenue Commissioners v Muller & Co’s Margerine Ltd \[1901\] AC 217. There is no business element in the arrangements. Other revenues If the amount derived is not a rent, fine, or a premium, the Commissioner’s view is that the amount derived under the arrangement comes within “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). The issue in interpreting these words is whether “other revenues” means amounts that are revenue in nature. The amounts derived under the arrangements are lump sums received in relation to the transfer of ownership of interests in land. If “revenues” in the context of section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature, then it could be argued that the amounts derived under the arrangement are capital in nature and not subject to the section. The ordinary meaning of “revenues” and dictionary definitions suggest that “revenues” means revenue in nature (see the Concise Oxford Dictionary, 10 th ed., 1999). The issue, which is discussed next and under the following headings, is not the meaning of “revenues” in isolation, but its meaning in the context of section CE 1(1)(e). Miller v IRC The meaning of “revenues” as used in section 88(1)(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (which was the same as section CE 1(1)(e)) was considered in Miller v IRC 10 AITR 122 (SC). The Court was concerned with a payment received by a land owner for two purposes. It was paid for the right to remove coal from the land owner’s land. It was also accepted by the owner as payment in full satisfaction of compensation for damage to the land, which would otherwise be payable under a previous agreement. Henry J made the following comment: The word “revenue” in its ordinary import in relation to the owner of land connotes the incomings which arise therefrom: London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority, London and North-Eastern Rail Co v Anglo-Scottish Railways Assessment Authority (1933) 150 LT 361 (HL) per Lord Tomlin at p 367. His Honour held that the monthly payments payable to the objector came within the words “other revenues” because they were paid for the use of land. This finding suggests that the purpose of the section is to capture payments made for the use of land. In finding that the payment was not compensation, and so the section could apply, it could be argued that the case also supports the view that section 88(d) (and section CE 1(1)(e)) only applies to payments that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner’s view is that the case does not go that far. The key finding was that the payments were made for the use of land, and so were within the section. Although Henry J said that a payment for compensation would not be within the section, he did not go so far as to rule out the possibility that capital payments may be within section CE 1(1)(e). In considering the meaning of “revenue” in Miller, Henry J referred to the House of Lords decision in London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co. The House of Lords said that the word “revenue” in relation to a business means those incomings of the business which are the products of or are incidental to the normal working of the business. It is arguable that London, Midland & Scottish Railway Co is authority for the proposition that “revenues” means amounts received in the course of a business. However, in the Commissioner’s view, London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co is not direct authority for the meaning of “revenues” in the context of section 88(1)(d), i.e. CE 1(1)(e), as the statutory contexts are quite different. In London Midland, Lord Tomlin was defining “revenue” in relation to a business. Section CE 1(1)(e) is concerned with amounts derived for the use of land. Even the form of the word is different – “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) and “revenue” in the Railways Act. In summary, although there are arguably indications in Miller and London, Midland and Scottish Rail Co that “revenue” in section CE 1(1)(e) may mean revenue in nature, in the Commissioner’s opinion Miller establishes only that payments for the use of land are within the section. Henry J in Miller did not hold that capital payments could never come within the section. The context of the section The context of the word “revenues” within section CE 1(1)(e) supports the conclusion that the intention is to capture a wide range of payments related to the use of land, and that the section is not limited to payments that are revenue in nature. “Revenues” is preceded by the words “rents, fines, premiums”. In the Commissioner’s opinion, the common theme of the specific words listed is that they are payments made in relation to land. This approach is supported also by considering the other words in the section: (e) All rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues (including payment for or in respect of the goodwill of any business, or the benefit of any statutory licence or privilege) derived by the owner of land from any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land, or from the grant of any right of taking the profits of the land. The section clearly deals with payments for rights relating to land. Types of interests in land or rights relating to land are listed, and further, these interests or rights are only included if they affect the land. In discussing goodwill in Romanos Motel Limited v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 435, the Court of Appeal said that the aim of the section is to include in income receipts from land (p 438). The opening words of the section “rents, fines, premiums” are not linked because they are revenue in nature. Clearly premiums are generally capital in nature. Goodwill, which forms part of this group of words by coming within parentheses after “other revenues”, is also usually capital in nature. Given that, it can be concluded that Parliament intended to include at least some capital payments in the section. The Australian High Court in Clarke v FC of T (1932) 6 ALJ 241 interpreted the comparable Australian section as having the broad intention to capture all payments derived from a lease. Case T8 Case T8 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,044 arguably supports the view that “revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e) means revenue in nature. Barber DJ held on the facts that a payment paid by a lessee was not an option payment but a payment to obtain a lease. Given this finding, in his opinion it was a premium or other revenue derived by the owner of land from a lease affecting the land, and within section 65(2)(g) of the Income Tax Act 1976 (now section CE 1(1)(e)). His Honour made the following comment about section 65(2)(e): Also, if the $22,000 was genuinely part of a sale of realty transaction, then s 65(2)(e) would not apply because it assesses revenue from land and not capital derived or relating to land. Barber DJ could be interpreted as taking the view that the section is aimed at amounts that are revenue in nature. The Commissioner considers in making this comment, his Honour was not asserting that section 65(2)(e) (section CE 1(1)(e)) only assesses revenue and not capital. Clearly some capital items are assessed under section CE 1(1)(e) – premiums are generally capital in nature, as the Privy Council said in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Wattie (1998) 18 NZTC 13,991, at p 13,999, and goodwill is generally capital in nature. The Commissioner considers that this comment is best interpreted as meaning that the section does not apply to income from the sale of land. If the amount received by the taxpayer had been for an option to purchase the motel, then it would have been for the sale of an interest in land, and such a fee would probably not be within section CE 1(1)(e). Therefore, in the Commissioner’s view, Barber DJ’s comment is not authority that no capital payments are caught within section CE 1(1)(e). Commentators’ views The Report of the Taxation Review Committee 1967 (usually known as the “Ross Report”) said that the section treats goodwill as being equivalent to additional rent calculated over the term of the lease but payable at the commencement of the lease. Similarly the Valabh Committee in its December 1989 report Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital said: Section 65(2)(g) \[now section CE 1(1)(e)\] is an attempt to avoid allowing taxpayers to transform lease payments (which would generally be taxable payments received on revenue account) into a non-taxable receipt received on capital account. For that reason, section 65(2)(g) includes in assessable income premiums as well as goodwill received by a lessor. ... These provisions demonstrate how it has been found necessary to move the traditional capital/revenue boundary to hinder the ability of taxpayers to transform otherwise assessable income into income on capital account which would not be subject to tax. These commentators consider that the policy intention is to include in section CE 1(1)(e) payments that are revenue in nature but disguised as capital. Note that that intention does not mean that the section is restricted to capturing disguised rent. The Court of Appeal in Romanos rejected the submission by counsel that only disguised rents for the lease of land, as opposed to a payment for what is really a lease of the goodwill of a business, are taxable under the section. As the Valabh Committee says, a decision has been made to include capital payments in section CE 1(1)(e). Thus the Ross and Valabh Committees considered that genuine premiums and goodwill payments, as well as attempts to disguise rent as premiums or goodwill, are within section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to the issue of whether only receipts that are revenue in nature are income under section CE 1(1)(e) The Commissioner’s opinion is that section CE 1(1)(e) is intended to capture amounts that are paid in relation to use of land, and that payments that have capital attributes may be included in section CE 1(1)(e). The words of the section and the decision in Miller, in particular, support this view. Romanos and Clarke also support the view that the intention of the section is to include in income payments for the use of land. The arguments that would support the contrary view are that Miller is not conclusive authority that “revenues” means incomings and not income in nature. The authority relied on by Henry J – London Midland and Scottish Rail Co. - appeared to find that “revenue” means revenue in nature. In the Commissioner’s view, the contrary arguments are less persuasive than the arguments supporting the view that “revenues” means incomings from land and includes receipts of a one-off nature. Therefore, the Commissioner’s view is that the amounts derived under the lease arrangement are not excluded from the words “other revenues” on the basis that payments that are capital in nature are not included in those words. Reliance on the case of Capel v CIR In the commentary to BR Pub 96/2A, the following was stated: A payment for buying a licence to occupy, or a lease, would also normally be considered a capital sum. However, Romanos and Capel are authority for the proposition that such a payment is included within the term “premiums, or other revenues”. The main issue in Capel was whether any of a number of goodwill payments received by a taxpayer setting up burger bar businesses, was for goodwill attached to a site, or for personal goodwill. Romanos Motel had established that only goodwill attached to a site is included within section CE 1(1)(e) (then section 88 1(d) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1954). The Commissioner now relies primarily on the arguments already discussed, which support the conclusion that capital payments that are not specifically included within section CE 1(1)(e), are in fact intended to be included in the section. Capel does gives some support for this view, in that the Court held that a payment that is capital in nature was within section CE 1(1)(e). Similarly the Court of Appeal in Romanos held that a capital payment for goodwill was subject to section CE 1(1)(e). Comments on technical submissions received Submissions received included two arguments that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to amounts that are revenue in nature. The first of these is that section CE 1 uses both the words “income” and “revenues” leading to the inference that to distinguish these two words, “revenues” must be taken to mean revenue in nature. The Commissioner prefers the view that the word “income” at the beginning of the section is part of the defined term “gross income”, and so inferences cannot be drawn from the use of the word in section CE 1(1)(e). The term gross income is used in the Act as a machinery provision to ensure that the provisions of the Act combine to identify a taxpayer’s taxable income. When the section was first enacted, the term “assessable income” was used for the same purpose. Therefore, the term “gross income” should be viewed as a defined term used for a specific purpose, and the substantive meaning of the word “income” is not relevant in determining the meaning intended for “revenues”. The second argument is that the Income Tax Act treats premiums and fines as revenue items. Previously, premiums and fines could be deducted under section EZ 6. The Commissioner does not consider that an examination of section EZ 6 assists in the interpretation of section CE 1(1)(e). Conclusion as to whether amounts derived under the arrangement involving a lease are subject to section CE 1(1)(e) In summary, the conclusions are that the amounts derived in relation to a lease (the fourth arrangement) are subject to section CE 1(1)(e), because • The amount is rent or a premium; or • The amount is included within “other revenues” because it is an incoming from land, and • The statutory intention is to capture a wide range of amounts derived from a lease, and • The words “other revenues” do not mean other things that are revenue in nature; instead, they mean incomings from land. Is the licence arrangement subject to section CE 1(1)(e)? The discussion so far has related to the application of section CE 1(1)(e) to the arrangement involving a lease. The other arrangement to which section CE 1(1)(e) applies involves a licence – the arrangement in BR Pub 02/06. The words listed in section CE 1(1)(e) – “rents, fines, premiums” apply most commonly to leases and not licences. That raises the issue of whether the amount derived under the licence arrangement is subject to the section. The first point to note is that section CE 1(1)(e) applies to certain receipts derived by the owner of land from “any lease, licence, or easement affecting the land”. Clearly, the section applies to licences. The arrangement involving a licence is described in the ruling as follows: The Arrangement is the disposition of real property for inadequate consideration, where a transferor transfers property to another person and under the arrangement the other person later grants a licence back to the transferor out of the property transferred: • where:  the transferor reduces the price of the property first transferred; or  the transferor reduces a debt owed by the transferee to the transferor; or  the transferor otherwise pays the transferee; and • the amount of the reduction in price, reduction in the debt or the payment is attributable to the licence granted back to the transferor. In summary, an amount is paid under the arrangement as consideration for the licence granted back to the transferor. Are the payments derived under the arrangement included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e)? The Commissioner considers that an amount derived in respect of a licence is included in the words “other revenues” in section CE 1(1)(e). For the reasons discussed above in relation to the lease agreement, the Commissioner does not consider that the words “other revenues” means “revenue in nature”. Instead, the Commissioner considers that these words are intended to mean amounts derived in relation to the use of land. Requirement 2 – the income must be derived by a land owner The discussion has been about the first requirement of section CE 1(1)(e), that is, whether there are “rent, fines, premiums, or other revenues” under the arrangements. The second requirement is that income must be derived by an owner or land. In the arrangements in BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06, a transferee granting either a lease or a licence back to the transferor is the owner of the land out of which that interest is granted. Requirement 3 – income derived from a lease or a licence If the transferee grants the transferor a lease or a licence, and the transferee derives an amount that is attributable to the lease or licence, then the requirement that the income is derived from any lease or licence is satisfied. Accordingly, the transferee is subject to income tax on an amount equal to the value of the amount attributable to the grant of the lease or licence. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/05 and BR Pub 02/06. Example 8 Taxpayer B has decided to transfer her family home to a family trust. She wishes to ensure that she has a right to occupy the house for the rest of her life . She transfers the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees subsequently grant B a licence to occupy. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $200,000. A valuer and actuary value the licence to occupy at $50,000. The house is transferred for $175,000, reduced by $50,000 to $125,000 to take into account the value of the licence to occupy. The $125,000 is left owing by the trustees as a debt repayable on demand. The trust has derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e) of $50,000, being the value of the licence to occupy. Life estate If the transferee grants the transferor a life estate, the transferee is not subject to section CE 1(1)(e). The reason is that section CE 1(1)(e) only applies to leases, licences, easements affecting land, and the grant of a right to take profits from land. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/04. Lease for life Generally, an arrangement referred to as a ‘lease for life’ is not a lease, but a life estate. An essential characteristic of a lease is that is has a certain term: Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v London Residuary Body \[1992\] 3 All ER 504. A lease that is based on the duration of a person’s life does not have a duration that is certain. It is a freehold estate in the nature of a life estate – see Amalgamated Brick & Pipe Co Ltd v O'Shea (1966) 1 NZCPR 580. In some instances, what is referred to as a lease for life may have a certain duration, and therefore will be a lease. For example, a lease expressed to be for say 200 years or for the life of A, is a valid lease. Although it is not known when A will die, and that A will die before 200 years have passed and the lease will terminate at A’s death, the lease has in law a certain duration. A tenancy with the power of each party to determine the tenancy at the end of any period by giving the appropriate notice, called a periodic tenancy, is a lease because any particular term can be made certain, even though it is impossible at the outset of the tenancy to say for what period the terms will last: Amalgamated Brick. Example 9 C and D decide to transfer their home to a family trust. They wish to ensure that they have a right to occupy the house for the rest of their lives . They transfer the house to the trustees of the trust. A condition of the transfer is that the trustees later grant C and D life estates in the property. The trustees comply with this condition. The house has a market value of $250,000. The life estates are worth $75,000. The price of the house is $250,000, which C and D leave owing as a debt, repayable on demand. The debt is reduced by $75,000 upon the grant of the life estates. The trust will not have derived gross income under section CE 1(1)(e), because the grant of a life estate is not income derived from a lease, licence, easement, or the right to take profits from land. Post-transfer grants – income tax implications for the transferor There are no income tax implications for the transferor under section CE 1(1)(1). Section CE 1(1)(e) applies to rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues derived from land. When a transferor transfers land, the person no longer owns the land, so cannot receive any rents, fines or so on from it. Any amount paid by the transferee for the transfer, in the arrangements covered by the rulings, will be consideration for a sale of land. Simultaneous transfer of a lease or a licence Where the grant and the transfer of a lease or a licence occur simultaneously, no income tax liability under section CE 1(1)(e) will arise as a result of the transaction. Purported grant of a licence to oneself The Commissioner’s view is that if a person purports to grant him or herself a licence, whether before or at the same time as the property is transferred to the transferee, that action should be interpreted as an intention to retain rights over the property before the transfer of the balance of the property. Following the House of Lords decision in Ingram, discussed above in relation to gift duty, the Commissioner considers that this situation should be treated as a simultaneous transfer. Simultaneous transfers–- implications for the transferee The transferee is the owner of the property interest transferred from the transferor. Where the transfers are simultaneous, the transferee does not grant anything out of the interest he or she receives, as he or she receives the property interest at the same time as it becomes subject to the obligation to grant an interest in the land back to the transferor. Accordingly, the transferee does not receive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues as a result of receiving the property interest. As this commentary has explained, a simultaneous transfer includes the situation where the requirements of conveyancing mean that the whole property must be transferred before the other interest can be transferred back. Such a situation will be treated as simultaneous, when the intention of the parties, as evidenced by the documents and surrounding circumstances, is for the transferor to retain an interest in the property transferred, and for the transferee never to obtain the property free of the transferor’s interest. Simultaneous transfers – implications for the transferor The transferor does not have an income tax liability, because the transferor does not derive any rents, fines, premiums, or other revenues from a lease or a licence in respect of the property kept or the property transferred. This analysis applies to BR Pub 02/07-02/10. Spreading income When a taxpayer derives income under section CE 1(1)(e), section EB 2(1) of the ITA allows the person to apportion that income between the income year in which it is derived and up to five subsequent income years.
