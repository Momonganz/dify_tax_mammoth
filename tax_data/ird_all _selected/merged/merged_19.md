Introduction 1.1 The term “financial services” covers a wide range of transactions including the provision of loans, the taking of deposits, trading in financial securities such as shares and debentures, the provision of life insurance, and charging interest on goods sold on credit. Businesses involved in the supply of financial services are also varied and include banking institutions, credit unions, financiers, life insurers, and, to a lesser degree, retailers and other businesses that sell goods on credit. 1.2 This discussion document considers the application of goods and services tax (GST) to the supply of financial services in New Zealand. It represents the second part of the post-implementation review of GST and was raised as an area for further review in the discussion document GST: A Review. 1 1.3 Since 1 October 1986, the date that GST first applied to goods and services supplied in New Zealand, supplies of financial services have been exempt from GST. Exemption, technically known as “exemption without credit”, means that GST is not charged on the supply of financial services. It also means that suppliers of financial services are not able to recover any GST paid on purchases in respect of supplying those services, that is, they are denied “input tax credits”. This treatment in effect taxes suppliers of financial services as if they were final consumers. 1.4 Although in New Zealand exemption is generally seen as undesirable as it departs from the policy of maintaining a broad-based GST, it is recognised internationally as a pragmatic solution for including financial services within an indirect tax system such as GST. Treating financial services in this way does, however, create a number of problems including the creation of “tax cascades” in the economy, which can lead to the overtaxation of the business sector. Another problem is the incentive for banks, financiers, life insurers and other financial service providers (financial intermediaries) to “self- supply” essential activities – that is, undertake the activity internally, rather than out-source it, so as to minimise the impact of GST. Exemption also generally increases compliance costs on financial intermediaries as they are required to apportion costs between exempt financial supplies and other supplies that are taxable. 1 GST: A Review - a tax policy discussion document, published by the Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue, March 1999. 2 1.5 In response to these problems the government is proposing in this discussion document that business-to-business supplies of financial services be zero- rated. 2 In other words, GST will not be charged on the supplies but the supplier will be able to recover GST on its purchases that are related to the supplies. The benefits of this proposal include the reduction in the potential for distortions to arise in respect of supplies of financial services to businesses. It should also go some way to relieve the GST burden on financial intermediaries that regularly provide financial services to the business sector, arising from the inability of the financial intermediaries to claim input tax credits. This document outlines in detail how the proposal will operate. 1.6 The proposal to zero-rate business-to-business supplies of financial services is accompanied by proposals for changing the definition of “financial services”. The reforms are directed at a future narrowing of the definition of financial services (section 3 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985) and should, in combination with the proposed zero-rating reform, reduce the bias that financial intermediaries have to in-source goods and services rather than acquire them from third parties. 1.7 Another area considered in this document is the application of the grouping rules for GST. Allowing related companies to return GST as if they were a single entity is intended to reduce distortions that would otherwise arise between different corporate structures and to reduce compliance costs. The rules become complex when a mix of taxable and exempt supplies is made in a group, so further clarification is, however, needed. Key topics 1.8 The key topics discussed in this document are: • the reasons financial services are exempt and the problems caused by exemption; • the conclusions reached by international studies and practices on whether financial services should be included in the base of an indirect tax such as GST, and, if so, what alternative treatments exist that could be applied to include financial services within the base; and • the scope and application of the proposal to zero-rate business-to- business supplies of financial services. 1.9 The document also makes recommendations for change in relation to: • some aspects of the definition of “financial services”; and • the treatment of intra-group supplies. 2 The treatment of exported financial services will remain unchanged. 3 1.10 Aside from the proposal to zero-rate business-to-business supplies of financial services, the government is not recommending a substantial departure from the current treatment of financial services supplied in relation to personal bank accounts. The government will instead leave issues in this area open for possible future discussion. For example, the document does not recommend that bank fees to final consumers should be taxed. 1.11 Internationally, the treatment of financial services under an indirect tax such as GST is the subject of continuing discussion. The New Zealand government continues to participate in this area at the OECD and to monitor developments in key jurisdictions such as Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Summary of content in this discussion document C HAPTER 2 Background – the financial services exemption Chapter 2 looks at the policy debate that occurred between 1984 and 1985 in relation to GST and financial services. Despite the decision made in 1985 to exempt financial services, it is acknowledged that the current exemption creates a number of distortions, specifically: • the potential for exemption to create tax cascades in the New Zealand economy, and • the bias that financial intermediaries have to in-source key activities. C HAPTER 3 Recent studies on GST and the treatment of financial services Chapter 3 considers the conceptual basis for GST, including the theoretical arguments for excluding savings (deferred consumption) from the GST base. It also considers the differing views internationally on whether the consumption of financial services by households should be included in the GST base. Given that there is no consensus view on these issues, the government is not proposing at this time either to tax financial services or exclude them from the tax base. However, given the present distortions that exemption is creating in relation to business-to-business supplies of financial services in New Zealand, the government is proposing to zero-rate these supplies in certain circumstances. 4 C HAPTER 4 The proposal to zero-rate business-to-business supplies This chapter sets out the conditions under which it is proposed that the supply of financial services in New Zealand may be zero-rated. The purpose of the reform is to better align the supply of financial services from financial intermediaries to businesses with the supply between businesses of taxable, standard-rated goods and services. It is proposed that the supply of financial services (as defined in section 3) by a registered person to another registered person who primarily makes supplies of standard-rated goods and services will be zero-rated. Zero-rating will not apply when the recipient is not registered for GST. It is also proposed that zero-rating not apply where the recipient has more than an incidental activity of making exempt supplies. A recipient will be treated as having a predominant activity of making taxable supplies if the level of taxable supplies (not including supplies that are zero-rated as a result of the proposals in this document) represents 75 percent or more of the recipient’s total supplies in any twelve-month period. The application of this test will be able to be based on reasonable assumptions as to the nature of the business, rather than a consideration on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Views are sought on whether it is feasible to develop a system to provide input tax credits to a supplier of financial services if the recipient of the service makes predominantly exempt supplies to registered persons that make predominantly taxable supplies. At this stage the proposal does not include a means by which the supplier in these circumstances could claim input tax credits. C HAPTER 5 Other matters relating to zero-rating business-to-business supplies Chapter 5 looks at some of the practical problems with the proposal to zero-rate business- to-business supplies of financial services, including the deduction of input tax, transitional issues and information requirements. Although significant changes to the current change-in-use adjustment rules are not proposed under the zero-rating proposal, the way in which financial intermediaries claim input tax credits is likely to change to some extent. The method of apportioning input tax credits between taxable and exempt supplies adopted by the taxpayer will need to be agreed with Inland Revenue. The chapter addresses potential base maintenance concerns to ensure that the zero-rating proposals in this document do not create unintended tax advantages. C HAPTER 6 The scope of the definition of “financial services” Issues discussed in chapter 6 are: • achieving a further reduction in the self-supply bias through narrowing the definition of “financial services” to exclude third party activities; • the competing arguments on the GST treatment of management fees charged in relation to long-term investment vehicles (such as unit trusts and group investment funds); and • the extent to which the supply of participatory securities should be treated as a supply of exempt financial services. 5 C HAPTER 7 Policy objectives of the grouping rules The self-supply bias also has implications for the grouping rules contained in the GST Act. Chapter 7 sets out the proposed policy role of the grouping rules as they affect intra- group supplies of goods and services. The grouping rules attempt to reflect a single entity approach for groups of companies when accounting for GST. C HAPTER 8 Proposed amendments to the grouping rules It is proposed to clarify the application of the grouping rules in relation to change-in-use adjustments and intra-group supplies to better reflect this policy. Chapter 8 discusses the relationship between the grouping rules and the proposed reverse charge as outlined in the discussion document GST and imported services. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS • Supplies of financial services by a registered person will be zero-rated provided that the recipient: 1. is registered for GST; and 2. makes taxable supplies (not including supplies that are zero-rated as a result of the proposals in this document) in a given twelve-month period of 75 percent or more of total supplies in the period. • Zero-rating will not apply to the supply of financial services if the recipient’s level of taxable supplies cannot be determined or the recipient is a financial intermediary. The issue of supplies to financial intermediaries who in turn make supplies to other businesses will be further considered in consultation. • An option will be allowed for zero-rating to be based on reasonable assumptions as to the nature of the customer’s business. These assumptions will then be used to determine the level of input tax credits for supplying zero-rated financial services. • Provisions will be introduced in respect of the timing of deductions of input tax credits, particularly in relation to transitional matters, and to address potential base maintenance issues. 6 • The definition of “financial services” in the GST Act will be narrowed to: 1. subject to further consultation, exclude services provided by third parties (such as brokers); and 2. clarify the definition of “participatory security” and the extent to which such transactions should be treated as financial services. • The treatment of management fees for long-term investment vehicles, particularly group investment funds and unit trusts, is reviewed. • The application of the grouping rules in relation to change-in-use adjustments and intra-group supplies is clarified in order to improve the alignment of these rules with the treatment of single entities. Application date 1.12 Unless otherwise stated, the changes outlined in this discussion document are planned for inclusion in the first available tax bill in 2003. It is acknowledged that the proposals may require financial intermediaries to undertake considerable systems changes. To accommodate this, the government proposes to defer the application date of the proposals for approximately 12 months after the date the relevant legislation is enacted by Parliament.

Policy development 2.1 During the policy development of GST in 1984-1985, a number of options were considered and evaluated to establish whether financial services could be fully integrated into the GST base. This began with a non-government discussion paper entitled Financial Services and the GST. 3 The paper identified that integrating financial services within a credit-invoice 4 GST framework was problematic. 2.2 Part of the difficulty with taxing the service component of a financial supply is measuring the payment for services supplied on a transaction-by- transaction basis. Financial intermediaries earn income from the margin between the price charged for applying funds and the price charged for receiving funds, as in the case of banking, lending and borrowing. The substantial component of that price will represent interest, which is generally outside the scope of a consumption tax. 3 Carl Bakker and Phil Chronican, Financial Services and the GST – A discussion paper, Victoria University Press for the Institute of Policy Studies, Victoria University of Wellington, 1985. 4 This is the most common form of GST/VAT. Otherwise known as the subtractive-indirect method, it is based on the formula t (outputs) – t (inputs) or in other words t (taxable sales) – t (taxable purchases). This method is preferred for four reasons: (i) the tax liability arises at each transaction in a production and distribution chain, making it technically superior to other forms, (ii) it creates a good audit trail, (iii) multiple rates can be used, and (iv) it is easy to calculate the tax liability. 9 2.3 Applying GST to supplies of financial services on an individual transaction basis is difficult because the service element, as distinct from the interest or other components, is often not separately identifiable in the charges made. 2.4 Acknowledging that the inclusion of financial services within GST would require a different approach from the credit-invoice method proposed in the White Paper, 5 the following options were considered: • Zero-rating: This option does not tax the consumption of financial services by households. No tax is paid on the supplies of financial services, and a full refund is given for GST paid in making those supplies. • Exemption: No tax is charged on the supply of financial services, and no GST refund is allowed for tax paid in making those supplies. By not allowing input tax credits, household consumption of financial services is taxed at the intermediary stage, as is consumption by the business sector. • Additive approach: Under this approach, financial services are calculated by reference to the sum of salary and wages, other labour expenses, rates, levies (and other indirect taxes) and the net operating surplus, less depreciation incurred. This method correctly measures the tax base, but does not directly identify the tax charged on supplies. Not identifying the tax charged on a supply makes it difficult to provide input tax credit relief to other businesses for the GST cost of the financial service. 6 • Net operating income: The GST is calculated on the basis of the net operating income of the financial intermediary. Input tax credits are allowed to the financial intermediary. The tax is not necessarily related to transactions. This means that it suffers from the same problems as the additive approach in terms of its effect on businesses. • Full invoicing: Under this option, depending on the nature of the financial service, the value would be the consideration (the fees and commission) or the dollar amount the transaction represents (in the case of deposits or withdrawals). This approach fits within a credit- invoice framework but is inconsistent with the aim of GST as the time- value of money, which is neither goods nor services, is included in the tax base. Although businesses would be able to recover the GST paid by way of input tax credits, final consumers would be overtaxed on their consumption of financial services. 5 White Paper on Goods and Services Tax: Proposals for the Administration of the Goods and Services Tax; New Zealand government, March 1985. 6 This method is applied in Israel and is widely referred to as a wages plus profits tax. Under the Israeli method no input tax credits are allowed to the financial intermediary. This effectively taxes the supply of financial intermediation but does not remove production distortions resulting from the additional layer of unrelieved tax. 10 • Separate tax rates: Under this option, the tax rate is determined in relation to the value of the service. For example, if the margin (treated as the value of the service) is based on a lending rate of 12% and a borrowing rate of 8%, it would represent one-third of the lending rate, or 4%. A GST rate of one-third of the full rate could then be applied to the total interest rate. This rate would be 4 1 / 6 %, (one-third of the 12.5% GST rate). This method is likely to create additional economic distortions and costs, although it is more accurate than full invoicing in determining the value of the services provided by financial intermediaries. Implementing the exempt treatment of financial services 2.5 In early 1985 the then government consulted with the financial services industry on the various options for the GST treatment of financial services. Using the discussion paper Financial Services and the GST as a means of summarising the government’s work, it became evident that no ideal solution existed because of the compliance and measurement difficulties associated with each of the taxing options proposed. 2.6 In June 1985 the government announced that suppliers of financial services would pay GST on the same basis as final consumers 7 and, therefore, that financial services were to be exempt from GST. This announcement was accompanied by a government discussion paper, 8 which acknowledged that although GST was intended to apply to a broad range of goods and services at a single uniform low rate, the design of any tax involved an element of compromise between theory and practicality. The treatment of financial services was one such area where the practical difficulties associated with correctly applying the tax could not easily be resolved. Exemption was seen as the best option given these constraints as it included financial services within the GST base but did not have to address the measurement difficulties associated with charging GST on supplies of financial services. 2.7 Submissions on the discussion paper were considered by the Advisory Panel on the Goods and Services Tax. 9 The Advisory Panel on GST 2.8 In its report to the government dated July 1985, the advisory panel expressed a number of concerns about the proposed exempt treatment of financial services, namely: 7 Press statement, Hon R O Douglas, Minister of Finance, “Proposals released for GST and Financial Services”, 6 June 1985. 8 Proposed application of Goods and Services Tax to financial services, The Treasury, June 1985. 9 The advisory panel was an independent panel of individuals from the private sector that was formed to receive and consider submissions on the government White Paper on Goods and Services Tax and the later Proposed application of GST to financial services. The role of the panel was to provide an external opinion to the government that reflected public concerns and identified possible areas of reform. 11 • The high compliance costs caused by the need to allocate purchases between taxable and exempt activities. This was perceived to be in conflict with the government’s objective of keeping the tax as simple as possible. • The potential avoidance opportunities that could arise if financial institutions arranged to provide services from abroad. For example, a New Zealand institution could lend to its offshore affiliate, thereby exporting the financial service. This would be zero-rated and therefore permit the New Zealand institution to claim a credit for the GST incurred in making the supply. The offshore affiliate would then on- lend to the New Zealand customer. The price charged by the offshore affiliate would include no tax component as the supply would be outside the New Zealand GST base. • The incentives that the exemption without credit would create for financial institutions to provide in-house services, rather than to obtain them from third parties. • The possibility that tax cascades might occur in the economy, as a result of financial services including a tax cost that cannot be claimed back by a business recipient of a financial service. This arises because the inability to claim an input tax credit increases the costs faced by financial intermediaries when supplying financial services. Depending on the level of competition in the financial services market, the financial institution could pass on that cost by way of higher prices. 2.9 For these reasons the advisory panel did not favour the exemption without credit approach. It developed its own option of applying GST to the full price (the advertised interest rate or fee) of the financial services. The premise of this option was that if the “value added” to goods and services is generally the difference between the consideration received from the sale of those goods and services and the costs incurred in making the supply of those goods and services, this should also apply to the supply of financial services. 10 2.10 Under this option, therefore, GST would have applied to interest payments. Transactions where money was exchanged for no specific fee (for example, a foreign exchange, where the financial institution’s profit is the margin between the rate at which the currency is bought and sold) would be exempt, but with a credit for purchases. Specific fees and charges would be taxable, including brokerage fees in relation to equity instruments. 10 This proposed treatment is similar to “full invoicing”, as described on page 9. 12 The government’s response 2.11 The government considered the advisory panel’s report but concluded that the full taxation of financial services would not appropriately value the supply of financial services and was concerned about the impact that taxing financial services would have on the wider economy. Given the long history exemption had in Europe, and the preference for exemption as expressed by jurisdictions that operated a value added tax (VAT) or GST, the government decided to exempt financial services. The problems with the financial services exemption 2.12 The two key difficulties caused by exemption are the potential for GST to “cascade” in relation to supplies by the financial services sector to the business sector and the incentive that exemption creates for financial intermediaries to “self-supply” key activities. Exemption also creates a number of practical difficulties in relation to the definition of “financial services” and apportioning costs between taxable and exempt activities. Tax cascades 2.13 Tax cascades arise when a supplier of a financial service cannot recover the GST paid on goods and services purchased. The non-creditable GST will then form part of the cost of production. To compensate, the financial intermediary either raises the price of the service or absorbs the GST cost. If the cost is passed on to businesses through higher prices, businesses face the same decision, to increase the prices charged for their products or absorb the additional tax cost. This may increase prices faced by final consumers, as illustrated in figure 1. Alternatively, if the non-creditable GST is absorbed, the GST is effectively being paid by the business through reduced profits rather than being shifted onto the price of goods and services supplied to final consumers. Figure 1: How tax cascades arise As the GST cannot be recovered from the transaction between Business A and the financial intermediary, the GST is included in the cost of the financial service supplied by the financial intermediary to Business B. This higher cost may then be passed through to the products sold by Business B to its customers. 11 11 A numerical example of how tax cascades arise is included in Annex A. Financial intermediary Business A Business BFinal consumer GST ExemptGST No input tax credit No input tax credit No input tax credit as GST is not charged 13 Self-supply bias 2.14 A bias for a financial services provider to provide all key services in-house may arise if the provider is unable to recover the GST paid on goods and services purchased. The provider may see this as preferable to obtaining those services from a third party that is likely to charge GST on the supply. This bias has implications in relation to both the zero-rating proposal and the grouping rules. Definition of “financial services” 2.15 The first main problem to arise with the definition of “financial services” related to the supply of accounting and processing services by a third party to various trading and savings banks. The issue concerned the extent to which exemption applied to such services provided by a third party. Although amendments enacted in 1989 12 and the decision of the Privy Council in Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Databank Systems Limited 13 have provided some guidance on the boundary between financial and non- financial services, it remains a complex area of the GST Act, particularly in relation to third party supplies. Apportionment 2.16 A boundary between exempt and taxable supplies makes it necessary for taxpayers that make a combination of supplies to apportion purchases between the two activities when claiming input tax credits. This imposes compliance costs and can be difficult to achieve accurately. In practice, apportionment is the most difficult issue facing financial intermediaries when complying with GST. This has been compounded by uncertainties in the application of the grouping rules. 12 Refer sections 3(5) and 14(1). 13 (1990) 12 NZTC 7,227. 14 Chapter 3 RECENT STUDIES ON GST AND THE TREATMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES This chapter discusses: • the conceptual basis of GST and why savings are not included in the GST base; • the arguments for and against the inclusion of household consumption of financial services in the GST base; • alternatives to exemption presented by overseas studies and practices; and • the policy reasons for zero-rating domestic business-to-business supplies of financial services. The conceptual basis of GST 3.1 Chapter 2 outlined the options and decisions faced by the then government in 1985 when considering the cost treatment of financial services. The ultimate adoption of exemption was based on the widespread view that financial services were appropriately classified as taxable consumption and, therefore, should be included in the scope of the GST base. The key problem with this was how to tax financial services under a credit-invoice method and keep savings outside the GST base. Some commentators have, however, developed alternative views and models that argue that it is not always appropriate to classify financial services as taxable consumption. 14 3.2 Commentators suggest that the arguments for and against the inclusion of financial services in the GST base should be dependent on how the concept of GST is viewed. Indirect taxes such as GST are based substantially on the sum of private and government consumption, investment in capital goods and net exports (exports less imports). 15 This, in principle, is representative of the spending within New Zealand, which can be used to determine the quantity of goods and services demanded in New Zealand. It also means that the GST base can be largely defined by using sales and allowing an offsetting credit for purchases. This is reflected in the credit-invoice mechanism, which creates a high level of accuracy in the measurement of GST because transactions are based on the prices agreed by the parties to the transaction. 14 Most recently: Ngee Choon Chia and John Whalley, Treatment of Financial Intermediation, Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, Vol. 31 No. 4 (November 1999), Ohio State University Press; Harry Grubert and James Mackie, Must Financial Services be Taxed under a Consumption Tax, National Tax Journal Vol. 53 No. 1 (March 2000); William Jack, The Treatment of Financial Services under a Broad-Based Consumption Tax, National Tax Journal Vol. 53 No. 4 (December 2000); and Alan J Auerbach and Roger H Gordon, Taxation of financial services under a VAT, American Economic Review (May 2002). 15 For a similar discussion refer Ian Roxan, The nature of VAT supplies of services in the twenty-first century, British Tax Review (2000) No. 6. 15 3.3 The credit-invoice mechanism is also important to ensure that double taxation does not arise in respect of the following items and that GST largely remains a tax on consumption: 16 • Intermediate production: Some activity does not give rise to direct consumption but, rather, to the production of goods and services that are later consumed. The removal of intermediate production from GST is usually dealt with by providing input tax credits. • Investment goods (non-consumption items): In principle, investment goods, as with intermediate production, should be excluded from GST. This is because these goods do not in themselves represent production but are used more broadly to generate production. Although these items are generally included in the GST base of most jurisdictions, neutrality is preserved as the GST impost is removed by an input tax credit. Reason for excluding savings from the GST base 3.4 As GST can largely be characterised as a tax on private and government expenditure on final goods and services, savings (or deferred consumption) should not be included in the GST base. This is not to say that the services supplied by financial intermediaries to consumers, which may be complementary to savings products, should not be included in the tax base but that the treatment of savings needs to be considered in the same manner as non-consumption items. 3.5 In principle, GST should apply only at the time that savings are applied to purchase goods and services. This is because the return on savings largely compensates for the time value of money or “pure interest” (the return required for someone to be indifferent about whether to spend now or some time in the future). Taxing the time value of money within the GST base would likely result in double taxation. This would occur as the compensation for deferring consumption would be taxed, and then taxed again when the funds were applied to acquire goods and services in a later period. The issue with regard to the treatment of financial services is the extent to which the process of deferring consumption should or should not be subject to GST. 16 New Zealand’s GST, like many other GST and VAT systems used in other jurisdictions, includes investment goods and services (particularly those purchased by households) in addition to goods and services that economists typically characterise as consumption goods and services. 16 The treatment of household consumption of financial services 3.6 Both studies which take the view that financial services should be subject to GST, 17 and studies which argue that they should not, 18 share the view that GST should generally preserve the neutrality between current and deferred consumption. There is no agreement, however, on the extent to which complementary services relating to savings should be excluded from the GST base. 3.7 The traditional view is that the margin of a financial intermediary should be subject to GST. However, unless the margin is correctly measured on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as required under the credit-invoice method, there is the possibility that GST would apply to pure interest and overvalue the amount that should be properly taxed. 3.8 The alternative view treats the entire margin as being part of the cost associated with transferring consumption between periods (either in the form of savings or investment) and concludes that complementary services as well as deferred consumption should generally be excluded from GST. The arguments are based on whether financial services enter the utility function of households and conclude that a household’s consumption of financial services should not be classified as taxable consumption if the purpose of financial intermediation is to facilitate and smooth consumption. Therefore financial intermediation, which allows inter-temporal consumption of goods, should not be taxed as tax is collected at the point when the savings are used by the household to purchase goods and services. As such, it is inappropriate to include financial services in the GST base. 3.9 Even if the non-consumption categorisation of financial services is accepted, views may still differ across a range of intermediation fees as to what should and should not bear GST. One consideration is whether the fee is explicitly charged or included in the margin. 3.10 The government notes that these academic arguments on whether the household consumption of financial intermediation should be treated as taxable or non-taxable consumption are inconclusive. Comment from interested parties on this debate is encouraged but, in the face of these differing views, the government does not propose to review the current treatment of household consumption of financial services in the immediate future. 17 Refer Ernst & Young, Treatment of Financial Services under a VAT Prepared of the Commission of the European Communities (August 1993); Treatment of Financial Services under a VAT: Further exploration of the cash-flow method of taxation, prepared for the Commission of the European Communities (September 1994); Satya Podder and Morley English, Taxation of financial services under a Value-Added Tax: Applying the Cash Flow Approach; National Tax Journal Vol. 50 No. 1 (March 1997) and, Ernst & Young, The TCA System – A detailed description, Taxation and Customs Union, Reports and Studies commissioned for the European Commission, Brussels (1998). 18 Ibid footnote 14. 17 The treatment of business consumption of financial services 3.11 Although there are differing opinions on the proper treatment of household consumption of financial services, it is generally agreed that, in principle, GST should not apply to the business consumption of financial services. This is for the same reasons that input tax credits are allowed in respect of intermediate production and investment goods consumed by businesses. 3.12 In chapter 2 it was highlighted that the current exemption creates a number of problems in the New Zealand economy and affects the neutrality of production decisions. Two problems have been identified for consideration, the creation of tax cascades and the self-supply bias. These two problems have a single cause – the inability of financial intermediaries to recover GST paid on their purchases. Responses to the problems presented by exemption 3.13 Some jurisdictions have specifically sought to address the self-supply bias. For example, Singapore allows financial intermediaries to claim input tax credit relief on a prescribed recovery percentage, provided that the supplies relate to business-to-business supplies. Australia allows a notional input tax credit of 75 percent (a “reduced input tax credit”) to financial intermediaries on certain prescribed purchases. 19 Another means of addressing the self- supply bias could be by way of a self-supply tax. 3.14 In the consultative paper The Application of Goods and Services Tax to Financial Services, 20 the Australian government noted that many jurisdictions included within the scope of the exemption fee-based charges that could otherwise be included directly in the tax base. It considered this level of exemption to be undesirable as it increased the compliance burden of exemption to those that supply financial intermediaries and has, therefore, opted to tax “agents” (generally third parties) who supply financial services. Narrowing the potential scope of exemption in this manner addresses similar concerns to, and is complemented by, the reduced input tax credit for financial intermediaries in respect of certain services. 3.15 The government considers that, in practical terms, the most serious difficulty with exemption is the overtaxation of businesses caused by the inability to recover input tax. Tax cascades are the direct result of this and should, therefore, be the initial focus for reform. Reducing tax cascades will, however, in turn reduce the self-supply bias, which is equally caused by the inability to recover input tax. The government is in any event concerned as to the risk of arbitrariness in a self-supply focus through such mechanisms as the reduced input tax credit, as this is inconsistent with the precise measurement of GST under the credit-invoice mechanism. 19 Refer A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999, Regulation 70-2, Commonwealth of Australia. 20 The Application of Goods and Services Tax to Financial Services – Consultation Document, August 1999, Commonwealth of Australia. 18 Taxing financial services 3.16 Taxing financial services using the credit-invoice methodology requires considerable information flows. A financial intermediary’s core business activity involves bringing together borrowers and lenders and supplying services to both parties. The charge for these services may be included in the difference between the interest rate charged on borrowing and the interest rate paid on lending. Such margins will represent the payment for services supplied to both borrowers and lenders. 3.17 To charge GST directly on the services supplied by the financial intermediary to the two parties it is necessary to know the margin between the rate of interest offered to lenders and the rate of interest charged to borrowers. It is also necessary to calculate the way that the margin is allocated between the two parties. This is problematic because financial intermediaries do not directly link individual lenders and borrowers, and they have a number of borrowing and lending rates applicable to each party. 3.18 Under these circumstances, it is not easy to identify the charge applicable to an individual transaction, let alone determine the portion of the difference that represents the fee for the services to a particular customer. 3.19 International work on approaches to taxing financial services has sought to approximate the allocation of these margins. 3.20 The cash flow method of taxing financial services as developed by Satya Podder and Morley English, 21 called the “truncated cash flow method with tax calculation account” specifically includes both households and businesses within the scope of the base. Broadly, under the cash flow method, cash inflows from financial transactions are treated as taxable sales, and cash outflows are treated as taxable purchases. In the case of simple deposit- taking intermediation, the cash flow method measures and taxes the implicit fee for financial margins and allocates the margin between borrowers and lenders. (An explanation of this method of taxing financial services under a GST is included in Annex B). 3.21 Despite its promising features, the cash flow method makes a number of assumptions as to the rate of interest (“pure interest”) on which to index the intermediation fee charged for the services supplied to lenders and borrowers. Although these assumptions reduce the extent of the compliance burden faced by businesses, the use of an indexing rate to allocate financial margins between lenders and borrowers raises concerns about accuracy. Although the government will continue to monitor international studies on the truncated cash flow method, it is not convinced that its implementation would resolve the difficulties presented by exemption. They may indeed increase compliance costs above those imposed by exemption. 21 Ibid footnote 17. 19 3.22 The government has also considered the option of taxing explicit fees, while continuing to exempt margin-based charges. This would be a practical response to the problems associated with exemption, as it attempts to address the undertaxation of households and the overtaxation of businesses (as an input tax credit would be allowed for any GST charged). However, a potential problem with taxing explicit fees is the ability of financial intermediaries to substitute fee and margin income. Although the deregulated and competitive state of the financial services market would suggest that the opportunities to substitute are limited, given the unresolved debate concerning the treatment of household consumption of financial services it would be inappropriate, at this time, to advance this option. 3.23 Acknowledging that the correct treatment of household consumption of financial services has yet to be resolved, and, in the absence of a comprehensive GST on financial services, the government considers that the next best policy option is to address the overtaxation of financial services supplied to businesses arising from tax cascades and the self-supply bias. 20 Chapter 4 THE PROPOSAL TO ZERO-RATE BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SUPPLIES This chapter sets out the key features of the proposal to zero-rate business-to-business supplies of financial services. It discusses when zero-rating should apply and when it should not apply. The main proposals are: • The supply of financial services (as defined in section 3) by a registered person to another registered person who has a predominant activity of making taxable supplies of goods and services will be zero-rated. • Zero-rating will not apply when the recipient is not registered for GST, nor if the recipient has more than an incidental activity of making exempt supplies. A recipient will be treated as having a predominant activity of making taxable supplies if the level of taxable supplies (not including supplies that are zero-rated as a result of the proposals in this document) represents 75 percent or more of the recipient’s total supplies in a given twelve-month period. The application of this test will be able to be based on reasonable assumptions as to the nature of the business, rather than a consideration on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Views are sought on whether it is feasible to develop a system to provide input tax credits to a supplier of financial services if the recipient of the service makes predominantly exempt supplies to registered persons that make predominantly taxable supplies. At this stage the proposal does not include a means by which the supplier in these circumstances could claim input tax credits. General application 4.1 In March this year the government announced a proposal to zero-rate business-to-business supplies of financial services. This chapter examines the application of the proposal in more detail, including the circumstances in which zero-rating should and should not apply. 4.2 In general, the supply of a financial service (as defined in section 3 of the GST Act) made by a registered person to another registered person will be treated as a zero-rated supply. “Zero-rating” means that financial services will be taxed at the rate of zero-percent. This means that no tax is payable on the supply of financial services, but input tax credits will be allowed for GST paid on purchases used to make the supply. This is illustrated in figure 2. 21 Figure 2: How zero-rating will work Being zero-rated the supply by the financial intermediary to Business B is a taxable supply and the financial intermediary will be able to claim an input tax credit on its purchases from Business A used to make that supply. 4.3 This proposal is designed to address concerns that New Zealand businesses are being overtaxed in relation to their consumption of financial services. Overtaxing financial services can create tax cascades in the economy, which may result in higher prices being charged for some goods and services. 4.4 As shown in figure 3, zero-rating business-to-business supplies of financial services achieves parity with other (non-financial) supplies, if the financial services are used for the purpose of making taxable supplies, other than supplies that are zero-rated as a result of the proposals in this document. The previously irrecoverable tax paid by the financial intermediary does not cascade and no longer results in the final consumer potentially paying a higher price for non-financial goods and services sold by registered persons. 22 Limitations to zero-rating 4.5 The main aim of the proposal is to retain exemption (and deny input tax credits) for supplies made by a financial intermediary to a non-registered person but to zero-rate (and thus allow input tax credits) for supplies made by a financial intermediary to a registered person. 4.6 The supply of financial services by a registered person will not, therefore, be able to be zero-rated if the recipient is not registered for GST. 22 This is subject to the relative incidence of GST and competition in the financial services market. Financial intermediary Business A Business BFinal consumer GST Input tax credit Zero-ratedGST No input tax credit as GST is charged at the rate of zero percent No input tax credit 22 Figure 3: Comparison of the treatment of taxable supplies and exempt supplies under current and proposed legislation Current treatment 1. Supply of taxable goods and services by Business B 2. Supply of financial services by financial intermediary Proposed treatment 23 3. Supply of financial services by financial intermediary Under the proposal, the supply of financial services by the financial intermediary to Business C is equivalent to a supply of standard-rated goods and services. 4.7 A further limitation arises for supplies made by a financial intermediary to another financial intermediary or registered person making exempt supplies. If such supplies were also zero-rated, financial intermediaries could make GST-free supplies to final consumers by interposing another financial intermediary between themselves and the final consumer. This is illustrated in figure 4. 23 A numerical example is included in Annex C. Financial intermediary Business A Business CFinal consumer GST Zero-rated GST Business BBusiness A Business C GST Input tax credit GST GST Final consumer Input tax credit No input tax credit Financial intermediary Business A Business C GST No input tax credit ExemptGST Final consumer No input tax credit No input tax credit as supply is exempt Input tax credit allowed No input tax credit as GST is charged at the rate of zero percent No input tax credit 23 Figure 4: Supply of financial services between financial intermediaries The difference between this example and that in figure 2 is that the supply by financial intermediary A is not a taxable supply. Financial intermediary B does not, in this example, make standard-rated supplies and overtaxation does not therefore arise. 4.8 This concern would be met by not allowing zero-rating if the recipient (in the financial intermediary B in figure 4) makes exempt supplies. There are two problems with such a response. First, many registered persons provide ancillary exempt supplies (for example, consumer finance) but their main business is providing taxable supplies. Disallowing zero-rating in such cases would penalise such firms and reintroduce the problem of tax cascades. Allowing zero-rating in such cases would allow some supplies to be provided to final consumers free of any GST but not to a substantial extent. 4.9 A second problem is that disallowing zero-rating as described would reintroduce a cascading effect where a financial intermediary provides exempt supplies to a second financial intermediary that adds value and then makes further supplies to a registered person who makes taxable supplies. 4.10 It is necessary to find a practical approach to deal with both issues. The approach needs to balance compliance and administrative costs against the need to avoid tax cascades as far as possible and to ensure that opportunities are not created to make GST-free supplies to final consumers. Supplies of financial services between financial intermediaries 4.11 The government has given consideration to ways that the zero-rating of financial services between financial intermediaries could be achieved without creating a tax advantage to final consumers. The information that the financial intermediary would need in order to determine whether financial services it supplies would be used by the immediate recipient for its taxable, exempt or non-business customers would impose high compliance costs that would seem to outweigh any efficiency gains. GST ExemptExempt Financial intermediary A Business Financial intermediary B Final consumer No input tax credit No input tax credit No input tax credit as GST is not paid 24 4.12 One option would be to establish an industry average for input tax credits to compensate for any zero-rated financial supplies possibly made further down the chain. The government is concerned, however, that this would be inconsistent with the high level of measurement accuracy normally associated with GST and would, in any event, give rise to its own set of compliance cost problems. 4.13 The government is interested in receiving submissions on how these compliance cost and other concerns can be addressed. Applying the zero-rating rules – a threshold for making taxable supplies 4.14 It is proposed that zero-rating will be allowed if the recipient is registered and does not have a more than incidental activity of making exempt supplies. 4.15 In the absence of a threshold-based test, it would be almost impossible for a financial intermediary to determine whether its customers make more than incidental supplies of exempt services to final consumers. Many registered persons make exempt supplies of some description. An appropriate threshold would allow for the receipt of zero-rated financial supplies by most registered persons except those that have as a significant part of their business an activity of making exempt supplies, such as the supply of financial services to final consumers. 4.16 Having regard to the trade-offs between compliance costs and the extent to which a business ought reasonably to be regarded as an entity that makes mainly taxable supplies, the government is proposing that this threshold be set at 75 percent of total supplies. Therefore businesses that supply standard- rated goods and services and/or zero-rated exports of goods and services, but also make supplies of exempt services and/or financial services zero-rated as a result of the proposed reforms, will be able to receive zero-rated financial services provided that the level of the former services represents 75 percent or more of their total supplies in a given twelve-month period. This period could be retrospective or prospective, depending on the nature and circumstances of the business. 4.17 The government accepts that a percentage threshold is necessarily a matter of judgement and that, as with all thresholds, opinions will vary as to where it is best set. On balance, the government has opted for a generous threshold, reflecting the importance it places on compliance cost reduction. Identifying customers based on the threshold 4.18 When applying the threshold test a financial intermediary will need to know at a minimum the status of the customer and their ratio of taxable supplies to total supplies. Recognising the costs that would arise under a transaction-by- transaction approach the government prefers an approach that would allow financial intermediaries to categorise their customers and apply the categorisation for a set twelve-month period which is based on the nature of 25 the customer’s business and reasonable assumptions as to the level of their taxable supplies. 4.19 Financial intermediaries that elect to categorise their customers will be required to review that categorisation at regular intervals which will be administratively determined. 4.20 The proposed threshold should not prevent financial intermediaries from applying the zero-rating tests on a transaction-by-transaction basis if they choose to do so. 4.21 It is expected that the determination of the taxable status of the recipient will be made by the financial institutions. The reason for this is that the difference between zero-rating and exemption can generally be described as the respective ability or inability of financial intermediaries to claim input tax credits. The deduction of input tax credits is a matter for the supplier of financial services to determine – not the recipient. As far as the recipient of a financial service is concerned, GST does not currently apply to the receipt of financial services, and this position will remain with zero-rating. Therefore it is expected that the recipient of a financial service should not have any direct involvement in this determination, although this should not preclude financial intermediaries from seeking information from customers as needed. 24 4.22 The government is interested in receiving submissions on what information financial intermediaries may require to determine the taxable status of their customers and whether these requirements should be included in legislation. 4.23 If the recipient cannot be identified or categorised as outlined zero-rating will not apply. This allows financial intermediaries to assess, in less straightforward situations, the trade-off between the benefits of zero-rating and the compliance costs associated with identifying the customer and determining the mix of taxable and exempt supplies made by their business customers. Customers that make a mixture of taxable and exempt supplies from separate operations 4.24 It has been assumed that a business customer of a financial intermediary represents a single company or other entity which may carry on a range of taxable and exempt operations. The 75 percent test ensures that the customer is treated as either taxable (and entitled to receive zero-rated supplies) or exempt (and not entitled to receive zero-rated supplies). 24 It is recognised that allowing input tax credits for zero-rated supplies is likely to reduce the cost faced by financial intermediaries in supplying financial services. The extent to which these cost savings are passed on to customers is a matter for each financial intermediary to determine. 26 4.25 In practice, however, the customer bases of a financial intermediary may include one or more branches of an entity or a consolidated group of two or more entities. In either case, if the 75 percent threshold were applied, a different result would occur, depending on whether the different activities were aggregated or treated as separate. 4.26 This difference may result in an incentive for businesses to treat their taxable and exempt operations as separate if they do not already do so, to ensure that the taxable operations are able to receive zero-rates supplies. This would, in principle, achieve the intended result of removing the tax cascades when financial services are supplied to those making standard-rated supplies. 4.27 To allow a business categorisation approach to zero-rating, it may be necessary for the legislation to refer to the financial intermediary’s customer base. This raises the issue of whether and, if so, how, the term “customer” should be defined. Submissions are sought on this point. Zero-rating – an illustration 4.28 Figure 5 illustrates the questions that should be considered when determining whether a supply of financial services should be zero-rated. It is not a definitive view of how the proposal should work but is included for the purposes of discussion. 27 Figure 5: Applying the proposed zero-rating of domestic business-to-business supplies of financial services \* When considering the application of the 75 percent threshold there will need to be administrative rules to determine when registered persons need to closely examine certain customers to assess whether or not they are appropriately categorised as businesses that are entitled to receive zero-rated financial supplies. The main determinant should be the nature of the customer’s business. Thus: • A customer that is a financial intermediary or a supplier of residential accommodation would not generally be categorised as entitled to receive zero-rated supplies as it is reasonable to expect that the volume of exempt supplies and zero-rated financial services would exceed 25 percent of its total turnover. • Most manufacturers, primary producers and retailers, on the other hand, would be expected to be entitled to receive zero-rated supplies. • Businesses that make a mixture of taxable and exempt supplies such as general and life insurers will need to be categorised on a case-by-case basis. Is the supply a supply of financial services as defined in section 3? Zero-rating does not apply YES YES NO Is the recipient a registered person or reasonably expected to be a registered person? NO NO NO Is the recipient a person who makes, or is reasonably expected to make, taxable supplies that represent 75% or more of their total supplies?\* Zero-rating applies YES 28 Chapter 5 OTHER MATTERS RELATING TO ZERO-RATING BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS SUPPLIES This chapter discusses other matters relating to the zero-rating of business-to-business supplies of financial services, including: • the deduction of input tax – outlining possible adjustment mechanisms; • base maintenance issues – a reduction in input tax credit recovery for supplies that are in substance made to final consumers; • transitional issues; and • information requirements. 5.1 The purpose of this chapter is to outline proposals for changes to the rest of the GST Act to cater for the zero-rating of business-to-business supplies of financial services. The effects of the zero-rating reforms on the definition of “financial services” and the grouping provisions are discussed in later chapters, which also contain proposals to ensure that the legislation is achieving its policy intent. Deduction of input tax 5.2 Registered persons are generally able to claim an input tax credit for the GST paid on their purchases provided they can establish that the purchased goods and services have been acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Although financial intermediaries make a mixture of taxable and exempt supplies, the fact that they are predominantly exempt suppliers means that they are generally unable to claim input tax credits at the time goods and services are acquired. This makes financial intermediaries dependent on the change-in-use provisions to recover some of the GST paid (sections 21E to 21H). 5.3 Under the current legislation, financial intermediaries may face significant compliance costs in determining an allowable level of input tax credit entitlement and the value of adjustments required under the change-in-use provisions. This is unlikely to change as a result of the proposed reforms. 5.4 It is expected that claims for input tax credits will continue to vary among financial intermediaries, depending on their internal accounting systems and ability to allocate input tax credits between taxable and exempt supplies. 29 5.5 Section 21A sets out the methods of allocating input tax credits to making taxable and other (including exempt) supplies. • Actual use: This method of allocation requires the taxpayer to directly attribute the use of the goods and services to the extent that those goods and services are used for a purpose of making taxable supplies. • Turnover method: This method is used in cases where the actual use method is too difficult to apply – for example, in the case of overhead expenses. The formula, as shown in the legislation, is: Total value of exempt supplies for taxable period Total value of all supplies for taxable period • An alternative (or special) method: This method is available, provided that the Commissioner approves it, if its use results in allocated amounts that are fair and reasonable in comparison with actual use. 5.6 In all cases, section 21A requires that the method of allocation used must result in a fair and reasonable allocation of input tax credits between taxable and other supplies. It is expected in cases where financial intermediaries are able to identify when zero-rating applies on a transaction-by-transaction basis that they will also be able to match the deduction of input tax credits to those zero-rated supplies. The input tax recovery ratio and end-of-year adjustments Input tax recovery ratio 5.7 In some instances it may be difficult to match purchases to particular taxable supplies owing to the nature of expenditure such as overhead items, which can be attributed to a number of activities. To assist in the allocation of overhead purchases between taxable and exempt supplies, financial intermediaries may adopt either the turnover method or a special method of allocating input tax credits. 5.8 The turnover method uses supplies in calculating the numerator and the denominator. This means of calculating the level of adjustment includes the so-called “value added” created by the taxpayer by the payment of salary and wages. Thus an activity that involves a minimum of purchases that are subject to GST but requires a high labour content may skew the rate of input tax recovery. The reverse situation can equally apply so that the rate of recovery of input tax is insufficient. 30 5.9 The use of the turnover method may not, therefore, always be appropriate. Instead, a new method of calculation may need to be developed, as agreed between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. Further, the use of a “business categorisation” approach to implement the proposals in this document requires a review of how input tax credits are in practice apportioned. 5.10 The formulae illustrate two different approaches that could be considered when apportioning input tax credits. The first is based on a turnover methodology but uses the ratio of net income from taxable supplies to net income from total supplies. The second formula approaches the question of input tax apportionment from the position of cost allocation between taxable activities and total activities. 5.11 The calculation of input tax credits from activities involving non-residents and interest will also be a matter for the taxpayer to discuss with Inland Revenue. Once agreement is reached, the input tax recovery ratio may be used on a day-to-day basis. This will be familiar to some financial intermediaries that currently have agreed a similar mechanism with Inland Revenue. 5.12 It is proposed that financial intermediaries will also be able to rely on the input tax recovery ratio for an agreed period before a new calculation will be required. Both the initial and subsequent periods will need to be agreed with Inland Revenue. 5.13 Figure 6 illustrates the way in which input tax credits may be claimed. This illustration should not be taken as a determinative view but is included for the purposes of discussion. 31 Notes to formulae • The formulae are included for the purposes of discussion. They are not definitive, and it is expected that some variation may be required. • The information required to apply the formulae should be able to be sourced from financial statements. Determining the margins from foreign exchange and derivative transactions to businesses and non-residents will, however, require sampling. Any sampling period will need to include the last day of a financial quarter (such as 31 March, 30 June, 30 September and 31 December), as this day is typically busier than others. • The reference to “business” means those registered persons that qualify to receive zero- rated supplies – that is, the business does not have more than an incidental activity of making exempt supplies (less than 25 percent of total turnover in a given twelve-month period). 1. The input tax recovery ratio based on supplies Net income from taxable supplies Net income from total supplies Net income from taxable supplies Net income from total supplies Domestic services Net interest from businesses Foreign exchange and derivatives margins from businesses Net fees and commissions from businesses Other net/margin revenue from businesses Standard-rated net fees and commissions Exported services Foreign exchange and derivatives margins from non- residents Net interest from non-residents Net fees and commissions from non-residents Other net/margin income from non-residents 2. The input tax recovery ratio based on cost allocation A + B C Where: A = Costs attributable to exported services B = Costs attributable to zero-rated supplies to businesses and standard-rated supplies C = Total costs For the purpose of this formula the term “cost” is defined as purchases that have been subject to GST (that is, excluding salary and wages, depreciation, interest and profit margins). Foreign exchange and derivatives margins Net interest Net fees and commissions Other net/margin income = Input tax recovery ratio = Input tax recovery ratio 32 Figure 6: Applying the input tax recovery ratio Explanation 1A. The advisory services are purchased and supplied directly to a final consumer for a standard-rated fee. As the services were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, an input tax credit can be claimed for the GST paid. 1B. The advisory services provided to the business are not directly on-supplied but the cost of the purchase is recovered through the zero-rated financial product. As the services were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies (including zero-rated supplies) an input tax credit can be claimed for the GST paid. 2. General insurance is taken out for the operations of the financial intermediary. As it cannot be attributed to any specific supply, a partial rate of input tax recovery is allowed as agreed between the financial intermediary and Inland Revenue. 3. As the purchase is an exempt supply, no GST is charged and, therefore, no input tax credit is allowed, irrespective of zero-rating. End-of-year adjustments 5.14 To ensure that the input tax recovery ratio used by financial intermediaries for overhead expenditures is a reasonable reflection of the mix of the taxable and exempt supplies made during an accounting year, an adjustment will need to be calculated at the end of the financial intermediary’s accounting year. 5.15 Unlike the input tax recovery ratio, which is forward-looking, the end-of- year adjustment will look back at the supplies actually made by the financial intermediary during the period covered at the close of each accounting year, as illustrated in figure 7.

The end-of-year adjustment will be required to be calculated and returned to Inland Revenue in the second month of the new accounting year. Base maintenance 5.17 As with the proposal to zero-rate business-to-business supplies of financial services, it is important to prevent the tax base from being eroded by exploitation of the boundary between zero-rated and exempt supplies. Therefore the government is concerned not to increase the recovery of input tax by financial intermediaries by effectively allowing final consumers to access zero-rated financial services. 5.18 An anti-avoidance provision will be necessary to prevent arrangements that would treat a supply of financial services that, in substance, is received by an unregistered person as being received by a registered person. In this situation it is proposed to allow the Commissioner to cancel in respect of any supply the amount of input tax to which the financial intermediary would otherwise be entitled. 5.19 A related issue is the situation where a business might acquire zero-rated financial services for the purpose of benefiting an employee, shareholder or director. The government considers that this is a particular risk in the case of sole proprietors and other business structures where individuals, in their private capacity, are closely related to the trading activity of the business. A specific anti-avoidance provision is, however, seen as unnecessary in this instance as the change-in-use provisions should apply to any application of the financial service to an individual and would require the business to begin apportioning input tax credits. 25 25 Refer sections 21 to 21C. Input tax recovery ratio End-o f-year adjustment Accounting year 34 Transitional arrangements 5.20 As zero-rating mainly concerns the recovery of input tax credits by financial intermediaries, it is not expected that the transitional impact for customers will be significant. 5.21 In relation to financial intermediaries, the main issue to be addressed is the timing and availability of input tax credits in respect of certain supplies: • Supplies that span the application date: The new rate of input tax recovery will apply to supplies that span the application date of these proposals according to the following rules: - Goods will be treated as being supplied when delivered or available for delivery or removal by the customer. - Services will generally be treated as being supplied when they are performed. The transitional provisions will, therefore, be broadly similar to those that applied at the time GST came into effect, on 1 October 1986. • Goods held at application date: The timing of input tax credits for goods, such as office equipment and consumable items, held at application date will continue to be determined by way of the change- in-use provisions as follows: - Input tax credits claimed under the change-in-use provisions for consumable items will be calculated at the time that they are acquired. For example, no adjustment will be allowed in respect of the input tax credit claimed for goods, such as stationery, purchased before the application date to reflect any increase in taxable supplies after that date. - Input tax credits claimed under the change-in-use provisions for fixed assets under a period-by-period basis or annual basis will be allowed to reflect any increase in taxable supplies in and from the first period, or year, in which the change-in-use adjustment is made after the application date. - One-off change-in-use deductions to take account of any increase in taxable supplies resulting from these reforms will not be allowed. Information requirements – tax invoices 5.22 Section 24 requires a tax invoice to be issued by a registered person when making a taxable supply to another registered person. For the purposes of zero-rated business-to-business supplies of financial services, such a requirement is unnecessary. Tax invoices play a key role in establishing the deduction of input tax. When zero-rating applies to supplies between registered persons it is not necessary to consider the deduction of input tax by the recipient. For this reason it is proposed that financial intermediaries will 35 not be required to comply fully with section 24 in respect of zero-rated supplies. Inland Revenue will provide administrative guidelines under section 24(6) on the type of information that will need to be provided. 36 Chapter 6 THE SCOPE OF THE DEFINITION OF “FINANCIAL SERVICES” This chapter outlines potential areas for reform to the scope of the definition of “financial services”, with particular emphasis on: • services provided by third parties; • management fees for long-term investment vehicles; • services relating to underlying taxable supplies; • the distinction between arranging and advising; and • using a generic definition. It recommends that: • The definition of “financial services” be narrowed so that services provided by third parties (such as brokerage) are subject to GST. Having regard to the potential scope of this change, it will be implemented only after full consultation has been undertaken. • The definition of “participatory security” be amended so that services relating to underlying taxable supplies are not included. In considering the treatment of management fees for long-term investment vehicles, the chapter does not make a recommendation as to whether such services should be treated as taxable services or as financial services, but invites comment on the policy justifications and relative costs and benefits of each option. 6.1 Although it is proposed that the scope of the exemption for financial services will be reduced by zero-rating business-to-business supplies, the definition of “financial services” will continue to apply to the boundary between standard- rated and zero-rated supplies for business-to-business transactions. It will also continue to apply to the boundary between taxable and exempt supplies for other than business-to-business supplies. 6.2 This chapter discusses some of the remaining difficulties with the application of the definition and how they might be resolved. 37 Background 6.3 The scope of the definition of “financial services” was originally set out in the 1985 discussion paper Proposed application of GST to financial services. 26 This document outlined the government’s reasons for treating financial services as exempt supplies and detailed the expected application of the definition. 6.4 It was envisaged that the exemption would apply to five broad categories of financial services. These were: • dealings with money; • dealings with securities; • granting credit and making loans; • brokerage and/or intermediary services relating to the above; and • the provision of life insurance. 6.5 The government considers that these broad categories remain appropriate, but that the policy developed in 1985 has led to a number of inconsistencies in respect of the treatment of third parties and the treatment of certain substitutable supplies provided by the financial services industry. The reforms proposed in this chapter are designed to clarify and narrow the scope of the definition, particularly in respect of brokerage and intermediary services provided by third parties. Areas for reform Third party activities 6.6 The current definition of “financial services” does not, in the main, draw a distinction between “non-core” financial services (such as arranging the issue of securities) that are supplied by an entity in relation to supplies of “core” financial services (such as the issuing of securities) that the entity makes, and supplies of the same non-core services by third parties. For example, arranging the provision of credit under a credit contract is included in the definition, regardless of whether the entity which provides the credit or a third party supplies the arranging services. 27 6.7 The lack of a distinction was an attempt to reduce the bias that financial service providers would have to self-supply non-core financial services if such services were treated as taxable when provided by third parties. 26 Ibid footnote 8. 27 The provision of credit under a credit contract is included by section 3(1)(f), arranging the provision by section 3(1)(l). 38 6.8 When non-core financial services are self-supplied by the supplier of the core financial services, they may either be charged an explicit fee, or an implicit fee may be included in the margin on the supply of the core financial service. A third party which does not provide the core financial service cannot bundle the charge for other services with any margin-based charge for the core financial service. The ability to substitute services and the accompanying valuation difficulties which underpin the exemption of financial services do not occur, therefore, when third parties supply non-core financial services. 6.9 In certain circumstances services provided by third parties are already excluded from the definition of financial services when they would be within the definition if provided by a supplier of financial services. For example, debt collection services, which may be included in the definition under section 3(1)(ka) when carried out by the entity to which the debt is owing, are specifically excluded from the definition when provided by a third party. 28 More generally, the Australian GST legislation draws a distinction between services provided by principals, which are included in the definition of financial services, and services provided by agents, which are not. 6.10 The proposals in this discussion document relating to zero-rating business-to- business supplies of financial services are primarily aimed at reducing the tax cascades that arise from the exemption of financial services. These proposals will, in turn, reduce the self-supply bias. Narrowing the definition of “financial services” as far as practicable would be consistent with these reforms. It would also be consistent with the fact that a primary driver for exemption is the concern with substitutability and valuation. Self-supply does not, of itself, create a justification for exemption, as there will always be distortions wherever GST sets a boundary. 6.11 The government therefore proposes to remove non-core financial services provided by third parties from the scope of the financial services definition. When a person other than the person supplying the core financial service has an involvement in the supply of that financial service, in the form of arranging, facilitating, or executing the service, that service will be excluded from the definition of “financial services”. 6.12 The activities of brokers and other intermediaries, except underwriters and sub-underwriters, 29 will be affected by the proposal. As it is uncertain what the impact of the proposal will be for these businesses, the government does not propose that it be introduced until full consultation has been undertaken. It is proposed that any credit management by a third party, such as checking creditworthiness, making decisions about whether to offer credit, monitoring creditor payments or managing overdue payments, will be outside the scope of the definition and will, therefore, be subject to tax. Services relating to the provision of advice are already subject to GST. 28 Section 3(4)(b), as inserted by the Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. 29 Section 3(1)(e). 39 6.13 In the case of corporate finance, brokerage activities will be included in the definition of “financial service” if the activities relate to the entity’s own securities. This is provided that the intermediation between buyers/investors and sellers/issuers is coordinated and concluded by the same party to which the securities relate. 6.14 Some third party services, however, may remain exempt when treating them as taxable would create competitive distortions between different types of financial services. For example, management services provided by third parties to long-term investment vehicles, such as superannuation schemes, might remain within the definition of “financial services”. This is discussed further below. Management services 6.15 Management services are generally excluded from the definition of financial services, as they are discrete services that can be valued and they are not inherently financial services. They are also often provided by third party suppliers. The management of a superannuation scheme is, however, included in the definition by section 3(1)(j). This is an attempt to prevent any distortion between the treatment of superannuation schemes and the treatment of life insurance, which does not usually involve a separate management charge. Generally, both are long-term investment vehicles with a substantial savings component. 6.16 The treatment of management services for other investment vehicles, such as unit trusts and group investment funds, which are not currently included in the definition, is more problematic. 6.17 Management services for these investment vehicles could be included in the financial services definition, whether supplied by the provider of the investment vehicle or by a third party. This would ensure there are no distortions between the treatments of different long-term investment vehicles. 6.18 On the other hand, the government considers that there are good arguments for treating management fees for unit trusts and group investment funds as taxable. This is on the basis that, as with other third party supplies, these fees are not inherently for financial services and do not suffer significantly from valuation difficulties. 6.19 Both possible treatments of management services involve distortions. The government is interested in submissions on which approach is more sound and the relative magnitude of the distortions involved. 6.20 If such management services were included in the financial services definition, the scope of section 3(1)(l) (agreeing or arranging financial services) would need to be narrowed so that these services are excluded from the provision of management services for long-term investment vehicles. Agreeing to do or arranging the management of an investment vehicle is a step removed from the actual management of a long-term investment vehicle and should, therefore, be treated as taxable. 40 Services relating to underlying taxable supplies 6.21 The definition of financial services excludes the supply of certain services which would otherwise be exempt when they involve the supply of taxable goods or services. For example, the definitions of “debt”, “equity” and “participatory securities” exclude an interest or estate in land or shares in the share capital of flat-owning or office-owning companies. 30 Deliverable futures contracts are not included in the definition if they provide for the delivery of a taxable commodity. 31 6.22 These exclusions attempt to better define the financial services boundary and to ensure that taxable supplies cannot be recharacterised as exempt supplies with a consequent tax advantage. Some investment vehicles, particularly participatory securities, continue to involve the recharacterisation of otherwise taxable supplies of goods and services as exempt supplies. Of particular concern are situations where ownership of an otherwise “taxable” asset is, in substance, transferred without participation in the investment vehicle’s capital or assets. 6.23 The term “security” is generally defined as an interest in the property of another person. The High Court in R v Smith 32 made the observation that the term “security” implied more than just a contractual right to delivery and involved some element of participation in the capital, assets, earnings, royalties or other property of a person. It is such situations that the inclusion of the supply of a participatory security in the definition was meant to encompass, not the bare transfer of ownership of an asset. 6.24 It is therefore proposed that the definition of “participatory security” be amended to reflect a boundary between participation in property and the transfer of ownership. Other issues Arranging and advising 6.25 The distinction in section 3(1)(l) between agreeing to and arranging the supply of a financial service (which is exempt), and advising on the supply of a financial service (which is taxable), is problematic for many taxpayers. They often find the distinction a difficult one to make and may, as a result, incur significant compliance costs. However, the distinction does delineate an important difference between services which are closely related to the supply of the financial services by the financial institution and, therefore, properly included in the definition, and services which are a step removed from the actual supply of the financial services and properly taxable. 30 Section 3(3)(b) and (c) respectively. 31 Section 3(1)(k). 32 (1991) 5 NZCLC 67,120. 41 6.26 Therefore it is not proposed to remove this distinction, at least as it relates to arranging services provided by the supplier of the financial services to which the arranging services relate. 6.27 It is expected that the removal of third party suppliers from the definition of “financial services” will limit the extent to which this distinction is a problem in practice. The legislation will be easier for brokers and other affected parties to apply. Taxpayers who have an incidental involvement with financial services, such as lawyers involved in conveyancing, will also be able to treat all of their activities as taxable. 6.28 As noted earlier, however, the scope of section 3(1)(l) may be narrowed so that the agreeing to do, and the arranging of, the management of long-term investment vehicles is not included in the definition. A generic definition 6.29 Consideration has been given as to whether the current prescriptive definition in section 3 could be either replaced or supplemented by a more purposive, generic definition. A generic definition, instead of listing specific services within its scope as section 3(1) does at present, could describe the fundamental characteristics of a financial service. 6.30 A generic definition would have the advantage of being flexible enough to cater for innovations in the financial services sector, which constantly create new types of services. The current prescriptive definition runs the risk of becoming outdated and subjecting services to GST which should not be subject to GST, as has occurred in the past in relation to certain derivative products. 6.31 The government does not, however, consider it appropriate to replace the current prescriptive definition with a generic definition. This could create uncertainty and increase compliance costs by unnecessarily disturbing the existing treatment of financial services. A generic definition could, however, supplement the prescriptive definition, providing guidance for the treatment of new products, such as new derivatives. 6.32 The generic definition could be in the nature of a purpose provision, particularly for products not covered by the prescriptive definition. Such a definition would require careful consideration of the inherent characteristics of financial instruments, ensuring that supplies of services that are properly taxed are not inappropriately included within the scope of the financial services definition. 6.33 Some of these characteristics could be drawn from accounting practices which define financial assets. 6.34 The government is interested in receiving submissions on this issue. 42 Chapter 7 POLICY OBJECTIVES OF THE GROUPING RULES This chapter describes the GST grouping rules in section 55 of the GST Act and the policy role the government intends them to fulfil. 7.1 Many taxpayers are structured as groups of companies. For GST purposes they are able to take advantage of group registration to reduce any possible distortions between a single entity, a branch structure and a group structure and reduce compliance costs by treating the group as a single entity. For most taxpayers the grouping rules operate well and achieve this compliance cost reduction aim. However, for groups that make a mix of taxable and exempt supplies, such as financial institutions, the application of the rules is far more complex. Role of the grouping rules Original policy intent – 1986 to 1989 7.2 Section 55 was intended to ensure that there was no distortion between the GST treatments of a single entity, a branch structure and a group structure. The grouping provision allows groups of companies to reduce compliance and administrative costs by requiring that only one GST return be filed. It was broadly modelled on the equivalent United Kingdom VAT provision. 33 7.3 The section was intended to reflect a “single entity” approach for groups of companies accounting for GST – the group was to be treated as if it were one company for GST purposes. This ensured that intra-group supplies sourced completely from the group’s resources were not subject to GST, in the same way that the “self-supply” of those services within a single company or between branches would not be subject to GST. 7.4 Once a group of companies is registered as a group for the purposes of section 55, one member of the group is nominated as the “representative member”. The supplies made by the members of the group are, in effect, aggregated and attributed to the representative member. 7.5 This is achieved through section 55(7) providing as follows: • Section 55(7)(a) treating all taxable activities of all members as being carried on by the representative member, and not by any other member of the group. 33 Section 43 of the Value Added Tax Act 1983. 43 • Section 55(7)(c) allowing taxable supplies between members of a group to be disregarded to the extent that the recipient of the supply would have been entitled to deduct input tax in respect of that supply, had it not been a member of the group. • Section 55(7)(d) treating all taxable supplies made by a member of the group, or to a member of the group, as being made by the representative member or to the representative member respectively. • Section 55(7)(da) treating all other supplies made by a member of the group as being made by the representative member. 7.6 Figures 8 to 10 illustrate the intended operation of the grouping rules. Note that the terms “taxable member” and “exempt member” refer to companies which make predominantly taxable and predominantly exempt supplies, respectively. The group in the examples is predominantly “taxable”, based on supplies made by the group (turnover). Figure 8: A taxable supply is made by a third party to a member of a group GST treatment: The supply is treated as being received by the group (representative member) under section 55(7)(d). 7.7 The availability of input tax credits in relation to this supply depends on how the services are used. The requirement that the supply be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies still applies to determine whether input tax credits are available. If the supply is used principally to make intra-group taxable supplies which are not disregarded, or are to make taxable supplies to persons outside the group, an input tax credit would be available. Intra-group taxable supplies that are disregarded cannot be said to have been acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, as the supplies are disregarded. Therefore input tax credits would not be available.

Figure 10: A taxable member of the group makes a taxable supply of services to an exempt member of the group GST treatment: GST must be charged on the supply, as it is a taxable supply to an exempt member of a group and cannot be disregarded under section 55(7)(c). If the recipient member of the group was only partially exempt, the supply could be disregarded to the extent that an input tax credit would be available to the member. Predominantly taxable group A DB C Exempt Taxable Taxable Taxable Predominantly taxable group D Exempt A Taxable C Taxable B Taxable 45 1989 amendments – section 55(7)(c), (db) and (dc) 7.8 In the late 1980s structural reforms to certain sectors of the financial services industry were undertaken. As a result, some entities which had in-sourced certain taxable supplies re-formed in a group structure using a subsidiary to provide the taxable services to all other members of the group. 7.9 Under the legislation as it stood, the taxable supply of those services would not have been disregarded for grouping purposes. Section 55(7)(c) would have applied to prevent the supply from being disregarded to the extent that input tax credits would not have been available to the recipient of the supply. This meant that entities which had in-sourced the supplies with little or no GST impost would be subject to GST on intra-group supplies which were unable to be disregarded. 7.10 The government of the day decided to amend the grouping rules to reduce the GST cost to those companies in the financial services sector adopting a group structure. 7.11 This was achieved through the following amendments to section 55(7): • Section 55(7)(c) was amended to allow taxable supplies between members of a group to be disregarded, subject to sections 55(7)(db) and (dc). • Section 55(7)(db) was inserted to treat a change in use as having occurred when a member of a group (not being a member of the GST group) acquires a supply for taxable purposes, joins the GST group, and then any other member of the group (deemed to be the representative member) uses the supply for other than taxable purposes. This was intended to ensure that an output tax adjustment under the then section 21(1) would be required so that GST would, in effect, be paid on the supply of those goods or services between group members, in the same way as would occur if a single entity made a change in use. • Section 55(7)(dc) was inserted to treat a change in use as having occurred when a member of a group (not being a member of the GST group) acquires a supply for non-taxable purposes, joins the GST group, and then any other member of the group (treated as being the representative member) uses the supply for taxable purposes. This was intended to ensure that an input tax adjustment under the then section 21(5) would be allowed, in the same way as would occur if a single entity made a change in use. 7.12 Figures 11 to 13 illustrate the intended operation of the grouping rules after the 1989 amendments. As discussed later, clarification is needed in some areas. 46 Figure 11: Taxable company joins predominantly exempt group – treatment of pre-existing assets of the taxable company GST treatment: On joining the exempt group, the taxable company has pre-existing assets for which it has claimed input tax credits. If the group uses those assets to make exempt supplies, the representative member must make an output tax adjustment for the change in use. Figure 12: Exempt company joins predominantly taxable group – treatment of pre-existing assets of the exempt company GST treatment: On joining the taxable group, the exempt company has pre-existing assets for which it was unable to claim input tax credits. If the group uses those assets to make taxable supplies, the representative member is entitled to make an input tax adjustment for the change in use.

The supply may be disregarded under section 55(7)(c), as it is a taxable supply between two members of a group. As the exempt member uses those services to make exempt supplies, the representative member may be required to make an output tax adjustment for the change in use. Proposed role of the grouping rules 7.13 The GST grouping rules continue to play an important role in alleviating potential distortions between the treatment of single entities (companies), branch structures and group structures, and reducing the compliance costs of accounting for GST for groups of companies. The rules should continue to ensure that intra-group supplies sourced completely from a group’s resources are not subject to GST, in the same way that the “self-supply” of those services within a single company or between branches would not be subject to GST. The rules should not, however, result in any advantages for groups of companies over other entity structures. 7.14 The government does not propose to make any substantive changes to the GST grouping rules. 7.15 In certain areas, however, there is uncertainty as to whether the intended operation of the grouping rules is clearly expressed in section 55. The next chapter proposes amendments to ensure that the intended policy of the grouping rules is clearly set out in section 55. Predominantly taxable group A B Taxable D C Exempt Taxable Taxable 48 Chapter 8 PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE GROUPING RULES This chapter proposes amendments to clarify the application of the grouping rules as expressed in section 55, by: • clarifying when input tax credits are available for supplies used in turn to make disregarded intra-group supplies; • clarifying the situations in which adjustments will be required; and • requiring that adjustments for assets held by companies which join a group be made at market value. It also discusses the relationship between the grouping rules and the proposed reverse charge on imported services, and proposes that cross-border intra-group charges, other than salaries and interest, be subject to the reverse charge. 8.1 This chapter identifies areas where the grouping rules are not in line with the policy (as outlined in chapter 7) that they are intended to implement, and recommends clarifying amendments to ensure that the policy intention is met. The chapter also discusses the relationship between the grouping rules and the proposed reverse charge on imported services as regards cross- border-related party transactions. Non-availability of input tax credits for disregarded supplies Issue 8.2 As stated in chapter 7, there is no entitlement to an input tax credit when goods and services acquired from a third party by a group are used to make intra-group supplies which are disregarded under section 55(7)(c). An entitlement to input tax credits would amount to the zero-rating of intra- group supplies, which was not the intention of the grouping rules. It is not sufficiently clearly understood, from the wording of section 55, that input tax credits should not be allowed in relation to a disregarded intra-group supply. 8.3 This issue arises from the use of the term “disregarded” in section 55(7)(c), and the status of an otherwise taxable supply which is disregarded and for which no output tax is charged. The disregarding of an intra-group supply should result in there being both no output tax charged by the supplier and no input tax being able to be claimed by the supplier. 49 8.4 Further, although an inability to claim input tax credits is appropriate when exempt activities are carried on by a group, it is not appropriate for a group which only makes taxable supplies. The grouping rules currently allow a group to disregard supplies at its own discretion – if the supply is not disregarded an input tax credit may be available to the supplier (through the representative member). 8.5 Therefore a fully taxable group has the choice of either claiming input tax credits and not disregarding intra-group supplies, thereby losing the compliance cost savings of grouping, or not claiming input tax credits and disregarding intra-group supplies, which results in a tax cascade within the group. This occurs as tax is charged on the supply made to the group by the third party, no input tax credit is available for the tax paid, and the group then charges tax on the supplies it makes to third parties. This can result in the overtaxation of a fully taxable group. Proposal 8.6 The grouping rules should ensure that a single company, a group of companies and branches are treated in the same manner. They should also reduce compliance costs for groups of companies. The current rules arguably do not achieve these outcomes, because of the treatment of disregarded supplies, principally with respect to the availability of input tax credits. 8.7 The availability of input tax credits for acquisitions made by a group should be judged on the basis of the supplies that group makes outside the group (that is, to third parties), with adjustments required for changes in use within the group. This will place a group of companies in a similar position to single companies. Disregarded supplies should not be determinative of the availability of input tax credits. 8.8 It is proposed to amend section 55(7) to provide that input tax credits are available on purchases acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies outside the group, and that intra-group taxable supplies are to be ignored. 8.9 As part of these changes the discretion to disregard taxable supplies will be removed. If a group registers for GST purposes it will be required to disregard all intra-group taxable supplies. 8.10 Figures 14 to 17 illustrate the intended operation of the grouping rules as regards the availability of input tax credits for purchases from third parties: 50 Figure 14: A fully taxable group Transactions 1.

If intra-group supplies are made entirely out of the group’s resources, with no external inputs (for example, merely using staff), there will be no GST impact, in the same way that the “self- supply” of those services within a single company or between branches would not be subject to GST. The requirement to make adjustments 8.12 A group is intended to be required to make adjustments for changes in use in the following circumstances (as outlined in chapter 7): • For goods and services held before a group is formed, or held by a new member entering a group, where the use by the group differs from that for which the goods and services were acquired (sections 55(7)(db) and (dc)). • For goods and services acquired by the group for a particular purpose and used either within or by the group for another purpose (sections 21 and 21E). 8.13 Sections 55(7)(db) and (dc) apply to deem the requirements of sections 21 and 21E to have been met when goods and services are “subsequently applied” for a purpose other than the purpose for which they were originally acquired. It is questionable whether goods and services can be said to have been “subsequently” applied if the goods or services are consumed in making supplies or in some way change in form. For instance, a diverse range of inputs is required to make an internal supply of record-keeping services such as computers and staff time. 8.14 This bundling can change the nature of the goods and services originally acquired, and may mean that the goods and services are not subsequently applied – rather the product of their application is subsequently applied. Under this argument, a subsequent application would only happen in relation to enduring assets – for instance an asset that is leased to an entity which uses it for a taxable purpose and the asset is then subleased, on the same terms, to another entity which uses it for a non-taxable purpose. 8.15 This interpretation is inconsistent with the intention of the grouping rules. An adjustment should be required so that a group of companies is in the same GST position as a single company when it changes the use of any goods and services. It is notable that the word “subsequently” was removed from the change-in-use adjustment provisions for similar reasons. 34 The wording of section 55(7)(db) is also inconsistent with the wording of section 21(1), referring only to the application of goods and services, whereas section 21(1) refers to application, acquisition and production of goods and services. 34 Taxation (GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2000. 55 8.16 It is proposed to align the wording of sections 55(7)(db) and (dc) with the wording of sections 21 and 21E. This will involve removing the references to “subsequently” and adding the terms “acquired” and “produced” to “applied” in section 55(7)(db). The value of adjustments 8.17 Output tax adjustments can be made based on either the lesser of the cost of an asset or the open market value of the deemed supply of the asset. When made using the cost 35 option, a depreciation methodology is usually adopted. This can result in a timing advantage, based on the difference between the depreciation rate of the asset and the open market value of the deemed supplies made. 8.18 The use of the depreciation methodology raises an issue in relation to assets which have a high depreciation rate. Some taxpayers hold assets, such as computers, which depreciate at a high rate and have a zero value for depreciation purposes. In relation to a change from taxable to exempt use, the argument has been made that a zero output tax adjustment can, therefore, be made, as previously there has been an “over-adjustment”. Taxpayers argue that as the asset has been fully depreciated, the depreciation rate is zero, with the result that a nil adjustment is made. 8.19 This may give an undue advantage to groups of companies over other entity structures, particularly when new members join a group. The government therefore proposes that the adjustments made under sections 55(7)(db) and (dc) when a new member joins a group of companies be made at market value. Relationship with reverse charge proposals Background 8.20 The discussion document GST and imported services was released in June 2001. Since then further consultation has been undertaken with interested parties and it is planned that the proposals in that discussion document will be implemented alongside the proposal for zero-rating business-to-business supplies of financial services. The remainder of this chapter outlines the main issues arising from that discussion document and the government’s response. 35 Note that for the purposes of such adjustments Inland Revenue does not view the cost of the goods and services to be merely their original cost. 56 8.21 The discussion document outlined the government’s proposed reforms to the treatment of imported services by the introduction of a reverse charge on such services. The discussion document also raised certain issues relating to grouping. It proposed that a New Zealand entity or presence should be treated as separate from its offshore presence in relation to services that would be subject to GST if supplied in New Zealand. This requires not disregarding supplies within a group of companies which include offshore entities. 8.22 Thus, subject to any appropriate exclusions, management fees or cost allocations charged from offshore to a New Zealand arm of an international group of companies would be subject to the reverse charge. 8.23 Those who made submissions on the discussion document largely accepted the theory that the reverse charge will remove the current distortions arising from the fact that GST is imposed on domestic supplies but not on supplies of imported services. However, some submitters questioned whether the current non-taxation of imported services distorts decisions in practice. Those who believe that no distortions exist base their view on the belief that there are no ready substitutes in New Zealand for the services provided by most offshore service providers. They therefore consider that, at the least, the application of the reverse charge should be limited to those services which do have New Zealand substitutes. 8.24 This would generally exclude management fees and cost allocations by an offshore affiliate, which could be achieved by allowing the offshore affiliate to be grouped for GST purposes with New Zealand companies that met the requirements for grouping. 8.25 The alternative view is that submitters’ arguments on the lack of New Zealand-sourced substitutes for services provided from overseas are based on a static view of the market for services, instead of recognising that the market is continually changing. The submitters’ arguments also do not recognise the possibility that the GST disadvantage New Zealand suppliers face may well be a factor in any potential lack of New Zealand substitutes for overseas services. 8.26 The government considers that there is no completely distortion-free option for the treatment of cross-border intra-group supplies. Both the proposed treatment and submitters’ preferred treatment would result in distortions in the treatment of supplies of services depending on the supplier of those services. 8.27 GST grouping in the context of the reverse charge needs to be limited in any event because of concerns over: • the substitutability of services; and • circumvention of the reverse charge. 57 Substitutability 8.28 It is not necessarily always valid to compare the treatment of supplies within a New Zealand group with supplies between an offshore parent (or head office) and a New Zealand subsidiary (or branch). In the context of the policy of the reverse charge the question is the risk of offshore supplies creating distortions relative to domestic supplies. Supplies by an offshore parent or head office can create this risk since they may compete with domestically generated supplies which may be sourced from outside the New Zealand group. 8.29 Although the government understands concerns that this competition is in practice limited, in most instances there is nothing in the inherent nature of those services which would preclude their supply by a third party. Therefore the distortionary effects of not imposing GST on such supplies cannot be ruled out. The government is concerned to reduce the risk of offshore supplies creating distortions relative to domestic supplies from outside a group. However the impact of distortions in relation to related-party charges is viewed, the reverse charge cannot operate unless potential avoidance problems are dealt with. Circumvention of the reverse charge 8.30 If related party charges were not subject to the reverse charge, the use of offshore associated entities through which New Zealand entities were able to access supplies from offshore third party entities could very easily undermine the effectiveness of the reverse charge more generally. 8.31 Thus, even if submitters’ approach were accepted, not all internal charges would necessarily be removed from the reverse charge. A conservative approach would be needed. Thus only charges that could be identified as internal would be excluded. Salaries would seem to be the main such charge. Other charges can too readily include third party elements because they are made up of any number of components. While salaries are also open to substitution, they are likely to carry less of an avoidance risk because they involve a single charge. 8.32 As stated in the imported services discussion document, interest could also be excluded, not on the basis of arguments over substitutability, but because, to the extent that it retains its nature as interest, it represents a non-taxable supply which will always be excluded from the reverse charge. Therefore if interest forms part of a cost allocation it could be excluded from the scope of the reverse charge. Proposal 8.33 The government proposes that, having regard to the need to reflect a continually changing market and the practical concerns raised by submitters, internal charges will be subject to the reverse charge but there will be an exclusion for salaries and interest. A NNEXES 61 ANNEX A CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF TAX CASCADES – AN EXAMPLE The following example shows how tax cascades increase the price of commodities sold to final consumers. The example compares the effect of two supplies from registered persons to a local retailer. The first supply is a taxable supply of goods by a manufacturer. The second supply is a supply of financial services by a bank. The cost to the manufacturer and financial intermediary to supply their products is $900.00 (including GST of $100.00). As the manufacturer makes taxable supplies, it can claim an input tax credit – this reduces the cost of the purchases. The bank, on the other hand, cannot recover this cost. When determining the price for the manufactured goods, the manufacturer requires a return of $200.00. GST is charged on this price. The bank requires a similar margin but is not required to charge GST. Manufacturer Bank Purchases to provide goods 900.00 Purchases to provide service 900.00 GST Input Tax Credit (100.00) GST Input Tax Credit - Total cost 800.00 Total cost 900.00 Operating margin 200.00 Operating margin 200.00 Base cost of goods 1,000.00 Interest 1,100.00 GST at 12.5% 125.00 GST (Exempt) - Price of goods sold 1,125.00 Interest charged 1,100.00 A local retailer purchases the goods and services from the manufacturer and the financial intermediary. 36 The higher purchase price from the bank is a result of the exempt supply. This has the effect of increasing the base price on which the retailer charges GST. The GST that could not be recovered by the bank has cascaded, meaning that the retailer is collecting $162.50 in GST rather than $150.00, as is the case when selling only the manufacturer’s goods. 36 Unlike the manufacturer’s goods which are sold directly to final consumers, the interest cost forms part of the retailer’s cost of operation. The retailer seeks to recover the interest cost by adding the $1,100 interest charge across all goods and services sold by the retailer. For the purposes of this example, this has been disregarded. 62 Retailer Retailer Purchase from manufacturer 1,125.00 Interest payable to bank 1,100.00 GST Input Tax Credit (125.00) GST Input Tax Credit - Total cost 1,000.00 Total cost 1,100.00 Operating margin 200.00 Operating margin 200.00 Base price of goods sold 1,200.00 Base price of goods sold 1,300.00 GST at 12.5% 150.00 GST at 12.5% 162.50 Price of goods sold to consumers 1,350.00 Price of goods sold to consumer 1,462.50 63 ANNEX B BASIC METHODOLOGY OF CASH FLOW TAXATION AS APPLIED TO DIFFERENT TYPES OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION 37 This annex summaries the basic methodology underlying the GST treatment of financial services under a cash flow taxation model, as developed by Satya Podder and Morley English. As noted in chapter 3, the model includes both household and business financial transactions within the tax base and attempts to measure the implicit fee for financial margins and allocate that margin between borrowers and lenders. 38 The model predominately addresses the taxation of financial services in the context of deposit-taking intermediation but can also be applied to: • securities transactions; • derivative transactions; and • life insurance. The methodology outlined in this annex applies to financial services provided by “financial institutions”, which are taxpayers defined as mainly having an activity of supplying financial intermediation services or regularly trading in financial assets. By measuring and allocating the margin for financial intermediation, it is generally expected that the normal rules for calculating and returning GST under the credit- invoice method could be applied. This means that as the financial margin is identified, and GST charged, the financial intermediary would be entitled to claim an input tax credit in the ordinary way. Business customers of the financial intermediary would, in turn, be entitled to claim an input tax credit for the GST paid on the financial services, hence removing the tax cascade. Final consumers would expect to receive an invoice showing the GST charged with, say, a monthly bank statement. Taxing deposit-taking intermediation The basis of taxing financial services under the truncated cash flow method with tax calculation account involves allocating the margin earned by a financial institution between borrowers and depositors. The allocation is performed by the tax calculation account (TCA), which measures the margin over the life of financial contracts. An indexing rate is applied to the TCA to allocate the margin, in the case of deposit- taking intermediation, between depositors and borrowers. The indexing rate is intended to be an approximation of a “pure” rate of interest, that is, a rate that does not contain a charge for intermediation or credit risk. 37 This annex is based on a report by Ernst and Young to the Taxation and Customs Union for the European Commission. Refer, The TCA System – a detailed description, Brussels (1998). 38 Explicit fees are generally taxed under the usual credit-invoice methodology. 64 This means that GST is not applied to the rate of interest advertised, or the rate paid on a loan or received on a deposit. Instead, the taxable margin is calculated as the difference between the actual amounts paid or received compared to what would have been paid and received according to the indexed rate of interest. Therefore the GST liability on financial services will decrease as the interest rate on a loan decreases and will increase as the interest rate paid on a deposit decreases. The TCA records the details of transactions between the financial institution and the customer, including the principal amount of the deposit or loan, and applies the rate of GST on each entry. Although GST consequences arise on principal transactions, this is usually offset by corresponding GST debits and credits and net to zero. Therefore the TCA is in practice concerned with tracking the difference between actual interest rates (and corresponding interest payments or receipts) as compared to the indexed interest rate. The TCA can therefore apply to loans and deposits in two ways: (i) the sum of the cash flows method; and (ii) the interest margin method. • The sum of the cash flows method involves the calculation of the GST base for a period by: (i) debiting the TCA by the amount of all cash inflows associated with loans or deposits in the period; (ii) crediting the TCA by the amount of all cash outflows associated with a loan or deposit in the period; (iii) multiplying the net debit or credit balance by the indexing rate, which results in a debit or credit entry in the TCA for the period; and (iv) reducing the TCA balance at the end of the period by the loan or deposit balance, which becomes the opening balance for the next period. This approach does not require a distinction between interest and principal cash flows, since the closing balance reduction ensures that no net GST is paid or credited on the relevant principal amount. • The interest margin method involves the calculation of the GST base for a period by: (i) determining the difference between the contracted interest in the period on a loan or deposit and the indexing adjustment; (ii) applying the indexing adjustment to the margin for the period; and (iii) multiplying the TCA balance by the GST rate for the period. This approach requires a distinction between interest and principal cash flows. The model also includes a number of adjustments to reflect bad debts and discounts. Securities transactions The same methodology can, in principle, be applied to security transactions. Assuming that the mid-market price equals the mid-point between the dealer “bid” and “ask” prices (which converts to an explicit price), this fee can be allocated between purchasers and sellers of securities through a financial institution in the following way: • The difference between the “bid” price paid by a financial institution for the purchase of a security as a principal and the mid-market price would be deemed to be a brokerage fee charged to the seller. 65 • The difference between the “ask” price received by a financial institution for the sale of a security as a principal and the mid-market price is deemed to be a brokerage fee charged to the purchaser. The total amount paid or received by customers is deemed to include GST on the deemed brokerage fee. Any gains and losses that arise on security inventories of financial institutions are recognised for GST purposes, either by recording the cash flows or using the TCA method. If the cash flows are taxed: (i) all cash outflows from purchases are treated as purchases that are eligible for GST refunds; (ii) all cash inflows from sales are treated as taxable sales that are subject to GST; and (iii) all cash inflows from the receipt of dividends or interest are treated as taxable sales that are subject to GST. The TCA account, on the other hand, is calculated in the same manner to that for deposit-taking intermediation: (i) all cash inflows are debited to the account; (ii) all cash outflows are credited to the account; (iii) the net balance in the TCA for a period is multiplied by the indexing rate and is credited to the TCA; (iv) the closing value of a security on hand is debited to the account to offset the credit associated with its purchase; (iv) GST is calculated on the closing balance; and (v) the closing value of a security becomes the opening value in the TCA for the subsequent period. Under both methods, GST is calculated on the basis of cash flows associated with an entire security portfolio and is deemed to be derived from bearer securities without any counterparty, which means the burden of the GST falls on financial institutions. Cash flows are deemed to be GST inclusive, but with the amount of gain or loss determined after excluding the deemed brokerage fee subject to GST: that is, the cost of a security is deemed to include the amount of the deemed brokerage fee, subject to GST, and the proceeds for a security are deemed to be reduced by the amount of the deemed brokerage fee, subject to GST. Derivative transactions In relation to derivative transactions, the TCA is not necessary as over-the-counter derivatives such as interest-rate swaps, forwards, equity swaps, commodity swaps and options can, in principle, be taxed according to the cash flows, provided that the price is grossed up to include GST. If the TCA were used, the “inception profit” (associated with the writing of a derivative) would be used as the equivalent of an explicit intermediation fee subject to GST. The “inception profit” equals the present value of the anticipated margin associated with the writing of a derivative and is determined as the difference between the price specified under the instrument and the mid-market price for the same position in the same instrument. The inception profit is then treated as a loan to the counterparty, in respect of which the TCA is established to compute GST on the financial margin over the term of the derivative. Subsequent cash flows under a derivative instrument are treated as debits or credits to the TCA. 66 Life insurance Life insurers can be taxed either by reference to cash flows or using the TCA method. Either method measures both the risk intermediation margin and the net investment margin of insurers. Taxing life insurance by reference to cash flow requires the application of GST to all cash inflows of an insurer from premiums and investments, with the provision of input tax credits for all amounts that are paid as claims and are credited as interest to policy reserves. Amounts paid as claims to registered businesses are treated as taxable sales by such businesses and are subject to GST. The application of the TCA method to insurance policies involves: (i) the debiting of the amount of cash inflows (premiums) associated with a particular policy for the relevant period; (ii) the crediting of the amount of cash outflows (claims, bonuses and policy surrenders) associated with a particular policy for the relevant period; (iii) a debiting or crediting equal to the net debit or credit balance for the period multiplied by the indexing rate; (iv) a reduction equal to the amount of the reserve balance associated with a particular policy at the end of the period; and (v) the remittance or refund of amounts equal to the TCA balance at the end of the period multiplied by the GST rate. The closing TCA balance for a period becomes the opening TCA balance for the following period. Several adjustments to the general methodology are required to ensure that re- insurance is treated as a zero-rated supply and that, where TCAs are used, policy reserves are allocated to particular policies for the purposes of the TCA on a per transaction/per customer basis. Separate TCAs are also required for insurance policies and for investment activities. The indexing adjustment then serves to allocate the total insurance margin between insurance policies (the risk intermediation margin) and investments (the investment intermediation margin). 67 ANNEX C NUMERICAL EXAMPLE COMPARING THE TREATMENT OF TAXABLE SUPPLIES AND EXEMPT SUPPLIES UNDER CURRENT LEGISLATION WITH THE PROPOSED ZERO- RATING ENVIRONMENT 39 This annex illustrates how the proposal to zero-rate domestic business-to-business supplies of financial services is aimed at removing tax cascades and creating parity with taxable supplies of non-financial goods and services. It assumes that the tax is able to be fully shifted forward by the supplier to the customer.

The provision of brokerage services involves three distinct cash flows: (i) payment by a purchaser to the intermediary of the purchase price for a specified item; (ii) receipt by a seller through the intermediary of the sale price for a specified item; and (iii) the fee charged by the intermediary for the provision of the intermediation services. Cash-flow taxation: A method of calculating the taxable value of financial services, based on treating cash inflows as taxable sales and cash outflows as taxable purchases. Credit-invoice mechanism: The mechanism by which GST is collected and paid in New Zealand, which works by levying tax in instalments at each transaction in the production and distribution chain. A liability to charge tax arises every time a registered person makes a supply. Tax is also imposed on imports. Credits for tax paid on a registered person’s purchases means that the tax rolls forward at each intermediate transaction until the point of sale to a final consumer. Deposit-taking intermediation: This involves the making of deposits and debt investments with an intermediary who provides the relevant funds to users of capital in the form of loans. Deposit-taking intermediation involves five distinct cash flows: (i) the advance of a principal sum by the supplier of capital through the intermediary to the user of capital; (ii) the repayment of the principal sum by the user of capital through the intermediary to the supplier of capital; (iii) the pure time-value return or interest charge that compensates the supplier of capital for the use of its funds by the user of capital; (iv) the premium charged by the intermediary to compensate for the risk of default on payment obligations by users of capital; and (v) the fee charged by the intermediary for intermediation services. Exempt activity: Any activity carried on by a registered person that makes exempt supplies. Exempt supplies: A supply that is not subject to GST but for which the supplier is unable to claim an input tax credit. In the context of the reforms proposed in this discussion document, exempt supplies include supplies of financial services to final consumers (households), financial intermediaries and businesses that have more than an incidental activity of supplying financial services. Exemption-without-credit: This is the technical description for the current treatment of financial services. Briefly, it means that a financial intermediary does not charge GST on the supply of a financial service described in section 3 of the GST Act. It also means that in supplying any financial services the provider is unable to claim an input tax credit for any GST incurred in producing that service. This treatment is a proxy for taxing final consumption as it ensures that the intermediary expressly bears the tax cost. Final consumers/households: GST is a tax on the supply of goods and services in New Zealand. The tax is ultimately borne by the last person in the production-distribution chain, who is often referred to as the final consumer. The tax is borne by final consumers as they are unable to claim an offsetting credit for the tax paid when acquiring the goods or services. Financial intermediary: In its broadest sense, the term “intermediary” includes any person who serves to bring other persons together. Intermediation is the service provided by a person in bringing together suppliers and consumers of particular goods and services. Intermediaries therefore reduce transaction costs otherwise associated with matching suppliers and consumers. “Financial intermediation” can be divided in to four categories: • intermediation between suppliers and users of financial capital; • intermediation between persons with different exposures and/or tastes for risk; • intermediation between persons with exposure to similar risks; • intermediation between buyers and sellers of commodities, currencies, debt and equity securities. In addition to these intermediation services, firms may also provide advisory and administrative services, such as record-keeping and cash management functions and credit and investment evaluation. Goods and services: “Goods” is defined in section 2 of the GST Act as all kinds of real or personal property other than choses in action 40 or money. “Services” is defined as anything which is not goods or money. Therefore money is not part of the GST base, and choses in action are treated as services. Input tax credits: Registered persons are entitled to an offsetting credit for GST paid on purchases of goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The term “input tax” is defined in section 3A of the GST Act. Insurance: This involves the pooling of funds to spread exposure to risk among a number of persons or a number of different investments. Insurance involves three distinct cash flows: (i) payment by the insured of premiums (or savings in the case of diversification) to an intermediary for coverage in respect of a specified risk; (ii) payment by the intermediary to the insured of proceeds in respect of the occurrence of the specified risk (or the return on 40 For example, leases of land, use of patent rights, an interest in a partnership, company shares, trademarks and copyrights. 70 an interest in a diversified savings portfolio); and (iii) the fee charged by the intermediary for intermediation services. Reduced input tax credits (RITCs): A concession to allow registered persons to claim a percentage of input tax credits that would not otherwise be allowed for tax paid on their purchases. The purpose of the credit is to remove the bias financial intermediaries have to provide activities from within their own resources and thereby reduce the impact of GST. In Australia, where the RITC is used, the rate of input tax recovery is set at 75% of the GST paid on certain prescribed taxable supplies of goods and services. Registered person: A “registered person” is a person who is required to charge GST on the supply of goods and services made by them. Registration is required if the person has a taxable activity and makes supplies in New Zealand that total more than $40,000 in a 12-month period. Persons may also voluntarily register if they have a taxable activity and their turnover is less than $40,000. Risk intermediation: This involves the acceptance by the intermediary of exposure to a specified risk that the transferor is unwilling to bear, and the transfer by the intermediary of that exposure to another person willing to accept it. Risk intermediation involves three distinct cash flows: (i) the payment by the losing counterparty to a bet of the amount of that losing position to the intermediary; (ii) the payment by the intermediary of the amount of the losing bet to the winning counterparty; and (iii) the fee charged by the intermediary for intermediation services. The first two cash flows are channelled through the intermediary, who does not bear the risk associated with either side of the bet. The only risk assumed by the intermediary is, in fact, the credit risk associated with the chance that a losing party to a bet might default on its payment obligations, leaving the intermediary to make good on those obligations. A portion of the intermediation charge compensates for the assumption of this default risk. Self-supply: The term describes the behaviour of providing necessary goods and services “in-house”. In the case of financial intermediaries, the behaviour may arise from the inability to recover the GST paid on their purchases of goods and services. If the financial intermediary cannot pass on these costs, or faces tightening margins, it may elect to reduce the cost of supplies by replicating external supplies internally. Self-supply tax: A tax that is imposed, in theory, to achieve parity between internally generated supplies and those that could otherwise be sourced from third parties. It is designed, therefore, to remove the bias faced by some registered persons to in-source supplies of goods and services owing to the inability to claim input tax credits. The rate of tax should be equal to the standard rate of VAT/GST. The application of a self-supply tax would involve the complex issue of how to value internally created supplies. Tax cascade: Tax cascades can arise where a supplier of a financial service cannot recover the GST paid on the purchase of goods and services used to make those supplies. To compensate, the financial intermediary either raises the price of the services or absorbs the GST cost. If the irrecoverable GST cost is passed on to businesses through higher prices, this may increase the prices charged by businesses for their products. Tax invoice: A document that complies with section 24(3) or (4) of the GST Act. Taxable activity: The taxable activity test, as defined in section 6 of the GST Act, establishes the boundaries within which GST operates. It is similar to a business test but without the requirement that the activity be carried on for profit. The existence of a taxable activity depends on whether the activity is carried on continuously or regularly and whether it involves, or intends to involve supplies, other than exempt supplies, to another person for a consideration. Taxable supply: Taxable supplies are supplies charged with GST under section 8 of the GST Act, either at the standard 12.5% or, in certain circumstances, at zero percent. Zero-rating: Zero-rated supplies of goods and services are taxed at the rate of zero-percent. No tax is payable but input tax credits are allowed in respect of supplying the goods and services.

For example, the Privy Council has observed that: “The whole rationale of taxation would break down and the whole burden of taxation would fall only on diligent and honest taxpayers if the Commissioner had no power to obtain confidential information about taxpayers who may be negligent or dishonest.” 2 1.2 The current legal professional privilege contained in section 20 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 protects from disclosure communications between a lawyer and a client, and is the main exception to Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers. The current privilege has been identified in a number of reports as causing difficulties in the administration of the tax system. 1.3 This discussion document sets out a proposed new structure for the application of privilege to tax in New Zealand that would replace the current legal professional privilege applying in tax. The new rules should improve Inland Revenue’s access to factual information and, therefore, assist the enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts. At the same time, the new rules should promote the efficient conduct of compliance with the tax laws by allowing or continuing to allow tax practitioners to have a candid relationship with their clients. The new structure would be a complete code and constitute the only legislative exception to the Inland Revenue’s information- gathering powers. Summary of proposed changes 1.4 The new privilege structure would have two parts: • a new privilege for opinion on tax law; and • the existing litigation privilege based on definitions in the forthcoming new Evidence Code 3 and with certain procedural rules. 1 Inland Revenue’s primary information-gathering powers are contained in sections 16, 17 and 19 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2 New Zealand Stock Exchange and National Bank of New Zealand v CIR \[1992\] 13 NZTC 8,147 at 8,149. 3 Legislation for which is scheduled to be introduced into Parliament in 2002. 2 1.5 The new privilege for opinion on tax law would work as follows: • The privilege would apply only to opinion on tax law given at any time (whether before or after the filing of a tax return in respect of a tax period) by members of approved professional bodies. • The privilege would apply only if claimed by the taxpayer and would apply only in respect of identified documents and information. • If a document included both opinion on tax law and other information, the whole document would have to be provided, with any proper deletions of the material consisting solely of opinion on tax law being clearly identified in the document. The balance of any document consisting of material that was not opinion on tax law would not be privileged. • If Inland Revenue disputed the validity of a privilege claim, the privilege would not apply unless the claimant applied within one month for a determination by a District Court Judge of what part, if any, is privileged because it is opinion on tax law. (This would require the taxpayer to provide the unedited document to the court for review.) 1.6 The existing litigation privilege would continue to apply, with procedural rules similar to those applying for the privilege for opinion on tax law. The tests used in the new Evidence Code would be used for determining the boundary between what is covered by litigation privilege and what is not. The two main tests for determining this boundary are: • The document must have come into existence when litigation is in progress or is reasonably apprehended. • The dominant purpose of the document’s preparation must be to enable the conduct of litigation. 1.7 Procedural rules to ensure the physical protection of documents should also be enacted for Inland Revenue to invoke in the rare cases where it considers that there is a risk of the documents being removed, destroyed or tampered with before the validity of a privilege claim can be determined. These rules would be consistent with provisions in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will give Inland Revenue the power to remove documents for copying. Benefits of reform 1.8 A number of important benefits are expected to ensue from the reform of the privilege rules in tax. 3 Increasing the amount of factual information available to Inland Revenue 1.9 The current privilege rule prevents some factual information that is communicated between a lawyer and his or her client from being released to Inland Revenue. The new privilege structure should reduce the difficulties in tax administration caused by the current privilege by improving the department’s access to factual information. Improving access to factual information will assist Inland Revenue to enforce the Inland Revenue Acts, particularly where that information will help in understanding the arrangements under investigation. Improving competitive neutrality 1.10 At present, only tax advice given by lawyers is subject to legal professional privilege. However, tax advice of the same nature is frequently given by other professional advisers, such as chartered accountants. An advantage of reforming the current privilege rules is that it would remove the competitive advantage that lawyers have over other professional advisers, especially chartered accountants, in providing tax advice. Increasing perceptions of fairness 1.11 If the public perceives that some taxpayers are able to conceal details of their true income and, therefore, avoid or evade payment of tax, voluntary compliance with the tax system could suffer. A decrease in voluntary compliance would increase the tax burden for those taxpayers who continue to comply with the law. 1.12 Reforming privilege will help to maintain the integrity of the tax system by removing such perceptions and increasing perceptions of fairness. Promoting the efficient conduct of tax compliance 1.13 The new privilege for opinion on tax law should also promote the efficient conduct of compliance with the tax laws by allowing tax practitioners to have a candid relationship with their clients. Legislative timetable and application date 1.14 The government proposes that amendments implementing the new tax and privilege structure should be included in a tax bill to be introduced in Parliament in early 2003, with application from the date of enactment. Submissions 1.15 Submissions are invited on all aspects of the proposed new structure for tax and privilege. In particular, the government wishes to receive submissions on issues such as: 4 • Should the professional bodies whose members are able to give opinions on tax law that are privileged be approved by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, or specifically listed in the tax legislation? • Should the principles and procedures contained in Inland Revenue’s 1993 policy statement on access to advice and other workpapers prepared by accountants be applied to members of other approved professional bodies such as the New Zealand Law Society? • Should the boundary between what is covered by litigation privilege and what is not be more closely defined (in addition to using the definitions contained in the new Evidence Code)? • Is it necessary to re-enact the existing exceptions contained in section 20(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for information on trust accounts and investment receipts because such information by its very nature should not come within the proposed new tax and privilege structure in the first place? • The proposed procedures that could be invoked on a discretionary basis by Inland Revenue to ensure the physical protection of documents for which privilege is claimed pending judicial determination of the claim’s validity. 1.16 Submissions should be addressed to: Tax and Privilege: Proposed New Structure The General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz 1.17 The closing date for submissions is 31 July 2002. Submissions should contain a brief summary of their main points and recommendations. 1.18 Submissions may be published on the web site of the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue, in the interests of making the information widely available. Should you object to your submission being published in this way, please clearly specify this in your submission. 5 Chapter 2 THE CURRENT APPLICATION OF LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE 2.1 The main limitation on Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers is legal professional privilege. Legal professional privilege protects from disclosure communications between a lawyer 4 and a client and also protects from disclosure other material in the context of litigation. The rationale for the privilege is to encourage lawyers and their clients to have a candid relationship and thereby promote the efficient administration of justice. The legislation 2.2 The protection from disclosure to Inland Revenue of communications between a lawyer and a client is contained in section 20 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Section 20 was originally enacted in 1958 as section 16A of the Inland Revenue Department Act 1952 in response to the Court of Appeal’s decision in CIR v West-Walker , 5 which held that the Commissioner’s information-gathering powers must be interpreted as being subject to the common law privilege applying to communications between a lawyer and a client. The purpose of section 16A was to express the West- Walker decision in statutory form, while preventing its application to trust accounts and other financial records. 2.3 Section 20 provides that any information or book or document is privileged from disclosure in the following circumstances: • if it is a confidential communication passing directly or indirectly between a legal practitioner in his or her professional capacity and a client, or between legal practitioners in their professional capacity; • if it is made for the purpose of obtaining or giving legal advice; and • if it is not made for the purpose of committing some illegal or wrongful act. 2.4 Section 20 constitutes a code for legal professional privilege to the extent that it applies to communications between a lawyer and a client. Legal professional privilege in relation to such communications applies only to the extent permitted by the section. 6 The section is silent, however, on the application of legal professional privilege to protect communications with third parties relating to litigation or information prepared by a taxpayer, lawyers or third parties for the purpose of litigation. Section 20 therefore does not operate as a complete code for legal professional privilege and tax because it does not cover these aspects of litigation privilege. 4 Here the term “lawyer” is used to mean a person who is enrolled as a barrister and solicitor of the High Court and holds a current practising certificate. 5 \[1954\] NZLR 191. 6 Section 20(4), Tax Administration Act 1994. 6 2.5 If anyone refuses to disclose information to Inland Revenue on the ground that it is privileged under section 20, an application can be made to a District Court Judge to determine whether the claim of privilege is valid. 7 The courts 2.6 The New Zealand courts have followed the approach taken in the United Kingdom and have held that privilege applies if the dominant purpose of the communication relates to the provision of legal advice: Guardian Royal Exchange v Stewart . 8 2.7 If documents are merely lodged with a lawyer for safe custody, they are not privileged from disclosure: CIR v West Walker . 9 2.8 In Leary v Federal Commissioner of Taxation , 10 a decision of the Australian Federal Court, it was held that a lawyer acting primarily in the role of a promoter of a scheme was unable to rely on legal professional privilege. Brennan J explained that: \[The\] activities of an entrepreneur in the promotion of a scheme in which taxpayers would be encouraged to participate fall outside the field of professional activities; those activities are not pursued in discharge of some antecedent professional activity. Entrepreneurial activity does not attract the same privilege nor the same protection as professional activity; and the promotion of a scheme in which particular clients may be advised to participate is pregnant with the possibility of conflict of entrepreneurial interest with professional duty. 11 2.9 In Dinsdale v CIR , 12 the High Court held that legal professional privilege does not extend to the notes of interviews conducted with a number of third parties by auditors of a bank on instruction from the bank’s solicitors. The notes were not communications between a lawyer and client, so section 20 did not apply. The Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s decision. 13 2.10 In Miller v CIR , 14 the High Court held that legal professional privilege extends to communications between salaried solicitors and their employer clients, if the solicitor is acting in his or her capacity as a legal adviser, and not in some other capacity, such as an executive capacity. The case involved discovery of legal opinions prepared by Inland Revenue solicitors. Baragwanath J applied the main Commonwealth precedent of Alfred Crompton v Customs and Excise Commissioners (No 2) . 15 7 Section 20(5), Tax Administration Act 1994. 8 \[1985\] 1 NZLR 596. 9 \[1954\] NZLR 191. 10 (1980) 80 ATC 4438. 11 (1980) 80 ATC 4438 at 4452. 12 (1997) 18 NZTC 13,244. 13 (1998) 18 NZTC 13,583. 14 (1997) 18 NZTC 13,001. 15 \[1972\] 2 QB 102. 7 2.11 It is also well established that no privilege exists against self-incrimination in relation to the Commissioner’s information-gathering powers: Commissioners of Customs and Excise v Ingram; 16 Singh v CIR. 17 Lord Goddard CJ stated in the former case that such privilege would “stultify the whole purpose” of the revenue’s information-gathering powers. Disadvantages of current system 2.12 The current privilege system has been identified as causing difficulties in the administration of the tax system. In particular, it allows factual information contained in legal advice given on transactions not to be disclosed to Inland Revenue, making the enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts more difficult. This situation is inconsistent with the basic principle that Inland Revenue should have access to all factual information that is available. 2.13 In its evidence to the Davison Commission, 18 Inland Revenue gave several examples of how its legitimate investigations have been hindered by privilege claims. They include: • claiming privilege for materials held on a solicitor’s file but clearly not involving matters of legal advisory nature; • taking a restrictive interpretation of the word “control” over information held by a corporation’s solicitors, when faced with a wide- ranging Inland Revenue information request; • removing documents from files made available for inspection and not informing the department that legal professional privilege has been claimed; • mixing (or not separating) transaction documents with legal advisory papers, and claiming a blanket privilege for all documents; • including transaction details in the document containing legal advice to hide them from the department; and • preventing access to offices where important records may be retained without giving sufficient notice that a claim of legal professional privilege can be made. 2.14 Voluntary compliance with the tax system could suffer if there is a perception that some taxpayers are able to use the current privilege system to conceal details of their true income, and therefore avoid or evade payment of tax. A reduction in voluntary compliance increases the tax burden for those taxpayers who continue to comply with the law. 16 \[1948\] 1 ALL ER 927. 17 (1996) 17 NZTC 12,471. 18 Commission of Inquiry into Certain Matters Relating to Taxation, Report of the Winebox Enquiry , August 1997, pp3:1:62-3:1:63. 8 2.15 Another disadvantage of the current privilege system is that it provides lawyers with a competitive advantage over other tax advisers. Privilege may be claimed for tax advice from a lawyer when advice of exactly the same nature provided by a chartered accountant is not privileged. Support for change 2.16 In recent years, a number of reports relating to the application of privilege in tax have commented on the need to reconsider legal professional privilege as it applies to tax. 2.17 In 1994, the Inland Revenue Organisational Review Committee considered the issue of legal professional privilege. It stated that it might be appropriate to reconsider legal professional privilege generally in relation to tax matters, noting a growing trend in litigation to place “all cards on the table”. 19 2.18 In 1997, the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Matters Relating to Taxation concluded that legal professional privilege in tax matters should be abolished. 20 The Commission had itself experienced considerable difficulties with privilege claims during the course of its investigations. 2.19 In 1998, the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance expressed concern at the Commissioner’s legitimate investigations being hindered by dubious claims for legal professional privilege. 21 The Committee did not make any final recommendation on the scope of the existing legal professional privilege rule applying in tax matters because it preferred the government to refer to the more detailed work on this issue which was being undertaken at the same time by the Law Commission. 2.20 In October 2000, the majority of the Law Commission recommended that legal professional privilege, other than litigation privilege, should not apply in tax matters. 22 One of the Law Commissioners, Paul Heath QC, did not agree with this majority recommendation of the Law Commission. 19 Organisational Review Committee, Report on the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department , April 1994, para 9.52. 20 Commission of Inquiry into Certain Matters Relating to Taxation, Report of the Winebox Enquiry , August 1997. 21 Tax Compliance: Report to the Treasurer and Minister of Revenue by a Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance , paras 9.36-9.63, December 1998. 22 Tax and Privilege – Legal Professional Privilege and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s Powers to Obtain Information , Report 67, October 2000. 9 Chapter 3 A NEW STRUCTURE FOR TAX AND PRIVILEGE 3.1 The government proposes a new and complete code for tax and privilege to replace the current legal professional privilege contained in section 20 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 23 The new privilege structure should reduce the difficulties in tax administration caused by the current legal professional privilege by improving Inland Revenue’s access to factual information. At the same time, the new privilege structure should promote the efficient conduct of compliance with the tax laws by allowing tax practitioners to have a candid relationship with their clients. 3.2 Clearly, comprehensive language would have to be used to ensure that the new section 20 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 covered the field of tax and privilege and, therefore, operated as a code. Such wording could be along the following lines: “Despite the Evidence Code or any rule of law and except as provided in this section, no information or document is privileged from disclosure for the purposes of \[the Commissioner’s statutory information-gathering powers\].” 3.3 The new and complete code for privilege and tax would consist of two parts: • a new privilege for opinion on tax law; and • the existing litigation privilege based on definitions in the new Evidence Code 24 and with certain procedural rules. Opinion on tax law 3.4 The government proposes to enact a new privilege for opinion on tax law. This new privilege should promote the efficient conduct of compliance with the law by allowing tax practitioners who give opinions on tax law to have a candid relationship with their clients. 3.5 The proposed privilege is consistent with the basic principle that Inland Revenue should have access to all factual information that is available. There is an important distinction between the facts of a transaction and an adviser’s opinion on how the tax law applies to those transactions. It is essential that Inland Revenue has the ability to obtain all the facts so it can fulfil its function of ensuring that the correct amount of tax is paid by all taxpayers. 23 As noted earlier, existing section 20 does not operate as a complete code for privilege and tax because it does not cover certain aspects of litigation privilege, in particular, communications between a taxpayer, or the taxpayer’s lawyer, and third parties and information prepared by a taxpayer, lawyers or third parties for the purpose of litigation. Existing section 20 refers only to communications between taxpayers and their lawyers (or communications between lawyers) and section 20(4) does not prevent these other types of litigation privilege applying. 24 Scheduled to be introduced in 2002. 10 For Inland Revenue to come to a view as to how the tax law applies to the particular facts of a taxpayer it is not necessary for it to know an adviser’s view of how the law applies to their client’s facts. Main features of the proposed structure 3.6 The new privilege for opinion on tax law would work in the following way: • The privilege would apply only to opinion on tax law given at any time (whether before or after the filing of a tax return in respect of a tax period) by members of approved professional bodies. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue would be responsible for approving a professional body. The criteria for approval would be whether the body had strong disciplinary procedures and a code of professional ethics. The main examples of such bodies would be the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand 25 and the New Zealand Law Society. By restricting the privilege to members of professional bodies subject to strong disciplinary and ethical measures, there is a greater likelihood of excluding persons who would abuse the privilege (despite the procedural protections). • The privilege would apply only to opinions on tax law given by members of approved professional bodies in their professional capacity. For example, an opinion on tax law given by a director of a company who was also a chartered accountant would not be privileged if it was given by that person in his or her capacity as a company director rather than a chartered accountant. This requirement reflects the existing condition in section 20(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. • The privilege would apply only if claimed by the taxpayer and would apply only in respect of identified documents and information. • If a document included both opinion on tax law and other information, the whole document would be required to be provided with any proper deletions of the material consisting solely of opinion on tax law being clearly identified in the document. 26 The balance of any document consisting of material that was not opinion on tax law would be treated as not being privileged. (It is only opinion on tax law that is proposed to be privileged from disclosure, not opinions generally. For example, the opinions of valuers would not be privileged from disclosure.) • The new privilege would apply to opinion on tax law in any form, including opinions in an electronic format. • If Inland Revenue disputed the validity of a privilege claim, the privilege would not apply unless the claimant applied within one month for a determination by a District Court Judge of what part, if any, was privileged because it is opinion on tax law. (This would require the taxpayer to provide the whole document to the court for review.) 25 It is also proposed to allow privilege to apply to opinions on tax law prepared by persons enrolled as barristers and solicitors of the High Court who are employees of chartered accountants. 26 This procedure would be similar to that applying to Official Information Act requests. 11 • The privilege would not apply to any information or document made or brought into existence for the purpose of committing an illegal or wrongful act. This is a justifiable continuation of the exception contained in existing section 20(1)(c). (This illegality exception is also a feature of other existing privileges and is included in the new Evidence Code.) 3.7 The requirement to particularise the documents or information in respect of which privilege is claimed should preclude the alleged practice referred to in Inland Revenue’s evidence to the Davison Commission of documents being removed from files made available to it for inspection without it being informed that privilege was being claimed for them. The proposed identification requirement is also consistent with the present procedural requirements when privilege is claimed as part of the discovery process in civil litigation proceedings. These procedural rules require parties claiming privilege to identify the documents and state the grounds for privilege by affidavit. 27 3.8 The new privilege for opinion on tax law would be a separate privilege from the existing legal professional privilege and would be akin to the separate privilege that currently exists for medical practitioners, informers, and ministers of religion. Only the litigation privilege part of the current legal professional privilege would continue to apply in tax. Lawyers, of course, would be entitled to the new privilege for opinion given on tax law. 3.9 It would not seem to be necessary in the case of the new privilege for opinion on tax law to reproduce the existing exceptions in section 20(2) and (3) for information on trust accounts and investment receipts because such information, by its very nature, would not qualify as opinion on tax law. Disputing a privilege claim 3.10 If Inland Revenue disputed the validity of a privilege claim it would issue a formal written notice to the claimant so that the claimant was fully informed of the consequences of not initiating court proceedings. 3.11 The reason for placing the onus on the privilege claimant to apply for a judicial determination of the validity of a privilege claim if Inland Revenue disputes the claim, is that the department must administer the tax laws for all taxpayers, whereas taxpayers’ responsibilities are limited to their own tax affairs. Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers could be unduly impeded if it had to initiate all court proceedings testing the validity of privilege claims, resulting in the department being unable to fulfil its function of ensuring that all taxpayers pay the correct amount of tax. Placing the obligation on privilege claimants to initiate court proceedings should also deter invalid privilege claims being made. 27 The Law Commission in its Tax and Privilege report noted that without such a requirement to identify the documents for which privilege is claimed “it is too easy to cheat”. 12 Relationship with penalties 3.12 It would not be possible for a person to rely on privileged material as a defence in relation to the application of penalties. Someone who wanted to rely on privileged material to support the non-application of penalties would have to waive privilege and disclose the material. Practical implications for professional bodies 3.13 The main beneficiaries of the new privilege for opinion on tax law would be chartered accountants working in tax, given that none of their work currently enjoys privilege from disclosure. In the case of lawyers working in tax, there would be fewer communications between lawyers and their clients that would be privileged than in the current privilege situation, under which most communications may be privileged from disclosure (with some limited exceptions such as information on trust accounts). At present, facts about a transaction that are referred to in communications between a lawyer and a client may be privileged from disclosure. Under the proposed new tax and privilege structure, no facts contained in communications between a lawyer and a client, including facts referred to in a lawyer’s advice given on a transaction, will be privileged outside litigation. 3.14 The proposed privilege for opinion on tax law would enact aspects of the Inland Revenue’s current position on access to audit workpapers (including associated management letters) and other workpapers prepared by accountants, which is set out in policy statements published in 1991 and 1993. Legislation would obviously give greater certainty than that afforded by these policy statements, so would better promote the efficient conduct of compliance with the tax laws. The principles underlying the policy statements would remain extant and, in particular, these principles would continue to provide guidance on Inland Revenue’s approach to management letters associated with audit workpapers. 3.15 Inland Revenue would apply the principles and procedures contained in the 1993 statement entitled Commissioner’s policy on access to advice and other workpapers prepared by accountants to material not covered by the new privilege structure that is prepared by members of approved professional bodies, including the New Zealand Law Society. 3.16 Inland Revenue would incorporate the principles in the 1991 and 1993 policy statements into the department’s general guidelines for applying its information-gathering powers in due course. 28 28 This incorporation would not include paragraph 5.2 of the 1993 policy statement, relating to the factual content of advice workpapers, because it is considered to be inconsistent with the basic principle that Inland Revenue should have access to all factual information that is available. 13 Litigation privilege 3.17 The existing litigation privilege would continue to apply in tax. It is generally recognised that litigation privilege promotes the efficient conduct of litigation by allowing litigants to give a candid account of their position with a lawyer without the risk of disclosure. 3.18 The definitions contained in the new Evidence Code would be used for determining the boundary between what is covered by litigation privilege and what is not. 29 The two main tests for determining this boundary are: • the document must have come into existence when litigation is in progress or is reasonably apprehended; and • the dominant purpose of the document’s preparation must be to enable the conduct of litigation. 3.19 It is envisaged that tax litigation would generally be reasonably apprehended when a person commenced to use the challenge procedures in Part VIIIA of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3.20 It would not seem to be necessary to enact the existing exceptions contained in section 20(2) and (3) for information on trust accounts and investment receipts because such information should not come within the ambit of the statutory definition of litigation privilege in the first place. 3.21 It is worth noting that the examples given by Inland Revenue to the Davison Commission of investigations allegedly being hindered by privilege claims did not seem to involve the litigation aspects of legal professional privilege. (Instead, they mainly involved legal advice given on the tax consequences of transactions.) Procedural requirements 3.22 Certain procedural requirements would also apply to litigation privilege claims. The identification of documents or information for which privilege was being claimed would be a condition of obtaining privilege. If Inland Revenue disputed the validity of a privilege claim (by issuing a formal written notice), the privilege would not apply unless the claimant applied within one month for a determination by a District Court Judge of the claim’s 29 The main sections relied on in the Evidence Code are sections 55 and 57. Section 57 is specifically directed at litigation privilege and provides that a person who is a party to, or contemplates on reasonable grounds becoming a party to, a proceeding has a privilege in respect of particular communications and information if the dominant purpose of making or receiving the communication or preparing the information was to prepare for the proceeding. (This definition of litigation privilege is based on tests formulated by the Court of Appeal in Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance of New Zealand Ltd v Stuart \[1985\] 1 NZLR 596.) However, section 57 caters only for communications between a party/lawyer and third parties or information prepared by the party/lawyer/third party. It does not cover communications between a party and its lawyer for the purpose of litigation because such communications are already privileged under the separate lawyer-client privilege in section 55. Therefore, for the purpose of a new section 20 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, it would be necessary to enact a form of section 57 but include lawyer-client communications relating to litigation within such a provision. 14 validity. (This would require the taxpayer to provide the document or information to the Court for review.) 3.23 A specific exclusion from litigation privilege should apply in the case of any information or document made or brought into existence for the purpose of an illegal or wrongful act. This would reflect the existing exclusion in section 20(1)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Review Authority proceedings 3.24 The litigation privilege in the new section 20 should be extended beyond lawyers to communications and material involving members of professional bodies approved by Inland Revenue who are engaged in Taxation Review Authority (TRA) proceedings. 30 This extension is in line with the application of the proposed new privilege for opinion on tax law. The criteria for approval by Inland Revenue would, similarly, be whether the body had strong disciplinary procedures and a code of professional ethics. The main example of such a body would be the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand. 3.25 This extension to TRA proceedings is based on a Law Commission recommendation, although its application is narrower as the Law Commission had suggested that litigation privilege should apply in relation to any non-lawyer advocate engaged in TRA proceedings. The restriction to members of approved professional bodies subject to strong disciplinary and ethical measures would strengthen the likelihood of excluding persons who would abuse the privilege (despite the procedural protections). Physical protection of documents 3.26 It would also be desirable in relation to the new code for tax and privilege to have procedures that Inland Revenue could invoke on a discretionary basis to ensure the physical protection of documents for which privilege is claimed, pending judicial determination of the claim’s validity. Such procedural rules would include requiring the relevant documents to be placed in a package which is sealed and delivered to the nearest District Court Registrar for safe custody. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance in 1998 recommended the enactment of protective procedures along these lines. A precedent for such protective procedures is contained in section 232 of the Canadian Income Tax Act. 30 Under section 16(3)(a) of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994, persons other than barristers and solicitors have a right of audience in proceedings before a Taxation Review Authority. 15 3.27 Inland Revenue would invoke these procedures only in rare cases where it considered there was a risk of abusive practices such as documents being removed, destroyed or tampered with. These procedural rules could apply in relation to either the new privilege for opinion on tax law or litigation privilege. 3.28 The procedures would be consistent with provisions in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will allow Inland Revenue to remove documents for copying. Those provisions were also recommended by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance. Application of new privilege structure to Inland Revenue 3.29 The new structure for tax and privilege would also apply in relation to material prepared or collected by Inland Revenue. This would not mean that information not covered by the new tax and privilege structure could not be withheld under other grounds. For example, the identity of informants would remain confidential. Privilege for opinion on tax law does not apply to the document Privilege for opinion on tax law claimed for a document Has IRD been advised of the existence of the document? Has IRD been provided with a copy of the document with the opinion material deleted? Has IRD disputed the validity of the privilege claim? Has the privilege claimant applied within one month to a District Court Judge for a determination of the claim's validity?

Under present law, Australian shareholders in a New Zealand company operating in Australia are unable to access Australian franking credits. The same problem applies in reverse to New Zealand shareholders in Australian companies operating in New Zealand. In effect, both groups of shareholders are taxed twice on their income. We have agreed that the examination of triangular taxation is a worthwhile step in addressing possible barriers to trans-Tasman investment. This is a problem that obviously requires a bilateral solution – one that preserves the tax bases of both countries and is acceptable to government and business in both countries. To that end, we instructed officials in both countries to develop a workable model that allocates both franking and imputation credits to shareholders in proportion to their shareholding of the company. The mechanism is known as pro rata allocation. As the next step in the evaluation of the model, before deciding whether to implement it or not, we seek the views of businesses, their tax advisers and other interested parties on its operation. The two governments will use this information in assessing the costs and benefits of implementing the proposed model.

This discussion document outlines a proposed mechanism for reducing the current double taxation imposed by Australia and New Zealand on dividends received through triangular investment. 1.2 To illustrate the underlying concepts simply, chapters 1 and 2 have the Australian or New Zealand company itself making the investment in the other country. Although this occurs with branch investment, investment through a subsidiary is just as likely. Chapter 3 and subsequent chapters discuss triangular investment through subsidiary companies as part of the mechanism for providing relief. Triangular investment illustrated 1.3 Australian and New Zealand investors can invest in a company with the same residence as themselves or in a company resident elsewhere. If they invest in a company with the same residence, the home country imposes only one layer of taxation on income earned in its jurisdiction. When income is distributed to shareholders through dividends, tax paid in the home country is passed on to them through imputation credits. 1 1.4 Trans-Tasman “triangular investment” arises when Australian or New Zealand investors invest in their own country through a company with residence in the other jurisdiction. For example, an Australian investor invests in a New Zealand company that invests in Australia, as illustrated in figure 1. The term “triangular investment” similarly applies to a New Zealand investor investing in an Australian company that invests in New Zealand. 1.5 The New Zealand company in figure 1 attaches imputation credits to dividends for New Zealand tax paid. Australia does not recognise foreign imputation credits or dividends from non-resident companies as being eligible for Australian imputation credits, even though those dividends may have been paid out of profits which Australia has taxed at source. Australia imposes full source country taxation on income earned by the Australian branch. It taxes its investors once when the income is earned at the company level and again when the income is distributed to the investor by way of dividend. Therefore when the New Zealand company pays out the 1 For the purposes of chapters 1 to 3, the term “imputation credit” is intended to include franking credits attached to a dividend for purposes of Australian income tax law, as well as imputation credits attached to a dividend for the purposes of New Zealand income tax law. From chapter 4 on Australian imputation credits are referred to as “franking credits”. 2 Australian source income as a dividend to the Australian investor, it cannot attach an Australian imputation credit. The lack of an Australian imputation credit means that the Australian investor will be effectively taxed twice on the Australian source income. F IGURE 1: T RIANGULAR INVESTMENT 1.6 This is known as “triangular taxation”, although the term equally applies to the double taxation imposed by New Zealand on the New Zealand source income derived by an Australian company with New Zealand shareholders. 1.7 The taxation of trans-Tasman triangular investment is a consequence of Australia and New Zealand’s policy of allowing only: 2 • tax paid in their country to generate imputation credits; and • resident companies to pass on imputation credits to their shareholders. 1.8 In the 1980s, when imputation rules were implemented by both Australia and New Zealand, these policies did not cause concern as Australians primarily invested into Australian companies and New Zealanders primarily invested into New Zealand companies. Since then, with the development of globalisation generally and Closer Economic Relations (CER) in particular, there has been a greater level of cross-investment between the two countries. This increased level of trans-Tasman cross-investment highlights the issue of triangular taxation, that Australia and New Zealand are respectively imposing two layers of tax upon the same underlying income. 2 Australia and New Zealand’s current imputation models are not alone in this feature. It is common international practice. Australia has, however, proposed to allow franking credits for certain foreign dividend withholding tax from 1 July 2002. Australia New Zealand Australian investor Australian branch New Zealand company Effective investment Capital flows Capital flows 3 1.9 Triangular taxation may arise between any two countries with imputation rules similar to those of Australia and New Zealand. However, owing to the special relationship embodied in CER, Australia and New Zealand are only concerned with examining the double taxation that arises on trans-Tasman triangular investment. Benefits of reform of taxation of trans-Tasman triangular investment 1.10 Triangular tax relief would preserve Australia and New Zealand’s source taxation, while reducing the extra layer of tax faced by their residents when taxed on their worldwide income. This is consistent with both countries’ imputation systems, which are intended to tax resident investors only once on income earned in their home countries. 1.11 The issue of triangular taxation relief can also be considered from the perspective of the wider CER dynamic. Since the inception of CER, in 1983, the strategic underpinning of the economic relationship has been the closer alignment of the Australian and New Zealand economies. 1.12 Although the CER agreement is now a mature one, and significant inroads have been made towards creating a single market, the process is not yet complete. The capital market remains the least aligned part of the trans- Tasman market, and taxation disincentives may be impeding the flow of capital across the Tasman. 1.13 Both governments are committed to the removal of impediments to trans- Tasman business where possible, and addressing the problem of triangular taxation could be a significant step towards improving the ease of trans- Tasman capital flows. 1.14 Triangular tax reform would provide relief to Australian and New Zealand investors from the residence taxation imposed on income that has already been taxed at source by their home governments. Australian and New Zealand governments’ approach to triangular reform 1.15 Although the need to address possible barriers to trans-Tasman investment is an important consideration, reform must also consider the need to maintain the integrity of the respective tax bases. This is a key design objective. 1.16 It is important, therefore, that any triangular relief achieves a balance between the objectives of relieving disincentives to triangular investment and preserving the integrity of the Australian and New Zealand tax bases in a way that is acceptable to both business and the two governments. 4 Steps to trans-Tasman triangular reform 1.17 The possible reform of trans-Tasman triangular taxation was noted in Australia’s Ralph Report: 3 “The Australian Government propose to the New Zealand Government that discussions be held with a view to introducing a mechanism to allow franking credits to flow through trans-Tasman companies on a pro-rata basis to Australian and New Zealand investors.” 1.18 On 29 August 2000, the Australian Treasurer, Mr Peter Costello, and the New Zealand Minister of Finance, Dr Michael Cullen, issued a joint press statement advising that they had requested officials to develop a workable solution to the triangular issue and assess the costs and benefits of applying such a solution. 1.19 On 20 June 2001, Dr Cullen announced that Mr Costello and he had agreed that the mechanism should be one that allocates both franking and imputation credits to shareholders in proportion to their shareholding of the company. It would involve a mechanism known as pro rata allocation. As a further step in the process, a discussion document would be published to assist consultation. 1.20 This resulting discussion document outlines the preferred approach that the two governments will ultimately consider in deciding whether or not to reform the treatment of trans-Tasman triangular taxation. It also discusses other approaches to the provision of triangular relief and explains why both governments have decided not to pursue these other approaches. Application date 1.21 It is proposed that triangular reform would apply no earlier than the New Zealand imputation year beginning 1 April 2003. Triangular reform would apply to companies from a particular day. For example, franking credits would arise in respect of franked dividends, or dividend withholding tax paid on unfranked dividends, paid on or after the start date. 3 A Tax System Redesigned, July 1999, at page 633. 5 T ABLE 1: S UMMARY OF PROPOSED REFORM • Trans-Tasman investors would receive both an Australian and a New Zealand imputation credit for tax paid in both countries. Each country’s imputation credits would continue to be redeemable only to resident shareholders. • A mechanism that allocates both Australian and New Zealand imputation credits in proportion to the shareholder’s ownership of the company is the preferred method. This method is known as “pro rata allocation”. • Australian companies would generally be entitled to maintain imputation credit accounts, and New Zealand companies would generally be entitled to maintain franking accounts. This would be subject to Australian companies fully complying with New Zealand law governing imputation credit accounts and New Zealand companies fully complying with Australian law governing franking accounts. • Australia and New Zealand group structures, regardless of the percentage ownership, would generally be entitled to pass through both credits.

Distinction between direct and triangular investment into Australia and New Zealand 2.2 Imputation systems are designed to impose only one layer of tax on resident companies’ income earned in their home jurisdiction and distributed to resident shareholders. The rationale is that because the resident company is merely an intermediary for its shareholders, taxation should be on the basis of economic equivalence rather than legal identity, to eliminate distortions in investment behaviour. The equivalent in economic terms is that resident individuals investing in their home jurisdiction would face only one level of taxation by their government. Without a system of imputation, the equivalent investment in economic substance would face taxation at the company level when the income was earned, and then again when it was distributed to shareholders. 2.3 Both countries’ imputation systems, however, mirror the taxation of an economically equivalent investment only when residents make investments directly through a resident intermediary company rather than indirectly, and possibly incidentally, through a company resident in the other jurisdiction. Indirect or “triangular” investment by residents in their home country through a company resident in the other jurisdiction is taxed on the basis of legal identity rather than economic equivalence. 2.4 The outcome is illustrated by the calculations set out in tables 2 and 3. Table 2 shows the difference in tax treatment for an Australian resident, at the top marginal tax rate of 48.5%, investing in Australia through an Australian company or indirectly through a New Zealand company. It is only when Australian investment is made through an Australian company that the income is taxed at the investor’s marginal rate. 2.5 Table 3 shows the difference in tax treatment for a New Zealand resident, at the top marginal tax rate of 39%, investing in New Zealand through a New Zealand or Australian company. As shown in the table, it is only when New Zealand investment is made through a New Zealand company that the income is taxed at the investor’s marginal rate. 7 T ABLE 2: T AX TREATMENT OF AN A USTRALIAN RESIDENT INVESTING IN A USTRALIA THROUGH AN A USTRALIAN OR A N EW Z EALAND COMPANY Australian company New Zealand company 4 Income earned in Australia100100 Tax paid in Australia3030 Tax paid in New Zealand3 5 Australian income after tax7067 Less New Zealand NRWT 6 (10) Cash dividend to shareholder7057 Imputation credit 7 30 Foreign tax credit10 Assessable income10067 Tax on assessable income48.5032 Less franking rebate(30) Less foreign tax credit(10) Tax payable18.5022 Net dividend received51.5035 Effective tax rate48.5%65% 2.6 Trans-Tasman companies may sometimes overcome such distortions by transferring investments in the other jurisdiction 8 into a separate structure and seeking shareholders from that country. Although shareholding would be open to all investors, the benefit of being able to offer imputation credits to residents of the other country is a key marketing advantage. In practice, such structuring is an option only for large companies with significant operations in both countries, as it involves significant implementation costs. 2.7 The proposed reform will diminish the incentive to restructure by allowing trans-Tasman companies to attach Australian imputation credits if source taxation has been paid in Australia, and New Zealand imputation credits if source taxation has been paid in New Zealand. 4 This table assumes that no New Zealand imputation credits have been attached and thus New Zealand’s foreign investor tax credit rules do not apply.

In particular, it considers the scope of reform, introduces the proposed relief mechanism and discusses alternative approaches not being pursued. Scope of reform 3.3 To make the underlying concepts and distortions clear, chapters 1 and 2 discussed triangular tax in very simple terms. The examples used have the intermediary company itself making the investment in the other country. This happens, however, only when investment takes place through a branch structure or some other direct investment 12 by the ultimate parent company rather than through a holding company. 3.4 Although investment through a branch, or some other form of direct investment, in the other jurisdiction by the ultimate parent company would receive relief from triangular taxation, it would not be restricted to such forms of investment. 12 Investment that generates interest, dividends or royalties on which tax is deducted by the other jurisdiction. This is discussed further under “Creditable taxes” in chapter 4. 10 Ownership through wholly owned groups 3.5 Although triangular relief would apply to branch investment, it would also cater for structures involving an ultimate parent and subsidiary holding companies that are resident in the other country. Figure 2 shows a sample structure having an Australian company as the ultimate parent company. 3.6 Although the New Zealand shareholders of the Australian ultimate parent company in figure 2 will own a proportion of its capital, the Australian parent company itself does not directly invest or pay tax in New Zealand. As the companies in the group form one economic unit, triangular tax reform must be wide enough to cater for such commonly used ownership structures. Ownership through interposed companies 3.7 In some cases, as a result of takeover and merger activity, the trans-Tasman chain of companies is not as “clean” as the one shown in figure 2. For instance, an Australian company may be owned by a New Zealand company that in turn is owned by an Australian company. This sort of structure is illustrated in figure 3. Because it is still an Australia/New Zealand group of companies, such a structure should not preclude triangular tax relief. Australian ultimate parent Australian holding company Australian operating company New Zealand holding company New Zealand operating company F IGURE 2: E XAMPLE OF POSSIBLE TRANS -T ASMAN OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE 11 Australian ultimate parent New Zealand holding company Australian operating company New Zealand holding company Australian operating company F IGURE 3: E XAMPLE OF OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE WITH INTERPOSED COMPANIES F IGURE 4: E XAMPLE OF NON - WHOLLY OWNED GROUP STRUCTURE Australian ultimate parent Australian holding company Australian operating company New Zealand holding company New Zealand operating company 50% Third party 50% 12 Ownership through non-wholly owned groups 3.8 It is not uncommon for companies further down the corporate chain to engage in joint venture activity with investors other than the ones holding shares in the ultimate parent. The result is a chain of companies that do not have a 100 percent common ownership, as in figure 4. 3.9 Although the shareholders of the Australian ultimate parent company in figure 4 have full rights to the Australian income, they have rights only to 50 percent of the income from the New Zealand operating company. The question, therefore, is whether triangular relief should be restricted to wholly owned chains, as is the case for both countries’ grouping rules, or whether chains that are not wholly owned are acceptable. It appears that the avoidance concerns that provide the rationale for the 100 percent restriction for New Zealand’s consolidation and grouping rules do not apply to triangular investment. It also appears that the rationale for the 100 percent restriction in Australia’s proposed consolidation rules similarly does not apply to triangular investment. Relief could, therefore, be allowed for chains that are not wholly owned. Ownership through chains involving third countries Australian ultimate parent Australian holding company 3 rd country holding company New Zealand holding company New Zealand operating company F IGURE 5: E XAMPLE OF OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE INVOLVING A THIRD COUNTRY 13 3.10 Consideration has also been given to chains of companies in which a holding company from a third country is interposed between Australian and New Zealand companies, as shown in figure 5. As neither government has jurisdiction over a third country holding company, triangular tax relief should not extend to such structures. It is proposed, therefore, to restrict triangular reform to chains of ownership consisting of Australian and New Zealand entities only. Proposed relief mechanism – “pro rata allocation” 3.11 The proposed mechanism for providing triangular tax relief is one known as “pro rata allocation”. It is the preferred approach for both governments as it is the only method of those considered that apportions the tax benefits on the basis of the shareholders’ ownership, which is consistent with both countries’ current policy on imputation. Shareholders have the right to a proportion of the total income of a company rather than to a specific income source derived by the company. It seems appropriate, therefore, that the credit allocation rules continue to require a company paying a dividend to attach the same proportion of each type of credit to each dividend that it pays. This also ensures that the total Australian or New Zealand tax rate imposed on shareholders is consistent with their proportionate share of each source of income derived by the company. 3.12 Relief from triangular tax that is based on a pro rata allocation of imputation credits would see dividends paid by an Australian or New Zealand company have both an Australian and a New Zealand imputation credit attached. Subject to the respective countries’ rules on the maximum allocation of credits (maximum ratio), the imputation credits would be allocated to shareholders in proportion to their shareholding in the company. 3.13 Take, for example, a company of which Australians owned 65 percent, New Zealanders 25 percent and other shareholders 10 percent. Subject to the maximum ratio, Australian shareholders could receive up to 65 percent of the Australian tax paid as an Australian imputation credit and 65 percent of the New Zealand tax paid as a New Zealand imputation credit. In this case only the Australian imputation credit would have any value to the Australian shareholder, as the New Zealand imputation credit could not be used. 3.14 The mechanism would work as follows: • Australia would generally allow New Zealand resident companies to maintain franking accounts, and New Zealand would generally allow Australian resident companies to maintain imputation credit accounts. • Companies would be able to elect into the triangular rules to pass on the other country’s imputation credit. 14 • For Australian companies, dividends would continue to be exempt from dividend withholding tax to the extent they are franked, but the dividend withholding tax deducted from unfranked dividends would be creditable to the New Zealand company’s franking account. • For New Zealand companies, the foreign investor tax credit rules would continue to apply, but both the imputation credit attached to the dividend and the non-resident withholding tax deducted from the dividend would be creditable to the Australian company’s imputation credit account. • Australian shareholders in receipt of a New Zealand dividend with Australian imputation credits might have their franking rebate reduced by the amount of any supplementary dividend paid, but other options that give an equivalent result might be considered as well. 13 3.15 The operation of the pro rata allocation mechanism would require Australian companies with an imputation credit account to comply with the New Zealand law governing its maintenance, as New Zealand companies currently do. Conversely, it would require New Zealand companies with a franking account to comply with the Australian law governing its maintenance, as Australian companies currently do. Alternative approaches 3.16 There are three alternatives to the provision of triangular tax relief which both governments have considered but do not wish to pursue: • mutual recognition, including pro rata revenue sharing; • streaming; and • apportionment. Mutual recognition including pro rata revenue sharing 3.17 Mutual recognition would involve either providing imputation credits for company taxes paid in another country, or extending the full benefits of imputation to residents of another country on a reciprocal basis. Compensation might also be paid to the country that recognised the imputation credit from the country that received the tax. This is known as pro rata revenue sharing. 3.18 If compensation were paid, relief would be provided by the source country; otherwise the cost of the imputation credits would be borne by the residence country. Either way, the recognition could apply to all taxpayers or it could be limited to natural persons. 13 This issue is discussed further in paragraph 4.21. 15 3.19 Mutual recognition would involve the Australian government recognising a New Zealand imputation credit attached to a dividend that was distributed to an Australian resident shareholder, and vice versa. In this case, the imputation credit would be generated through the payment of New Zealand company tax, but could be used as a rebate against the Australian individual’s tax liability. The Australian government, as the residence country, would bear the cost of recognition. 3.20 For the shareholders themselves, pro rata revenue sharing would be equivalent to the extension of the full benefits of imputation to residents of another country on a reciprocal basis. For individual shareholders, this method would see each country recognising the other country’s imputation credits as if they were its own, but in turn receiving compensation from the other government. The compensation would be netted out and the government that had recognised the greater amount would receive a payment from the other for the difference. For example, if the Australian government had recognised $20 million in New Zealand imputation credits and the New Zealand government had recognised $15 million in Australian imputation credits, the latter would pay the Australian government $5 million. 3.21 The effect of pro rata revenue sharing is equivalent to each government’s company tax being treated as a withholding tax on behalf of the other. Both countries would preserve full residence taxation while giving up some source taxation. The mechanism would be similar to that already in place for social welfare. 3.22 Mutual recognition in whatever form, however, raises complex issues involving a possible substantial revenue impact, avoidance opportunities, international tax treaty obligations and national economic welfare. Mutual recognition would involve a loss of tax revenue from each government to its resident shareholders in respect of company tax paid to the other government. Alternatively, in the case of pro rata revenue sharing, there would be a loss of tax revenue from each country to the other country’s resident shareholders in respect of company tax paid in its own country. 3.23 In theory, mutual recognition could offer potential efficiency gains and, as a result, generate revenue gains that could offset the initial revenue costs. The net revenue effects are, however, uncertain and could be substantially negative. 3.24 Mutual recognition also exceeds what is required to achieve triangular reform because shareholders in either country would receive imputation credits, regardless of whether tax was paid in their respective home countries. Neither government is willing, therefore, to pursue mutual recognition further at this stage. 16 Streaming 3.25 Streaming would see all tax paid in Australia being available to provide imputation credits solely to Australian shareholders, and all tax paid in New Zealand available to provide imputation credits solely to New Zealand shareholders. Such a model is contrary to Australia’s and New Zealand’s imputation rules as it provides tax benefits to shareholders disproportionate to their shareholdings. 3.26 A streaming model, however, would address some of the concerns of pro rata revenue sharing, as tax would have to be paid in the home country of the shareholder before an imputation credit was given. Both governments, however, are concerned about the fiscal risks of such a model, given that imputation credits would be allocated only to shareholders of countries in which the tax was paid. This means that most 14 of the imputation credits allocated could be used to reduce the shareholders’ home country tax liabilities. 3.27 Another concern is that to allow streaming in this environment might also signal that streaming of credits more generally is now acceptable. Both governments wish to avoid such a result, as it is still both countries’ policy that imputation credits should not be streamed and should be allocated across all shareholders. Apportionment 3.28 Apportionment would see the tax credit attached to dividends split into Australian and New Zealand imputation credit components according to the ratio of income earned in either country and in equal proportions for all shareholders. This method is similar to pro rata allocation except that the imputation credits are allocated not only in proportion to the residence of the shareholder, but also in proportion to the country in which the income is earned. It would give the same result as pro rata allocation when a company had no previous balances of imputation credits and fully distributed all tax- paid income. 15 3.29 The source of income would become important under an apportionment approach, as each shareholder could receive Australian and New Zealand imputation credits in total only up to the maximum ratio. Thus if a company earned 50 percent of its income in Australia and 50 percent in New Zealand and paid full tax in both countries, the shareholder could at most receive 50 percent of a full Australian imputation credit and 50 percent of a full New Zealand imputation credit. If the company were resident in Australia, where it had previously been able to fully frank the dividend, it would now frank up to 50 percent and impute up to 50 percent. Alternatively, if the company 14 Charities in New Zealand, for instance, would still not be able to get benefits from the imputation credits, even under a streaming model. In Australia, however, registered charities are eligible for refunds of imputation credits following the government’s recent reforms. 15 This is because pro rating effectively allows over-crediting (compared with apportionment), which is possible only if the company has previous balances of imputation credits or does not fully distribute all tax-paid income. 17 were from New Zealand, a previously fully imputed dividend could now be imputed only up to 50 percent and franked up to 50 percent. 3.30 Such a mechanism would be advantageous to the shareholders who currently do not receive any of their country’s imputation credits, but it would disadvantage shareholders who can currently benefit from a fully franked or imputed dividend. It is also not consistent with the current imputation policy of both countries, which allows imputation credits to be allocated across all shareholders to the extent that tax has been paid, and not over sources of income. 18 Chapter 4 THE PRO RATA ALLOCATION RELIEF MECHANISM Summary of proposed pro rata allocation mechanism 16 • Australian and New Zealand companies would be able to attach both Australian franking and New Zealand imputation credits to dividends paid, to the extent that tax has been paid in both countries. Each country’s credits would continue to be redeemable only to resident shareholders. • Consistent with current imputation rules, credits would arise to the franking and imputation credit accounts, as a result of tax paid or franking or imputation credits attached to dividends received. • Credits would also arise in the other country’s tracking account when withholding taxes were deducted in the other country. Non-resident withholding tax deducted in New Zealand from an Australian company’s New Zealand income would be creditable to that company’s imputation credit account. Dividend, interest and royalty withholding taxes deducted from a New Zealand company’s Australian income would be creditable to that company’s franking account. • Australian and New Zealand group structures, regardless of the percentage of ownership, generally would be entitled to pass both credits through. • Companies maintaining the other country’s tracking account would be required to comply with that country’s law, including rules on shareholder continuity, benchmark dividend ratios and anti-streaming. • A method to minimise the impact of exchange rates on the respective imputation systems is needed. Submissions are sought on the best way to achieve this. • A recovery mechanism would be established to ensure the collection of additional tax and penalties in the event of companies in the other country defaulting. 4.1 This chapter considers the mechanics of a pro rata allocation of imputation and franking credits to provide relief to Australian and New Zealand shareholders who invest in their home country through a company resident in the other jurisdiction and receive dividends from that company. 16 This mechanism is based on Australia’s proposed simplified imputation system (SIS). Under the SIS, credits will be called “imputation credits” and companies will maintain imputation accounts. However, for consistency with current terminology when discussing the proposed operation of the pro rata mechanism, chapters 4 and 5 and the appendices refer to Australian imputation credits as “franking credits” and Australian imputation accounts as “franking accounts”, to distinguish them from New Zealand imputation credits and New Zealand imputation accounts. 19 Illustration of mechanism 4.2 Figure 6 illustrates the operation of the proposed pro rata relief mechanism. The example concerns an Australian company that has an Australian and a New Zealand shareholder, each owning 50 percent of the shares. The company earns $2,500 of Australian income and $1,500 of New Zealand income, in the same unit of currency. The effective tax rate in both countries is assumed to be 30%, and the company has a 50 percent distribution policy. F IGURE 6: E XAMPLE OF PRO RATA ALLOCATION Australian parent company 50% distribution $2,000 gross income $700 cash $300 franking credits $225 imputation credits $700 cash $300 franking credits $225 imputation credits Australian shareholder New Zealand shareholder New Zealand income $1,500 New Zealand tax $450 Australian income $2,500 Australian tax $750 20 4.3 Under the current rules, only the Australian franking credits are attached to the dividends to shareholders. Under the proposed reform, however, New Zealand imputation credits could also be attached in proportion to the shareholding. This means that a dividend could have both franking credits and imputation credits attached and could, in fact, be both fully franked and fully imputed. Although shareholders would receive imputation and franking credits, they would be able to redeem only the credits relating to their country of residence. Because the New Zealand shareholder in figure 6 owns 50 percent of the company, she can receive up to 50 percent of the tax paid, which is not enough to fully impute the dividend. Sufficient tax is paid, however, for the Australian shareholder to receive a fully franked dividend. No Australian dividend withholding tax is deducted from the dividend to the New Zealand shareholder as it has been fully franked. 4.4 Table 4 illustrates what would happen under the proposed reform to the tax payable on the dividends received by the New Zealand shareholder in figure 6. In this situation there would be no change to the position of the Australian shareholder in figure 6.

This is appropriate, as the dividend is not fully imputed, having been partially generated by Australian income with Australian, not New Zealand, tax paid. 4.6 Table 5 then illustrates what happens under the proposed reform to the tax paid by the Australian shareholder if the company in figure 6 had a New Zealand parent company instead of an Australian parent. In this situation there would be no change in the position of the New Zealand shareholder. The effective tax rate, however, is 48.5% for the Australian shareholder because the dividend is fully franked. 17 The effective tax rate is calculated on $1000 of underlying pre-tax income. 21 T ABLE 5: T HE TAX TREATMENT OF TRIANGULAR INVESTMENT BY AN A USTRALIAN INVESTOR , BEFORE AND AFTER THE REFORM Before reformAfter reform Cash dividend$700$700 Supplementary dividend 18 $81$81 Less New Zealand NRWT 19 ($117)($117) Net cash dividend$664$664 Foreign tax credit$117$117 Imputation credits Nil$219 20 Assessable income$781$1000 Tax due @ 48.5%$379$485 Foreign tax credit$117$117 Franking rebateNil$219 21 Tax payable$262$149 Net dividend$402$515 Effective tax rate 22 59.8%48.5% Details of mechanism Eligibility 4.7 Australia would allow New Zealand companies to maintain a franking account, and New Zealand would allow Australian companies to maintain an imputation credit account, although the current exclusions that apply to resident companies would also apply to companies in the other jurisdiction. 23 4.8 A New Zealand company would need to be a resident of New Zealand under the New Zealand residence rules to be able to maintain a franking account, and an Australian company would need to be a resident of Australia under the Australian residence rules to maintain an imputation credit account. 18 Although the tax rate used in the example is 30%, the supplementary dividend has been calculated at 67/187 of New Zealand imputation credit of $225 under the current rules. 19 Non-resident withholding tax levied at 15%. 20 The imputation credit of $300 has been reduced by a $81 supplementary dividend. This is discussed further in paragraph 4.21. 21 The franking rebate of $300 has been reduced by a $81 supplementary dividend. This is discussed further in paragraph 4.21. 22 The effective tax rate is calculated on $1000 of underlying pre-tax income. 23 This does not include the current exclusions on Australia/New Zealand dual-resident companies. 22 Australian corporate limited partnerships, corporate unit trusts and public trading trusts Australian tax law treats corporate limited partnerships, corporate unit trusts and public trading trusts in the same way as companies, including for imputation purposes. These entities are generally treated as Australian residents if they conduct business or hold property in Australia, even though they may be formed in a foreign country. It is not proposed to extend the scope of these rules in the context of triangular taxation because the current law essentially treats them as residents, making triangular tax relief unnecessary. For example, a corporate limited partnership formed in New Zealand that conducts business in Australia would be treated as resident in Australia. It would have a franking account, and franking credits would arise on payment of Australian income tax, so that franked distributions could be paid to an Australian partner. 4.9 The Australian treatment of companies that are dual resident companies of New Zealand and another country is still under consideration. The New Zealand treatment of dual resident companies of Australia and another country, however, would require such companies to be subject to Australian tax for the purposes of a double tax agreement in order to maintain an imputation credit account. Should Australia not have a double tax agreement with the other country, the company would not be entitled to maintain an imputation credit account. 4.10 Although it is currently mandatory for resident companies in each jurisdiction to maintain their country’s tracking account, under the proposed mechanism it would be elective for companies in the other jurisdiction. For instance, although at present it is mandatory for New Zealand companies to maintain an imputation credit account, Australian companies would be able to choose whether or not they wish to maintain one. Should Australian companies wish to maintain an imputation credit account, they would make an election to do so. An equivalent procedure would apply to New Zealand companies wishing to maintain a franking account. 4.11 For example, in order to maintain an imputation credit account and pay dividends with imputation credits attached, an Australian company would need to make an election and then notify New Zealand’s Inland Revenue Department of that election. Imputation credits would generally arise for an Australian company only if the company had made an election. As a transitional measure, however, consideration could be given to allowing retrospective elections. Elections would be revocable, but a company’s imputation credit account or franking account would be cancelled on revocation of the company’s election. 23 Australia’s exempting company rules and proposed changes An exempting company in Australia is one that is, effectively, wholly owned by non-residents or tax-exempt entities. Although exempting companies must maintain franking accounts in the same way as other companies, franked dividends paid by an exempting company generally do not provide any benefit to resident shareholders and provide only an exemption from dividend withholding tax for non-residents. If an exempting company ceases to be effectively wholly owned by non-residents or tax-exempt entities, it becomes a former exempting company . The franking account is converted to an exempting account, which quarantines the franking credits and debits relating to the period during which the company was an exempting company. A surplus or credit balance in the exempting account may be used only to pay exempted dividends . An exempted dividend will exempt non- resident shareholders from Australian dividend withholding tax, but will generally not provide franking credits to resident shareholders. The exempting company rules are designed to prevent non-resident owned companies that have accumulated large balances of franking credits, when sold to residents, giving an unwarranted benefit to the resident shareholders. The franking credits of a company under non- resident ownership are of no value to the non-resident shareholders other than as a means of exempting the dividend from dividend withholding tax. Upon sale of the company to residents, however, the franking credits would then be available to reduce the tax payable on dividends by residents, even though they were not shareholders when the franking credits were originally generated. A company is considered to be effectively wholly owned by non- residents or tax exempt entities if 95 percent or more of the shares and interests in the company that confer economic ownership are held by non-residents or tax exempt entities. A “look-through” approach is adopted to determine the effective ownership of chains of resident companies, partnerships, or trusts. Non-resident partnerships and trusts are also “looked through”. For example, if shares in a company are held in a resident trust but the trust is controlled by non-resident individuals and all the income beneficiaries are non-resident, the shares of the company will be considered to be effectively owned by those non-residents, rather than the resident trust. Non-resident companies, however, are not looked through to find the ultimate effective owners, even though the ultimate effective owners may be predominantly Australian. 24 With the proposed triangular reform, unless changes were made to the exempting company rules, an Australian resident company that is a wholly owned subsidiary of a New Zealand parent company would be an exempting company, regardless of the level of Australian shareholding in the New Zealand company. This would mean that franked dividends paid by the subsidiary company would not result in a franking credit to the franking account of the parent company. It is proposed, therefore, that the look-through approach be amended to include New Zealand companies, so that New Zealand companies as well as Australian entities and non-resident partnerships and trusts, are looked through to find the ultimate effective owners. Thus an Australian or New Zealand company would be an exempting company only if 95 percent or more of the ultimate effective ownership of the company were held by New Zealand or other shareholders not resident in Australia. Neither the New Zealand parent nor the Australian subsidiary in the previous example would be exempting companies if the New Zealand parent had Australian shareholders in excess of 5 percent. If the ultimate Australian shareholding were less than 5 percent, however, the franking credits attached by the New Zealand company would not generally provide any benefit to its Australian shareholders. Following triangular reform, if a New Zealand parent company has five percent or more ultimate Australian shareholders and an Australian subsidiary company and it migrates to Australia, the franking credits accumulated by the subsidiary company could be accessed by the shareholders in the parent company. This would not be possible under the current law because the subsidiary company would be an exempting company before the relocation of the parent company, and a former exempting company after relocation. Flow-through mechanism 4.12 Consistent with the current rules governing credits to the tracking accounts, franking and imputation credits would arise either when tax was paid or when a company received a dividend with credits attached. Thus for an ultimate parent company to be able to distribute tax paid by a lower tier company as franking or imputation credits, dividends with credits attached would need to be paid up the chain of companies. This is consistent with the current requirements of both sets of imputation rules. 25 4.13 Except when Australia’s exempting rules applied, as the credits flowed through the companies in proportion to the shareholding there would be no need for the lower tier companies that pay the tax to know the ultimate shareholding percentages. At each level the correct percentage would be passed on with the dividend, so by the time the credits reached the top company, the correct proportion of tax paid would be available to be passed on to the final shareholders. Creditable taxes 4.14 It is proposed that withholding taxes imposed by one country on non- residents, as well as income tax paid directly, be creditable to that country’s tracking account in the other jurisdiction. For example, if a royalty is paid from a New Zealand company to an Australian company, non-resident withholding tax would be deducted in New Zealand. A credit could then be made to the Australian company’s imputation credit account for the non- resident withholding tax deducted in New Zealand, since non-resident withholding tax is simply another form of New Zealand tax. The treatment is consistent with the current rules that allow the imputation credit account to have New Zealand resident withholding tax credited to it. 4.15 For Australian companies maintaining an imputation credit account, the New Zealand withholding taxes that could be credited are non-resident withholding taxes on interest, royalties and dividends and non-resident contractors withholding tax. The approved issuer levy, however, would not be creditable to an imputation credit account as it is not a liability of the non- resident. 4.16 For New Zealand companies maintaining a franking account, the Australian withholding taxes that could be credited are dividend, interest and royalty withholding taxes. Franking credits for these withholding taxes would be an extension of the current imputation system. The justification for this proposed change is that these withholding taxes, like company tax, represent an additional layer of Australian tax on Australian income received by Australian shareholders. 4.17 Australia is also proposing to give a franking credit for foreign withholding tax on dividends paid that meets certain criteria. In the case of New Zealand withholding tax, Australia may want to reduce the franking credits for the withholding tax to the extent of any attached franking credits; otherwise the franking credits attached to the dividend would be excessive. 4.18 It is also proposed to allow a credit to an Australian company’s imputation credit account for any non-resident withholding tax deducted from dividends in New Zealand. When the tax was eligible to be credited to both accounts, companies could choose into which account they wished it to be credited. A franking credit would arise in a company’s franking account only to the extent that an imputation credit did not arise in the company’s imputation credit account, and vice versa. Otherwise, the single payment of non- resident withholding tax on dividends could generate excessive tax benefits 26 through the creation of both a franking and an imputation credit for the same amount of the single payment of the tax. Creditable taxes and interface with New Zealand’s international tax rules New Zealand dividend withholding payments Dividend withholding payments made by New Zealand companies on foreign dividends received may, in effect, be passed on to the imputation credit accounts of Australian companies, depending on how they are accounted for in New Zealand. New Zealand companies that do not maintain a dividend withholding payment account currently credit such payments to the imputation credit account, and they can be passed on to shareholders as New Zealand imputation credits, rather than dividend withholding payment credits. Under the proposed reform, if one of these shareholders were an Australian company with an imputation credit account, this imputation credit would simply be credited to it. New Zealand companies that do maintain a dividend withholding payment credit account currently attach a dividend withholding payment credit to dividends paid to shareholders. Unlike an imputation credit, these credits are refundable to the extent they exceed the New Zealand tax liability of the shareholder. If the shareholder is a non- resident, the dividend withholding payment is refunded to the extent it exceeds the non-resident withholding tax due. The latter is then deemed paid. At present, an Australian company that has received a dividend with a dividend withholding payment credit attached will receive a refund from the New Zealand government to the extent it exceeds the company’s liability to non-resident withholding tax. Under the proposed reform, the non-resident withholding tax could then be credited to its imputation credit account. Foreign investor tax credit rules The foreign investor tax credit rules would continue to apply to New Zealand companies paying dividends to non-residents. New Zealand companies paying a supplementary dividend to non-residents would continue to receive a foreign investor tax credit against their company tax. 27 Non-resident shareholders receiving a New Zealand source dividend and a supplementary dividend would continue to be liable for non- resident withholding tax, which would be deducted at source by the New Zealand company. Imputation credits, reduced by the supplementary dividend, would continue to be attached to the dividend. Australian companies that had elected to maintain an imputation credit account would credit both the imputation credits attached to the dividend to the account as well as the non-resident withholding tax deducted from the original and supplementary dividend. The operation of the mechanism is illustrated in tables 9 and 10 in chapter 5. Allowable credits 4.19 Withholding tax on dividends paid in one country is generally allowed as a foreign tax credit in the other country to the extent that tax is due in the home country. Under the proposed reform, it would be possible for the ultimate shareholder to receive a dividend with full imputation credits that has also had a withholding tax deducted by the source country. 4.20 For instance, all New Zealand dividends paid to non-residents are liable to non-resident withholding tax, and unfranked Australian dividends paid to non-residents are liable for dividend withholding tax. 4.21 Under the proposed reform, both countries would continue to allow a foreign tax credit for non-resident withholding tax or dividend withholding tax deducted in the other country, even though the dividends might also have franking or imputation credits attached. Australia might, however, limit the franking rebate on New Zealand dividends when and to the extent that a supplementary dividend is also paid. 24 As the supplementary dividend reflects a reduction in the New Zealand company tax rate for non-residents, 25 when combined with a full franking rebate it could result in a taxpayer paying a lower effective tax rate investing through a New Zealand rather than an Australian company. The limiting of the franking rebate by the level of the supplementary dividend, or another equivalent option, would ensure that Australian investors investing in Australia through a New Zealand or an Australian company paid the same amount of tax. 24 In relation to this situation, other options that give an equivalent effect may be considered. 25 Company tax is reduced so that when combined with the liability to NRWT, non-residents pay no more than a 33% tax rate in New Zealand. 28 Compliance requirements 4.22 The requirement for maintenance of the other country’s tracking account is that the relevant company would have to comply fully with the domestic law in that country. Appendix 1 sets out the respective imputation rules. For instance, a New Zealand company that elected to maintain a franking account would have to comply with the Australian law governing its operation, as Australian companies currently do. The converse also applies, as Australian companies that wished to maintain imputation credit accounts would have to comply with New Zealand domestic law. The recent Australian redefinition of “debt” and “equity” may mean that instruments in New Zealand that are eligible for imputation credits, such as redeemable preference shares, may not be eligible for franking in Australia. 4.23 Compliance with the other country’s domestic law includes compliance with the provisions relating to shareholder continuity in New Zealand, exempting companies in Australia, benchmark dividend and anti-streaming rules, even though each country has slightly different requirements. 4.24 One relaxation in the requirement of compliance with domestic law regards each country’s current or potential grouping rules. New Zealand has provisions that allow wholly owned groups to maintain a consolidated tracking account on behalf of a New Zealand group. From 1 July 2002, Australia will have similar provisions. Rather than imposing New Zealand grouping rules on Australian companies maintaining imputation credit accounts and Australian grouping rules on New Zealand companies that maintain a franking account, it is proposed to allow the home country’s consolidation rules to apply. This would mean that Australian companies would be entitled to maintain one consolidated imputation credit account, in accordance with the Australian grouping rules, and New Zealand companies would be able to maintain one consolidated franking account, in accordance with the New Zealand grouping rules. 4.25 This relaxation would be subject to the condition that it would only apply to companies that would normally be eligible for a franking account or an imputation credit account if resident in the other jurisdiction. Currency issues 4.26 The tracking accounts of each country would have to be maintained in the currency of the country concerned. There are various implications at the shareholder level of converting the credit from its base currency into the other country’s currency. Appendix 2 sets out possible options for dealing with these issues, and submissions are sought on the most suitable approach. Administrative requirements 4.27 Australia and New Zealand have differing disclosure requirements for their tax tracking accounts. They are detailed in table 6. 29 4.28 It is not proposed to make any changes to the New Zealand requirements. Australian companies maintaining an imputation credit account would be required to file a reconciliation of the imputation credit account with Inland Revenue in New Zealand. The requirements for New Zealand companies maintaining a franking account have not been settled.

In the event of non-compliance, shareholders would be denied imputation credits, and the other jurisdiction’s tax authority would enforce the request for information through the exchange of information article in the Australia/New Zealand Double Tax Agreement. 4.30 If a company were to run the other country’s tracking account into debit, additional tax and penalties would be due. If an Australian company, for example, over-imputed its dividends, putting the imputation credit account into debit, New Zealand would seek to recover tax from the Australian company. 4.31 Although the primary liability would be with the company that caused the account to go into debit, all companies in the other jurisdiction with a 50 percent or greater common shareholding would also be jointly and severally liable for any additional tax and penalties. Lack of compliance by the parent company might see shareholders denied imputation credits in the home jurisdiction. 4.32 As a final safeguard against non-compliance by the parent company and the subsidiary companies, both governments are committed to ensuring that there is a mechanism in place to ensure the collection of additional tax and penalties, should companies in the other country default. 26 A company is required to file a franking account if the franking account is in deficit at the end of the company’s income year. 27 The removal of the requirement to file a dividend statement is being considered as part of New Zealand’s tax simplification initiatives. 30 4.33 Extending the previous example, the process would be as follows: Assume an Australian ultimate parent company over-imputes dividends, causing the imputation credit account to have a debit balance of $1,000. By 20 June following the imputation year, the Australian company is required to pay $1,000 further New Zealand income tax, as well as 10 percent imputation penalty tax of $100, giving a total due of $1,100. 4.34 If the further tax and the imputation penalty tax were not paid by 20 June following the New Zealand imputation year ending 31 March, the New Zealand imputation credits attached to the dividends of the New Zealand shareholders would be denied. Inland Revenue would seek the tax due, along with additional penalties and interest accruing, in accordance with the New Zealand compliance and penalty rules, from the New Zealand subsidiary companies. 4.35 The reversion to the New Zealand group would be at the discretion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The current rules applying to remission of penalties and interest for New Zealand companies would also apply to Australian companies with an imputation credit account. 4.36 As a final step, if recovery from the New Zealand group were to be unsuccessful or Inland Revenue considered recovery unlikely because of the companies’ financial position, the debt would be transferred to the Australian Tax Office for enforcement. 4.37 Similar procedures would apply to New Zealand companies maintaining a franking account. Compliance and administrative costs 4.38 There would be compliance costs for New Zealand and Australian companies that elected to benefit from triangular reform. They would have to become familiar with the imputation rules of the other jurisdiction as well as comply with that country’s administrative requirements. They would also need to make amendments to the statements received by shareholders in order to incorporate a dividend with potentially an imputation and franking credit attached. 4.39 Because the reform would be elective, however, it is expected that companies that elected into the new rules would do so because the benefits of the reform would outweigh any additional compliance costs. 4.40 There would also be additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue and the Australian Tax Office as a result of a greater number of taxpayers being covered by each country’s respective imputation rules. Specific issues, such as those related to compliance, would also arise because of the need to administer the law in relation to non-resident entities. 31 Chapter 5 HOW THE MECHANISM WOULD WORK 5.1 This chapter sets out a detailed example of how the pro rata mechanism would work with a group structure of companies that are not wholly owned. They earn income in their home jurisdictions as well as make an intercompany payment from a New Zealand to an Australian group company. The exchange rate is maintained constant throughout, so the issues raised in appendix 2 do not apply. The structure is shown in figure 7. Original transactions 5.2 The original transactions are as follows and are illustrated in figure 8: • The Australian operating company 1 earns A $1,000 and pays A $300 in tax, generating a credit balance of A $300 in the franking account. • The New Zealand operating company pays the Australian holding company a royalty of NZ $900 after deducting non-resident withholding tax of NZ $100, generating a credit to the imputation credit account of NZ $100. • The New Zealand operating company also earns NZ $5,000 and pays NZ $1,650 in tax, generating a credit balance in the imputation credit account of NZ $1,650. • The Australian operating company 2 earns A $10,000 and pays A $3,000 in tax, generating a credit balance in the franking account of A $3,000. • All Australian companies have elected to maintain an imputation credit account and all New Zealand companies have elected to maintain a franking account. 5.3 The corporate tax rates used are 30% for Australia and 33% for New Zealand. 32 F IGURE 7: E XAMPLE OF NON - WHOLLY OWNED GROUP OF COMPANIES Exchange rate 1NZD = 0.80 AUD Ownership 100% unless otherwise specified 50% Third party Australian ultimate parent Australian holding com pany Australian operating company 2 New Zealand holding company 30% 50% New Zealand operating company Third party Australian operating company 1 70% 50% 50% New Zealand shareholder Australian shareholder 33 F IGURE 8: I LLUSTRATION OF GROUP ’ S ORIGINAL TRANSACTIONS Australian shareholder 50% Third party Exchange rate 1NZD = 0.80 AUD Australian ultimate parent Australian holding company Australian operating company 2 New Zealand holding company 30% 50% New Zealand operating company Third party Australian operating company 1 New Zealand shareholder Royalty paid NZ $900 NRWT deducted NZ$100 Income earned A $10,000 Tax paid A $3,000 Income earned NZ $5,000 Tax paidNZ $1,650 Income earnedA $1,000 Tax paidA $300 50% 50% 34 F IGURE 9: D IVIDEND FLOWS BETWEEN COMPANIES 50% Third party Exchange rate 1NZD = 0.80 AUD Ownership is 100% unless otherwise specified Australian ultimate parent Australian holding company Australian operating company 2 New Zealand holding company 30% 50% New Zealand operating company Third party Australian operating company 1 Cash dividendA$4,900 Franking creditsA$2,100 Imputation creditsNZ $677.50 Cash dividend A $700 Franking creditsA $300 70% Cash dividendA$4,900 Franking creditsA$2,100 Imputation creditsNZ $577.50 Cash dividendNZ $1,675 Supplementary dividend NZ$295 Franking creditsA$150 Imputation creditsNZ$530 NRWTNZ$295 Cash dividendNZ $1,675 Franking creditsA$150 Imputation creditsNZ$825 50% 50% Australian shareholder New Zealand shareholder 35 Operation of pro rata allocation mechanism 5.4 Figure 9 illustrates the steps involved in passing on the tax paid by the lower tier companies as franking and imputation credits to the ultimate shareholders of the parent company, while figures 10 to 14 show these steps individually. 5.5 Although almost all the franking and imputation credits flow up the chain of companies, some of the accompanying cash dividends do not. This is because the pro rata allocation mechanism involves two credits being attached to one dividend payment, even though only one payment of tax has been made on the underlying income. Consequently, the cash from the dividend may remain in an intermediary company while the franking or imputation credit passes up the chain. 5.6 Figure 10 shows the Australian operating company 1 paying a fully franked dividend of A $700 to the New Zealand operating company. No dividend withholding tax is deducted as the dividend is fully franked. 5.7 There is now a nil balance in the franking account, as shown in table 7, because this dividend has transferred up the franking credit generated by the tax payment of A $300.

Generally mandatory for all resident companies. Specific prohibition for non-resident companies. Maximum ratio 30/7033/67 Benchmarking A corporate tax entity may nominate the franking percentage (ratio). Otherwise the ratio is set by the first dividend paid. All frankable distributions made in the same six- month period will generally have to be franked to the same extent. An entity will not be allowed to increase or decrease the extent to which it franks distributions by more than 20% in the subsequent six- month period. The benchmark dividend is the first dividend paid. All subsequent dividends must attach imputation credits in the same ratio as the benchmark dividend. Companies can subsequently change the ratio attached to dividends only if an officer of the company declares that the change is not part of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage. Continuity There are no rules on continuity except that if certain companies cease to have non-residents or tax-exempts holding 95% or more of their shares, the franking credits of the company at the time of the change in shareholding can generally only be used to exempt dividends from dividend withholding tax. Credits may generally be carried forward if 66% of the shareholding remains continuous. Consolidated groups One single franking account is to be maintained for the whole group. Although each company within the group must maintain an imputation credit account, the consolidated group must also maintain a separate imputation credit account for the whole group. Franking/imputation year Same as the company’s income year. 1 April to 31 March, regardless of the company’s balance date. 37 This table is a summary, not a comprehensive description of the rules. 38 The Australian imputation rules are based on the Exposure Draft New Business Tax System (Entity Taxation) Bill 2000 . 44 Filing requirements A company dividend statement is not required to be filed. Generally, a franking account return is only required to be lodged when the franking account is in deficit at the end of the income year. An annual imputation return and company dividend statement 39 is required to be filed. Streaming and trading • If there is an arrangement that allows one shareholder or groups of shareholders to receive a greater tax advantage than another shareholder or groups of shareholders, the Commissioner may impose a franking debit in the company’s franking account or cancel the franking benefits to shareholders. • Shares must be held “at risk” for more than 45 days. • Franking credits attached to dividends paid by companies with 95% or greater non-resident or tax-exempt ownership only “exempt” dividends from dividend withholding tax. They are generally of no benefit to residents. • Arrangements that allow one shareholder or groups of shareholders to receive a greater tax advantage than another shareholder or groups of shareholders are void and the associated imputation credits are lost. • No holding period rules. Penalties • If the franking account is in deficit at the end of the income year (or a deficit is deferred and tax is refunded within three months of the end of the franking year) franking deficit tax is payable. • An additional penalty (equivalent to current franking additional tax) is payable when the deficit / deferral amount is excessive. • Overfranking tax is imposed when the franking percentage of a dividend exceeds the benchmark rate. A penalty debit is imposed if a dividend is underfranked. • General penalties relating to statements also apply to franking account assessments. • The general interest charge applies in cases of late payment of franking deficit tax and overfranking tax. • If the imputation credit account is in debit at the end of the imputation year, imputation penalty tax of 10% is payable on the additional tax due. • Late payment penalties apply to any tax paid after the due date. 39 The removal of the requirement to file a dividend statement is being considered as part of New Zealand’s tax simplification initiatives. 45 Credits to franking account/imputation credit account • Payment of income tax or a PAYG instalment. • Credit from receipt of a franked distribution. • Foreign withholding tax paid as a result of receipt of a foreign dividend (proposed). • Does not include: - foreign tax credits, - penalties, and - fringe benefit tax. • Tax paid to meet an income tax liability. • Dividend withholding payments if the company has no dividend withholding payment account. • Imputation credits attached to dividends. • Does not include: - foreign tax credits, - penalties, and - fringe benefit tax. Debits to franking account/imputation credit account • Franking credits attached to a frankable distribution. • Refunds of income tax paid. • Payment of franking deficit tax. • Underfranking penalty debits. • Dividend streaming penalty debits. • Tainting of share capital account debits. • Imputation credits attached to dividends. • Refunds of income tax paid. • Credits that fail to meet continuity tests. 46 Appendix 2 SUBMISSION POINT – IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATES Principal features of the current Australian and New Zealand systems The four main features of the current imputation systems relating to exchange rates and currency conversion are: • The tracking account is maintained in the currency in which the tax is paid. The New Zealand imputation credit account is maintained in New Zealand dollars, and the Australian franking account is maintained in Australian dollars, consistent with the currency in which the tax is paid. • The shareholder’s imputation or franking credit is in the same proportion to the total tax paid by the company as the shareholder’s proportionate membership interest. For example, shareholders who own 50 percent of a company are entitled, subject to the maximum ratio, to 50 percent of the New Zealand tax paid as imputation credits. • The ratio of the value of the credits to the value of the dividend remains the same from when the company attaches the credit to the dividend to when shareholders return their income to their respective tax authorities. Shareholders receive the same proportion of credits on their dividends as that attached by a company. For example, if a company attaches franking credits in a 30/70 ratio to the dividend paid, the shareholder will receive franking credits in the same ratio. • Foreign dividends are taxed on the amount of local dollars the dividend could have bought on the day it was received. Although the foreign dividend will be paid in a foreign currency, for tax purposes it is converted into the local currency on the day the dividend is received. These four features contribute to the robustness of the imputation rules as well as the relationship with foreign income. Ideally, they should all be retained in any triangular reform. This may not be possible, however, because triangular reform would involve a dividend paid in one currency, with two credits attached, one of which represents tax paid in the other currency. 47 Three options for incorporating the issue of exchange rates and currency conversions within the triangular reform have been identified. Essentially, each option involves a relaxation of one of the last three features of the current imputation systems. Submissions on these options as well as any other possible solutions are welcomed. For reasons of compliance, consistency and administrative ease, the tracking account should continue to be maintained in the currency in which tax is paid. Another important consideration is that there should be as much certainty of outcomes as possible for companies and shareholders. Option 1 – Imputation and franking credits would be attached in the local currency of the company, with conversion being at the exchange rate on the day the dividend is declared. This option would relax the proportionate requirement between the imputation/franking credit, total tax paid and membership interest. The imputation and franking credits attached to a dividend would be in the same currency as the dividend paid. The imputation ratios 40 would be calculated on the date of declaration and the debit to the other country’s tracking account would be converted at the exchange rate prevailing on the date the dividend was declared. Shareholders in the other country would then convert both the dividend and their country’s credit at the exchange rate applicable on the date of receipt. Example 1 An Australian parent company with a 50/50 split of Australian and New Zealand shareholders declares on 1 June that it will pay a fully franked and fully imputed dividend on 15 July. The A/NZ exchange rate is 0.85 on the day of declaration, 1 June. The dividend to be paid out will be A $7000 in total. Franking credits of A $3000 (30/70 x A $7000) in total will be attached, as will imputation credits of A $3447 (33/67 x A $7000). The franking account will be debited with A $3000 when the dividend is paid. The imputation credit account will be debited with NZ $4055 (A $3447 /0.85). The exchange rate is 0.80 on 15 July. The New Zealand shareholders convert both the Australian dividend and the imputation credit at this rate when calculating the gross income and the imputation credit available. 40 Ratio of credit to the cash dividend. 48 As the New Zealand shareholders received half the dividend paid, in total they will return NZ $4375 as dividend income (A $3500 41 /0.80) and NZ $2154 as the corresponding imputation credit (A $1723.5 42 /0.80). The NZ $2154 imputation credit is not 50 percent of the total tax paid, NZ $4055, so the requirement of shareholder proportionality is not satisfied. Advantages This option would maintain three features of the current imputation systems: • The tracking account is maintained in the currency tax is paid. • The imputation ratio remains the same for the company and the shareholder. When the company attached the New Zealand imputation ratio it was A $3447/A $7000, or 33/67. When the New Zealand shareholders return the dividend and imputation credit, the total returned will be NZ $2154 / NZ $4375 or 33/67. • Foreign dividends are converted at the exchange rate on the day of receipt. The Australian dollar dividend of the New Zealand shareholders is converted for income tax purposes at 0.80, being the exchange rate on the date of receipt. Disadvantages Under this method the amount of credits may not reflect the underlying tax paid. Although this method would work if the shareholder receiving the dividend were not maintaining a tracking account, it would not be suitable for passing credits up a chain of companies. If the Australian and New Zealand shareholders in example 1 were companies maintaining imputation credit accounts, on receipt of the dividend they would convert the New Zealand imputation credit of A $3447 at 0.80. This would give a total credit to the respective imputation credit accounts of NZ $4309, when in fact the underlying tax paid was only NZ $4055. This effect of the difference in exchange rates between the date of declaration and the date of payment could be mitigated by calculating the New Zealand dollar debit to the imputation credit account, using the forward exchange rate on the date of declaration for the proposed date of payment. 41 50% of A $7000. 42 50% of A $3447. 49 Such an approach, however, would not eliminate the additional compliance costs of having to convert in and out of the base currency, the currency of the country the tax was originally paid in, for the tracking account. Option 2 – The ratio of credits from the other jurisdiction would be calculated on the day the dividend is declared, using the forward exchange rate that relates to the day the dividend is expected to be paid. Both imputation credits would, however, be attached in their own currency. This option would relax the requirement that the ratio of the value of the credits to the value of the dividend remains the same from when the company attaches the credit to the dividend to when the shareholders return their income to their respective tax authorities. The imputation and franking credits would be attached in their local currency. The imputation ratios would be calculated on the date of declaration. In the case of the other country’s credit, the forward exchange rate relating to the day the dividend was expected to be paid would be used for conversion purposes. As the imputation and franking credits are in their local currency, shareholders in the other country will convert only the dividend at the exchange rate on the day of receipt. Example 2 As before, an Australian parent company with a 50/50 split of Australian and New Zealand shareholders declares on 1 June that it will pay a fully franked and fully imputed dividend on 15 July. On the day of declaration, the forward A/NZ exchange rate is 0.83 with respect to the date of payment, 15 July. The dividend to be paid out will be A $7000 in total. Franking credits of A $3000 (30/70 x A $7000) in total will be attached, as will imputation credits of NZ $4154 (33/67 x A $7000 / 0.83). The franking account will be debited with A $3000 when the dividend is paid. The imputation credit account will be debited with NZ $4154. The exchange rate is 0.80, on 15 July. The New Zealand shareholders will convert the Australian dividend at this rate when calculating their gross income. The New Zealand imputation credit would be attached in New Zealand dollars, and therefore does not need converting. As the New Zealand shareholders would have received half the dividend paid, they will return a total of NZ $4375 as dividend income (A $3500 43 /0.80) and NZ $2077 as the corresponding imputation credit (50% x NZ $4154). 43 50% of A $7000. 50 Advantages This option would maintain three features of the current imputation systems: • The tracking account is maintained in the currency tax is paid. • The credit is the same proportion of the total tax paid as the shareholder’s proportionate membership interest. The imputation credit returned by the New Zealand shareholders, NZ $2077, is half the debit the company makes to its tracking account, NZ $4154, which equals their proportionate membership interest in the company. • Foreign dividends are converted at the exchange rate on the day of receipt. The Australian dollar dividend of the New Zealand shareholders is converted for income tax purposes at 0.80, being the exchange rate on the date of receipt. Disadvantages The main disadvantage is that the imputation ratio calculated when the dividend is declared would not necessarily be maintained at the shareholder level. The New Zealand shareholders received, in total, a dividend of NZ $4375 and imputation credits of NZ $2077, which is a ratio of only 32/67. In other words, the dividend, in the hands of the shareholder, is less than fully imputed, although at the time the company declared the dividend it was fully imputed. Under-imputation is not the only possible outcome: if the exchange rate were to move the other way, the dividend would become over-imputed. Because the forward rate is being used, however, it is unlikely that the outcome would diverge as much from full imputation as in this example. In practice, the only difference would relate to unexpected changes in the exchange rate between declaration and payment, which is usually no longer than two months. Option 3 – Shareholders would convert their dividends at the exchange rate used by the company for calculating the imputation ratio on the day the dividend is declared. Both imputation credits would, however, be attached in their own currency. This option would relax the requirement that foreign dividends are taxed on the amount of local dollars the dividend could have bought on the day it was received. The exchange rate used for calculating the imputation ratio is the rate to which the shareholder is required to convert its dividend income for tax purposes. The exchange rate used could be either the actual rate on the date of declaration or the forward exchange rate for the date of payment. 51 The exchange rate used for calculating the imputation ratio would be included on the shareholder’s dividend statement, and the shareholder would convert its dividend income using that rate. Example 3 As before, an Australian parent company with a 50/50 split of Australian and New Zealand shareholders declares on 1 June that it will pay a fully franked and fully imputed dividend on 15 July. On the day of declaration, the forward A/NZ exchange rate is 0.83 with respect to the date of payment, 15 July. The dividend to be paid out will be A $7000 in total. Franking credits of A $3000 (30/70 x A $7000) in total will be attached, as will imputation credits of NZ $4154 (33/67 x A $7000 / 0.83). The franking account will be debited with A $3000 when the dividend is paid. The imputation credit account will be debited with NZ $4154. The exchange rate is 0.80 on 15 July, but the New Zealand shareholders will be required to convert the Australian dividend at the rate used for calculating the imputation ratio, 0.83. As the New Zealand shareholders received half the dividend paid they will return a total of NZ $4217 as dividend income (A $3500 44 /0.83) and NZ $2077 as the corresponding imputation credit (50% x NZ $4154). Advantages This option would maintain three features of the current imputation systems: • The tracking account is maintained in the currency tax is paid. • The imputation credit is the same proportion of the total tax paid as the shareholder’s proportionate membership interest. The credit returned by the New Zealand shareholders, NZ $2077, is half the debit the company makes to its tracking account, NZ $4154, which equals their proportionate membership interest in the company. • The imputation ratio remains the same for the company and the shareholder. When the company attached the New Zealand imputation ratio it was NZ $2077 / NZ $4217, or 33/67, and New Zealand shareholders will return the same amount in total. 44 50% of A $7000. 52 Disadvantages The main disadvantage is that when shareholders converted their dividend income, they would do so at a rate that is different from that applying on the day they received the dividend. Using the forward exchange rate for the payment date when calculating the imputation ratio could, however, lessen this effect. This would mean that the only exchange rate difference would arise from unexpected changes in the exchange rate between declaration and payment, which is usually no longer than two months.

The Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, Desiring to conclude a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, Have agreed as follows: Article 1 Personal Scope 1. This Convention shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. 2. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing the Philippines from taxing, in accordance with its domestic legislation, Filipino citizens who may be residents of New Zealand. New Zealand, however, is not obliged to give credit for the Philippine tax imposed by virtue of this reservation. Article 2 Taxes Covered 1. This Convention shall apply to taxes on income imposed by a Contracting State, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied. 2. All taxes imposed on total income or on elements of income, including taxes on gains from the alienation of movable or immovable property, shall be regarded as taxes on income. 3. The existing taxes to which the Convention shall apply are in particular: (a) in New Zealand: the income tax and the excess retention tax (hereinafter referred to as "New Zealand tax"); (b) in the Philippines: the income taxes imposed under Title II of the National Internal Revenue Code of the Philippines as amended from time to time (hereinafter referred to as "Philippine tax"). 4. The Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes on income which are imposed after the date of signature of this Convention in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes which have been made to their respective taxation laws relating to the taxes to which this Convention applies. Article 3 General Definitions 1. For the purpose of this Convention, unless the context otherwise requires: (a) (i) the term "New Zealand", when used in a geographical sense, means the metropolitan territory of New Zealand (including the outlying islands) but does not include the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau; it also includes areas adjacent to the territorial sea of the metropolitan territory of New Zealand (including the outlying islands) which by New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law have been, or may hereafter be, designated as areas over which New Zealand has sovereign rights for the purposes of exploring them or of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources of the sea, or of the sea-bed and sub-soil; (ii) the term "Philippines" means the Republic of the Philippines and when used in a geographical sense means the national territory comprising the Republic of the Philippines; (b) the terms "a Contracting State" and "the other Contracting State" mean, as the context requires, New Zealand or the Philippines; (c) the term "person" includes an individual, an estate, a trust, a company, and any other body of persons; (d) the term "company" means any body corporate or any entity which is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; (e) the terms "enterprise of a Contracting State" and "enterprise of the other Contracting State" mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; (f) the term "international traffic" means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of one of the Contracting States, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State; (g) the term "national" means: (i) any individual possessing the citizenship of a Contracting State; (ii) any legal person, partnership or association created, organised or incorporated under the laws of a Contracting State; (h) the term "competent authority" means: (i) in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his authorised representative; (ii) in the case of the Philippines, the Minister of Finance or his authorised representative. 2. As regards the application of the Convention by a Contracting State any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning which it has under the law of that State concerning the taxes to which the Convention applies. Article 4 Resident 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term "resident of a Contracting State" means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature. But this term does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. 2. Where, by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1, an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows: (a) he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both Contracting States, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); (b) if the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State in which he has an habitual abode; (c) if he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State of which he is a national; (d) if he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting State shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3. Where, by reason of paragraph 1, a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement endeavour to settle the question having regard to its day to day management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. Article 5 Permanent Establishment 1. For the purposes of this Convention, the term "permanent establishment" means a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2. The term "permanent establishment" includes especially: (a) a place of management; (b) a branch; (c) an office; (d) a factory; (e) a workshop; (f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources; (g) a place of exploration of natural resources; (h) a building site or construction, installation or assembly project, or supervisory activities in connection therewith where such site, project or activity continues for more than six months; (i) premises used as a sales outlet; (j) a warehouse, in relation to a person providing storage mainly for some other person or persons; (k) A place for the furnishing of services, including consultancy services by an enterprise through employees or other personnel where activities of that nature continue (for the same or a connected project) within the country for a period or periods aggregating more than 183 days within any twelve month period. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term "permanent establishment" shall be deemed not to include: (a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; (b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; (c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; (d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; (e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 4. A person acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting State (other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 5 applies) shall be deemed to be a permanent establishment of that enterprise in the first-mentioned State if he has and habitually exercises in that State, an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise, unless his activities are limited to the purchase of goods or merchandise for that enterprise. 5. An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. However, when the activities of such an agent are devoted wholly or almost wholly on behalf of the enterprise, he shall not be considered as agent of an independent status within the meaning of this paragraph if the transactions between the agent and the enterprise were not made under arms-length conditions. In such a case, the provisions of paragraph 4 shall apply. 6. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. Article 6 Income From Immovable Property 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term "immovable property" shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services. Article 7 Business Profits 1. The profits of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State, but only so much of them as is attributable to � (a) that permanent establishment; or (b) sales within that other Contracting State of goods or merchandise of the same or a similar kind as those being sold, or other business activities of the same or a similar kind as those being carried on through that permanent establishment if the sale or the business activities had been made or carried on in that way with a view to avoiding taxation in that other State. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of amounts paid or charged (other than reimbursement of actual expenses) by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of: (a) royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights; (b) commission for specific services performed or for management; and (c) interest or money lent to the permanent establishment, except in the case of a banking institution. 6. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 7. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 8. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. Article 8 Shipping and Air Transport 1. Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation in international traffic of ships or aircraft shall be taxable in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, profits from sources within a Contracting State derived by an enterprise of the other Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic may be taxed in the first-mentioned State but the tax so charged shall not exceed one and one-half percent of the gross revenues derived from sources in that State. 3. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits derived from the participation in a pool, a joint business or in an international operating agency. Article 9 Associated Enterprises 1. Where (a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. \[2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State  and taxes accordingly  profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. � Paragraph 2 inserted by Article I of the Protocol signed on 21 February 2002\] Article 10 Dividends 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. \[2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. � Replacement paragraph 2 inserted by Article II of the Protocol signed on 21 February 2002\] 3. The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares and other income assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14 as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. 6. Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing the Philippines from imposing on the earnings of a company attributable to a permanent establishment in that State, tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a resident of that State, provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 15 percent of the amount remitted abroad. For the purpose of this provision, the term "earnings" means the profits attributable to a permanent establishment in the Philippines in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on such profits by that State. Article 11 Interest 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. \[2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. � Replacement paragraph 2 inserted by Article III of the Protocol signed on 21 February 2002\] 3. The term "interest" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income assimilated to income from money lent by the taxation law of the State in which the income arises, including interest on deferred payment sales. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political sub-division, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred; and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. 7. Interest derived by the Government of a Contracting State, or by any other body exercising governmental functions in, or in a part of, a Contracting State, or by a bank performing central banking functions in a Contracting State, shall be exempt from tax in the other Contracting State. 8. The Philippine tax on interest arising in the Philippines in respect of public issues of bonds, debentures or similar obligations and paid by a company which is a resident of the Philippines to a resident of New Zealand shall not exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. Article 12 Royalties 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. \[2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the royalties, the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the royalties. � replacement paragraph 2 inserted by Article IV of the Protocol signed on 21 February 2002\] \[3. The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments or credits of any kind received as a consideration for: a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright (including the use of or the right to use any literary, artistic or scientific work, any data or images, or any films, tapes or other medium used for storing data), patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark, or other like property or right; b) the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment; c) the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information; d) the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (a), any such equipment as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (b) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (c); e) total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. � Replacement paragraph 3 inserted by Article IV of the Protocol signed on 21 February 2002\] 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such a case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention.

In such cases, the income may be taxed in that other State but only so much of it as is attributable to activities connected with that fixed base or performed during such period or periods. 2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article income derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character may be taxed in the other Contracting State if the gross remuneration derived for his services in the year of income or fiscal year from residents of the other State exceeds eleven thousand New Zealand dollars or its equivalent in Philippine pesos or such other amount as may be specified and agreed in letters exchanged between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. 3.

In the case of New Zealand: Subject to any provisions of the law of New Zealand which may from time to time be in force and which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle thereof), Philippine tax paid under the laws of the Philippines and consistently with this Convention, whether directly or by deduction, in respect of income derived by a New Zealand resident from sources in the Philippines (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. � Replacement paragraph 2 inserted by Article V of the Protocol signed on 21 February 2002\] For the purposes of this Article, profits, income or gains of a resident of New Zealand which are taxed in the Philippines in accordance with the Convention shall be deemed to arise from sources in the Philippines.

Article 26 Territorial Extension 1. This Convention may be extended, either in its entirety or with any necessary modifications, to any territory for whose international relations New Zealand is responsible, which imposes taxes substantially similar in character to those to which the Convention applies. Any such extension shall take effect from such date and subject to such modifications and conditions (including conditions as to termination) as may be specified and agreed between the Contracting States in notes to be exchanged through diplomatic channels or in any manner in accordance with their constitutional procedures. 2. Unless otherwise agreed by both Contracting States, the termination of the Convention by one of them under Article 29 shall also terminate, in the manner provided for in that Article, the application of the Convention to any territory to which it has been extended under this Article. 3.

The Government of New Zealand and the Government of the Republic of the Philippines, Desiring to conclude a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, Have agreed as follows: Article 1 Personal Scope 1.This Convention shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. 2.Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing the Philippines from taxing, in accordance with its domestic legislation, Filipino citizens who may be residents of New Zealand. New Zealand, however, is not obliged to give credit for the Philippine tax imposed by virtue of this reservation. Article 2 Taxes Covered 1.This Convention shall apply to taxes on income imposed by a Contracting State, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied. 2.All taxes imposed on total income or on elements of income, including taxes on gains from the alienation of movable or immovable property, shall be regarded as taxes on income. 3.The existing taxes to which the Convention shall apply are in particular: (a)in New Zealand: the income tax and the excess retention tax (hereinafter referred to as "New Zealand tax"); (b)in the Philippines: the income taxes imposed under Title II of the National Internal Revenue Code of the Philippines as amended from time to time (hereinafter referred to as "Philippine tax"). 4.The Convention shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes on income which are imposed after the date of signature of this Convention in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes which have been made to their respective taxation laws relating to the taxes to which this Convention applies. Article 3 General Definitions 1.For the purpose of this Convention, unless the context otherwise requires: (a)(i)the term "New Zealand", when used in a geographical sense, means the metropolitan territory of New Zealand (including the outlying islands) but does not include the Cook Islands, Niue or Tokelau; it also includes areas adjacent to the territorial sea of the metropolitan territory of New Zealand (including the outlying islands) which by New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law have been, or may hereafter New Zealand-Philippines Double Tax Agreement be, designated as areas over which New Zealand has sovereign rights for the purposes of exploring them or of exploring, exploiting, conserving and managing the natural resources of the sea, or of the sea-bed and sub-soil; (ii)the term "Philippines" means the Republic of the Philippines and when used in a geographical sense means the national territory comprising the Republic of the Philippines; (b)the terms "a Contracting State" and "the other Contracting State" mean, as the context requires, New Zealand or the Philippines; (c)the term "person" includes an individual, an estate, a trust, a company, and any other body of persons; (d)the term "company" means any body corporate or any entity which is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; (e)the terms "enterprise of a Contracting State" and "enterprise of the other Contracting State" mean respectively an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; (f)the term "international traffic" means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of one of the Contracting States, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State; (g)the term "national" means: (i)any individual possessing the citizenship of a Contracting State; (ii)any legal person, partnership or association created, organised or incorporated under the laws of a Contracting State; (h)the term "competent authority" means: (i)in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or his authorised representative; (ii)in the case of the Philippines, the Minister of Finance or his authorised representative. 2.As regards the application of the Convention by a Contracting State any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning which it has under the law of that State concerning the taxes to which the Convention applies. Article 4 Resident 1.For the purposes of this Convention, the term "resident of a Contracting State" means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature. But this term does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. 2.Where, by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1, an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then his status shall be determined as follows: (a)he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State in which he has a permanent home available to him; if he has a permanent home available to him in both Contracting States, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State with which his personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); (b)if the State in which he has his centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if he has not a permanent home available to him in either State, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the Contracting State in which he has an habitual abode; (c)if he has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, he shall be deemed to be a resident of the State of which he is a national; (d)if he is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting State shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3.Where, by reason of paragraph 1, a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall by mutual agreement endeavour to settle the question having regard to its day to day management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. New Zealand-Philippines Double Tax Agreement Article 5 Permanent Establishment 1.For the purposes of this Convention, the term "permanent establishment" means a fixed place of business through which the business of the enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 2.The term "permanent establishment" includes especially: (a)a place of management; (b)a branch; (c)an office; (d)a factory; (e)a workshop; (f)a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources; (g)a place of exploration of natural resources; (h)a building site or construction, installation or assembly project, or supervisory activities in connection therewith where such site, project or activity continues for more than six months; (i)premises used as a sales outlet; (j)a warehouse, in relation to a person providing storage mainly for some other person or persons; (k)A place for the furnishing of services, including consultancy services by an enterprise through employees or other personnel where activities of that nature continue (for the same or a connected project) within the country for a period or periods aggregating more than 183 days within any twelve month period. 3.Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term "permanent establishment" shall be deemed not to include: (a)the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; (b)the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; (c)the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; (d)the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; (e)the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any other activity of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 4.A person acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting State (other than an agent of an independent status to whom paragraph 5 applies) shall be deemed to be a permanent establishment of that enterprise in the first-mentioned State if he has and habitually exercises in that State, an authority to conclude contracts on behalf of the enterprise, unless his activities are limited to the purchase of goods or merchandise for that enterprise. 5.An enterprise shall not be deemed to have a permanent establishment in a Contracting State merely because it carries on business in that State through a broker, general commission agent or any other agent of an independent status, provided that such persons are acting in the ordinary course of their business. However, when the activities of such an agent are devoted wholly or almost wholly on behalf of the enterprise, he shall not be considered as agent of an independent status within the meaning of this paragraph if the transactions between the agent and the enterprise were not made under arms-length conditions. In such a case, the provisions of paragraph 4 shall apply. 6.The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. New Zealand-Philippines Double Tax Agreement Article 6 Income From Immovable Property 1.Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2.The term "immovable property" shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for the working of, or the right to work, mineral deposits, sources and other natural resources; ships, boats and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3.The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. 4.The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services. Article 7 Business Profits 1.The profits of an enterprise of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State, but only so much of them as is attributable to — (a)that permanent establishment; or (b)sales within that other Contracting State of goods or merchandise of the same or a similar kind as those being sold, or other business activities of the same or a similar kind as those being carried on through that permanent establishment if the sale or the business activities had been made or carried on in that way with a view to avoiding taxation in that other State. 2.Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3.In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4.Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article. 5.Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3, no deduction shall be allowed in respect of amounts paid or charged (other than reimbursement of actual expenses) by the permanent establishment to the head office of the enterprise or any of its other offices, by way of: (a)royalties, fees or other similar payments in return for the use of patents or other rights; (b)commission for specific services performed or for management; and New Zealand-Philippines Double Tax Agreement (c)interest or money lent to the permanent establishment, except in the case of a banking institution. 6.No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 7.For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 8.Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Convention, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. Article 8 Shipping and Air Transport 1.Profits derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation in international traffic of ships or aircraft shall be taxable in that State. 2.Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, profits from sources within a Contracting State derived by an enterprise of the other Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic may be taxed in the first-mentioned State but the tax so charged shall not exceed one and one-half percent of the gross revenues derived from sources in that State. 3.The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to profits derived from the participation in a pool, a joint business or in an international operating agency. Article 9 Associated Enterprises 1.Where (a)an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or (b)the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. \[2.Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State - and taxes accordingly - profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which might have been expected to have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which might have been expected to have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Convention and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall if necessary consult each other. – Paragraph 2 inserted by Article I of the Protocol signed on 21 February 2002\] Article 10 Dividends 1.Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. \[2.However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is the New Zealand-Philippines Double Tax Agreement beneficial owner of the dividends the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the dividends. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. – Replacement paragraph 2 inserted by Article II of the Protocol signed on 21 February 2002\] 3.The term "dividends" as used in this Article means income from shares and other income assimilated to income from shares by the taxation law of the Contracting State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 4.The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14 as the case may be, shall apply. 5.Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company's undistributed profits to a tax on the company's undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. 6.Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing the Philippines from imposing on the earnings of a company attributable to a permanent establishment in that State, tax in addition to the tax which would be chargeable on the earnings of a company which is a resident of that State, provided that any additional tax so imposed shall not exceed 15 percent of the amount remitted abroad. For the purpose of this provision, the term "earnings" means the profits attributable to a permanent establishment in the Philippines in a year and previous years after deducting therefrom all taxes, other than the additional tax referred to herein, imposed on such profits by that State. Article 11 Interest 1.Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. \[2.However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises, and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the interest the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. – Replacement paragraph 2 inserted by Article III of the Protocol signed on 21 February 2002\] 3.The term "interest" as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage, and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor's profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures, as well as income assimilated to income from money lent by the taxation law of the State in which the income arises, including interest on deferred payment sales. Penalty charges for late payment shall not be regarded as interest for the purpose of this Article. 4.The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such a case, the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. New Zealand-Philippines Double Tax Agreement 5.Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political sub-division, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred; and such interest is borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 6.Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt- claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. 7.Interest derived by the Government of a Contracting State, or by any other body exercising governmental functions in, or in a part of, a Contracting State, or by a bank performing central banking functions in a Contracting State, shall be exempt from tax in the other Contracting State. 8.The Philippine tax on interest arising in the Philippines in respect of public issues of bonds, debentures or similar obligations and paid by a company which is a resident of the Philippines to a resident of New Zealand shall not exceed 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest. Article 12 Royalties 1.Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. \[2.However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise, and according to the law of that State, but if the recipient is the beneficial owner of the royalties, the tax so charged shall not exceed 15 percent of the gross amount of the royalties. – replacement paragraph 2 inserted by Article IV of the Protocol signed on 21 February 2002\] \[3.The term "royalties" as used in this Article means payments or credits of any kind received as a consideration for: a)the use of, or the right to use, any copyright (including the use of or the right to use any literary, artistic or scientific work, any data or images, or any films, tapes or other medium used for storing data), patent, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, trademark, or other like property or right; b)the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, commercial or scientific equipment; c)the supply of scientific, technical, industrial or commercial knowledge or information; d)the supply of any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in sub- paragraph (a), any such equipment as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (b) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in sub-paragraph (c); e)total or partial forbearance in respect of the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. – Replacement paragraph 3 inserted by Article IV of the Protocol signed on 21 February 2002\] 4.The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise, through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. New Zealand-Philippines Double Tax Agreement 5.Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is that State itself, a political subdivision, a local authority or a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether he is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 6.Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such a case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Convention. Article 13 Alienation of Property 1.Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6, and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2.Income or gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State or of movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including such income or gains from the alienation of such permanent establishment (alone or together with the whole enterprise) or such fixed base, may be taxed in that other State. 3.Income or gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State from the alienation of ships or aircraft operated in international traffic or movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that State. 4.Income or gains from the alienation of any property, other than those mentioned in this Article, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident. Article 14 Independent Personal Services 1.Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that State unless such services are performed in the other Contracting State, and (a)the individual is present in the other State for a period or periods exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in the year of income or fiscal year, as the case may be, for the purpose of performing his activities, or (b)the individual has a fixed base regularly available to him in the other State for the purpose of performing his activities. In such cases, the income may be taxed in that other State but only so much of it as is attributable to activities connected with that fixed base or performed during such period or periods. 2.Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this Article income derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character may be taxed in the other Contracting State if the gross remuneration derived for his services in the year of income or fiscal year from residents of the other State exceeds eleven thousand New Zealand dollars or its equivalent in Philippine pesos or such other amount as may be specified and agreed in letters exchanged between the competent authorities of the Contracting States.

Typically, the tax benefit of these deductions occurs regardless of the success of the scheme. Over the last six years or so these schemes have generally been marketed to high-income individuals, although trusts and companies, both small and large, have also invested in them. 1.2 The schemes cover a range of projects, from films to forestry and the commercialisation of “concepts”. There are also schemes that target GST refunds, often in association with an income tax-driven proposal. The problem 1.3 Although schemes that exploit loopholes in the tax legislation are not new, the Government is concerned about their recent proliferation and wide-ranging consequences. Therefore officials have been asked to consider how they can be combated. 1.4 The New Zealand tax system can, in certain circumstances, allow deductions to be taken for expenditure in advance of the income associated with that expenditure. For example, the costs of growing timber are deductible as incurred, whereas the income usually will not arise until harvest. The mere use of this opportunity is not the subject of this paper. 1.5 Rather, this paper considers schemes that seem to overstate the investors’ deductions. Such schemes typically include apparently artificial sales projections that result in high asset valuations, together with the use of money in respect of which the investor is not at risk. 1.6 The New Zealand tax system is largely founded on the concept of voluntary compliance. If taxpayers perceive that the system lacks integrity, they will be less likely to comply, which in turn compounds the difficulties faced by Inland Revenue. These schemes have a negative impact on the integrity of the tax system, thereby undermining taxpayer confidence in that system. 1.7 For investors in the schemes, the consequences can include exposure to use- of-money interest and penalties on any resulting unpaid tax, as well as the unexpected expense and stress of being part of an Inland Revenue audit. For the Government, there is a potential loss of revenue and an inefficient use of Inland Revenue’s resources. 2 1.8 By the end of the 2000 income year, about $436 million in tax credits had been claimed in relation to the schemes that Inland Revenue is aware of. This is a significant amount, and it could continue to increase in the absence of a targeted response. To date, however, $100 million of this has been recovered by continuing audit activity. Suggested solution 1.9 Targeting the solution is a key issue. The Government has indicated that it has no desire or intention to change the current legislative and administrative rules for genuine, everyday investments. For example, it is not anticipated that the standard forestry schemes involving multiple investors would face any change. 1.10 The suggested solution has two aspects: • A new “deferred deduction” rule would defer an investor’s net losses from a scheme against future income from the scheme to the degree they exceed the amount of money the investor has “at risk” in the scheme. • Schemes that meet one of several criteria would have to register with Inland Revenue and disclose that fact in a specified format on their prospectuses or “invitations to invest”. Submissions 1.11 All aspects of the suggested solution are offered for comment. We are particularly concerned that the suggested deferred deduction rule may be broader than appropriate, so comments on targeting the rule are particularly welcome. Comments on the detail of the suggested change, including issues related to the application date, are also welcome. 1.12 Submissions, which close on 22 February 2002, should be addressed to: Mass-marketed Tax Schemes The General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Or email: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz 1.13 Submissions may be published on the website of the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue Department, in the interests of making the information widely available.

The investor makes a cash return regardless of whether the scheme is a commercial success or not. 2.2 There is no concern about schemes financed by the investor or commercial borrowings in which the investor is at real risk of losing this money if the scheme fails. 2.3 The schemes in question vary in quality, with some clearly being a form of tax avoidance. A number of current schemes are structurally similar to some that appeared in the early 1980s and then disappeared, to re-emerge in the mid- 1990s. 2.4 Inland Revenue is currently auditing 22 of these schemes, involving $376 million of income tax in the years 1995 to 2000. One scheme will, if it is found to meet the criteria of the Revenue Acts, produce a revenue loss of over $50 million per year for many years. 2.5 The schemes are not restricted to income tax, as some also have GST implications. For example, GST refunds have been claimed on the purchase of second-hand goods such as intangible property rights, at prices Inland Revenue considers are well in excess of apparent market values. About $60 million in GST input credits were claimed in respect of these schemes for the four years from June 1996 to June 2000. 2.6 The schemes usually have some of the following features: • They involve participation in a high-risk activity with apparently optimistic or unrealistic future sales projections. • They include a transfer of property, including intangible and intellectual property, that is difficult to value with precision. Transfer at an excessive price magnifies the available tax deductions, which are usually by way of a depreciation deduction. Sometimes GST input credits are also claimed. • They make use of non-residents, tax-exempt organisations like charities, tax loss companies, or entities that are not registered for GST. The use of such entities can give rise to income that is effectively exempt from New Zealand income tax and/or GST. • Their finance is arranged so that the investor is not at real risk of ever having to repay the loans. This can create inflated interest deductions and/or provide support for a higher transfer price. 6 • Their projected income is well into the future and may or may not materialise. • Sometimes the arrangements detailed in the accompanying invitation to invest are not implemented. 2.7 The tax system presumes that transactions between non-associated persons are at arm’s length market values. Vendors attempt to maximise their return and purchasers attempt to minimise their cost. The end agreement as to value may or may not be what a valuer would agree, but arm’s length bargaining is conceptually acceptable for taxation purposes. 2.8 The schemes that are the subject of this paper generally revolve around obtaining tax deductions for assets whose valuation is based on potential future income. The techniques for valuing these assets are not usually in question. It is the credibility of the forecasts of future income that underpin these valuations that is usually the issue. 2.9 If purchasers are not actually at risk of having to dispose of their own assets to acquire scheme assets, however, it is reasonable to suggest that the arm’s- length presumption does not hold. At this stage both parties’ interest in the value focuses, at least to a significant extent, on the size of the associated tax deductions. How the schemes work 2.10 The schemes in question are generally similar in structure, and usually vary only in detail. 2.11 Typically, investors put a relatively small amount of money into a joint venture or partnership. This can be by way of scheme-specific, loss attributing qualifying companies (LAQCs) or it can be direct. 2.12 The joint venture or partnership undertakes an activity. Most of this money goes into the activity, with the balance going to the promoter. 2.13 The promoter arranges for the investors to have access to loan money. The loan money is used to purchase high-value assets that diminish in value, at least for tax purposes, over time. The higher the purchase value, the greater the tax deductions. 2.14 The investors are not at risk of having to repay the loan even if the scheme is commercially unsuccessful. A variety of mechanisms are used to ensure this. They range from the loan being provided on limited or non-recourse terms, to it being lent to a scheme-specific company and only secured over the assets of and perhaps the shares in the company. Other mechanisms include the use of put or call options over scheme assets or the use of “insurance policies”. 7 2.15 The lending is frequently arranged so that the effects of the financial arrangement rules – in particular, the rules that produce gross income when debt is remitted – can be circumvented, as such income would reduce the positive tax benefits caused by the scheme. Example 2.16 Mary puts $10,000 into a joint venture (JV) that forecasts losses of $100,000 over the first three years. It forecasts income of $150,000 in year four, which in fact does not arise. 2.17 The promoter of the scheme sells fixed life intangible property to the JV for $95,000. This is depreciable over three years. The JV pays $5,000 cash (from Mary’s investment) for the property, with the balance of $90,000 funded by a non-recourse loan from the promoter. The JV spends the remaining $5,000 in a fashion that causes it to be deductible. 2.18 Mary receives tax deductions of $100,000 over three years, saving her $39,000 if the 39% marginal tax rate applies to her income. This is $29,000 more than she has or will invest. She has made a substantial gain even though the JV has been unsuccessful. 2.19 The cash flows and loss transfers are as follows: 2.20 Chapter 5 gives more detailed examples of these schemes and illustrates the effect of the deferred deduction rule suggested in chapter 3. Why is a legislative response required? 2.21 Some investors who appear in a number of these schemes are presumably aware of the potential consequences if, upon audit by Inland Revenue, the supposed tax benefits do not materialise. However, a number of investors are surprised when Inland Revenue not only suggests that deductions should be disallowed under either technical or anti-avoidance grounds, but that penalties might also apply. The compliance costs and stress faced by investors when a scheme is audited should not be underestimated.

This was in addition to the litigation management and adjudication staff involved. One scheme alone has led to over 500 tax returns (covering multiple years) that are potentially subject to reassessment by Inland Revenue. This is clearly not the most efficient use of the department’s scarce resources. 2.23 These tax schemes reduce the integrity of the tax system, thereby undermining taxpayer confidence in that system as a whole. The New Zealand tax system is largely founded on the concept of voluntary compliance, so if taxpayers perceive that the system lacks integrity, they will be less likely to comply. This in turn compounds the difficulties faced by Inland Revenue. 2.24 Although Inland Revenue is taking and will continue to take operational action to counter the use of such tax schemes, it is also appropriate to consider specific legislation to target them. 2.25 The legislation would aim to: • reduce the number of such schemes, therefore reducing investors’ compliance costs and Inland Revenue’s administrative costs; • inform potential investors that investment in such schemes should be considered carefully; • confirm the policy intent of the law; • increase taxpayer confidence in the tax system; and • support the general anti-avoidance provisions in the law. Overseas approaches 2.26 Canada and the United States also experienced significant revenue losses from such schemes marketed to individuals in the 1980s and early 1990s. Their experience indicates that a legislative response based on deduction limitation has the intended effect of limiting these schemes. 2.27 Both Canada and the United States have rules that identify money in respect of which the investor is “not at risk” and limit deductions accordingly. Canada does this by reducing the cost base of assets that give rise to tax deductions by the amounts “not at risk”. The United States also defers deductions to the extent that an investor is “not at risk” in relation to an interest in specified assets or activities. 2.28 Both countries have tax shelter (a defined term) registration rules similar to, but more widely targeted than those suggested in this paper. 9 Chapter 3 SUGGESTED DEFERRED DEDUCTION RULE 3.1 The valuation of assets used in the schemes in question is the most problematic feature, so it should ideally be the target of any legislative response. Targeting valuation, however, is very difficult because the forecasts of income that underpin valuations of the assets involved are inherently difficult to determine and are very subjective. Therefore an alternative approach is needed. 3.2 Our suggested approach focuses on whether investors have used their own money or put their own assets at risk in the scheme. Such an approach would result in investors being unable to claim a greater deduction than the amount of money they are “at risk” of losing if the scheme in which they have invested is unsuccessful. Excess deductions arising from amounts the investor is “not at risk” of losing would be deferred against future income from the scheme or future contributions by the investor. Deferred deduction rule 3.3 Our suggested criteria for the application of the rule are as follows: • an investor enters into an arrangement that has a promoter, and • incurs or expects to incur aggregate net tax losses in the first three years of the arrangement, and • has money “not at risk” in the arrangement. 3.4 If the criteria are met, the net tax losses available for offset against other income or for transfer to another taxpayer will be reduced by the amount of money that is “not at risk” in the arrangement. This balance will be deferred until it can be released, either by the arrangement generating net income in future years for the investor or through reduction of money “not at risk”. 3.5 The deferral may be permanent if the arrangement is not commercially successful. 3.6 These tests will have to be applied by treating the investor and any associated persons as one to ensure that, if companies are part of the scheme, transactions are aggregated. This associated persons test will obviously have to include interests in LAQCs that are involved in schemes. 10 3.7 Whether the expectation test is met at the time the investment is made may often be easy for potential investors to ascertain. 3.8 More difficulty arises when the “invitation to invest” contains the suggestion that there may be significant income in the three-year period, but does not in any way guarantee this. In this circumstance, investors may choose to apply the deferred deduction rule from year one to ensure they are not significantly disadvantaged by a backdated application of the rule several years later. 3.9 Should the deferred deduction rule apply because forecast income is not realised and the investor has not voluntarily applied the rule, an adjustment would be required to the investor’s tax position taken in earlier years. 3.10 This backdated application of the rule, however, would cause use-of-money interest to apply. Inland Revenue would have to set a new due date 1 for the reassessments for the payment of any tax. The reassessments would not be subject to the four-year time bar, given there generally will be only limited time after year three for the reassessment to be completed. 3.11 Given that some existing schemes will produce deductions for some years, we suggest that the deferred deduction rule should apply to future deductions of existing schemes as well as any future schemes that fall within the criteria. Thus, for present schemes, its effect would be retroactive. The detail of any transitional rules has yet to be worked through. Money “not at risk” 3.12 The term “not at risk” will need to be carefully defined. Given the various schemes Inland Revenue has sighted to date, we suggest that money “not at risk” be defined to include: • Loans that are explicitly limited or non-recourse. • Loans that are economically limited recourse because they have been lent to scheme-specific entities and are not secured against other non- scheme assets of the investor 2 , except for loans that are demonstrably on arm’s length terms and conditions. • Put and call arrangements that function to relieve funding risk if the value of the put or call does not necessarily bear any relationship to market value of the assets subject to it. This will be carefully worded so as to exclude forward sales of homogenous products at values that relate to market values. For example, the forward sale of logs at a value that relates to expected market values if the forester still has the risk of delivering logs of a certain quality should not result in money being “not at risk”. 1 For example, the date could be the terminal tax due date for year three of the arrangement if the expected income does not arise. 2 A loan to an individual generally puts all of the individual’s assets at risk. Likewise, a loan to a top tier holding company puts all of the assets of that company at risk. In both cases the funding would be regarded as “at risk”. 11 • Insurance arrangements, except for policies issued by a New Zealand insurance company, or that are demonstrably on arm’s length terms and conditions and are not arranged by the promoter. 3.13 Given the nature of the schemes and the pattern of their development, it is also necessary to consider whether there should be a further provision along the lines of “any other arrangement that has the same effect”. 3.14 In light of the suggested associated persons rule, any loans to scheme-specific entities by the investor or associated persons would not be “not at risk” unless the holder is “not at risk” in respect of the loan. Location of rule 3.15 We suggest the legislation for the deferred deduction rule be located in Part E of the Income Tax Act 1994. This rule would not, by itself, deem the arrangement to be an avoidance arrangement or otherwise cause penalties to apply. It merely acts as a timing rule for the scheme’s tax deductions. This adjustment would be made outside the tax return. 13 Chapter 4 SUGGESTED SCHEME REGISTRATION 4.1 The tax administration’s current information-gathering process has a number of problems in relation to these mass-marketed schemes: • When a return is provided the information in the return is often not of sufficient detail for Inland Revenue to determine the tax impact of an investment. • Inland Revenue frequently has to review large numbers of tax returns before a scheme is identified. This imposes administrative costs as well as a risk that such schemes might not be detected. • Audit activity may not begin until two or three years after the end of the income year in which the investment was made. This means: –a revenue loss to the Government as the investment erodes the tax base until audit action begins; –increased administrative costs through resolving an issue over multiple years rather than when the investment was first made; and –the potential for taxpayers to face several years of shortfall penalties. 4.2 Incentives for investors to provide the information to Inland Revenue voluntarily are limited. Investors generally enter these types of schemes to minimise their tax, so they are naturally inclined not to draw attention to the scheme. Scheme registration 4.3 We suggest that a scheme registration system, similar to that currently in operation in the United States and Canada, would be the most efficient and fairest way of obtaining information on schemes. It would put the focus on the origin of the problem instead of dealing with the consequences of lack of information. If done well this would benefit both investors and Inland Revenue. 4.4 Registration would not necessarily mean Inland Revenue would begin an investigation into the scheme at that time. It would simply mean the department would be made aware of the existence of the scheme, its ambit, and potentially its investors. This would allow it to plan its audit activity more efficiently, in contrast to the current situation, where Inland Revenue may become aware of the scheme only when the first related return is filed. 14 4.5 Registration would not prevent a promoter applying for a binding ruling in respect of the scheme, or remove any rights under the tax dispute resolution process. 4.6 The registration system could consist of the promoter or anyone else associated with the scheme filing with Inland Revenue a copy of the offer documents and a simple standard form notifying Inland Revenue that the scheme had one or more of the features requiring registration and identifying the promoter. It would, therefore, be both quick and simple. If Inland Revenue then wanted more details the promoter would be obliged to provide details of investors. Registration criteria 4.7 Given that registration, by itself, would not impose any sanctions, and given the obvious need for information, the criteria could be somewhat wider than those required for deferred deduction. The criteria set would also have to be both simple and certain in application. It would not be in the interests of promoters, investors or Inland Revenue for debates about whether registration was required to take place after the event. This would need to be balanced, however, by the need to ensure that forcing an undue number of investments to be registered did not impair the efficiency of New Zealand’s capital markets. 4.8 We suggest the following registration criteria: The promoter must sell or anticipate selling the arrangement, or arrangements with the same generic features, to five or more investors and: • the arrangement results in the deferred deduction rule applying because the expected income in the first three years is insufficient to cover tax deductions; or • if the arrangement is commercially unsuccessful, net tax losses available to the investor could exceed the money the investor has risked in the arrangement; or • a tax-exempt person, as part of the arrangement, sells an asset other than in the ordinary course of its business that it acquired in anticipation of or as part of the arrangement that causes the investors to derive tax deductions; or • the investor claims GST input credits if the vendor is not registered for GST in respect of the transaction. 15 4.9 The types of schemes that can be used to erode the tax base change constantly. For this reason Inland Revenue would monitor the types of features that are commonly indicative of certain tax schemes. This is likely to lead to the criteria being updated if necessary. Encouraging registration 4.10 It would be important to provide promoters with an incentive to notify Inland Revenue of their participation in a scheme that met the criteria for registration. This could be achieved in two ways: by measures targeted directly at the promoter and by measures that make unregistered schemes ineffective. 4.11 The Government discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review , published in August last year, raises the prospect of penalties being levied on promoters of certain tax schemes. However, such measures targeted solely at the promoter are unlikely to create a sufficient incentive to ensure registration. For example, if Inland Revenue becomes aware of an unregistered scheme several years after it has been promoted, it may no longer be possible to track down a promoter on whom sanctions can be applied. 4.12 Instead, it may be possible to make unregistered schemes ineffective, thus causing tension between the promoter and investors. To this end, we believe it may be appropriate to defer all tax deductions claimed by investors until a scheme that should be registered is registered. 4.13 Deferring the deductions would have a substantial impact on investors in schemes that, while otherwise satisfying the requirements of the Revenue Acts, have not been registered. Again, this could lead to new due dates being set and the investor being exposed to use-of-money interest. However, we believe the incentive would be sufficient to ensure registration. 4.14 This rule would also have an effect on schemes to which the main deferred deduction rule outlined in chapter 4 applies. The deferral for non-registration would apply to all deductions arising from the scheme, rather than only those up to the “not at risk” amount. Therefore the total deductions deferred would be greater if the scheme had not been registered. 4.15 Any deferred deduction of this kind would need to address the situation where a promoter advises potential investors that a scheme had been registered, when in fact it had not. 4.16 A similar deferral would apply to GST input credits until the scheme is registered. 16 Notification 4.17 To alert investors that Inland Revenue may know the details of such schemes, we suggest that registered schemes contain a statement notifying potential investors that the scheme is registered, such as the following: “This proposal is registered with Inland Revenue as required by tax law. Registration conveys no assurance that this proposal complies with the current tax legislation. Investors should seek independent tax advice.” 4.18 We acknowledge that if schemes that use existing law in a legitimate manner are required to register and use the registration notice this could act as a real impediment to commercial investments because potential investors could view the registration notice as a warning. Investors would need to understand that registration in itself did not mean that a proposal amounted to tax avoidance. Both targeting and the form of the statement made to prospective investors are key factors in ensuring that scheme registration works as intended. 4.19 Inland Revenue is also considering the merits of mounting an advertising campaign to draw potential investors’ attention to the types of scheme required to carry a registration notice and the possible implications and risks of such a notice. Such a campaign would have to consider the effects of any inappropriate targeting. 17 Chapter 5 DETAILED EXAMPLES 5.1 This chapter presents three examples of how the deferred deduction rule would apply in practice. In the first two examples the rule applies to the schemes involved. The third example is of a structure to which neither the deferred deduction nor the scheme registration rules would apply, even though it incorporates scheme-specific finance. Example 1 5.2 Under current law and presuming the scheme will yield the tax results the promoter suggests, Bill puts $10,000 of his own money into a joint venture (JV). The JV uses this for a computer development activity that produces deductions of $10,000 in the first year. The scheme does not amount to tax avoidance. 5.3 The scheme also provides that the promoter will sell to the JV fixed life intangible property that is depreciable over the first two years for taxation purposes. Each venturer’s share of this is $40,000. Because the JV cannot afford to pay for it, the promoter will arrange finance. To ensure that Bill is not actually at risk of having to repay this finance, the loan is limited recourse. 5.4 The “invitation to invest” suggests that income of $55,000 will arise in year four. Tax payable on this income will be Bill’s responsibility as the JV is “looked through” for tax purposes. In fact, income of only $10,000 arises. 5.5 Bill receives tax deductions of $50,000 over two years (JV activity of $10,000 together with depreciation of $40,000). At a marginal tax rate of 39%, under current law Bill receives tax refunds of $19,500 within two years. 5.6 The scheme has a mechanism in place to ensure that Bill is not exposed to any taxation consequences of the accrual rules if the project is unsuccessful. 5.7 The cash flows and tax deductions are summarised diagrammatically below.

In net terms over four years, Bill has paid tax of $1,950 on a return of $5,000, an effective tax rate of 39%. 5.11 The actual return over years one to four for the investor is significantly different. It can be summarised as: ActualTaxable income/ (loss) Refund/ (Tax to pay) Return/ (Investment made) Net cash position Year one(30,000)11,700(10,000)1,700 Year two(20,000)7,80007,800 Year three0000 Year four10,000(3,900)0 4 (3,900 ) Total(40,000)15,600(10,000)5,600 5.12 Note that this net cash gain of $5,600 arises even though the scheme was not commercially successful. If the scheme actually made no income, Bill’s net cash gain would be even better, at $9,500. Supposedly, Bill would make a 95 percent gain (solely at the expense of the tax base) even though the scheme was totally unsuccessful. 3 Sum of tax to pay/(refund) and investment made/(return) for year. 4 Income of $10,000 is firstly put towards repayment of the limited recourse loan of $40,000. There are no proceeds to be returned to Bill. 19 Cash flows and taxable income under the deferred deduction rule 5.13 The proposed deferred deduction rule will apply because the “invitation to invest” does not expect income until year four. Net losses will be incurred within three years. The total amount “not at risk” subject to the deferred deduction rule is $40,000, with the result that the first $40,000 of tax losses are deferred. The following arises from the application of the deferred deduction rule: Deferred deduction rule Allowable taxable income/(loss) Deferred taxable loss Refund/ (Tax to pay) Return/ (Investment made) Net cash position Year one0(30,000)0(10,000)(10,000) Year two(10,000)(40,000)3,90003,900 Year three0(40,000)000 Year four0(30,000) 5 000 Total(10,000)(30,000)3,900(10,000)(6,100) 5.14 It can be seen that the deduction generated by the “not at risk” money is not available until the scheme generates income in the fourth year. The $30,000 balance of deferred deductions will only be useable against further income or if the amount “not at risk” is reduced. 5.15 If the scheme actually made no income Bill’s net cash cost would still be $6,100. This is the correct result, as Bill has lost his investment of $10,000 and is, in the circumstances, entitled to a tax deduction for this loss. 5.16 Note that the scheme would also have to be registered under the scheme registration rule, as the deferred deduction rule will apply because the expected income in the first three years is insufficient to cover tax deductions. Example 2 5.17 Kay puts $20,000 of her own money into a scheme-specific LAQC, which in turn invests into a partnership of LAQCs. The partnership uses this money to make a film and obtains a deduction for it in year 1. 5.18 The scheme provides that the promoter will sell to the partnership fixed life intangible property that is depreciable for taxation purposes. Each partner’s share of this deduction is $70,000, also in year 1. 5 Taxable income of $10,000 is offset by deferred deductions that are now available for release. 20 5.19 Because the partnership cannot afford to pay for it, the promoter will arrange finance. This finance is secured over the assets of and shares in the LAQCs, with the result that investors are not actually at risk of having to repay this finance from their non-scheme assets. In economic terms the loan is limited recourse against the scheme’s assets and income. The scheme does not amount to tax avoidance. 5.20 The “invitation to invest” indicates that in year three the income of $120,000 per investor is expected. Tax payable on this income will be the responsibility of the LAQC, with a shareholder guarantee over the LAQC tax liability. The scheme in year three, in fact, produces income of only $30,000. 5.21 Kay receives tax deductions of $90,000 in year 1 (partnership activity $20,000 together with depreciation of $70,000). At a marginal tax rate of 39%, under the current law she receives tax refunds of $35,100 within 12 months. 5.22 The scheme has a mechanism in place to ensure that Kay is not exposed to any taxation consequences of the accrual rules if the project is unsuccessful. 5.23 The cash flows and loss transfers are summarised diagrammatically below: Cash flows and taxable income under existing law 5.24 If the positions of Kay and the special purpose LAQC are consolidated, the anticipated result is similar to that shown in example 1. The forecast return over years one to three for Kay can be summarised as: Fil m Production (3) Sells F LIP $70k (3) Loan back $70k scheme specific (4) $20k (4) $20k deductions Partnership of LAQCs (3) Depreciates $70k FLIP Promoter LAQC (5) $90k deduction (2) $20k Kay (5) $90k deduction (1) $20k own monies 21 ForecastTaxable income/ (loss) Refund/ (Tax to pay) Return/ (Investment made) Net cash position Year one(90,000)35,100(20,000)15,100 Year two0000 Year three120,000(46,800)50,000 6 3,200 Total30,000(11,700)30,00018,300 5.25 If the forecast income is realised, Kay has received a timing benefit only. In net terms over four years, she has paid tax of $11,700 on a return of $30,000, an effective tax rate of 39%. 5.26 The actual return over years one to three for Kay is significantly different. It can be summarised as: ActualTaxable income/ (loss) Refund/ (Tax to pay) Return/ (Investment made) Net cash position Year one(90,000)35,100(20,000)15,100 Year two0000 Year three30,000(11,700)0 7 (11,700) Total(60,000)23,400(20,000)3,400 5.27 Note a net cash gain of $3,400 arises even though the scheme was not commercially successful. If the scheme actually made no income, Kay’s net cash gain would be even better at $15,100. Kay then would have made a 75.5 percent gain 8 (solely at the expense of the tax base) even though the scheme was totally unsuccessful. Cash flows and taxable income under the deferred deduction rule 5.28 Assuming that the expected return of $120,000 is realistic at the time the investment is made, Kay will not be required to apply the deferred deduction rule at the outset of the investment. However, should Kay so choose – for example, if she is uncertain as to the outcome of the investment – the rule can be applied from the year in which the investment is made. The total amount “not at risk” subject to the deferred deduction rule is $70,000, with the result that the first $70,000 of tax losses are deferred as soon the rule is applied. 6 Proceeds are used first to repay limited recourse loan of $70,000. The balance of $50,000 is passed from the partnership to the LAQC and then on to the investor. 7 Income of $30,000 is first put towards repayment of the scheme-specific loan of $70,000. There are no proceeds to be returned to the investor. 8 $15,100/$20,000 (amount originally invested) x 100= 75.5% 22 5.29 Kay is not confident that the expected return of $120,000 in the third year will eventuate. To avoid use-of-money interest and the possibility of shortfall penalties applying if the expected return does not eventuate in year three she decides to apply the deferred deduction rule in year one, with the following results: Deferred deduction rule Allowable taxable income/(loss) Deferred taxable loss balance Refund/ (Tax to pay) Return/ (Investment made) Net cash position Year one(20,000)(70,000)7,800(20,000)(12,200) Year two0(70,000)000 Year three0(40,000) 9 000 Total(20,000)(40,000)7,800(20,000)(12,200) 5.30 The deductions generated by the “at risk” money are, in this example, available in year one. None of the deductions generated by the “not at risk” money are available until the scheme generates income in the third year, at which time they are released to the extent they cover net income from the scheme. The $40,000 balance of deferred deductions will only be useable against further income or if the amount “not at risk” is reduced. 5.31 If the scheme actually made no income Kay’s net cash cost would also be $12,200. This is the correct result as Kay has lost her investment of $20,000 and is, in the circumstances, entitled to a tax deduction for this loss. 5.32 Note that the scheme would also have to be registered under the scheme registration rule, since the net losses available to Kay could otherwise have exceeded the money she has risked in the event that the scheme is not commercially successful. Example 3 5.33 Tom puts $10,000 of his own money into a scheme-specific LAQC which in turn invests into a partnership of LAQCs. The partnership uses $7,000 of this to plant trees and obtains a deduction for it in year one. The balance is used as part payment for the land on which the trees are grown. 5.34 The “invitation to invest” indicated that in year 25 the income would be $150,000 per investor. 5.35 The scheme provides that the promoter will sell to the partnership land on which to grow trees. This land will cost $12,000 per partner. 9 Taxable income of $30,000 is offset by deferred deductions that are now available for release. 23 5.36 Because the partnership cannot afford to pay for the land in full, the promoter arranges a loan of $9,000 per partner from a New Zealand bank. The finance is secured by mortgage over the land. This results in the investors actually not being at risk of having to repay this finance from their non-scheme assets. In economic terms, the loan is limited recourse against the scheme’s assets and income. 5.37 However, the loan is from a New Zealand bank and interest is payable monthly. The investors pay this by way of automatic payments to the partnership, which in turn pays the bank. The bank loan is not “not at risk” because it is arm’s length on fully commercial terms and conditions. 5.38 Because there is no money that is “not at risk”, the deferred deduction or scheme registration rules do not apply. Tom receives, via the LAQC, tax deductions of $7,000 plus interest. The cashflows and tax deductions, ignoring interest, are summarised below.

This report provides officials’ comment on these issues. Several of these issues are covered in greater detail in volume 2 of the Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill. Te Puni Kokiri were involved with the preparation of the advice relating to Maori organisations. Issue: Rationale underlying the Maori authority tax rate of 19.5% The Committee has sought advice on the rationale underlying the proposed Maori authority tax rate of 19.5%. Comment Once it was clarified that there was a case for separate tax rules for a certain class of Maori organisations, the question of the appropriate tax rate arose. The proposed tax rate for Maori authorities has been set at 19.5% because this is the statutory tax rate applying to most of their members. This view is based on the fact that 90 percent of Maori earn less than $38,000 and the appropriate tax rate that applies to that level of income is 19.5%. This estimation was undertaken by extrapolating from Statistics New Zealand Household Economic Survey data for the 1997/98 year. (See attached appendix for further information.) It is reasonable to assume that, as submitted by the Federation of Maori Authorities, members of Maori authorities have a similar income distribution to that of Maori generally, since Maori authority membership is unrelated to income level. In contrast, most company shares belong to shareholders with a statutory marginal tax rate of 33% or higher. Matching the tax rate applied to the entity to that of its members brings savings in compliance and administration costs. This is consistent with recent tax policy changes which have focused on removing the need for a significant number of taxpayers to file tax returns or income statements. The Maori Trustee is charged with the administration of over 2,000 properties, and each of these properties is a separate taxpayer. In any income year, the Maori Trustee could make distributions to over 50,000 individual members associated with these properties. The average size of distributions is about $135 per annum. If the Maori authority tax rate exceeded 19.5% 4 there would be a stronger inducement for individual members either to file tax returns or request income statements from Inland Revenue in order to claim refunds on overpaid tax, thereby increasing both compliance costs and administrative costs. Issue: Proposed definition of “Maori authority” Ms Therese Turner, Tax Advisor to the Committee, advised that Maori organisations are generally subject to certain restrictions on the trust funds that they hold and that some assets, particularly Maori freehold land, cannot be traded easily. Even so, it is also true that settlement funds can be used to acquire or begin commercial enterprises that compete on the open market, but the ownership interests in these enterprises can in fact be traded. In response to these comments, the Committee sought advice from officials on how the proposed definition could be narrowed and what would be the resulting implications. Comment There are a range of options for narrowing the proposed definition of “Maori authority”, but none of these options would be sufficient to address the main concern raised by submissions that expressed the view that the proposed definition is too wide. Those submissions consider that Maori authorities should be taxed at the same tax rate as other entities as this would be consistent with the principle of competitive neutrality. Their concern centres on the application of differential tax rates rather than the scope of the proposed rules per se. This suggests that the simplest way of addressing this specific concern would be to align the Maori authority tax rate with the tax rate applying to other organisations, such as the company tax rate of 33%. Exclude wholly-owned companies of Maori authorities The proposed definition could exclude wholly owned companies from the proposed definition. These companies would be taxed under the ordinary company rules and face a tax rate of 33%. Dividends paid to the “parent” Maori authority would be taxable but imputation credits would be attached. Taxing companies wholly owned by Maori authorities at a higher rate than their “parents” is likely to encourage Maori authorities to use tax minimisation techniques to reduce the profit that would be subject to the higher tax rate. For example, they could use management fees to transfer profits from wholly owned companies to the parent, which would be deductible from the company’s income and included in the parent’s income. Maori authorities could achieve the same tax result as if they had wholly owned entities undertaking the commercial activities but would incur higher transaction costs. It is recognised that such techniques are used by sole proprietor companies to transfer profits to the proprietor so that the profit can be taxed at the marginal tax rate of the shareholder/proprietor. However, such techniques are not so 5 readily available to more widely owned companies. A parent authority is more akin to an entity with a large number of members rather than a sole proprietor company. Maori authorities may also be encouraged to undertake their commercial activities within the parent structure. It would not be administratively feasible to differentiate streams of income from different kinds of assets held within the parent authority. Furthermore, the behaviour change is likely to lead to Maori authorities using inefficient structures to hold and manage their assets. Although Maori authorities are likely to have some income taxed under other rules – for example, dividends from ordinary companies, including companies owned entirely by Maori authorities in the definition is expected to reduce compliance costs relative to exclusion. The costs associated with transferring profits or activities to the parent entity is an inefficient use of resources. Including such entities in the proposed definition (where they elect to be Maori authorities) is also consistent with the grouping of ordinary, wholly owned companies for tax purposes, which offers certain tax advantages but encourages the efficient structuring of wholly owned commercial activities. It recognises in economic terms that the group of companies is really one economic unit. Maori authority tax rules originally came into place because Maori organisations were different from other types of commercial entity. Not only are they subject to some different rules governing the use of their assets, but they also face unique challenges in terms of communal ownership. For example, the land may not be able to move to its highest value use, it is difficult to borrow money on Maori land, and the title to the land can be fragmented over time. The Committee has asked to what extent these restrictions flow through from the parent entity to the subsidiary. The issue is not only the extent that legal restrictions flow through to the subsidiary, but also to what extent the legislative and other issues affecting the group’s ability to support a wholly owned subsidiary and its development. In economic terms, a group of wholly owned companies is really one economic unit. Therefore constraints in one area may affect the overall performance of the whole economic unit. Some of the constraints faced by the parent Maori organisations may impact on the development and growth of its wholly owned subsidiaries. For example, common commercial practice in debt financing is to initially secure against the assets of the subsidiary. When this security is insufficient the financier will look at the parent entity to satisfy its security requirements. Therefore the constraints on the assets mentioned in the preceding example will affect the ability to provide this security. In some circumstances this will be a constraint upon the commercial activity of the subsidiary. Include Maori land based entities only The proposed definition could be restricted to Maori organisations that administer Maori freehold land under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. Maori Trust Boards, settlement entities, the Crown Forestry Rental Trust and the Fisheries Commission would be excluded from Maori authority tax status. They would be taxed under the general tax rules. 6 Retaining specific tax rules for Maori authorities recognises that certain Maori organisations have unique characteristics that set them apart from other entities such as companies and trusts. The most defining characteristic is the non-transferability of property rights, which is particularly evident in relation to Maori organisations that administer Maori freehold land on behalf of their owners under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. Maori freehold land administered under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 is a good example where the non-alienation of the land places constraints on the owners of that land. The Maori Land Act 1993 imposes restrictions on the ability of owners to alienate or trade their land interests (or shares as in the case of a Maori incorporation), and on the ability of the trustees of the authority to sell Maori land vested in them. The Maori Land Court also has wide powers to control the administration of Maori freehold land. The impact of these restrictions is to create three major constraints to economic efficiency in the use of Maori freehold land. The land may not be able to move to its highest value use, it is difficult to borrow money on Maori land, and the title to the land can be fragmented over time. The Maori Trustee is also subject to the same legislative restrictions in respect of its “trustee” role in the administration of properties under the Maori Land Act 1993. This option is unlikely to address the concern raised by submissions that commercial activities should be taxed at the same tax rate as other commercial entities. Maori land based entities may also undertake commercial activities unrelated to their land assets. In order to ensure that competitive activities are taxed at the same rate, complex apportionment rules would be required to ring-fence activities related to the land from other commercial activities of the authority giving rise to significantly higher compliance costs and administrative costs. Issue: Distributions from a Maori authority The Committee raised a concern that high tax-rate individuals would receive Maori authority distributions taxed at the lower rate of 19.5% and asked whether there would be any mechanism to ensure that such individuals pay the correct amount of tax on their distributions. Comment Clause 77 of the bill requires a Maori authority to provide members with information detailing the amounts distributed including the name of the Maori authority providing the distribution, the date of the distribution, the name and address of the member to whom the distribution is made and the amount of the distribution and any credit attached. There is also provision for the Commissioner to require other information be provided to the member. 7 Clause 87 of the bill requires a Maori authority to complete a distribution statement and provide it to members that receive distributions. The statement shows the amount of the distribution and any credits attached, the date on which the distribution is made, the base ratio of the distribution and any such further information as the Commissioner requires. Although the proposed information requirements do not specifically require the IRD numbers of members to be provided, the Commissioner does have the ability to request this information. In order to address the specific concern of the Committee, a specific requirement to provide IRD numbers of members could apply to Maori authorities. The provision of this information would provide Inland Revenue with appropriate information to ensure taxpayer compliance and for audit purposes. This requirement is also consistent with current law requirements imposed on Maori authorities under the resident withholding tax rules and should not in general impose additional compliance costs on Maori authorities. Furthermore, to ensure that Inland Revenue can ensure compliance with the need for members that have a higher tax rate to square-up their tax obligations, Maori authorities could be required to file a schedule as part of its tax return detailing the names and IRD numbers (if known), and the amount of distributions over certain threshold such as $1,000. This will allow Inland Revenue to match that information with the tax return of the member. Issue: Relaxing the public benefit requirement Ms Turner commented that with the removal of the blood ties component of the public benefit requirement there will be a degree of uncertainty of what this means for entities seeking to satisfy the amended public benefit requirement in practice. The Committee seeks clarification on the practical application of the amended public benefit requirement. Comment The proposed amendment is limited to relaxing the blood ties component of the public benefit requirement for all trusts, societies or institutions seeking “charitable” tax exemption. This means that in order to qualify for a “charitable” tax exemption, an entity must still meet the other requirements of a charity – this is, they must have a charitable purpose, that purpose must be for the benefit of the public or an appreciably significant section of the public, and the entity must not be carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. The proposed amendment applies to both Maori organisations and non-Maori organisations but it is especially relevant to Maori organisations because they often define their beneficiary class by reference to a blood relationship to a named person. 8 In determining whether a trust, society or institution benefits the public or an appreciably significant section of the public, other factors will still be relevant, such as the nature of the entity, the activities it undertakes, the potential beneficiary class, the relationship between the beneficiaries and the number of potential beneficiaries. These factors were enumerated in Dingle v Turner \[1972\] AC 601. Applying specific rules as to what constitutes “the public or an appreciably significant section of the public” would be arbitrary – for example, the number of potential beneficiaries exceeds a certain number. Given this, officials consider that the status quo should be retained. This means that the specific facts of each case will be taken into account in determining whether the amended public benefit requirement is met. Issue: Marae charitable exemption The Committee seeks clarification of the problem that the proposed charitable exemption for marae is attempting to solve. Mr Copeland expressed a concern that marae exemption creates a new class of charity. Comment The proposed amendment is intended to confer a “charitable” income tax exemption on a trust, society or institution that administers marae situated on Maori reservations that solely apply their funds to administer and maintain the marae’s physical structure. The reason for the specific exemption is because the trustees of a Maori reservation are statutorily debarred from alienating the land subject to the reservation. This poses a problem for trustees of Maori reservations to qualify for the “charitable” tax exemption because of the rule that property must always be applied for charitable purposes, even in winding up situations. In practice, the usual way of avoiding this requirement while seeking exemption was to establish a separate discrete legal entity to administer the day-to-day affairs of the marae. The land remains vested in the trustees of the Maori reservation, while a separate entity manages the affairs of the marae. The proposed amendment, therefore, provides relief from the alienation of property requirement for trustees of Maori reservations and avoids the need for these trustees to establish another entity to administer the marae. If the trustees of a Maori reservation wish to establish a separate entity to administer the day-to-day running of the marae the specific marae exemption would still apply, since the exemption applies to any trust, society or institution that administers marae situated on Maori reservations. Submissions consider that the exemption as it appears in the bill should be wider than merely the administration and maintenance of the physical structure. Volume 2 of the Officials’ Report to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Submissions on the Bill recommends extending the exemption to also allow marae funds to be applied to recognised charitable purposes if the appropriate requirements are satisfied. 9 Most, if not all, of the entities that administer marae should meet the definitions of either a “trust”, “society” or an “institution”. Marae not situated on Maori reservations would be excluded Entities administering marae not situated on Maori reservations could seek charitable status under the general “charitable” income tax exemption (as amended by the public benefit requirement). Generally such entities would not be subject to the same restrictions affecting Maori reservations, but even if they were they could still set up a separate discrete legal entity to administer the marae and apply for charitable exemption under the general provision in the same way as entities administering churches and public halls. Numbers of Maori reservations It is too difficult to provide any accurate statistics of how many marae are situated on Maori reservations or what the proportion of marae on Maori reservations is to total marae. There is no national Maori Land Court database on reservations and reservations may be established for purposes other than marae such as recreation or conservation. Issue: Potential private residence to qualify for the marae exemption The Committee raised the concern that a private residence could be set up as a marae on a Maori reservation and qualify for the proposed exemption. Comment The process for establishing a Maori reservation for the purposes of a marae begins with a meeting of the owners of the land. The minutes of that meeting, the attendance list and the application are filed with the Maori Land Court. The Maori Land Court then considers the application and makes a recommendation. If the recommendation is to establish the reservation the Chief Executive of the Ministry of Maori Development must approve the reservation by placing a notice in the Gazette declaring the land to be a Maori reservation. There are safeguards in Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 which limit possible abuse or non-compliance with the terms of the reservation. The Maori Land Court has wide powers to exclude from the reservation any part of the land comprised in it, cancel the reservation, redefine the purposes for which the reservation is made or redefine the persons or class of persons for whose use and benefit the reservation is made. It should also be noted that land cannot be set apart as a Maori reservation while it is subject to any mortgage or charge. This should limit the extent to which private residences can be used as a marae situated on a Maori reservation. 10 Issue: Memorandum from Mr Gordon F Copeland MP A memorandum from Mr Gordon F Copeland MP was also tabled at the Committee’s meeting of 13 November 2002. The memorandum noted that Mr Copeland was a member of the Government Working Party on the introduction of a system for the registration, reporting and monitoring of charities. The memorandum sets out the Working Party’s recommendations for an updated definition of “charitable purpose”. One of the limbs of the suggested updated definition is: “the advancement of culture and heritage, which includes: • the promotion and fostering of culture • the care preservation and protection of New Zealand heritage • the practice and development of Tikanga Maori, and • the practice, development and protection of Te Reo Maori.” Mr Copeland suggested that this recommendation could be pertinent to the Committee’s consideration of the current bill. The Committee asked for officials’ views on the content of Mr Copeland’s memorandum. Comment Officials understand that the suggested updated definition of “charitable purpose” is based on a draft of the proposed definition of “charitable purpose” to be introduced in Australia. The government’s position on this issue is that it will not make any changes to the definition until it has seen the results of work being done in other commonwealth countries. While it is accepted that the activities of a marae may be covered by current law, the purpose of the proposed exemption is to address the issue of the non-alienation of land subject to a Maori reservation to reduce the compliance costs of using a separate entity to administer the marae. Issue: Meaning of “wholly owned company” In discussions with the writers of some submissions, the issue of the meaning of “wholly owned company” in the context of the proposed Maori authority rules has been raised and should be clarified. 11 Comment In determining whether a company is wholly owned by a Maori authority or a group of Maori authorities, the shareholder continuity rules in the Income Tax Act 1994 should apply. These rules measure a shareholder’s voting or market value interest in a company to determine whether they are commonly owned. It is recommended that the bill clarify that the continuity rules will apply when determining whether a company is wholly owned by a Maori authority or a group of Maori authorities. 12 APPENDIX Maori Income Data for 2000-01 1 Below is an estimated income distribution for Maori individuals 15 years and older for the 2000-01 tax year. The Treasury has undertaken the estimation by extrapolating from Statistics New Zealand Household Economic Survey (HES) data in 1997-98. Income reported in the table is pre-tax and includes most forms of income. It does not include interest and investment income, which accounts for 8.5 percent of total income. This type of income tends to be unevenly distributed towards the higher income brackets. This tends to suggest that the figures presented below are slightly biased towards the low-income end of the distribution, and this slight bias is likely to be stronger for non-Maori than Maori. 2 The HES information is considered the best available for assessing income distribution by ethnic group. It also has the advantage that it can be grouped according to current marginal tax rates. The HES information on income is consistent with income data from the 1996 Census and the income supplement to the Household Labour Force Survey (June 2001). The HES is a sample survey that collects information on the income and expenditure patterns of private households throughout New Zealand. The HES was an annual survey until 1998, and then became a survey produced at three-year intervals. Approximately 3000 households (out of an eligible 1.4 million) are randomly selected to be surveyed. Income and expenditure data are not collected from children under 15 years. Like all surveys, there is a degree of error in the survey results. Although Statistics New Zealand is continuously trying to improve the methodology used, there is evidence of variation in the measurement of components. Some of this occurs from sampling error and under-coverage of specific population groups. The degree of variation will also vary from year-to-year. Estimated income distribution for individuals over 15 years of age for 2000-01 Tax rate 15% 21% 33% 39% Total 3 Taxable income $0-9500 $9501-38000 $38001-60000 $60001+ Number of Maori 80000 154000 21000 4000 259000 Percentage of Maori 31% 59% 8% 2% 100% General population 767000 1624000 389000 202000 2981000 Percentage of general population 26% 54% 13% 7% 100% 1 The results presented are the work of the Treasury, not Statistics New Zealand. Access to the data used in this study was provided by Statistics New Zealand under conditions designed to give effect to the security provisions of the Statistics Act 1975. 2 New Zealand Income Supplement (June 2000) indicates that 32 percent of non-Maori surveyed receive interest, dividends, rent or other investment income compared with 10 percent of Maori survey population. 3 Owing to rounding errors, rows may not add exactly. 13 Superyacht crew tax exemption 15 SUPERYACHT CREW TAX EXEMPTION Submission (New Zealand Marine Export Group) The marine industry generally feels that the time restraint of 365 days in any 24- month period could be difficult as many of the large refit projects can take fourteen to eighteen months to complete. The industry considers that this limitation could affect international competitiveness on large projects. The tax exemption period should be increased so that non-resident crew members of superyachts can be present in New Zealand for 18 months in any 24 month period. Comment On 28 May 2002 the government announced that people visiting New Zealand as superyacht crew members would be exempt from New Zealand income tax on income derived in this capacity, with application from the date of announcement. The proposal resulted from consultation with the marine industry and was designed to address the problem that New Zealand’s tax laws could be discouraging superyachts from undertaking refits in New Zealand, to the detriment of the New Zealand economy. In particular, the government did not want to discourage valuable refit and maintenance work on superyachts from being carried out in New Zealand. On 4 October 2002 the Hon Paul Swain, Associate Minister of Finance and Revenue, wrote to the Chair of the Finance and Expenditure Committee requesting the Committee to include the tax exemption for superyacht crew members in the Taxation (Annual Rate, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill when reporting the bill back to the House following its consideration. The Finance and Expenditure Committee invited the New Zealand Marine Export Group (MAREX), which represents the marine industry on this issue, to make a submission to the Committee on the government’s proposal. The proposed legislation exempting superyacht crew members from income tax contains a number of conditions. One of these conditions is that the crew member must not be present in New Zealand on more than 365 days in any 24-month period. This time limit was designed to ensure the temporary nature of the exemption. Officials do not support extending the tax exemption period to 18 months in any 24- month period, as suggested by MAREX, because such an extension would be inconsistent with immigration and customs practice and would undermine the intended temporary nature of the exemption. The proposed 365-day period for the superyacht crew tax exemption is aligned with the normal maximum 12-month period for a visitor’s permit issued by the Immigration Service. This alignment is relevant because one of the requirements in the proposed legislation for the exemption is that the relevant crew member is not in New Zealand unlawfully for the purposes of the Immigration Act 1987. 16 The proposed 365-day period is also aligned with the normal maximum period of the temporary import entry applying to the superyacht itself, which is issued by the Customs Service. This is relevant because another requirement for the superyacht crew exemption is that the superyacht on which the crew are employed is a temporary import under the Customs and Excise Act 1996 and therefore a recipient of a temporary import entry. Officials note that the proposed 365-day tax exemption period is four times longer than the 92-day period allowed for non-resident employees generally under the Income Tax Act and twice as long as the 183-day period allowed under New Zealand’s double tax agreements. An exemption period longer than 365 days would undermine the intended temporary nature of the exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined.

This proposal follows release of the discussion document More time for business, issued in May 2001. Taxpayers have to pay their income tax by their terminal tax date. Often the amount actually due is uncertain, with the amount paid during the year as provisional tax reflecting the taxpayer’s best judgement of the law on a large number of technical issues. If the taxpayer’s judgement of their liability is incorrect, and they have actually overpaid or underpaid tax, they will be exposed to the imposition of use-of- money interest. At present, there is no way taxpayers can avoid use-of-money interest without substantially overpaying their tax. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that many taxpayers consider that the rate of interest the government pays on tax overpayments to be too low and the rate it charges on underpayments too high. Tax pooling, as proposed in this bill, will allow businesses to pool provisional tax payments, offsetting underpayments by overpayments within the same pool, thereby reducing use-of-money interest exposure. The pooling arrangement will be made through a commercial intermediary, who will arrange for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset – participating taxpayers will pay or receive interest on their tax underpayments or overpayments. Intermediaries will be able to pay a higher rate of interest to taxpayers who have overpaid their tax into the pool, and charge a lower rate of interest to those who have underestimated their tax, and have therefore borrowed from the pool, than the rates of use-of-money interest. The commercial intermediaries make their money by arbitraging the interest rate differential between the department’s rates and their own (lower) financing costs. A number of submissions have been received on the proposal, covering a range of issues, substantive and technical. Almost all the submissions support the proposal, at least in principle. Several do so with the qualification that their first preference is that the government address what they see as the inequity of the current use-of-money interest rates. The view is also expressed that the government should concentrate on the development of administrative mechanisms that would more directly address difficulties in determining provisional tax. Many of the submissions either directly or indirectly focus on the issue of risk – for example, where the burden of risk should lie with respect to the security of taxpayers’ payments to a tax pooling intermediary, and what administrative steps might be taken to mitigate the risks associated with tax pooling. The question of compliance costs has also been raised – questioning whether the proposal actually increases, rather than reduces these. 4 In addition, there are a number of technical submissions intended to improve the workability of the proposal. Our recommended responses to these, and the other submissions, would necessarily result in a number of amendments being made to the proposed legislation, some reasonably substantive, and some of a more minor and consequential nature. 5 USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST RATES Clauses 37, 95 and 97 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 13 – Business New Zealand, 21W – KPMG, 31W – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Tax pooling does not address the inequity of the current use-of-money interest rates. The rate on underpayments should be reduced, and the gap between the underpayment and overpayment interest rates should be closed. Alternatively, the rates should be set according to a formula that better reflects the commercial borrowing cost of the taxpayer. Comment The objective of use-of-money interest is to compensate the relevant party (either the government or the taxpayer) for not having the use of its money. The formula for calculating the use-of-money interest rate on tax underpayments is based on the Reserve Bank business base lending rate series. This series tracks the base rates that major banks charge their corporate customers. For other borrowers, banks generally add a margin of between two and five percentage points. The margin represents a premium for the risk of default associated with a particular borrower. The underpayment use-of-money interest rate is inclusive of a margin of two percentage points, which is added to the Reserve Bank business base lending rate. This ensures that smaller businesses have an incentive to pay the correct amount of tax on time. The formula for calculating the use-of-money interest rate on tax overpayments is based on the Reserve Bank 90-day bank bill rate. The overpayment use-of-money interest rate reduces the 90-day bank bill rate by one percentage point, to discourage taxpayers from using Inland Revenue as an investment opportunity. The one percentage point margin also reduces the likelihood that the use-of-money interest overpayment rate will exceed the often-volatile 90-day bank bill rate. The key features of the use-of-money interest rules are that: • They apply regardless of the reason for overpaying or underpaying tax. • They underpin the provisional tax rules. • They recognise that Inland Revenue is an involuntary lender. • The same underpayment rate applies to taxpayers regardless of their creditworthiness. The use-of-money interest rate on tax underpayments is set at an appropriate rate reflecting the fact that Inland Revenue is an involuntary lender if taxpayers underpay. It is also an unsecured creditor in those circumstances. But unlike other trade creditors, Inland Revenue cannot stop taxpayers incurring further debt. 6 If the use-of-money interest rate on tax underpayments was reduced it would lead to a reduction in the efficiency of the provisional tax rules. The use-of-money interest rules have been very effective in ensuring that provisional taxpayers meet their tax liability on time during the income year. Use-of-money interest was extended to apply from the first provisional tax instalment date from the 1994-95 income year. Previously it had applied from the third provisional tax instalment date. The effect of this change has been that, in and after the 1994-95 year, the provisional tax payments at the first, second and third provisional tax dates have evened out. Lower interest costs on unpaid provisional tax could lead to significant deferrals, because those taxpayers whose cost of borrowing exceeds the use-of-money interest rate on tax underpayments might choose not to pay provisional tax. This in turn would raise the possibility that the unpopular and now repealed underestimation penalty might have to be reinstated to limit this type of behaviour, or that the “lack of reasonable care” shortfall penalty would be imposed on provisional tax estimates that were deemed to be too low. Using the same use-of-money interest rate on underpayments for all taxpayers means that the rate will always be too high for some taxpayers and too low for others. For example, the use-of-money interest rate on tax underpayments is still less than that applied by lenders who provide unsecured credit by way of credit card, and less than a bank’s unsecured small business and personal borrowing rate. The use-of-money interest rate on tax overpayments reflects the fact that Inland Revenue is not a financial intermediary and should not be treated as such by taxpayers. As with tax underpayments, Inland Revenue is an involuntary participant (this time, a borrower) if taxpayers overpay. When considering the use-of-money interest rate on tax overpayments, it should be recognised that taxpayers should not be in a position where they have an incentive to overpay tax, which is why the rate is less than those offered in the market. Also, it should reflect the fact that the overpayment of tax is not the government’s preferred method of borrowing. If the use-of-money interest rate on tax overpayments was increased it is quite likely that Inland Revenue would, in effect, become a target for taxpayers depositing funds, given the combination of a high interest rate and government guarantee. The levels of deposit that might occur may be significant, impacting on both financial markets and government debt management programmes. As noted, use-of-money interest rates are based on the relevant Reserve Bank series, which in turn are used by the market as underlying rates. As a result, the differential between use-of-money interest rates on tax underpayments and overpayments is, by and large, mirrored in the market. Reducing this differential would create an incentive for taxpayers to defer their tax obligations (if the underpayment rate was decreased) or to “bank” with the government (if the overpayment rate was increased). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 7 ALTERNATIVES FOR DETERMINING PROVISIONAL TAX Clause 37 Submission (13 – Business New Zealand, 31W – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Although pooling provisional tax may allow taxpayers to reduce exposure to use-of- money interest, the same result could be achieved more directly through the development of administrative mechanisms that address the difficulties in determining the correct amount of provisional tax. Comment The government is continuing to work on developing proposals to reduce the difficulties associated with determination of provisional tax. Several were raised in the discussion document More time for business, released in May last year. They included ways to match provisional tax payments with cash-flow – for example, by basing provisional tax on the value of GST sales, and aligning the payment dates with those for GST. Furthermore, tax pooling is designed not only to reduce taxpayer exposure to use-of- money interest, but also to provide taxpayers with flexibility in how they manage their tax payments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted – in addition to progressing the tax pooling proposal, we are working on ways to address the difficulties in determining the correct amount of provisional tax. 8 BURDEN OF RISK Clause 37 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21W – KPMG) Inland Revenue should shoulder some responsibility for the actions of an intermediary if there is a failure to pay tax on behalf of the taxpayer. The department should also put in place systems that will mitigate loss to taxpayers when default on the part of an intermediary has resulted in provisional tax payment obligations either not being met on time or not being met at all. For example, when necessary, tax pooling participants should be entitled to have the due date for payment of tax extended, with a corresponding delay in the date of imposition of any late payment penalties. Additionally, no refund from a tax pooling account should be made to an intermediary without sufficient explanation having been provided to Inland Revenue concerning the taxpayers the refund relates to and their provisional tax payment obligations. Furthermore, given that Inland Revenue will be approving the intermediaries, it should have an obligation to ensure the quality of those they approve, and better information on their attributes should be made available to participating taxpayers. Comment The onus for ensuring that tax payments have been made to Inland Revenue needs to remain on taxpayers, with the resolution of such issues as the transfer of taxpayers’ payments to Inland Revenue being made on time and the issuing of refunds to an intermediary, when necessary, remaining on a commercial footing between the intermediary and taxpayers. This will maintain intermediary accountability and the administrative benefits and savings that will flow to the government through introducing the proposal. It will also ensure that there will be no questions concerning the integrity of the tax system should an intermediary default occur. It is important to recognise that participation in a tax pool will be voluntary, and that many taxpayers will make the choice whether or not to enter a tax pool on the advice of their accountants. Also, many taxpayers already subject themselves to similar risks concerning their tax payments, in that they use their accountants to on-pay their tax to Inland Revenue. Participating taxpayers will be aware that payments that they have made to the intermediary do not satisfy their obligations to Inland Revenue. Where default on the part of an intermediary has resulted in a taxpayer’s provisional tax payment obligations not being met, the taxpayer will have recourse to the usual legal avenues for obtaining compensation from the intermediary. 9 The legislation does establish certain minimum criteria for intermediaries, for the purpose of promoting general confidence in tax pooling. Beyond this, however, matters pertaining to the commercial security of an intermediary’s tax pooling arrangements, such as certainty of treatment, ease of participation and privacy of taxpayer information, need to be dealt with at a commercial level, by way of contract between the intermediary and participating taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 10 COMPLIANCE COSTS Clause 37 Submission (21W – KPMG) The proposal will not reduce compliance costs, but will, in fact, raise them, as they introduce a new set of rules and associated expenses. Comment Participation in a tax pool will be voluntary – taxpayers will be free to choose whether or not the benefits flowing from participation outweigh the associated expenses. These benefits consist of the ability to better manage their provisional tax payments and to reduce their use-of-money interest costs. Currently, taxpayers have to pay their income tax liability by their terminal tax date. Often the amount actually due is uncertain, with the amount paid during the year as provisional tax reflecting the taxpayer’s best judgement of the law on a large number of technical issues. If taxpayers’ judgement of their liability is incorrect, and they have actually overpaid or underpaid tax, they will be exposed to use-of-money interest. At present, taxpayers cannot avoid use-of-money interest without substantially overpaying their tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 TIMING OF INTRODUCTION Clause 37 Submission (30 – Ian Kuperus) The proposed legislation currently provides that the tax pooling provisions apply for the 2003-04 and subsequent income years. For early balance date taxpayers this will be from February 2003. The proposed legislation should be amended to state that the provisions apply for all taxpayers from February 2003. Comment The proposed application, from the 2003-04 and subsequent income years, is required for administrative simplicity. This issue has been discussed with the submitter, who agrees with this position. It has also been agreed that persons wishing to act as pooling intermediaries should be allowed to apply to the Commissioner for approval to do so from the date of assent of the bill – the proposed legislation already provides for this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 12 SECURITY OF TAX POOLING FUNDS Clause 37 Submission (21W – KPMG) The nature of a tax pooling account should be that of a trust holding funds on behalf of the Crown. Comment The current wording of the proposed legislation already states that payments made to a tax pooling account must be legally secure, that is, held on trust on behalf of the contributing taxpayers. Beyond this, matters pertaining to the commercial security of intermediaries’ tax pooling arrangements are most appropriately left as a matter of contract between the intermediary and participating taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 13 CONFUSION OF PERSONS Clause 37 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The wording of the proposed section MBA 3(1)(e) needs to be amended, to clarify its intent. Comment The proposed section MBA 3(1)(e) is intended to provide that it must be made clear to participating taxpayers that payments made to an intermediary will not satisfy the taxpayer’s obligations to Inland Revenue. We agree that this intention needs to be made clearer, to avoid confusion over this point. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 14 ESTABLISHMENT OF TAX POOLING ACCOUNT Clause 37 Submission (21W – KPMG) The wording of the proposed section MBA 4(1) needs to be amended, to clarify its intent. Comment Section MBA 4(1) currently merely provides that a tax pooling account must be established with Inland Revenue. The wording needs to be changed to make it clear that the provision applies only to a person who has received approval to do so under section MBA 3. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 15 SIZE OF POOLS Clause 37 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21W – KPMG) The restriction to pools of 100 or more participating taxpayers is unnecessary, inappropriate and difficult to apply in practice. Commercial factors should determine pool size. Alternatively, if the restriction is still to apply, then the rules should provide for temporary breaches. Comment It is necessary to require a minimum size for pools in order to prevent burgeoning administrative costs associated with intermediaries establishing multiple pools, with only a few participants in each. A minimum pool size of at least 100 taxpayers will allow individual accountants to establish pools for their clients, while reducing the risk of multiplicity of pools. Larger taxpayers, who otherwise might want to have a separate pool for themselves, may have the ability to participate in a pool though their tax accountant. Moreover, in the longer term the restriction may not be relevant anyway, as larger pools will tend to have lower administrative costs and less risk for participants. The provision is already worded in a way which allows the Commissioner administrative flexibility in applying the restriction. However, to further ease application of the rule, we recommend that the legislation include the requirement for the Commissioner to give 30 days’ notice to an intermediary before winding up a pool owing to insufficient numbers. Recommendation That the submission to remove the restriction be declined. However, the proposed legislation should be amended to include a requirement for the Commissioner to give 30 days’ notice to an intermediary before winding up a pool owing to insufficient numbers of pool participants. 16 CONTRACTING WITH AN INTERMEDIARY Clause 37 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers ) The ability to enter into a tax pooling arrangement should not be restricted to only those transactions where the participant pays money to an intermediary. Additionally, the provision providing for this contracting should be redrafted to assist clarity. Comment We agree that ability to enter into a tax pooling arrangement should not be restricted to only those transactions where the participant pays money to an intermediary. Payment between the participant and the intermediary is a commercial matter, the form of which should be left as the concern of the two contracting parties. We also agree that the relevant subsection should be redrafted to assist clarity. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 17 COMMUNICATION OF ENTRY AND EXIT FROM THE TAX POOLING RULES Clause 37 Submission (21W – KPMG) A provision should be inserted requiring that a taxpayer advise Inland Revenue when entering and exiting the tax pooling rules. Comment The proposed legislation already requires that, when a deposit is made to a tax pooling account, the intermediary must provide the Commissioner with written details concerning the names and tax file numbers of contributing taxpayers, along with the amount of their payments. This provides the department with sufficient notice that the taxpayer will be participating in a tax pooling arrangement. It also provides taxpayers with the ability to check with the department, if they so desire, whether the intermediary has deposited the payment into the tax pooling account, as instructed by the taxpayer. The department has no administrative need for information advising that a taxpayer has ceased to participate in a tax pool. It is also worth noting that one of the intended advantages arising from tax pooling is that taxpayers who chose to participate will actually reduce their need to communicate with Inland Revenue regarding their income tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 18 INDIVIDUAL TAX ACCOUNT OBLIGATIONS Clause 37 Submission (21W – KPMG) The proposed legislation needs to be prescriptive in relation to individual tax account obligations. Comment We agree that the proposed legislation should be clarified in relation to its intended application to individual tax account obligations. For example, it needs to clearly set out the rules governing transfers from a tax pooling account to an individual taxpayer’s tax account. However, once a transfer is made from a tax pooling account to an individual taxpayer’s account, it becomes “tax paid” for that taxpayer, and the usual tax rules will then apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, to the extent that it calls for a clarification of the application of the proposed legislation to individual tax account obligations. 19 INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF AMOUNTS PAID INTO A TAX POOL Clause 37 Submission (30 – Ian Kuperus) The bill does not address the issue of how amounts paid to a tax pooling intermediary that are in the nature of tax will be treated for income tax purposes. The income tax legislation should be amended to provide that such amounts are not deductible, and also to provide that amounts paid that are in the nature of interest are deductible. Comment The income tax legislation already contains rules that will provide for the proper treatment of payments to an intermediary, in terms of ensuring that amounts paid that are in the nature of tax are not deductible. This has been discussed with the submitter, who agrees with this position. We agree that, in order to remove any uncertainty, the proposed legislation should be amended to provide explicitly that payments to an intermediary that are in the nature of interest are deductible. Following further consideration, we also recommend that the proposed legislation be amended to ensure that the resident withholding tax treatment of interest paid to and by an intermediary mirrors that applied to use-of-money interest generally – that is, intermediaries will be required to withhold the tax from interest payments made to taxpayers, but taxpayers will not be required to withhold the tax when making interest payments to intermediaries. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, to the extent that it recommends that the proposed legislation be amended to provide that payments to an intermediary that are in the nature of interest are deductible, and to ensure that the resident withholding tax rules apply appropriately. 20 EARLY WARNING SYSTEM Clause 37 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Commissioner should be required to issue a statement to the taxpayer when deposits are made to the tax pooling account, to confirm the amount and date of receipt. Comment We agree that the proposed legislation should provide participating taxpayers with the ability to obtain confirmation that their payments have been correctly deposited into a tax pooling account. The proposed legislation already requires that when a deposit is made to a tax pooling account, the intermediary must provide the Commissioner with written details concerning the names and tax file numbers of contributing taxpayers, along with the amount of their payments. This will enable taxpayers to check with the department whether their payments have been deposited correctly by the intermediary. To remove any potential uncertainty concerning application of the secrecy provisions, we recommend that the proposed legislation be amended so that the Commissioner can provide this information to taxpayers when requested. We recommend that, in addition, the proposed legislation be amended to state that the Commissioner must provide the intermediary with confirmation of the deposit details. This will enable taxpayers to check also with their tax pooling intermediary whether their payments have been deposited correctly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, to the extent that it calls for participating taxpayers to have the ability to obtain confirmation whether their payments have been correctly deposited into a tax pooling account. To remove any uncertainty concerning application of the secrecy provisions, we also recommend that the proposed legislation be amended to allow the Commissioner to provide this information to taxpayers when requested. 21 DETAILS OF CONTRIBUTING TAXPAYERS Clauses 37 and 81 Submission (21W – KPMG) Intermediaries should not be required to provide the Commissioner with details concerning contributing taxpayers, but instead should merely be obliged to retain this information for inspection, if required. Even more preferable, intermediaries should not be obliged to retain this information at all. Comment The requirement that the intermediary provide details concerning contributing taxpayers ensures that tax pooling participants have the ability to check with the department, if they so desire, whether their payment has been deposited into the tax pooling account, as instructed. This information is also required by the government, for revenue forecasting purposes. It is important that the government knows the total income tax taxpayers consider they may have to pay each year. Under tax pooling this would be a combination of the total of any tax payments made by participants to Inland Revenue and any made to tax pooling intermediaries. If it were not possible for Inland Revenue to monitor contributions to a tax pool, trends in government revenue would be more difficult to determine. We note that the proposed legislation currently states that the details concerning contributing taxpayers need to be provided to the Commissioner in writing. This is, in fact, inconsistent with the requirement in the proposed legislation that transfer requests, and the provision of associated information, be made by electronic means, in a format prescribed by the Commissioner. This inconsistency needs to be addressed, by ensuring that the same requirements apply to both. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the proposed legislation be amended to state that details provided by intermediaries to the Commissioner concerning contributing taxpayers be made by electronic means, in a format prescribed by the Commissioner. 22 AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR TRANSFERS Clause 37 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The wording of the proposed section MBA 6(1) needs to be amended to clarify its intent, with respect to the availability of funds for transfer. Comment The proposed section currently states that, for a transfer to be made from a tax pooling account, the amount to be transferred must exist, or have existed, on the effective date of the transfer – that is, the date it is to be credited to the taxpayer’s account. This is too general. The wording needs to be changed to make it clear that the funds have to be in the tax pooling account on that date. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 23 FREQUENCY OF ACTIONING OF TRANSFERS Clause 37 Submission (21W – KPMG) An intermediary should be able to request the actioning of a transfer at any time. Comment The proposed legislation is intended to limit the making of requests for the actioning of transfers to once a month. This restriction was considered necessary to avoid the administrative cost that might be associated with multiple requests being made each month. The drafting in the bill reflects our original view that intermediaries will generally only need to make requests monthly in any case, given that provisional tax obligations fall only once a month, on the seventh of each month. Also, we considered that as transfer requests would usually be retrospective in nature, intermediaries and taxpayers would generally not be negatively affected by this restriction anyway. Following further consideration, however, we agree that the limitation is strict, does not leave any room for flexibility and should, therefore, be waived. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 24 EFFECTIVE DATE OF TRANSFERS Clause 37 Submission (30 – Ian Kuperus) The wording of the proposed legislation needs to be amended to clarify its intent with respect to the effective date of transfers. Comment We agree that the proposed legislation should be clarified, to make clear the intention that transfers from a tax pool will generally be credited to a taxpayer’s account as at the effective date of transfer. The only exception to this will be where a taxpayer’s terminal tax date has passed, and the taxpayer is exposed to penalties for failing to meet minimum provisional tax obligations. In this case, any request for a transfer from a tax pool will be treated as being made at the date of the request, not the effective payment date. This is necessary to ensure that the taxpayer is not able to gain an unfair advantage by utilising the tax pooling rules to offset resulting penalties and use-of-money interest. (This aspect of the rules is dealt with under a separate submission.) Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 25 TRANSFERS BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS Clause 37 Submission (10 – The New Zealand Retailers Association, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Consideration should be given to moving towards allowing tax credits to be traded without first requiring that all parties be members of the same or any pool. A first move in this direction would be to liberalise the definition of “associated person” for the purpose of allowing transfers between associates. Comment Comprehensive new rules governing the transfer of overpaid tax were enacted in October. The new rules resolve many of the uncertainties previously surrounding such transfers. With respect to transfers from one taxpayer to another, the effective date of transfer will differ depending on the degree of association between the transferor and the transferee. The submission seeks an amendment to those rules to extend the list of taxpayers who may make backdated transfers. Officials have previously recommended against this and continue to do so primarily because of the administrative impact. The tax pooling provisions are targeted at taxpayers who cannot make backdated transfers under the new transfer rules. Allowing tax credits to be traded without first requiring that all parties be members of the same pool would significantly undermine the legislative intent of these new rules. We do note, however, that although the proposed legislation is intended to place this restriction on the making of transfers, it does not currently do so. We recommend, therefore, that it be amended to rectify this point. Recommendation That the submission be declined, and that the proposed legislation be amended to codify the intent that tax credits may only be traded between members of the same tax pool. 26 AVAILABILITY AND TIMING OF IMPUTATION CREDITS Clause 37 Submission (21W – KPMG, 30 – Ian Kuperus) The proposed legislation needs to make it clear that transfers to individual tax accounts qualify for imputation credits under the consolidation rules. Additionally, the imputation credits should arise to a taxpayer’s imputation credit account at the time the request for a transfer is received by the Commissioner. Comment We agree that the wording of the proposed legislation should be amended to make these matters clear. It was always the policy intention that transfers to individual tax accounts qualify for imputation credits, where appropriate. Setting the timing of the imputation credit at the time when a transfer is requested avoids uncertainty for taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 27 SANCTIONS FOR FAILING TO MAINTAIN APPROVAL CRITERIA Clause 37 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21W – KPMG) There needs to be some form of sanction against people who operate a tax pooling arrangement that fails to maintain the approval criteria. The Commissioner should be able to apply a penalty if the requirements are breached. Comment The proposed legislation already allows the Commissioner to wind up an intermediary’s tax pooling operations if there is a breach of its obligations to the Commissioner or the taxpayer. Additionally, if appropriate, the Commissioner will be able to apply the usual criminal penalties provided for in the income tax legislation. We do recommend, however, that the proposed legislation be amended to provide that, in addition to being able to wind up a tax pooling account if an intermediary breaches its obligations, the Commissioner should also be able to remove the intermediary’s approved intermediary status. We also recommend that the proposed legislation be amended to clarify that the Commissioner can exercise these powers if an intermediary fails to maintain the requirements that it must meet for initial approval as a tax pooling intermediary – for example, the holding of taxpayers’ payments on trust, safeguarding of the privacy of taxpayer information and the maintaining of adequate record-keeping systems relating to taxpayers’ payments. The proposed legislation does not currently make this clear. Recommendation That the submission be declined. However, the proposed legislation should be amended to provide the Commissioner with the power to remove an intermediary’s approved status, when appropriate, and to clarify when the Commissioner can exercise his powers of sanction. 28 WINDING UP OF A TAX POOLING ACCOUNT Clause 37 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21W – KPMG) Formal rules should be put in place governing the winding up of a tax pooling account. Additionally, a taxpayer’s deposit to a tax pooling account should be automatically transferred to the taxpayer’s individual tax account if the pool is wound up before the intermediary makes the requested transfer itself. Comment The proposed legislation already requires that an intermediary maintain adequate records to ensure that the correct amount will be paid back to a taxpayer if a tax pooling account is wound up. Nevertheless, we do agree that the proposed legislation should be amended to provide that, where a tax pooling account has been wound up and Inland Revenue has reason to believe that the pooling account funds may not be distributed back to the contributing taxpayers in the correct amounts, it should have the discretion to apply to the court for directions as to the redistribution of the funds. Beyond this, however, matters pertaining to the commercial security of intermediaries’ tax pooling arrangements, including the procedures to be followed upon the winding up of a tax pool, are most appropriately left as a matter of contract between the intermediary and participating taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the proposed legislation be amended to provide the Commissioner with the discretion to apply to the Court for directions as to the redistribution of pool funds upon winding up, when appropriate. 29 RECOVERY OF TAX Clauses 37 and 124 Submission (21W – KPMG) Inland Revenue already has recourse under section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 when it is seeking to recover amounts of tax owing. It is not necessary, therefore, to include amounts paid to an intermediary as “income tax” for the purposes of this section. Comment Under the proposed legislation, a payment made by a taxpayer to a tax pooling account does not constitute income tax – it only becomes “tax paid” once it is transferred to the taxpayer’s individual tax account. Consequently, a payment to a tax pooling account would not be “income tax” for the purposes of section 157 unless specifically provided for in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 30 INTERACTION WITH THE PENALTY RULES Clause 37 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 30 – Ian Kuperus) The proposed legislation provides that, for the purpose of the penalty rules, a transfer from a tax pooling account is to be treated as being paid to Inland Revenue on the date of the transfer, not the effective payment date. This seems to conflict with the general intention of the proposed legislation, which is to treat transfers as being made on the effective payment date elected by the intermediary. The section should either be amended, or removed. Comment The underlying rationale of the pooling proposal is to provide taxpayers with the ability to better manage their provisional tax payments and to reduce their use-of- money interest costs. This rationale must, however, be balanced with the need to ensure that taxpayers maintain reasonable compliance with the provisional tax rules. In actuality, these considerations are not in conflict. Within reasonable parameters taxpayers should still be able to enjoy considerably more flexibility in terms of managing their provisional tax payments than they do at present, along with the ability to reduce their use-of-money interest costs. The proposed legislation is intended to reflect this position. However, we recognise that it needs to be clarified to make it clear that when taxpayers fail to meet their minimum provisional tax obligations on a continuing basis, they should not be able to gain an unfair advantage from the proposal. For these taxpayers, at a certain point in time, the ability to offset resulting use-of-money interest and penalties should cease. We recommend that this point be reached within a reasonable period beyond a taxpayer’s terminal tax date – by this stage the taxpayer should have met provisional tax payment obligations for the income year. In practice, what this will mean is that, once a period of 60 days beyond the terminal tax date has passed, if a taxpayer is exposed to penalties for failing to meet minimum provisional tax payment obligations, any request for a transfer will be treated as being made at the date of the request, not the effective payment date, for both use-of-money interest and penalty purposes. However, where taxpayers have complied with their minimum obligations, but beyond 60 days following terminal tax date still find themselves owing tax (that is, after a reassessment) they will be able to utilise the tax pooling rules to offset any potential penalties and use-of-money interest. We recommend that the proposed legislation be amended to reflect this position. 31 Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the proposed legislation be amended to make it clear that when taxpayers fail to meet their minimum provisional tax obligations on a continuing basis, they are not able to gain an unfair advantage by utilising the tax pooling rules to offset resulting penalties and use-of-money interest. 32 APPLICATION OF THE USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST PROVISIONS Clauses 37, 95 and 97 Submission (30 – Ian Kuperus) The proposed legislation needs to be clarified, in terms of the way the use-of-money interest provisions will apply to intermediaries and participating taxpayers generally, and in particular to deposits to tax pooling accounts, and refunds and transfers. Comment We agree that the proposed legislation should be clarified, in terms of the way the use-of-money interest provisions are intended to apply. For example, it needs to clearly provide that use-of-money interest will be calculated, on a daily basis, on the credit balance of a tax pooling account. It also needs to clearly provide for the allocation of interest between an intermediary and participating taxpayers, with respect to transfers. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, to the extent that it calls for a clarification of the application of the use-of-money interest rules to tax pooling. 33 GST TREATMENT OF TAX POOLING INTERMEDIARIES Clauses 37 Submission (30 – Ian Kuperus) The bill does not address the issue of GST in relation to tax pooling. Tax pooling services should be zero-rated for GST purposes. Comment Tax pooling services should be subject to the same GST rules as other services. If they are financial services, they will be exempt from GST. In October this year the government released a discussion document on the GST treatment of financial services. This document proposes that the provision of certain financial services to businesses be zero-rated. Resulting legislation is expected to take effect sometime in late 2004 / early 2005. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 34 CLARIFICATION OF STATUS OF PARTIES Clauses 37 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed section MBA 2 should be amended to more clearly convey the absence of a Crown guarantee with respect to the security of taxpayers’ payments to a tax pooling intermediary. Comment The proposed section MBA 2 is intended to convey the absence of a Crown guarantee with respect to the security of taxpayers’ payments to a tax pooling intermediary. It does so, but only to a limited extent. The onus for ensuring that tax payments have been made to Inland Revenue will remain on taxpayers, with the resolution of such issues as the security of taxpayers’ payments to a tax pooling intermediary remaining on a commercial footing between the intermediary and taxpayers. This will maintain intermediary accountability, and the administrative benefits and savings that will flow to the government through introducing the proposal. It will also ensure that there will be no questions concerning the integrity of the tax system should intermediary default occur. It is important that the legislation adequately reflect this intent, sufficiently safeguards the Crown’s position, and clarifies the status of intermediaries. A new provision should be inserted, replacing the existing section, that properly codifies this position. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 35 PAYE by intermediaries 37 OVERVIEW The bill introduces an initiative that will allow employers to engage accredited intermediaries to largely assume an employer’s obligations under the PAYE rules – the “PAYE by intermediaries” initiative. The intermediary would be responsible for calculating PAYE, paying it and filing returns. The initiative was raised in a discussion document, More time for business, released in May 2001 in response to two compliance issues raised by employers: the time spent keeping up to date with PAYE requirements and the risk that PAYE deductions are not available to be paid to Inland Revenue when due. A number of submissions were received on the proposal, covering both general and technical issues. In addition, officials have consulted with other interested groups. Submissions welcomed the proposal, and some commented that the initiative was indicative of the high compliance costs currently placed on employers. A number of the submissions were also concerned with the risk to employers of engaging disreputable PAYE intermediaries, and suggestions were made to exclude such persons from the scope of the new rules. Technical submissions were also received in relation to how the rules should allow PAYE intermediaries to operate – for instance, the requirement for PAYE intermediaries to hold funds paid over by employers on trust and how these funds could be applied, the various obligations of PAYE intermediaries under the new rules, and sanctions for failure to comply with these rules. Submissions also suggested a number of drafting changes to the legislation in the bill. Officials have also recommended a number of changes designed to improve the workability of the initiative. The main changes we have recommended are extending the application date for the new rules and removing software certification from the accreditation criteria for PAYE intermediaries. The first change is necessary for Inland Revenue to provide an electronic administrative system to support the work of PAYE intermediaries, and in consultation with potential intermediaries, they supported extending the application date on this basis. Officials have also requested permission to make a number of amendments to improve the technical clarity of the legislation. 38 GENERAL SUBMISSIONS Issue: Employers face high compliance costs Clause 45 Submission (5 – Datacom, 10 – NZ Retailers Association, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 13 – Business New Zealand, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21W – KPMG) All submissions supported the proposal, but some expressed specific concerns that: • employers’ PAYE responsibilities are too difficult and the government should urgently review the tax obligations imposed on employers and amend the law to ensure that the compliance obligations imposed on employers is reasonable (KPMG); • the government should contribute to employers’ time and cost in meeting these obligations (KPMG); • Inland Revenue should be more forthcoming in providing advice and assistance to employers (Business New Zealand); and • there are likely to be costs for businesses from using intermediaries (Business New Zealand). Comment A review of the tax withholding obligations on employers is outside the scope of this tax simplification initiative. Although it is recognised that the PAYE system imposes compliance costs on employers, the source deduction mechanism is the best currently available for ensuring tax is deducted accurately from wage and salary income and paid to Inland Revenue on time. Inland Revenue research indicates that employers find the current system easier to comply with than previous models. The present system also supports important compliance cost reduction initiatives – most recently, the removal of requirements to file end-of-year tax returns for approximately 1.5 million wage and salary earners. The PAYE by intermediaries’ initiative is designed to offer more options for employers to mitigate the compliance costs imposed by, and risks associated with, the PAYE system. 39 In relation to the submission that employers’ costs from applying the PAYE rules should be reimbursed, it should be noted that businesses are already indirectly remunerated for their tax withholding function through the cash-flow advantage of retaining tax deductions before they are required to be paid to Inland Revenue. The proposed initiative will simply allow this benefit to be traded for lower compliance costs and less risk. Remunerating employers would also raise the issue of remunerating individual taxpayers and other intermediaries in the tax system, such as banks. In relation to the submission that Inland Revenue should provide more support to employers, the department already provides a number of employer and small business support services, including tax advisory services, business kits and technical support for businesses that use Inland Revenue’s electronic returns filing system. While these services are designed to reduce the risk of employers failing to comply with their tax obligations, the PAYE by intermediaries’ initiative is different in that it will allow businesses to be largely removed from the PAYE rules and the associated risks. Officials accept that the new service may come at a cost to employers: either the loss of the use of PAYE deductions before they are paid to Inland Revenue or a fixed fee charged by intermediaries. However, as correctly pointed out by Business New Zealand, businesses that are likely to engage a PAYE intermediary will do so because they consider the compliance cost savings to be significantly greater than the costs involved. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application date Clauses 35, 45-53, 56-58, 65(23), 67(7), 76, 80, 85, 96, 106, 119, 123, 124(4), 125- 127, 131, 146-150, 152-154, 156-159, 162-163, 164(12) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date of the proposed “PAYE by intermediaries” initiative should be extended from 1 April 2003 to 1 April 2004. Comment The application date in the bill presupposes using the current PAYE administration systems to support the tax simplification initiative. Although the bill envisages payments and returns will be made electronically, the current PAYE systems have several components that are paper based and rely on manual intervention. Given the number of employers that an intermediary could act on behalf of, using the current system to administer the initiative has the potential to overwhelm PAYE 40 intermediaries with multiple notifications in paper form and create unnecessary delays for them. Extending the application date by one year will allow a new end-to-end electronic system to be built to support the initiative. The administrative process including registration, filing returns, making payments, acknowledging payments and returns, incorporating amended assessments and issuing refunds could be done electronically and with fewer delays. We consider that such an electronic system would reduce compliance costs for PAYE intermediaries and be more administratively efficient. In discussions with Inland Revenue, potential PAYE intermediaries have expressed a strong preference for a delay in the application date so that the initiative can be supported electronically. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 41 ACCREDITATION REQUIREMENTS Issue: Software certification Clause 45 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The requirement for Inland Revenue to certify the payroll software used by a PAYE intermediary, under proposed new section NBA 2(2) should be removed. Comment Under the proposed new section NBA 2(2), Inland Revenue will be required to certify that a person’s payroll software used to calculate PAYE complies with the PAYE rules, before the intermediary is accredited as a PAYE intermediary. After discussion with a number of payroll software developers, we consider that this aspect of accreditation will not offer sufficient security to either employers or the revenue in a way that outweighs the potentially significant administrative costs to Inland Revenue. In particular, we are concerned that software accreditation will be subject to widespread misuse, with many software developers seeking software certification not because they want to operate as PAYE intermediaries, but rather to have their software “ticked off” by Inland Revenue to improve its marketability. If the proposed legislation is enacted in its current form it is expected that almost all providers of these products will seek to have their software certified so as not to lose out to competitors. Inland Revenue does not have the resources to meet this level of demand. In particular, there is a significant danger that Inland Revenue’s limited computer tax audit resources would be tied up indefinitely in this area, instead of carrying out more high-value investigations. Instead of software certification, we recommend using Inland Revenue’s normal audit processes to check PAYE intermediaries’ compliance with the PAYE rules. This would be similar to the way Inland Revenue currently audits large employers and payroll firms. We consider that while this will ensure that taxpayers operating as PAYE intermediaries are subject to the desired level of scrutiny, it will not unnecessarily divert Inland Revenue’s resources. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 42 Issue: Misappropriation of funds Clause 45 Submission (21W – KPMG) People who are discharged or undischarged bankrupts, who are not eligible to be company directors or who have been convicted of fraudulent offences should not be PAYE intermediaries or a member of a PAYE intermediary. Comment The submission argues that the rules in proposed new section NBA 2 provide very little comfort or protection from someone establishing themselves as an intermediary and then misappropriating funds. Officials agree that the categories of persons listed in the submission should not be allowed to be a PAYE intermediary. Officials have raised this issue with potential PAYE intermediaries, and they have agreed that such exclusion criteria would be a good idea. However, to be workable, the exclusion should be limited to principals and directors of PAYE intermediaries. Otherwise it would create significant compliance costs if the criteria had to be applied to all their staff, regardless of their position within their organisation. Officials consider that persons applying for accreditation as a PAYE intermediary should be responsible for evaluating whether they do not meet the exclusion criteria and give appropriate notice to Inland Revenue. Recommendation An amendment should be made to prevent people who are discharged or undischarged bankrupts, those who are not eligible to be company directors or who have been convicted of fraudulent offences from being a PAYE intermediary, or a director or principal of a PAYE intermediary. Issue: Revocation of accreditation Clause 45 Submission (21W – KPMG) Liquidation, receivership, transfer of incorporation, bankruptcy and conviction for fraud should all trigger revocation of accreditation. 43 Rules are required to ensure that funds held by a PAYE intermediary are returned to the appropriate employer if the intermediary has its accreditation revoked. Alternatively, the intermediary should be continued under statutory management (while issues arising from the revocation of accreditation are resolved) and also if the Commissioner is not satisfied with the performance of the intermediary. Comment Officials agree that liquidation, receivership, transfer of incorporation, bankruptcy and conviction for fraud of a PAYE intermediary should result in revocation of accreditation. We also consider that Inland Revenue should have the power to revoke accreditation if a person’s disclosure when applying to be accredited as a PAYE intermediary is subsequently found to be false. The second submission relates to money held by the PAYE intermediary at the time when accreditation is revoked. The bill deals with a similar situation – when a PAYE intermediary and employer cease their arrangement. In that case the PAYE intermediary is required to distribute any funds still held by it, and apply the PAYE rules in relation to those funds, as though it was still acting as an intermediary for that employer. We consider that this is the most appropriate way to deal with the funds held by an intermediary when its accreditation is revoked. Inland Revenue will also have to make employers aware that their PAYE intermediary has lost its accreditation and the effect of this on arrangements with the intermediary. Officials consider that any arrangements should come to an end by fourteen days after Inland Revenue provides the notice to employers. In relation to the issue of statutory management of failed PAYE intermediaries, under the Corporations (Investigation and Management) Act 1989 and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989, only the Securities Commission and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, respectively, are allowed to recommend that persons be placed under statutory management. A change to allow Inland Revenue to recommend that PAYE intermediaries be put under statutory management would not be feasible because Inland Revenue does not have the expertise to determine when statutory management is appropriate, as opposed to other courses of action. Inland Revenue’s new role would also overlap (and potentially impinge on) those of the Securities Commission and Reserve Bank – for example, if Inland Revenue sees statutory management as a viable option and the Securities Commission does not. Further, officials consider that the powers available to Inland Revenue under the Tax Administration Act 1994 to deal with defaulting taxpayers are sufficient to deal with defaulting or non-performing intermediaries. Recommendation That an amendment be made to: • give Inland Revenue the power to revoke accreditation on the basis of liquidation, receivership, transfer of incorporation, bankruptcy and conviction for fraud of a PAYE intermediary, and also if a person has made a false declaration when applying to be accredited as a PAYE intermediary; 44 • distribute any funds paid over by an employer and held by a person that has lost accreditation as a PAYE intermediary and apply the PAYE rules in relation to those funds as though the person were still a PAYE intermediary; • require Inland Revenue to give notice to employers that a PAYE intermediary acting on their behalf has lost its accreditation; and • deem arrangements between employers and their PAYE intermediary to have ceased by fourteen days after that notice is issued. That the submission that Inland Revenue should be able to recommend statutory management to run the affairs of a non-performing PAYE intermediary or one who has had their accreditation revoked be declined. 45 INTERMEDIARIES’ TRUST ACCOUNTS Issue: Deposits to and withdrawals from trust accounts Clause 45 Submission (5 – Datacom, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21W – KPMG) The requirement that gross wages should be deposited into the trust account should be changed so that only PAYE deductions are required to be deposited into the account. Also, PAYE intermediaries should be able to use money from the trust account to pay third parties on behalf of employees. (Datacom) An amendment is required to proposed new section NBA 6 to allow withdrawals from the trust account: • with the approval of the employer and the Commissioner; and (KPMG) • if calculation errors occur. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The option to make payments directly from the employer to Inland Revenue, once the liability is notified by the intermediary, should also be available. (KPMG) Comment Datacom has commented that in virtually all instances employees’ net salary and wages is debited from the employer’s bank account and credited into employees’ bank accounts in the same transaction. The funds, therefore, do not spend any time in any other account and would not be able to go through a trust account. Similarly, if an employer elected to pay an employee in cash, those funds would not be deposited in the trust account. Officials recognise that commercial considerations may make it efficient for a PAYE intermediary to facilitate a direct transfer of net wages from employers’ bank account to the accounts of their employees. Nevertheless, the requirement for employers to pay over gross wages (that is, net wages and PAYE) and for intermediaries to hold these amounts on trust exists to mitigate the risk that employers will pay net wages to their employees but not the PAYE deduction to Inland Revenue. Under this proposed initiative, some of the risk that PAYE deductions are not paid moves from employers to the government. This risk is partially offset by the requirement that PAYE deductions be made from any salary or wages paid over by employers. If the requirement for gross salary or wages to be paid into the trust account is removed, this offsetting effect will also be removed. If an employer pays an employee in cash, the PAYE intermediary will not have responsibility for applying the PAYE rules for that employee in respect of that payment. 46 Datacom points out that it is essential that an intermediary be able to receive and pay out funds in addition to tax deductions. Examples of such payments are healthcare premiums, union fees and payments to contributory superannuation schemes. It also says that many employers will wish to make only one payment to the intermediary for net wages, PAYE deductions, payments on behalf of employees to third parties and intermediaries’ fees. It would be difficult, in practice, to legislate for all of the types of payees that PAYE intermediaries could make payments to on behalf of employees without creating significant opportunities for the misappropriation of funds. Similarly, seeking Inland Revenue’s approval for payment to these payees individually would also be impractical. Officials therefore consider that the best option would be to introduce a provision that clarifies that funds paid by employers into the trust account are held by the PAYE intermediary as trustee for the benefit of employees and Inland Revenue. This formulation will allow intermediaries to apply the funds to third parties on behalf of employees. The PAYE by intermediaries initiative relies on the interest being available to be used by intermediaries to offset the cost of providing their services to employers. Therefore, the new provision would also have to stipulate that any interest earned on the trust account will be paid to intermediaries. Officials have discussed this matter with Datacom, who now agrees with the proposed provision. With respect to the ability to make withdrawals from the trust account for overpayments, fees and other unforeseen expenses, officials consider that such permutations would overly complicate the administration of the account and make it difficult to monitor and manage. Therefore we consider that intermediaries and employers should make alternative arrangements on a commercial basis. For example, overpayments could be applied towards future payments or paid to Inland Revenue, who could then refund the payment to the employer. Officials consider the option of paying PAYE deductions directly from employers’ accounts to Inland Revenue would be legislating for current practice. While this option would also move the PAYE risk to the government, it would do so without any of the benefits to government of intermediaries receiving the PAYE deductions at the time that net salary or wages are paid to employees. It is, therefore, not supported by officials. Recommendation That an amendment be made to clarify that gross salary or wages paid by employers to PAYE intermediaries are to be held on trust by intermediaries for the benefit of employees and Inland Revenue. The amendment should also specify that interest earned on the trust account should accrue to the trustee. 47 That submissions suggesting amendments be made to: • allow withdrawals from the trust account with either the approval of the employer and the Commissioner or if calculations errors occur; and • allow the option of making payments directly from employers to Inland Revenue be declined. Issue: Reference to trust account in new section NBA 5 Clause 45 Submission (21W – KPMG) The requirement to establish and maintain a trust account should be added to new section NBA 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Comment Officials agree that the bill should be amended to include the requirement for persons applying to become accredited as PAYE intermediaries to establish and maintain a trust account with a bank registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989. Recommendation That the bill be amended to include a requirement in new part NBA for a person applying to be accredited as a PAYE intermediary to establish and maintain a trust account with a bank registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989. 48 OBLIGATIONS OF AN INTERMEDIARY Issue: Use of an intermediary for all employees of an employer Clause 45 Submission (5 – Datacom) The requirement for all employees of an employer to be handled by a PAYE intermediary should be removed. Comment The submission points out that employers may use more than one payroll service provider or have different payroll systems for processing different employees – for example, an “in-house” system for the majority of staff and a payroll firm for its executive payroll. The requirement in the bill reflects limitations in the administration system that existed at the time the legislation was drafted. Those limitations have now been removed and therefore officials agree that the requirement can be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying the role of an intermediary Clause 45 Submission (5 – Datacom) If an employer engages a PAYE intermediary but does the PAYE calculation themselves, using calculation tools provided by the intermediary, the intermediary’s responsibility should only be that of ensuring that the PAYE calculated by the employer is paid to Inland Revenue on time and that returns relating to the payment have been made. Comment Officials consider that if an employer uses a PAYE intermediary’s calculation tools then the intermediary should be responsible for the calculation. That is, responsibility for the calculation must rest with those responsible for the calculation mechanism. The employer should be responsible only if the raw data exported into the tool is incorrect. 49 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (Matter raised by officials) The legislation should be clarified so it is clear that a person is a PAYE intermediary only if accredited as a PAYE intermediary by the Commissioner and the person assumes employer’s responsibilities under the PAYE rules. Comment The intention of the PAYE by intermediaries’ initiative is to transfer the entirety of employers’ PAYE obligations to willing third parties, thereby limiting employers’ risk exposure to the incorrect provision of employee information and payment of employee compensation to PAYE intermediaries. It was never the intention that the initiative would support the partial transfer of employers’ PAYE obligations to third parties – for example, employers retaining the PAYE calculation function (and the responsibility for that function) while passing on the payment and returns filing obligations (as well as the respective responsibilities) to third parties. Such a system would be very complex, especially in relation to assigning responsibility for complying with the different aspects of the PAYE rules, as employers’ responsibilities would then exceed that of simply providing employee information and gross salary and wages to an intermediary. As drafted, the proposed legislation is not clear, however, in preventing the outcomes discussed above. That is, there is no legislative exclusion from the proposed rules in part NBA for persons accredited as PAYE intermediaries, but who do not assume all of the obligations placed on an employer under the PAYE rules. Officials recommend clarifying the legislation in the bill so that it is clear that a person is a PAYE intermediary only if accredited as a PAYE intermediary and the person assumes all of an employer’s responsibilities under the PAYE rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 50 Issue: Interaction between employees and PAYE intermediaries Submission (5 – Datacom) PAYE intermediaries should not be legislatively required to deal directly with employers’ employees. Comment Datacom has submitted that the need for confidentiality and security over confidential information precludes payroll service providers from dealing directly with employees. It has indicated, for example, that it is very difficult to verify the identity of employees. Officials originally considered that PAYE intermediaries would prefer to have the opportunity to have direct access to employees to, for example, verify information provided by employers (such as tax codes). However, after consultation with potential intermediaries this appears not to be the case. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Record keeping requirements Clauses 45 and 76 Submission (5 – Datacom and matter raised by officials) Data retention requirements for PAYE intermediaries under the Tax Administration Act 1994 must reflect the functions the intermediary carries out. (Datacom) Employers should be required to keep copies of any information provided to a PAYE intermediary. (Matter raised by officials) Comment Datacom has submitted that some employers may wish to continue to calculate their payroll internally using a PAYE intermediary’s calculation tool, and delegate responsibility only for payment and reporting of PAYE to a PAYE intermediary. It suggests that requiring the employer to pass on all data relating to those calculations to the intermediary, when the employer should retain it, is both impractical and unworkable. 51 As noted earlier, if an employer calculates the PAYE using the PAYE intermediary’s calculation tool the intermediary should have responsibility for the calculation. Sufficient records need to be maintained by the intermediary so that those calculations can be verified by Inland Revenue. Such records would necessarily include information such as the amount of source deductions payments made to individual employees for given periods. With respect to officials’ submission, we consider that employers should retain any employee information provided to PAYE intermediaries. This information is necessary to audit both employers and intermediaries. Officials consider that employers would want to retain this information in any case to monitor their dealings with intermediaries. Recommendation That no amendment be made to the record-keeping requirements of PAYE intermediaries. An amendment should be made, however, to require employers to keep records of the employee information that they provide to PAYE intermediaries. Issue: PAYE adjustments relating to prior periods Clause 45 Submission (5 – Datacom) There should be a legislative provision outlining the responsibilities (if any) of a PAYE intermediary in respect of periods prior to commencing as the PAYE intermediary for a given employer and periods after ceasing to be the PAYE intermediary for that employer. Comment Officials consider that situations will arise where PAYE intermediaries will want to make adjustments to assessments that relate to periods before they assumed employers’ PAYE responsibilities or after the arrangement has ended. Rules governing what should happen in relation to funds held by the intermediary if the arrangement between the employer and the intermediary cease are already in the bill. The bill does not, however, contain rules governing changes to assessments that relate to periods prior to the arrangement. We consider that intermediaries who wish to make amendments to prior periods should be responsible only for the changes they make and not for the underlying prior assessment. Given that the intermediary was not responsible for making tax deductions in those prior periods, the tax liability or refund of tax that results from such adjustments would need to be the responsibility of the employer. 52 Recommendation That an amendment be made to allow intermediaries to amend assessments for periods prior to the arrangement, with the condition that the employer be liable for any resulting tax to pay or tax refund, whichever is the case. Issue: Access to information Clause 45 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21W – KPMG) PAYE intermediaries should have access to the information required to comply with employers’ PAYE obligations not less than, say, five working days before the due date. (KPMG) Clarification is required about how Inland Revenue intends to administer access rights to PAYE information for intermediaries – intermediaries should be given the equivalent of a tax agent’s “linking rights” for the PAYE accounts they manage. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment KPMG has submitted that it would help if there is a minimum time frame within which the employer must provide information to the intermediary. Failure to provide information by this time should result in any penalties being imposed on the employer rather than the intermediary. Officials consider that the time frame for providing information to intermediaries should be subject to agreement between employers and PAYE intermediaries, and that it is inappropriate to legislate for a specified period. This reflects our expectation that different parties will come to different arrangements based on individual commercial considerations, and that legislating for a specific time period will create unnecessary barriers to participation. PricewaterhouseCoopers has commented that as a PAYE intermediary effectively becomes “manager” of the employer’s PAYE account under the proposed initiative (and is liable for interest and penalties under the legislation), it makes sense for the intermediary to have access to information about movements in the PAYE account. It has submitted that intermediaries should be able to be “linked” to a PAYE account, much the same as a tax agent is. The submission notes that this is an administrative issue and should be dealt with as such. Officials agree that PAYE intermediaries should be able to have access to the PAYE accounts of the employers for whom they act. The initiative will be supported by administrative processes that will give intermediaries access to employers’ PAYE accounts. 53 Recommendation That no amendment be made to the bill in relation to the submissions. 54 OVER- AND UNDERPAYMENTS OF PAYE Issue: Overpayments of PAYE Clause 45 Submission (5 – Datacom) There needs to be recognition in the bill that if a PAYE intermediary inadvertently makes an overpayment of PAYE to Inland Revenue, the overpaid amount should be promptly reimbursed once the intermediary has notified the department of the error. Equally, there should be a provision in the legislation to allow an intermediary to recover any PAYE paid to Inland Revenue if an employer’s payment of gross wages to the intermediary is subsequently dishonoured. Comment In relation to the first point, the submission points out that in view of the potentially very large amounts involved, substantial delays in reimbursing overpaid tax could have a crippling effect on a PAYE intermediary’s business. Given that the electronic administration of the initiative will allow refunds of overpayments to be paid within one to two days of an amended return being filed, we consider that this matter will be adequately addressed administratively. Legislating for this administrative practice would make the legislation more complex, with very little benefit for PAYE intermediaries. In relation to the second point, the submission has said that in some instances, where the due date for payment of PAYE occurs within a few days of payment by the employer, the employer’s payment may be dishonoured by their bank, resulting in considerable difficulties for intermediaries who have paid the PAYE to Inland Revenue and must now obtain reimbursement. Officials recognise that the quantum of PAYE deduction held by most PAYE intermediaries will exceed, many times over, their business assets, making delays in refunding overpayments quite critical for these businesses. We support clarifying in legislation that if a PAYE intermediary has paid PAYE but the underlying payment to the intermediary has been dishonoured by the employer, the PAYE will be refunded to the intermediary’s trust account. Recommendation That the legislation be clarified to ensure that refunds of PAYE can be made to a PAYE intermediary’s trust account if an underlying payment from an employer is subsequently dishonoured. 55 Issue: Underpayments of PAYE Clause 45 Submission (5 – Datacom) There should be a provision in the legislation to enable an intermediary to seek redress from employees who have been undercharged PAYE, and third parties who have been overpaid deductions. Comment Officials do not consider that PAYE intermediaries should have powers of recovery from employees greater than that employers currently have. In further consultation, the writer of the submission indicated that its main concern was an employee being undercharged PAYE as a result of employers providing incorrect information – for example, an incorrect tax code. The bill provides that in this situation the employer, not the intermediary, will be responsible for the shortfall. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 56 PENALTIES Issue: Application of late payment penalties Clause 45 Submission (5 – Datacom) There should be a cap on the maximum late payment penalty chargeable, at a level not likely to put a PAYE intermediary out of business or reduce the incentive for potential intermediaries to offer this service. Comment The submission has commented that because a PAYE intermediary’s business may involve the payment of very large amounts of PAYE the 5% penalty for late payment could be large enough to potentially bankrupt the intermediary. These occurrences could be the result of an error or system failure by the intermediary, through a banking system failure, or force majeure. The submission has suggested that the deterrent effect of the penalty would be equally as effective if the overall amount of the penalty were to be capped at $10,000 for any one late payment, irrespective of the overall number of PAYE deductions involved. The late payment penalty is necessary to encourage compliance with tax payment dates, a point acknowledged by the submission. The penalty is imposed in two stages: a penalty of 1% of the unpaid tax if payment is late by one day, and a further penalty of 4% if the tax remains unpaid a week after the due date. To the extent an intermediary misses payment by a period not exceeding six days from the due date, the maximum late payment penalty chargeable would be 1% of the unpaid tax. While officials recognise that PAYE intermediaries, by making substantial tax payments on behalf of employers, will potentially be exposing themselves to large penalties if they err, we consider that intermediaries are in the best position to mitigate these risks. Intermediaries as specialists in the payroll function should have the processes to ensure the correct and timely payment of PAYE. That is, one would not expect PAYE intermediaries to fail to make payment for the reasons an employer would typically default (the unavailability of funds from use of PAYE deduction to meet business expenses). Intermediaries would also be eligible for remission of penalties on the basis of “reasonable cause”, such as if the failure was due to an event or circumstance beyond their control. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 57 Issue: Penalty for breaching accreditation requirements Clause 45 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Part IX of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be amended to enable the Commissioner to apply a penalty if a PAYE intermediary knowingly or negligently allows breaches of the accreditation requirements in proposed new section NBA 2. Comment The submission has commented that the most severe action that can be taken against a PAYE intermediary that breaches the accreditation criteria is for its accreditation to be revoked. It considers that there should be penalties on intermediaries who knowingly or negligently breach accreditation requirements. PAYE intermediaries who breach the terms of their accreditation will be prevented from acting as an intermediary. The penalties and interest rules in the Tax Administration Act will apply if the breach results in late or short payment of PAYE. Officials consider that the existing penalties are sufficient to encourage compliance with the PAYE rules, and by extension, the requirements of accreditation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 58 CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS Clause 51 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) References in section NC 14(2) and NC 14(4) to “employer” should also include references to PAYE intermediaries. Comment Some references to “employer” in the PAYE rules relate to the relationship of employment. We consider that it is not appropriate to extend those references to include PAYE intermediaries because no such relationship exists. It is, however, appropriate to extend references to “employer” to include PAYE intermediaries if what is being described relates to the physical function of payment of salary or wages. We consider that the three references to “employer” identified in the submission relate to the relationship of employment, so it is not appropriate to extend them to include PAYE intermediaries. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Clause 80 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) An amendment should be made to section 36A(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to include a reference to “PAYE intermediary” where there is a reference to “employer”. Comment The submission has commented that while clause 80 of the bill amends subsections (1) and (3) of section 36A to include references to “PAYE intermediary”, an adjustment to subsection (2) has been omitted. Officials agree that subsection (2) of section 36A should be amended so that it is consistent with subsections (1) and (3). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 59 Submission (Matter raised by officials) A change is required to the definition of “employer” in the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation, and Compensation Act 2001 to specifically exclude PAYE intermediaries, in their capacity as intermediaries, from this definition. Comment A clarification of the ACC legislation is needed to ensure that PAYE intermediaries are not deemed to be the employer. One such example is for the purposes of determining the rate at which employer levies are calculated. This clarification can best be achieved by specifically excluding PAYE intermediaries from the definition of “employer” in the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001. The exclusion will apply only to PAYE intermediaries in their capacity as an intermediary and not as an employer in their own right. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 60 DRAFTING CORRECTIONS Clause 65(9) Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) References to sections ND 3 and ND 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 in the definition of “gross tax deductions” should be to sections ND 13 and ND 14 of that Act. That definition can be further simplified by removing the phrases “in relation to an employer or a PAYE intermediary” and “in relation to an employer” Comment Officials agree that the references to sections ND 3 and ND 4 should be to sections ND 13 and ND 14. Officials also agree in principle that removing the two phrases identified in the submission could make the provision simpler. However, the language used in the bill mirrors existing provisions that are being replaced. Given the reasonably complex interrelationship of various provisions in the PAYE rules, we consider that reviewing the language used in the current legislation is outside the scope of this initiative and should be considered within the context of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the references to sections ND 3 and ND 4 be changed to ND 13 and ND 14 in the definition of “gross tax deductions”. The phrases in that definition to “in relation to an employer or a PAYE intermediary” and “in relation to an employer” should be retained. Clause 127 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The wording used in clauses 125, 126 and 127 of the bill should be consistent. Comment The new subsections being inserted set up a condition for the application of the main provision. Officials agree that, given that the condition is the same in all three sections, the new subsections should be worded similarly. Recommendation That clause 127 be redrafted to be consistent with clauses 125 and 126. 61 Clauses 35, 45-53, 56-58, 65, 76, 80, 85, 96, 106, 119, 123, 125, 126, 127, 131, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 152, 153, 154, 156, 157, 158, 159, 162, 163 and 164 Submission (Matter raised by officials) A number of technical amendments are required to improve the clarity and technical accuracy of the legislation enacting the initiative. Comment Officials recommend a number of changes to the present drafting of the legislation in the bill to improve its clarity and technical accuracy without affecting the operation of the “PAYE by intermediaries” initiative – for example, clarifying in new part NBA that any sanction imposed under the Tax Administration Act 1994 for non-compliance will be imposed on a PAYE intermediary and not the employer if the intermediary does not comply with the obligations placed on it by the PAYE rules (proposed new section NBA 5) and the employer has met all their requirements under proposed new section NBA 4. Recommendation That the submission be accepted 63 GST and telecommunications services 65 OVERVIEW Clauses 132-142 The proposed changes clarify the GST treatment of cross-border supplies of telecommunications services by inserting a new place of supply rule and new zero- rating provisions and definitions. Although it is clear that supplies of telecommunications services should be subject to GST in New Zealand when they are consumed in New Zealand, the general place of supply rule and zero-rating provisions in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 are not easily applied to cross-border supplies of telecommunications services. The nature of telecommunications services means that it can be difficult to state with certainty where the services are performed. Determining where the services are performed is of particular importance as, in many instances, the rules in the GST Act look to where a service is physically performed to determine its treatment. The concept of physical performance does not fit well with the nature of telecommunications services. Overseas case law suggests that physical performance takes place where the telecommunications equipment (satellite dishes and exchanges) is located. The physical performance test can, therefore, be particularly difficult to apply in cases where cross-border telecommunications services are supplied, as in many instances the supplier of the services will have equipment located in both countries to complete the “circuit” needed for a telephone call. New, specific, place of supply rules for telecommunications services proposed in the bill are intended to remove this uncertainty by removing the physical performance test for supplies of telecommunications services. The new provisions will, in effect, be a code for determining the place of supply (including zero-rating) for cross-border telecommunications services. Seven submissioners commented on the provisions of the bill that are intended to clarify the GST treatment of cross-border supplies of telecommunications services. Submissions strongly supported the clarification of the place of supply rules for supplies of telecommunications services. All submissions made various recommendations of a technical nature about the scope of the proposed changes. 66 DEFINITIONS: “TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES” AND “CONTENT” Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) For purposes of consistency, the definition of “content” should be aligned with the definition of “telecommunication” in the Telecommunications Act 2001. This will exclude the supply of “broadcasting” services from the new place of supply rules. Comment The proposed definitions of “content” and “telecommunications services” in this bill are based on those used in the GST or VAT Acts of other jurisdictions. They are also based on the definition adopted by the International Telecommunications Union (of which the New Zealand government, represented by Telecom, is a member) in the Final Acts of the World Administrative Telegraph and Telephone Conference 1 and the Telecommunications Act 1987. These definitions were settled on after extensive consultation with the telecommunications industry. Officials note that Vodafone New Zealand Limited (submission TXAR MOB/3) supports the definitions in clause 133, especially the clear distinction which is drawn between the supply of telecommunications services and the content “carried” by the telecommunications services. Officials prefer the definitions in the 1987 Act as they are more closely aligned with those used in foreign GST/VAT jurisdictions. It is these definitions, rather than those in the Telecommunications Act 2001, with which the definitions in the GST Act should be consistent as this is more likely to prevent unintentional double or non- taxation of services between different GST/VAT jurisdictions. Supplies of broadcasting should be (and currently are) within the GST base. If supplies of broadcasting services were to remain covered by the general place of supply rules in the Act the same issues and uncertainties that arise with respect to telecommunications services will continue to arise for these services. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 1 Final Acts of the World Administrative Telegraph and Telephone Conference (WATTC – 88), Melbourne, 1988; known as the Melbourne Accord. 67 DEFINITION: “TELECOMMUNICATIONS SUPPLIER” Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 29 – New Zealand Law Society, 32 – Telecom New Zealand Limited) A definition of “telecommunications supplier” should be inserted. Comment Officials agree that to clarify the scope and application of the amendments a definition of “telecommunications supplier” should be inserted in the Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 68 THE PLACE OF SUPPLY RULES: SUPPLIES BETWEEN REGISTERED PERSONS Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 31 – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The current section 8(2)(b) should apply to supplies of telecommunications services so that, unless agreed otherwise, a supply from a non-resident to a registered person in New Zealand for the purposes of carrying on the registered person’s taxable activity is treated as not being supplied in New Zealand and, therefore, not subject to GST. Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) A new provision should be inserted so that, if the supplier and the recipient agree, supplies of telecommunications services from a non-resident to a registered person in New Zealand for the purposes of carrying on the registered person’s taxable activity are treated as not being supplied in New Zealand. Comment The provisos to the general place of supply rule in current section 8(2) mean that, when a non-resident supplier makes supplies of services to New Zealand: • The supply is deemed to be made in New Zealand (and subject to GST) if the services are physically performed in New Zealand by a person in New Zealand at the time they are performed (section 8(2)(a)). • When the services are supplied to a registered person for the purposes of carrying on that person’s taxable activity they are deemed to have been supplied outside New Zealand (and not subject to GST) unless the non-resident supplier and the New Zealand recipient agree otherwise (section 8(2)(b)). Officials consider that it would be inappropriate to apply section 8(2)(b) to supplies of telecommunications services, as that section applies in the context of services physically performed. The proposed amendments to the place of supply rules for telecommunications services are being changed to remove references to physical performance because a test based on physical performance is unworkable when applied to telecommunications and other “electronic” services. The circumstances in which a telecommunications service would be supplied by a non-resident to a New Zealand resident would appear to be limited to those where the New Zealand resident initiated an offshore call using a foreign telecommunications company. If GST were chargeable by a non-resident telecommunications company to a New Zealand resident company initiating a call, the GST would generally be able to be recovered by the New Zealand resident company as an input tax credit. However, officials understand that this would give rise to compliance cost concerns. 69 Officials therefore agree that a new provision should be inserted to bring about the same effect as section 8(2)(b) – that is, unless the supplier and the recipient agree otherwise, supplies of telecommunications services from a non-resident to a registered person in New Zealand for the purposes of carrying on the registered person’s taxable activity are to be treated as not being supplied in New Zealand and therefore not subject to GST. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 70 THE PLACE OF SUPPLY RULES: DRAFTING ERROR Submission (29 – New Zealand Law Society) As currently drafted, there is a conflict between new section 8(2) and new section 8(6) as it is not stated, as with other sections, that section 8(6) applies despite section 8(2). Comment Section 8(6) is meant to apply instead of section 8(2) to determine the place of supply for telecommunications services supplied by non-resident suppliers. Clause 135(6) should, therefore, be amended to apply “despite subsection (2)”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 71 THE “INITIATOR” TEST Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 32 – Telecom New Zealand Limited) The definition of “initiator” in clause 135 should be replaced by a list of factors that should be taken into account when determining where a telecommunications supply is initiated. Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 29 – New Zealand Law Society, 32 – Telecom New Zealand Limited) The proposed discretion for the Commissioner to prescribe circumstances in which a person is treated as initiating a supply should be removed. Comment Whether or not a person in New Zealand initiates a telecommunications supply generally determines whether or not the supply of the service is liable to GST. The definition of “initiator” in the bill is intended to clarify who is the initiator in relation to collect and multi-party calls. Officials agree with the submission that the current definition of “initiator” does not provide sufficient guidance as to when a person is considered to have initiated a supply of telecommunications services. Officials therefore agree that the definition should be replaced with a provision listing factors to be taken into account when determining which party to a supply of telecommunications services has initiated the supply. These factors would include which party makes payment for the services and which party exerts control over the supply of services. Also, as suggested by submissions, a “tie-breaker” factor of which party has contracted for the supply would be included. The proposed discretion for the Commissioner to prescribe circumstances, in addition to those in the current definition, in which a person is treated as initiating a supply was intended to give the Commissioner a flexible way of providing certainty for telecommunications suppliers in the treatment of telecommunications services. After further consultation with telecommunications suppliers, officials consider that guidance in the form of an article in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin, while not binding on the parties in the same way as a prescribed treatment by the Commissioner under a discretion, will provide an appropriate level of certainty, and the proposed discretion should therefore be removed. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 72 THE “BILLING ADDRESS” TEST Submission (29 – New Zealand Law Society) As a telecommunications supplier may not always know the physical address (as opposed to a P. O. Box number) of a customer, the requirement that the telecommunications supplier apply the billing address test (and therefore know the physical address of customers) for all supplies made for the type of service or class of customer should be removed. Comment The “billing address” test in clause 136 is only intended to apply when the “physical location” test in clause 135 cannot be applied. In discussions with telecommunications suppliers it has generally been agreed that there will not be many situations when the billing address test will be used. The requirement that the telecommunications supplier must apply the billing address test (and therefore must know the physical address of customers) for all supplies made for the type of service or class of customer is important to prevent New Zealand residents from using billing addresses offshore when they are physically present, and consuming services, in New Zealand. This could lead to a revenue loss. Officials therefore do not recommend removing this requirement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 73 ZERO-RATING Submission (2 – Vodafone Group Services Limited (UK), 3 – Vodafone New Zealand Limited, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 29 – New Zealand Law Society, 32 – Telecom New Zealand Limited) The zero-rating provided for by clause 138 should be extended to include supplies by New Zealand resident telecommunications suppliers to non-resident telecommunications suppliers, regardless of where the telecommunications service the supply relates to is initiated. Comment An example of services that submissions consider should be zero-rated occurs when a non-resident present in New Zealand uses a cellular phone while in New Zealand (“roaming”) to make either an international or a local call through a non-resident telecommunications supplier with whom he or she has a contract for a supply of telecommunications services. This would be accomplished by a New Zealand resident telecommunications supplier providing a “link” between the roamer and the non-resident telecommunications supplier. (See attached diagram.) Under the current proposed rules as the non-resident roamer initiating the supply is physically in New Zealand the supply of the “link” services to the non-resident telecommunications supplier would be subject to GST. Telecom’s concern is more generally with the application of GST to supplies by resident telecommunications suppliers to non-resident telecommunications suppliers where there is an initiator in New Zealand. Officials consider that services in these circumstances are properly zero-rated given there is no physical interaction between the New Zealand telecommunications supplier and the initiator. The initiator in New Zealand does not directly receive the performance of the interconnection services – the offshore telecommunications supplier receives both the contractual and “actual” performance of the services and they should therefore be zero-rated as exported services. Officials note that the Minister of Finance and Revenue has asked that the Committee consider an amendment to extend zero-rating to cover the situations referred to in submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 74 EXAMPLE: Cellular Roaming Services Initiator in New Zealand (Cellular) New Zealand Telecoms Company (Cellular) New Zealand Telecoms Company (Fixed Line) Offshore Telecoms Company (Fixed Line) Offshore Telecoms Company (Cellular) Offshore “Recipient” of phone call “Path” of call Cellular roaming agreement “Link” services from NZ Telecoms Company (fixed line) AB Link “A”: properly subject to GST. Link “B”: should be zero-rated as an exported service. 75 REGISTERING NON-RESIDENT SUPPLIERS: “ROAMING” SERVICES FOR NON-RESIDENT CORPORATES Submission (29 – New Zealand Law Society) Clause 141 (which excludes supplies by non-residents physically in New Zealand from supplies to be taken into account in determining the requirement to register for GST) should apply when an employee of a non-resident company initiates the supply of services in New Zealand on behalf of the company under a cellular roaming agreement. Clause 141 may not apply currently as the company will not be physically present in New Zealand. Comment Officials note that the proposed amendments to the definition of “initiator” will ensure that the services described in the submission are not subject to GST, and the non- resident telecommunications supplier is not forced to register for GST. When an initiator of telecommunication services is physically outside New Zealand the services are treated as being supplied outside New Zealand and GST does not apply. Officials consider that the new rules would treat the non-resident company as the initiator of the supply. Although it is arguable that the employee roaming in New Zealand exerts control over the supply (as the roamer makes the telephone calls) the fact that the non-resident company would be paying for the supply and is the party which has the contractual relationship with the telecommunications supplier means that the company will be treated as the initiator. Officials also note that Vodafone Group Services Limited (UK) (TXAR MOB/2) and Vodafone New Zealand Limited (TXAR MOB/3), telecommunications suppliers which are involved in providing cellular roaming services, agree with the drafting of clause 141. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 76 CROSS-REFERENCING ERROR Submission (3 – Vodafone New Zealand Limited, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 29 – New Zealand Law Society) The reference in clause 141 to “section 8(5)” should be replaced by a reference to “section 8(6)”. Comment The reference in clause 141 to section 8(5) is a cross-referencing error and it should be replaced by a reference to section 8(6). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 77 RELATIONSHIP WITH THE AGENCY RULES Submission (29 – New Zealand Law Society) Clause 135(6) is inconsistent with the agency rules in section 60 of the GST Act. Comment The submission does not outline the practical impact of any inconsistency with the agency rules and officials are not aware of any issues. In any event, the place of supply rules for telecommunications services, which determine the liability to GST, are specific provisions which would be likely to be interpreted as taking precedence over the more general agency rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 79 Private and product rulings 81 CLAUSE 72 – THE INCLUSION OF MATERIAL FACTS IN PRIVATE AND PRODUCT RULINGS Overview of submissions The bill contains a proposal to amend the definition of “arrangement”, within the Tax Administration Act 1994, for the purposes of the binding rulings legislation. The amendment will allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to include in private and product rulings facts that the Commissioner considers material or relevant, as background or context, to any of the matters on which the private or product ruling is sought. These facts will form part of the “arrangement” specified in a ruling. The amendment prevents private and product rulings having a wider application than intended. Three organisations made submissions on the proposed legislation: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, The New Zealand Law Society, and the law firm Russell McVeagh. One submission suggested an alternative drafting of the legislation, and two submissions related to a requirement that material facts be specified in the ruling. One submission also proposed that the facts covered by the amendment should be considered material by both the Commissioner and the taxpayer. Russell McVeagh objected to the amendment on the basis that broadening the meaning of “arrangement” is unwarranted and unnecessary. 82 THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE FACTS BE CONSIDERED RELEVANT OR MATERIAL BY THE COMMISSIONER ONLY Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposed definition of “arrangement” should be changed to include background or contextual facts included in a ruling that are considered material by both the Commissioner and by the taxpayer. The definition currently requires that the background facts be considered material by the Commissioner only. Comment The rulings legislation permits the Commissioner to bind him/herself to a view of the law. In the absence of this legislation, the Commissioner is not legally bound by his/her view. A ruling under the rulings legislation, being the Commissioner’s view, not the taxpayer’s, ought to allow the Commissioner to take into consideration all facts and to include any restrictions that the Commissioner considers relevant or important to determining his/her view. Furthermore, if the taxpayer and the Commissioner were required to agree on which facts are relevant as background or context, an incentive would be established for taxpayers to disagree with proposed inclusions under the section so as to give rulings the broadest possible application. This scenario would be most likely to occur in the cases where the information covered by the amendment would decide the balance of, or be crucial to, the decision made by the Commissioner. This could frustrate the binding rulings process. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 83 THE INCLUSION OF MATERIAL FACTS IN PRIVATE OR PRODUCT RULINGS SHOULD BE LEGISLATED FOR SEPARATELY FROM THE DEFINITION OF “ARRANGEMENT” Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) To avoid confusion, legislating for the inclusion of background facts within a ruling would be better provided for in a separate “background facts” section, rather than as part of the “arrangement” of a ruling. Sections 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a) could also be amended to provide non-application tests. Comment The submission suggests that “background facts” should be defined separately from “arrangement” and that the drafted section should then be linked to sections 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a), the sections relating to the non-application of a ruling because of a breach of the “arrangement”, by way of further amendments. The submission’s proposed drafting would not alter the effect of the legislation but, in officials’ view, it would unnecessarily complicate the legislation. The current drafting of the legislation aligns the treatment of “background facts” with the treatment of facts already covered by the definition of “arrangement” in a way that makes the effect of the amendment transparent and obvious, minimises the number of amendments required and avoids duplication. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 84 THE AMENDMENT SHOULD NOT PROCEED OR, ALTERNATIVELY, BACKGROUND FACTS SHOULD BE INCLUDED Submissions (9W – Russell McVeagh, 29 – New Zealand Law Society) Russell McVeagh submits that the inclusion in the definition of “arrangement” of facts the Commissioner considers material or relevant as background or context introduces a subjective element to the definition. The amendment also gives the Commissioner the ability to apply the tax laws on the basis of considerations external to the “arrangement”. This is inconsistent with the manner in which New Zealand’s tax laws are applied. The amendment should, therefore, not proceed. In the alternative, it is submitted by both Russell McVeagh and the New Zealand Law Society that the amendment does not make it clear that the material background or contextual facts must be included in the ruling if it is part of the “arrangement”. Therefore the amendment requires clarification to ensure that taxpayers are aware, at the time a ruling is issued, of the basis on which the ruling is issued. Comment The rulings legislation permits the Commissioner to bind him/herself to a view of the law. In the absence of this legislation, the Commissioner is not legally bound by his/her view. A ruling under the rulings legislation, being the Commissioner’s view, not the taxpayer’s, ought to allow the Commissioner to take into consideration all facts and to include any restrictions that the Commissioner considers relevant to determining his/her view. The amendment gives the Commissioner the flexibility needed to come to a well considered view that takes into consideration relevant background or contextual facts, without imposing unwarranted restrictions on the ruling. Officials agree that any facts included within the “arrangement” of a ruling by virtue of the amendment should be stated in a ruling. However, officials consider that the amendment as drafted already requires such facts to be stated within a ruling. Section 91EH(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act provides that a private ruling must state the “arrangement” to which the ruling applies. Similarly, section 91FH(1)(c) requires the same in respect of product rulings. The amendment provides that any facts that the Commissioner considers material or relevant as background or context to a private or product ruling fall within the meaning of “arrangement”. Consequently, any facts that the Commissioner considers material or relevant as background or context to a private or product ruling must be stated in the ruling under sections 91EH(1)(b) and 91FH(1)(c). 85 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 87 Inland Revenue’s information- gathering powers 89 OVERVIEW Clauses 73, 74 and 75 The bill contains a number of proposed amendments that will extend and clarify Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers. These amendments are in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, which reported in 1998. The amendments have also been subject to previous public consultation as part of the discussion document Taxpayer, Compliance, Standards and Penalties: A Review, which was released in August 2001. The particular amendments in clauses 73 to 75 of the bill that extend and clarify Inland Revenue’s main information-gathering powers in sections 16 and 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are: • clarifying that third parties can be required to give reasonable assistance and facilities when Inland Revenue is exercising its powers to access premises; • clarifying who may be given authority to enter a taxpayer’s premises; • allowing warrants to enter private dwellings to be exercised by Inland Revenue officers in general; • allowing Inland Revenue to remove documents from premises to copy; • allowing Inland Revenue to requisition from New Zealand residents information held by offshore entities controlled by the New Zealand residents; and • giving Inland Revenue the discretion to require documents to be sent to a particular Inland Revenue office. Submissions were generally opposed to the amendments proposing to extend and clarify Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers. Submissions were most strongly opposed to the amendment in clause 74, which will allow Inland Revenue to remove documents from premises for copying. (Any documents removed must be returned as soon as practicable after copies have been made.) A number of submissions also requested that the government reimburse taxpayers for their costs in complying with information requisitions from Inland Revenue. Officials consider that the proposed amendments are necessary to clarify Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers and address particular deficiencies in those powers. The department’s information-gathering powers are critical to it carrying out its statutory function of collecting the correct amount of tax. In particular, the proposed power to remove documents for copying is necessary to address the risk in certain cases of documents being destroyed, removed or tampered with if an ordinary section 17 requisition is made for them. Although the government and the Commissioner endeavour to minimise compliance costs, the government does not generally reimburse taxpayers for these costs. 90 The main recommendations by officials to the Committee following submissions are that amendments should be made to the bill to: • allow taxpayers to inspect and copy any removed documents; • clarify the statutory secrecy obligations to ensure that they apply to persons accompanying Inland Revenue officers onto taxpayers’ premises; and • limit the aggregation rule in proposed section 17(1B), which applies for the purpose of determining whether an offshore entity is controlled by a New Zealand resident, to interests held by other New Zealand residents or controlled foreign companies. A taxpayer will be able to exercise the right to inspect and copy removed documents at all reasonable times, including specifically at the time the documents are removed. This right should ensure that the removal of documents for copying does not unduly disrupt a taxpayer’s business. In addition, Inland Revenue’s own administrative guidelines will impose the following controls on the use of the Commissioner’s information-gathering powers: • Documents will only be removed if the Inland Revenue officer considers that it is not practicable to make copies on the premises. • When documents are removed from a taxpayer’s premises for copying, the taxpayer will be given a receipt briefly outlining what items have been removed. • Inland Revenue will provide taxpayers with a copy of any removed documents that are copied, unless all the documents removed have been copied, in which case the taxpayer will be told that all of the documents have been copied. 91 AUTHORITY TO ENTER TAXPAYER PREMISES Clause 73 Issue: Specify officers authorised to enter Submission (13 – Business New Zealand, 21W – KPMG) Increasing the power of Inland Revenue to enter premises without requiring separate warrants for each staff member raises concerns. (Business New Zealand) The current law is not unreasonable in that the Commissioner should be required to formally turn his mind to which of his staff will exercise his powers of access under section 16. (KPMG) Comment As noted in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review: Practical difficulties can arise if the investigation requires the involvement of other investigators or other parties, such as computer programmers or police. For example, a new investigator may be needed if the original investigator becomes ill. 2 While the current system of separate warrants clearly imposes costs, officials are uncertain about the benefits arising from specifying in a warrant which particular staff member will be entering the taxpayer’s private dwelling. Taxpayers can always request the name and verification of identity of Inland Revenue staff members entering their premises. Although a warrant is valid for one month, if multiple staff members are named and one is not available for whatever reason, it may be difficult to get all the staff members together again in that month. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 2 Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, August 2001, paragraph 6.16. 92 Issue: Specify who accompanies Inland Revenue Submission (31W – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The legislation should specify who, and for what purpose, a person may accompany an authorised officer onto a taxpayer’s premises. Comment The bill provides that a person whom the Commissioner considers necessary for the effective exercise of the Commissioner’s inspection powers may accompany an Inland Revenue officer onto any premises. These powers are necessary to help the Commissioner carry out his statutory duty of collecting the correct amount of tax. Specifying the particular circumstances when third parties can accompany the Commissioner raises the risk of possible circumstances going unspecified or uncertainty as to whether a particular circumstance is identified. In other words, the proposed requirement would seem to be too inflexible to cater for all potential circumstances where third parties may need to accompany Inland Revenue officers on to premises. Officials consider that it is reasonable to rely on the Commissioner’s general obligation to use resources wisely and the overriding requirement under administrative law that all public powers must be exercised in good faith. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Warrants for assisting parties Submission (9W – Russell McVeagh) Where Inland Revenue is to engage an accompanying person to enter and search premises pursuant to section 16(2A), this should first be approved by way of a warrant, except where the accompanying persons are police officers. Comment Those accompanying Inland Revenue officers would be present only to assist the department and would be subject to the secrecy provisions. The requirement to obtain a warrant in these circumstances (where premises are not private dwellings) would be an unnecessary impediment to the Commissioner carrying out his duty of collecting tax, as set out in section 6A(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. A warrant is not currently required to enter any premises other than private dwellings. 93 The proposed amendment is consistent with the Customs and Excise Act 1996, which entitles an officer to use such assistance as is reasonable in the circumstances and confers a power to search craft on any customs officer and any authorised person assisting the officer. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Secrecy obligations Submission (9W – Russell McVeagh) The proposed section 16(2A) of the Tax Administration Act would permit a person (not being an Inland Revenue employee) to accompany Inland Revenue employees. It is not clear whether the statutory secrecy obligations apply to such persons. Comment Officials agree that the secrecy provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should apply to those persons accompanying Inland Revenue staff. Although section 87 may impose secrecy obligations, the definition of “person with access to restricted information” in section 87(5) is not clear, and clarification is appropriate. We therefore agree that the confidentiality obligations should be amended to apply expressly to persons accompanying Inland Revenue officers onto taxpayers’ premises. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 94 ASSISTANCE FROM THIRD PARTIES Clause 73 Issue: Amendment not required Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The Commissioner’s powers do not need to be extended in this way. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The amendment requiring reasonable assistance from third parties provides Inland Revenue with unnecessary and unreasonable powers. The Australian Tax Office recently raided several accounting and legal firms providing tax advice. These raids were unannounced, involved sealing rooms with tape designed to reveal tampering and compelling staff to stand away from their desks to prevent document destruction. Adoption of the Australian provision would allow Inland Revenue to adopt a similar approach. We view this approach with concern. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment This amendment provides Inland Revenue with powers that are both necessary and reasonable. The amendment was recommended by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance who recognised that uncertainty exists as to the application of current section 16(2) with respect to exactly who may be required to give reasonable assistance. For example, it is reasonable that a bank manager be required to identify the safety deposit box of a taxpayer. As noted in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, this measure is aimed at removing uncertainty over whether third parties are required to give reasonable assistance or answer questions. This uncertainty could potentially expose third parties to actions for breaches of confidence or infringement of the Privacy Act. Officials therefore consider that the amendment is necessary. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 95 Issue: Amendment to apply only if the taxpayer does not cooperate Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) At a minimum, these laws should apply only where there is demonstrable failure to cooperate by the taxpayer. Comment Officials consider that the submission’s proposal that the amendments apply only where there is demonstrable failure to cooperate by the taxpayer would be setting the threshold on the use of the power too high and significantly reduce its effectiveness. As noted above this amendment simply clarifies the current legislation and provides third parties with protection. There are a number of cases where approaching the taxpayer involved is not feasible. For example, inspecting bank account records can only practicably be done through the relevant bank, regardless of whether or not the taxpayer is cooperating. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Access to occupier’s staff Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Access or rights to detain an occupier’s staff should be only available during normal business hours of the occupier’s business and then only following a period of notice. Comment The normal practice will be for Inland Revenue to obtain the information during normal office hours. However, there are times when this will not be appropriate – for example, a taxpayer has records in storage and Inland Revenue has concerns that the taxpayer will destroy those records before normal working hours begin the next day. In this case Inland Revenue would require access outside of normal business hours. A requirement to give notice could also defeat the purpose of the amendments because it may mean that records could be destroyed, removed or tampered with during the period of the notice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 96 Issue: Payment of costs by Commissioner Submission (13 – Business New Zealand, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21W – KPMG) The powers of Inland Revenue to require assistance from third parties should not be increased without reimbursement. (Business New Zealand) Third parties required to attend in accordance with the proposals should be able entitled to compensation for their time and reasonable costs, as occurs in Australia. In borrowing from the Australian experience, the drafters have been disappointingly selective. The Australian provision 3 allows persons required to attend under the equivalent section to claim expenses to a level set by regulation. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Third parties should be allowed to claim reasonable costs. (KPMG) Comment Third parties will incur some compliance costs from information requests but it is unclear if these costs will increase because of this amendment. In fact, given that the proposal is simply to clarify current treatment, it is less likely that compliance costs will be incurred in arguing the current state of the law. Compliance costs incurred by taxpayers are an inherent feature of the tax system. Complying with information requests is but one example of such costs. Although the government and the Commissioner will always endeavour to minimise compliance costs, it is not government policy to generally reimburse taxpayers for these costs. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Definition of “occupier” Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The word “occupier” in proposed new section 16(2) – which ensures that third parties are required to assist Inland Revenue when it is exercising its power to access premises – should be defined. 3 Section 264 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. 97 Comment Using the word “occupier” means that an obligation is placed on those persons in a position to help the Commissioner to exercise his statutory right to inspect books and documents to do so. Officials consider that defining the term is unnecessary. This amendment to section 16 is based on the equivalent Australian legislation, in which the word “occupier” is not defined, and this has not been a problem in practice. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Not required to provide facilities that do not already exist Submission (31W – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) The taxpayer should not be required to provide Inland Revenue with facilities not already existing and available. Comment This amendment is based on the equivalent Australian legislation, 4 under which this issue not been a problem in practice. If the legislation were amended in line with the submission’s proposal there might be uncertainty as taxpayers and Inland Revenue officers disputed what facilities were existing and available. A taxpayer is not expected to provide facilities other than those existing. It is reasonable that basic facilities such as power, lighting and toilets should be available. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 4 Section 263(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. 98 REMOVING RECORDS FOR COPYING Clause 74 Issue: Extension of power not required Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 29 – New Zealand Law Society) The arguments for allowing Inland Revenue to remove documents for copying are overstated. Other provisions in the Act already cover Inland Revenue’s concerns. For example, section 17 gives Inland Revenue the power to require a taxpayer to produce documents. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Inland Revenue should not have an unrestricted right to remove records. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The importance of information to the discharge of the Commissioner’s duty to collect taxes is well established. The Privy Council has stated that: The whole rationale of taxation would break down and the whole burden of taxation would fall only on diligent and honest taxpayers if the Commissioner had no power to obtain confidential information about taxpayers that may be negligent or dishonest. 5 PricewaterhouseCoopers submitted that the ability to requisition documents relieves Inland Revenue of concerns about how the documents are produced. Officials recognise that section 17 gives Inland Revenue the power to require a taxpayer to produce documents; however, there are instances where this would be inappropriate. For example, requiring a taxpayer to produce a document is not a feasible measure if there is a risk that the documents might be altered or destroyed. Although penalty provisions could apply if documents are destroyed, the application of a penalty does not result in the relevant information being obtained by the department. Therefore the proposed amendment allowing Inland Revenue to remove documents from premises for copying is directed at obtaining the information. It is expected that the power to remove documents will not be exercised frequently. The exercise of the power will be limited to those situations where it is necessary to prevent the Commissioner’s legitimate investigations being hindered. In many cases the department will continue to requisition documents under section 17. 5 New Zealand Stock Exchange and National Bank of New Zealand v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,147, 8,149. 99 The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance considered this amendment necessary because the absence of a power in current section 16 to remove documents for copying could be problematical in certain situations – for example, where it is not possible or practicable to make copies of documents on the taxpayer’s premises and a risk exists that documents may be altered or destroyed if a section 17 requisition was made for them. Several of the deficiencies in Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers were highlighted in the evidence given on specific investigations by the department to the Davison Commission. In its evidence the department also outlined the barriers frequently encountered in investigations and provided examples of the way in which Inland Revenue investigators were hindered in obtaining information. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Taxpayers able to access records Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 21W – KPMG) Taxpayers should have reasonable access to their records if they are required. Comment Officials consider the proposed power to remove documents for copying is appropriate because there may be a risk that documents will be altered or destroyed. However, removal of documents could have a potentially significant impact on a business’s ability to function. We see a need to balance these issues in a way which does not prevent Inland Revenue having the right to remove the documents but still allowing the taxpayer some protection. Officials propose that the legislation be amended to allow a taxpayer to inspect and copy the documents removed. This right will be able to be exercised at all reasonable times, including specifically at the time the documents are removed. This amendment should ensure that the exercise of the power to remove documents does not unduly disrupt a taxpayer’s business or activity and will enable a taxpayer to prepare a defence if necessary. Officials propose that a provision similar to current section 17(4) be inserted into section 16 to facilitate this. The wording would be along the lines of: The owner of any books or documents that are removed under this section is entitled at all reasonable times (including at the time the documents are removed) to inspect the books or documents and to obtain copies of them at the premises to which the books or documents have been removed. 100 Recommendation That the submission be accepted by allowing a person to inspect and copy the documents removed. Issue: Compliance costs Submission (13 – Business New Zealand) The amendment allowing the removal of documents for copying (particularly those subject to legal privilege), should be reviewed in light of the need (not just desire), the compliance costs they would impose on businesses, and existing Inland Revenue powers. Comment The proposed amendments to the Commissioner’s information-gathering powers have taken into account the compliance cost implications, the need for these amendments and Inland Revenue’s existing powers. Compliance costs are an inherent feature of the tax system, although the government tries to keep them as low as is feasible. In collecting taxes the Commissioner must have regard to the resources available, the importance of promoting compliance, and the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. 6 Inland Revenue collects information from both taxpayers who are under audit and from third parties who have information about the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s business. Both taxpayers and third parties will necessarily incur some compliance costs as part of that information-gathering process. The measures aim to minimise costs arising from uncertainty and delay, by ensuring that the legislation clearly specifies Inland Revenue’s powers to gather information. It is unclear if compliance costs will increase because of this amendment. Because the amendment will improve Inland Revenue’s access to information it may allow quicker investigations with resulting lower compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 6 Tax Administration Act 1994, section 6A(3). 101 Issue: Power should only be available if photocopying cannot be performed on premises Submission (9W – Russell McVeagh, 31W – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Documents or books should not be removed from a taxpayer’s premises or dwelling where it is practicable to make copies of the documents on the taxpayer’s premises. Accordingly, it is submitted that after the proposed section 16A(1) of the Tax Administration Act, the words “if it is not practicable to make copies at the building or place where those books or documents are located” should be added. (Russell McVeagh) Documents should only be removed where there are no facilities to enable the copying of the documents and records. (MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Comment At present, Inland Revenue has authority to make copies from any books or documents but not to remove documents for copying elsewhere. The concern being addressed by the proposed amendment is that if copying facilities are not available or are not made available, records may be destroyed before they can be requisitioned by the Commissioner under section 17. A precedent for the proposed amendment is contained in section 165 of the Customs and Excise Act 1996, which authorises a Customs officer to remove from any place any documents for the purpose of making copies. Similarly, section 206 of the Fisheries Act 1996 enables a fishery officer, in the exercise of the officer’s other powers under that Act, to remove for a reasonable time any documents for the purpose of making copies. The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance considered the amendment necessary because the absence of a power to remove documents for copying could be problematical in certain situations – for example, where it is not possible or practicable to make copies of documents on the taxpayer’s premises, and a risk exists that documents may be altered or destroyed if a section 17 requisition was made for them. The Committee considered that the risk of altering or destroying documents exists despite the availability of inspection. If the documents are crucial to an investigation it is difficult to see what remedies could be effective other than those proposed. It is expected that the power to remove documents will only be exercised occasionally, to prevent the Commissioner’s legitimate investigations being hindered. Officials consider that copies should be made on the taxpayer’s premises, where this is reasonably practicable. However, this matter should be included in administrative guidelines rather than legislated for, in order to avoid disputes as to whether photocopying facilities were practically available. For example, a taxpayer has a functioning but clearly insufficient photocopier; the practical ability to make records would therefore be deficient. 102 Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Taxpayer should have notification and the option to retain the records Submission (9W – Russell McVeagh, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 29 – New Zealand Law Society) The bill should require Inland Revenue to notify taxpayers which of their books or documents are to be removed for photocopying, so as to give them reasonable opportunity to make copies in the interim. (Russell McVeagh) Taxpayers should continue to have the option to retain records but give Inland Revenue access. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) If a book or document is needed for the taxpayer’s business, the taxpayer must be able to retain it, subject to providing copies of the relevant parts to Inland Revenue. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment The proposals to provide the taxpayer with notification and the right to copy the documents before removal would defeat the very purpose of the amendments as they would involve the risk of documents being destroyed, removed or tampered with. Documents removed for copying will be required to be returned as soon as practicable. As discussed above, taxpayers will also be able to inspect and copy any removed documents. Officials consider that these measures are adequate to deal with the concerns expressed in the submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 103 Issue: Time limit on removal of documents Submission (9 – Russell McVeagh, 10 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 21W – KPMG) There should be a time limit imposed for when the documents being copied must be returned. One month is suggested as a more than sufficient period to enable copying of records. (Russell McVeagh) In all but the most exceptional of cases, it should be possible for the Inland Revenue Department to copy records overnight, and that turn-around period should be adopted as the standard. (New Zealand Retailers Association) There should be a requirement that the removed records are required to be assessed and returned within a predetermined time frame. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) This proposal needs to be balanced by a requirement that the removed records are required to be accessed and returned within a predetermined time frame. (KPMG) Comment There will be a statutory obligation on the Commissioner to return any documents removed as soon as practicable after copies have been made. To set a time limit such as overnight or one month, as the submissions suggest, would be too inflexible because it could not take into account the individual circumstances of each case. In most cases documents will be returned to the taxpayer well within the proposed one- month period. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Taxpayer should be given a record of documents removed Submission (9W – Russell McVeagh, 29 – New Zealand Law Society) The bill should require Inland Revenue to notify a taxpayer which, if any, of their books or documents have been photocopied. (Russell McVeagh) The taxpayer must be given a written record of what has been taken for copying. (New Zealand Law Society) 104 Comment Administrative guidelines will provide that when books or documents are removed the taxpayer will be given a receipt briefly outlining what items have been removed. The taxpayer will also receive a copy of the documents copied (unless all of the documents removed are copied, in which case the taxpayer will be told that all of the documents have been copied). Officials consider that these measures will address adequately concerns expressed in submissions. We consider that the recommendation that the legislation be amended to allow a taxpayer to inspect and copy any documents removed also deals with concerns that taxpayers may require a copy of the documents removed. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, but note that administrative guidelines will provide for the taxpayer to be given a receipt briefly outlining what items have been removed and a copy of the documents copied (unless all of the documents removed are copied, in which case the taxpayer will be told that all of the documents have been copied). Issue: Loss or destruction of records by Inland Revenue Submission (21W – KPMG, 31W – MinterEllisonRuddWatts) If Inland Revenue is unable to return documents provided by a taxpayer, the onus of proof in any dispute should be with Inland Revenue and not the taxpayer. (KPMG) In the event the Commissioner loses or damages documents obtained from the taxpayer’s premises, then the onus of proof that would otherwise rest with the taxpayer (section 149A of the Tax Administration Act 1994) should shift to rest upon the Commissioner. (MinterEllisonRuddWatts) Comment Officials do not consider that the proposal is feasible. It would be inappropriate to shift the burden of proof if the lost document was not significant. This raises the question of how the significance of a document could be determined. Other potential issues raised include the extent to which the burden of proof should be shifted and how this could be determined in a particular case. Also, if Inland Revenue has mislaid a document, it may not be able to meet the necessary evidential threshold for raising a valid assessment. This may provide a measure of protection to taxpayers in this circumstance. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 105 Issue: Copying of privileged documents Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 13 – Business New Zealand, 21W – KPMG) Inland Revenue must not copy any document that is subject to a claim of privilege. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) We are concerned about the increase in the power of Inland Revenue to remove documents for copying, particularly those subject to legal privilege. (Business New Zealand) Inland Revenue must not copy any document that is subject to privilege. If this is done the rule should specify that the information contained in the document not be admissible as evidence in any dispute. (KPMG) Comment The proposed amendment does not prevent a taxpayer from claiming privilege. If Inland Revenue removed and copied any information later identified as being subject to privilege, the information would not be admissible as evidence in court. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Minimum timeframe given to the taxpayer to assemble records Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 21W – KPMG) A minimum statutory timeframe should be given to the taxpayer to assemble the records and check for any privileged documents, unless Inland Revenue has reason to believe the records are at risk of being removed or destroyed. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) A minimum statutory timeframe should be given to the taxpayer to assemble the records and check for any privileged documents. (KPMG) Comment Officials consider that a minimum statutory timeframe would be too inflexible in practice as it would not cater for the different circumstances of each case. It could also defeat the purpose of the amendment as it could allow documents to be destroyed, removed or tampered with. 106 As noted above, any copied information later identified as being subject to privilege will not be admissible as evidence in court. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Access to non-relevant information Submission (29 – New Zealand Law Society) If a book or a folder contains material that has no relevance to the investigation, but that book or folder cannot easily be taken apart, Inland Revenue must mark the pages of the book or folder it requires and the taxpayer must be allowed to organise the copying of those pages. Comment Again, officials consider that the submission’s proposal places an unjustified restriction on the Commissioner’s powers. The proposal could defeat the purpose of the amendment as it means that documents may be destroyed, removed or tampered with. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 107 REQUISITION OF INFORMATION HELD BY OFFSHORE ENTITIES Clause 75 Issue: Disagreement with the proposal Submission (9W – Russell McVeagh, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 13 – Business New Zealand) The proposed amendment would result in a New Zealand resident taxpayer being required to produce for Inland Revenue information held by non-resident entities related to the taxpayer, even if the taxpayer has no practical control over those entities, and in circumstances where the entities have no bearing on the taxpayer’s New Zealand tax obligations. The proposed amendment goes far beyond what is justifiable. (Russell McVeagh) The proposal will create a law with which New Zealand persons will, in some instances, simply be unable to comply. In that sense, it is bad law. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) We are concerned about the increase in the power of Inland Revenue to require information held offshore to be provided, which raises complex issues of international jurisdiction. (Business New Zealand) Comment While section 17 enables the Commissioner to require a person to produce for inspection any records in the possession or under the control of that person, Inland Revenue investigators are sometimes hindered or delayed in obtaining access to information on offshore subsidiaries. For example, some companies respond to section 17 requisitions for the records of their offshore subsidiaries by saying that the information was the property of the subsidiary company, and it was the decision of the directors of the offshore subsidiary to release or withhold the information. The amendment, which will allow the Commissioner to requisition from New Zealand residents records held by offshore entities that are controlled by the New Zealand residents, was recommended by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance. The Committee noted that the corporate veil can be used too readily to frustrate legitimate investigation of entities, which are, in substance, under the control of New Zealand taxpayers. 7 Recommendation That the submission be declined. 7 Tax Compliance, report to the Treasurer and Minister of Revenue by a Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, December 1998 paragraph 9.17. 108 Issue: Amendment not required Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposals to amend section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 overlook the existence of section 21(1) of the same Act which currently addresses information requisitions in relation to offshore payments. Comment Section 21 of the Tax Administration Act is not an adequate substitute for the proposed amendment requiring records of offshore entities controlled by New Zealand residents to be produced for inspection in New Zealand. The difficulties in obtaining information from offshore entities have occurred despite the existence of section 21. Importantly, the operation of section 21 does not result in the production of such records, without which Inland Revenue’s legitimate investigations may be frustrated. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Limitation to power Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 21W – KPMG) The power should not apply when the amount involved is immaterial, or when the request is not necessary or relevant. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) A proviso to the introduction of such a power should be given when the amount involved is immaterial or when the request is not necessary or relevant. (KPMG) Comment In relation to an obligation being imposed on the Commissioner to prove that the tax involved is material before requisitioning information, officials are concerned that such a test may not be able to be satisfied without the requisitioned information itself. Also, even if the tax directly associated with specific information is not significant, the information itself may still be important – for example, in identifying flows of payments and chains of ownership. Therefore it is very difficult to determine what information is ultimately significant or not significant. 109 It is an existing requirement in section 17(1) that the Commissioner considers requisitioned documents to be necessary or relevant for any purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of any of the Inland Revenue Acts. It is therefore unnecessary to reproduce this requirement. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: “Control” needs to be defined Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) If the amendment proceeds, the term “control” needs to be defined. We submit this be defined to be the rules for determining group companies, that is, a minimum of 66 percent common ownership. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Extending Inland Revenue access to documents of non-residents controlled by New Zealand residents needs further attention. As drafted, the legislation does not define control. Control for the purposes of this section should not be the same as control interest in the controlled foreign company rules, which can be as low as a 40 percent interest. This is because, as a practical matter, a New Zealand resident with a 40 percent interest may be incapable of requiring the delivery of information to Inland Revenue. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment In response to the concern that the controlled foreign company aggregation test would create an obligation on a New Zealand residents holding 40 percent of the controlled foreign company, officials note that this test is not used in the bill. In response to the submission that the term “control” be defined, officials do not consider this to be necessary as case law has interpreted “control” to be greater than 50 percent of the shareholder decision-making rights. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 110 Issue: Overreach of the aggregation rule Submission (9 – Russell McVeagh) There is an important “over-reach” problem which arises under the proposed section 17(1B)(a) of the Tax Administration Act which, for the purposes of proposed section 17(1A), deems any interests held by persons associated with the New Zealand resident to be held by the New Zealand resident. The associated person definition in section OD 7 of the Income Tax Act is so wide that it would include, in the case of a multinational group, every entity within that group. The proposed new section 17(1B) should be removed. Comment The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance recommended that an aggregation rule be used to determine whether an offshore entity is under the control of a New Zealand resident. The voting interests in the offshore entities held by persons associated with the New Zealand resident should be aggregated with the voting interests held by the New Zealand resident, to prevent taxpayers circumventing the provision by fragmenting their interests among associated parties. Officials acknowledge the amendment, as currently drafted, would extend beyond the intended reach of non-residents controlled by residents to the interests of non- residents that control New Zealand residents. Officials consider that restricting the aggregation rule to interests held by New Zealand residents and controlled foreign companies would correct this situation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part and the aggregation rule be restricted to interests held by New Zealand residents and controlled foreign companies. Issue: Ignoring foreign secrecy laws Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21W – KPMG) The proposal to ignore foreign secrecy laws should not proceed because it is inappropriate for the New Zealand government to require New Zealand residents to break the law of another jurisdiction. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) A rule should not be introduced that effectively requires New Zealand residents to disregard laws that an entity which it controls is required to have regard to. Alternatively, the introduction of such a rule should not proceed in haste and some more thought be given to other legislative remedies. (KPMG) 111 Comment The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance noted that companies established subsidiaries in certain countries in the first place to take advantage of their secrecy laws and thereby frustrate legitimate investigations of tax authorities in their home countries. Other countries, such as Australia and the United States already have provisions similar to that proposed in the bill for ignoring foreign secrecy laws. The proposed amendment is consistent with the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development’s project on harmful tax practices, in particular, in preventing domestic taxpayers hiding behind the secrecy laws of tax havens. If information that is requisitioned is not provided, the taxpayer can be prosecuted for such failure. Taxpayers in this situation have the option of changing the location of the company to a jurisdiction which does not have secrecy laws that hinder the legitimate investigations of the tax authority in the parent company’s country of residence. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 112 DOCUMENTS SENT TO A SPECIFIED INLAND REVENUE OFFICE Clause 75 Issue: Right to recover reasonable delivery costs Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 13 – Business New Zealand, 21W – KPMG) Taxpayers have the right to recover reasonable delivery costs from Inland Revenue. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand and KPMG) Business New Zealand is concerned about the increase in the power of Inland Revenue to require documents to be sent to a specified Inland Revenue office without any reimbursement. (Business New Zealand) Comment Compliance costs incurred by taxpayers are an inherent feature of the tax system. Although the government and the Commissioner endeavour to minimise compliance costs, the government does not generally reimburse taxpayers for these costs. To reduce the compliance costs of this amendment, the department’s administrative guidelines will provide that if a significant amount of documentation is required Inland Revenue will agree to a taxpayer’s request to send the documents to the nearest Inland Revenue office, which will arrange the on-shipping of the documents to the Inland Revenue office conducting the investigation. The amendment may also, in fact, reduce compliance costs as it may allow speeder resolution of disputes. Currently, delays may occur if taxpayers send records to an Inland Revenue office other than that conducting the investigation. Recommendation That the submissions be declined, but note that administrative guidelines will provide that if a significant amount of documentation is required Inland Revenue will agree to a taxpayer’s request to send the documents to the nearest Inland Revenue office, which will arrange the on-shipping of the documents to the Inland Revenue office conducting the investigation. 113 Issue: Timeframe for response to section 17 requisition Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 21W – KPMG) Taxpayers should have a statutory minimum time frame within which to respond. Comment The obligation to provide information to the Commissioner is not being amended – only the power for the Commissioner to specify the office to which the information is sent. Officials consider that introducing a minimum timeframe would be too inflexible and would not take into account the particular circumstances of each case. The current approach of allowing the timeframe to be set by the investigator after discussion with the taxpayer works well in practice and should continue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 114 GENERAL Issue: Taxpayers should be provided a copy of documents photocopied Submission (10 – New Zealand Retailers Association) In relation to documents that are removed from the taxpayer’s premises, the Commentary on the Bill states that “Administrative guidelines will require taxpayers to be provided with a copy of the specific documents photocopied, unless all the documents were photocopied.” This measure should also apply in respect of on- premises copies made by the Inland Revenue Department, and that it should be a legislative requirement rather than merely administrative. Comment As taxpayers will bear the cost of photocopying on premises, it would be inappropriate to legislate for this requirement. The originals will remain with the taxpayer, and therefore a copy of documents photocopied may not be of any use to the taxpayer and could potentially be very costly. Instead, it would be possible to provide taxpayers with the opportunity to have a copy made, if they request one. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Examples where existing powers were insufficient Submission (13 – Business New Zealand) Inland Revenue should justify broadening its powers by providing the Committee with actual examples of where their existing information-gathering powers have not been sufficient. Comment There are numerous instances where the proposed amendments would have been of assistance. Specific examples of this include: • A taxpayer who was under investigation allegedly had three suspicious fires and a lightening strike destroy the buildings where his business records were kept. 115 • A taxpayer, under investigation over a GST refund, claimed he was unable to supply his business records as his briefcase had been stolen. The taxpayer claimed to have reported the theft to the Police but the police had no record of the report. The investigator attempted to obtain copies of the records but these were allegedly stolen also. The purchaser claimed to have reported the theft to Police, although the Police had no record of this either. • A taxpayer was required to send a particular invoice to Inland Revenue. The original was posted to the department and, when the invoice was examined, it was revealed that the taxpayer had stuck a piece of paper over parts of the invoice and altered it. • A taxpayer was under investigation and the Inland Revenue Department officer responsible for the investigation had obtained a search warrant. The search warrant was in the name of this officer, as stipulated by section 16 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The named investigator believed the taxpayer to be violent (based on interviews with informants) and a Police officer accompanied the investigator to the taxpayer’s residence, for safety reasons. The Police officer did not take part in the search. The taxpayer sought to sue the Commissioner and the Police for $50,000, a cause of action in the statement of claim being that the warrant was invalid as it was exercised by persons who were not named officers of the department. Proceedings were withdrawn after a settlement was negotiated and an ex gratia payment was made. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Misuse of powers Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The submission expresses concern that the bill proposes wide ranging powers, which are actually needed for a very small number of instances, but could be misused by Inland Revenue in other situations. It is important that controls are placed on Inland Revenue’s ability to use these extended powers if they are legislated. The submission suggests that Inland Revenue be required to report (as with the penalty regime) to Parliament annually its use of these powers and their existence, or otherwise, of complaints as to the use of the powers. It is also noted that these changes are being made while further changes are being considered in the context of the discussion document on taxpayer privilege. It seems that Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers should be considered in the context of taxpayers’ privilege and the current legislation should be deferred until that process is complete. 116 Comment The majority of proposed amendments were recommended by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance. The proposed amendments both clarify the current powers of Inland Revenue and address deficiencies in those powers. Our response to concerns over excessive use of the powers is that in exercising his duties, the Commissioner must have regard to the resources available. 8 For example, there would be no incentive to obtain non-relevant material because that would be an inefficient use of the Commissioner’s resources. Therefore the Commissioner would commit only those resources which were necessary to effectively carry out a particular audit. Officials agree that controls need to be in place around these powers. These powers are not unrestricted. Both the legislation and administrative guidelines will state procedures in relation to these. In the event that powers are used inappropriately, disciplinary procedures are in place and will apply. Also there is the overriding requirement under administrative law for all public powers to be exercised in good faith. In response to the suggestion that Inland Revenue be required to report annually to Parliament on its use of its information-gathering powers, officials are of the view that this would impose significant and unnecessary costs for no real benefit. The Commissioner’s powers are delegated on a wide level and there is no central registry which records each use of the department’s information-gathering powers. Officials do not agree that the current legislation should be deferred. Real deficiencies have been identified in the department’s information-gathering powers. These can be readily dealt with aside from issues of privilege. Deferring these measures would cause an undesirable delay in correcting these deficiencies. These amendments result from an extensive consultation process, including recommendations from the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance and a public discussion document. 9 Recommendation That the submission be declined. 8 Tax Administration Act 1994, section 6A (3). 9 Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, August 2001, Chapter 6. 117 OTHER ISSUES Issue: Removal of computers to copy information Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) It is agreed that, at a minimum, officials should carry out further work on whether the legislation should be amended to clearly provide for the removal of computers. However, we repeat our very strong objection to the proposal to remove computers – even more so than we disagree to removal of documents. Comment The government discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review included the proposal to amend section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make it clear that the word “document” includes computers. This proposal is not included in the bill. There is no New Zealand case law on this point, and the meaning of the current law in this area would seem to be unclear. Officials agree with the submission and have been instructed by Ministers to carry out further research on this proposal. Recommendation That the submission to carry out further research on this proposal be accepted. Issue: Removal of the words necessary or relevant Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) We agree with deferral of the proposal to remove the words “necessary or relevant”, and again note our strong disagreement with the proposal. Comment This issue will be considered following the review of tax and privilege. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 118 MINOR DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: New section 16(2) Submission (Matter raised by officials) In the first line of proposed new section 16(2), a reference to “land” should be inserted before the word “building”. Comment The proposed amendment is necessary to make the provision consistent with current section 16(1). The amendment will correct an unintended omission in the drafting of new section 16(2). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section 16(4) Submission (Matter raised by officials) In current section 16(4), “authorised officer named in the application” should be replaced by “an authorised officer”. Comment As currently drafted, the bill provides that the section is amended to read “the authorised officer”. Officials are concerned that there may be more than one authorised officer and therefore the amendment should refer to “an authorised officer” rather than “the authorised officer”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 119 Issue: New section 17(1A) Submission (Matter raised by officials) In the first line of proposed new section 17(1A), a reference to “information” should be added. Comment The proposed amendment is necessary to make new section 17(1A) consistent with the Commissioner’s primary requisitioning power in section 17(1), which refers to “information” as well as to “books and documents”. The amendment will correct an unintended omission in the drafting of new section 17(1A). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: New section 17(1B) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed new section 17(1B), which treats the interests held by associated persons as being held by the New Zealand resident, should provide that whether a person is associated with the New Zealand resident is determined under sections OD 7 or OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act. Comment As currently drafted, the provision relies only on the section OD 7 associated persons definition. This definition is inadequate in relation to trust relationships. This deficiency would be addressed by utilising the associated person definition in section OD 8(3) in addition to the section OD 7 definition. There are several precedents for this proposed approach, for example, sections EO 4A(6) and CG 11(8) of the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 121 Other policy issues 123 TAX AND CHARITIES Issue: Increase in the individual rebate threshold should be indexed Clause 31 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 10 – New Zealand Retailers Association) While supporting the increase in the maximum rebate that individuals can claim on their donations from $500 to $630, the Institute of Chartered Accountants recommends that the limit be indexed as a percentage of the individual’s gross or net income, being the system in place in Canada and the United States. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The New Zealand Retailers Association also expresses concern that the monetary limit can get out of date. (New Zealand Retailers Association) Comment Under a threshold that is a percentage of income, the revenue cost to the government is determined by the donor’s tax rate and income growth, so the government has less control over the aggregate amount of revenue it forgoes through the rebate. Furthermore, “support” may be biased towards the charitable purposes chosen by higher income earners. The government has signalled that it intends to review the threshold more frequently than has been the case in the past decade, and that it would like to have more information about the fiscal implications of increasing the rebate further. Having a registration, reporting and monitoring system (as proposed by the Working Party on Registration Reporting and Monitoring of Charities, and agreed to by the government) will give the government a better understanding of the size and scope of the charitable sector. This will assist the government in deciding any changes to the quantum and type of threshold. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 124 Issue: Simplification of the thresholds for deductibility of donations by companies Clause 8 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The proposed change to the limits on company donations should include a cross reference to “net income” under section BC 6. Comment The term “net income” is used in clause 8, the limit being set at 5 percent of net income. Section BC 6 indicates how “net income” and “net loss” are to be calculated for tax purposes. Clause 8 does not need to refer to section BC 6 as “net income” is a defined term in the Income Tax Act 1994 and that definition already includes a cross-reference to section BC 6. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Charitable purpose to be maintained Clause 6 Submission (8 – Inter Church Working Party on Taxation) While supporting the proposal to ensure that a charitable purpose needs to be maintained for a society or institution to continue to be eligible for the tax exemption, the submission would not want this to be extended to apply to trusts. The submission’s concern arises out of the comment on page 7 of the explanatory notes to the bill that “to qualify for the income tax exemption, an entity’s charitable purposes have to be carried out in each year the exemption is claimed”. Comment The submission’s concern is that requiring trusts to be “maintained” for a charitable purpose may cause problems for trusts that do not apply their funds immediately for the charitable purpose for which they were established. The funds, for example, may be invested pending some major item of expense. 125 Section CB 4(1)(c) states that the income tax exemption applies to “any amount derived by trustees in trust for charitable purposes or derived by any society or institution established exclusively for charitable purposes...”. As noted in the oral presentation by the writer of the submission, the Latimer v CIR case involving the Crown Forestry Rental Trust has thrown some doubt on whether the words “established exclusively for charitable purposes” apply also to trusts. Even though the Court of Appeal held that they did not, the case is to be heard by the Privy Council. If the words are held to apply to trusts, the proposed amendment in clause 6 would also apply as it adds “and maintained” after “established”. The same issue also arises in section CB 4(1)(e). It is the government’s intention that charitable purposes need to be maintained by trusts as well as societies and institutions. While this is the intention behind the legislative amendment before the committee, arguably the wording of the current Act already achieves this in the case of trusts. This is because the tax exemption applies to income derived for charitable purposes – in other words, at the time the income is derived the trust must have charitable purposes. In that sense the words “and maintained” do not need to apply specifically to trusts. Those words do, however, need to apply to other societies and institutions. This is because the current legislation arguably confers a tax exemption on a society or institution “established for charitable purposes”, whether or not it still maintains those purposes at the time the relevant income is earned. This situation has been clarified in the recently introduced Income Tax Bill, which contains the rewritten Parts A to E of the Income Tax Act and re- enacts the remainder of the Act. We would also emphasise that it is not intended that a charity must distribute all of its income in each year. The government has announced the establishment of a charities commission to register and monitor charities. It is expected that if a charity is accumulating funds, the commission would have the power to enquire as to the purpose of that accumulation, but that a reasonable accumulation for (ultimately) charitable purposes would be acceptable. Recommendation That it be noted that: • the uncertainties surrounding the words “established exclusively for charitable purposes” in sections CE 4(1)(c) and (e) are being addressed as part of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act; • the government’s intention is that charitable purposes need to be maintained by trusts as well as by societies and institutions; • it is not intended that charities would have to distribute all of their income in each year. 126 Issue: Deductions for charitable donations by close companies Clause 8 Submission (6W – Anchor Wire Limited) Small private companies should also be able to claim a tax deduction for their donations to charities. Comment The bill extends the range of companies that can claim a deduction for donations to charity, to include close companies listed on the stock exchange. Currently, all close companies are excluded from claiming such as deduction. The submission argues that the change is too narrow as the relaxation would still require a company to have a sizable number of shareholders to gain stock exchange listing, thereby excluding most small private companies. The reason the legislation precludes close companies in general from claiming the deduction is a concern that such companies might be used by their owners to extend their individual donations rebates. This is a real concern, given that the fiscal implications could be sizable as New Zealand is dominated by small businesses with few shareholders. This is less of an issue for companies that are widely held or are at least listed on a recognised exchange, given presumptions about greater scrutiny and transparency. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 127 REQUIREMENT TO DISCLOSE CHANGES IN IMPUTATION RATIOS Submission (Matter raised by officials) The requirement to disclose changes to imputation ratios under section 69(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, if the ratios have increased or decreased more than 20 percent from the previous year, and to furnish an explanation for the change should be removed. Comment The submission was originally raised by PricewaterhouseCoopers in relation to the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. Officials considered that the amendment being requested was beyond the scope of that bill and recommended its consideration as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. Section 69(2) requires that a company disclose in its annual imputation account if the ratio of imputation and dividend withholding payment credits to total dividends paid, and the ratio of credits to debits in the imputation credit account have changed by more than 20 percent over the preceding year. It is also required to furnish an explanation for the change. The reason for requiring companies to disclose significant variation in these ratios is to identify cases where an arrangement may have been entered into to obtain a tax advantage. An example of when disclosure may reveal a practice that the Commissioner may wish to investigate further would be when a company decides not to attach any imputation credits (or a very small amount of imputation credits) in one imputation year, and then attach a substantial amount (say, at the maximum ratio of 33/67) in the subsequent year to enable shareholders to make more effective use of those credits. PricewaterhouseCoopers commented that very few taxpayers comply with section 69(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as most are unlikely to be aware of this requirement. As a result, while removing the disclosure requirement would not reduce compliance costs for taxpayers currently unaware of their obligations, it would nevertheless reduce the risks associated with not making a disclosure. The information required to calculate the relevant ratios is already provided to Inland Revenue in the company income tax and imputation return. Consequently, officials consider that it would be possible for the Commissioner to calculate the ratios and to determine whether there has been a change of more than 20 percent between years. If the Commissioner determines that there has been a variation that warrants further investigation, the company can then be required to provide an explanation for the change. The amendment should apply from the 2002-03 income year 128 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 129 CONFIRMATION OF ANNUAL INCOME TAX RATES Clause 3 Issue: Reduction in the company and personal income tax rates Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 13 – Business New Zealand) The company tax rate and the personal tax rate should be reduced. A reduction in the company tax rate and the personal tax rate would contribute to economic growth and create a positive profile internationally. Comment The Income Tax Act 1994 provides for the rates of income tax specified in Schedule 1 of the Act to be confirmed each year. It has been a long standing practice of Parliament to confirm the tax rates annually. The bill confirms that the annual income tax rates for the 2002-03 income year will be the same as the rates that applied for the 2001-02 income year. The rates being confirmed reflects the government’s current policy as to the rates of income tax it wishes to levy on businesses and taxpayers. The increase in the top personal tax rate from 1 April 2000 was to generate additional revenue to meet the government’s social policy commitments. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: The margin between the top personal tax rate and the company tax rate should be reduced or eliminated. Submission (10 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The margin between the top personal tax and the company tax rate should be reduced or eliminated. Because a number of measures have been introduced to buttress the top personal tax rate of 39 percent, such as the multi-rate FBT rules and personal services attribution rule, these measures have added complexity to the legislation and have burdened taxpayers with additional compliance costs. 130 Comment The Income Tax Act 1994 provides for the rates of income tax specified in Schedule 1 of the Act to be confirmed each year. It has been a long standing practice of Parliament to confirm the tax rates annually. The bill confirms that the annual income tax rates for the 2002-03 income year will be the same as the rates that applied for the 2001 -02 income year. The rates being confirmed reflects the government’s current policy as to the rates of income tax it wishes to levy on businesses and taxpayers. Its current policy in relation to personal income tax rates is to have a more progressive model than applied when the company rate was aligned with the top personal tax rate. The increase in the top personal tax rate from 1 April 2000 was to generate additional revenue to meet the government’s social policy commitments. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 131 Remedial amendments 133 DEPRECIATION RULES ON AMALGAMATION (Clauses 9, 14, 15 and 144) Issue: Whether the anti-avoidance rule should apply to companies that are not associated before amalgamation. Submission (16A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed section FE 5(2) is flawed because it can apply when two previously non-associated companies amalgamate. This would mean that the associated persons rule applies all-pervasively and retrospectively. It would be wrong for companies that were not associated before amalgamation and that had no ability to influence tax outcomes before amalgamation to be prevented from achieving a step-up in the cost base. In terms of the scheme of the Income Tax Act 1994, the test for determining whether the subsection applies should be limited to those taxpayers who were associated parties before the amalgamation. Comment It is true that section FE 5(2), as drafted, could apply when two previously non- associated companies amalgamate, but we disagree that this is a flaw. On the contrary, it is necessary to achieve the policy intention of preventing an uplift in the cost base of depreciable property without a real change in the property’s ownership. The draft section FE 5(2) would apply the test of association by comparing the ownership of the continuing, amalgamated company as it exists immediately after amalgamation, with the ownership of the discontinued, amalgamated companies as if they continued to exist. For example: (i) Company A is wholly owned by Alice and has a net value of $100,000. It amalgamates with Company B, wholly owned by Bernard, with a net value of $50,000. The continuing company, Company A, is owned two-thirds by Alice and one-third by Bernard. The assets of Company B have been disposed of and acquired by Company A. (The assets of Company A have not been disposed of). In this case, the two companies are not treated as associated, because Bernard, the 100 percent owner of Company B, owns only 33 percent of the post- amalgamation Company A. Therefore the anti-avoidance rule does not apply to the transfer of assets from Company B to Company A. Any increase in the value of those assets can be taken into account in the depreciation cost base. 134 (ii) On the other hand, if Company B is the continuing company, then it is the assets of Company A which are disposed of. This time the test of association is deemed to be met. Alice, who owned 100 percent of Company A, now owns 67 percent of continuing Company B. That means that the anti-avoidance rule does apply to the transfer of assets from Company A to Company B. The submission objects to this conclusion on the grounds that two companies which were, in fact, not associated are treated as if they were associated. A company which had no ability to influence tax outcomes before amalgamation is prevented from achieving a step-up in the cost base. It is true that in example (ii), Company B had no ability to influence Company A before amalgamation. But the majority owners of Company B, as it continues after amalgamation, did have that ability, because they owned 100 percent of Company A. The assets formerly owned by Company A (and therefore owned by Alice) are still owned mostly by Alice, through her 67 percent shareholding in company B. The formulation of section FE 5(2), as drafted, will ensure that where the ultimate ownership of assets changes more than 50 percent, the anti-avoidance rule will not apply. But where the original majority owners continue to own at least half of the assets transferred, then the anti-avoidance rule will apply to prevent an uplift in base cost. If the submission were accepted, so that all previously unassociated companies were excluded, it would be easy for base cost to be uplifted without any change in ownership at all. For example, Charles owns 100 percent of Company C, which is worth $10m. Company C owns a depreciable asset which was bought for $1m but which is now worth $2m. The company amalgamates with Company D, owned by Denise, which is worth $100,000. Company D is the continuing company, but Denise now has a 1 percent shareholding and Charles owns the remaining 99 percent. The companies were not associated before amalgamation. Company D has acquired an asset from a company over which it could have had no influence before the transfer. Nevertheless, it is right that this should be treated as a transfer between associated parties, because the underlying ownership of the asset has effectively not changed at all. It has been suggested that existing anti-avoidance provisions could be used instead, in the case of companies unassociated before amalgamation. But the only relevant provisions are the general anti-avoidance rules at BG1 and GB1. It would be very difficult to apply these where there was a genuine commercial purpose associated with the amalgamation. The existence of a commercial purpose would not alter the fact that there has been no substantial change of ownership of the asset, and there should therefore be no uplift. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 135 Issue: How the rules apply to non-qualifying amalgamations Submission (13 – Business New Zealand) The provisions would mean that assets transferred in a non-qualifying amalgamation would be valued at historic cost rather than market value. This is inconsistent with the approach that non-qualifying amalgamations are akin to arm’s-length disposals. Comment The provisions would not apply to every non-qualifying amalgamation. They will apply only when the company transferring the asset and the continuing amalgamated company are “associated”, that is, when at least 50 percent of their control is common. So where an asset is transferred in a non-qualifying amalgamation, and there is a significant change in its underlying ownership (that is, where at least half of the ownership changes) market value will continue to apply. Anti-avoidance rules are needed to prevent the owners of assets which increase in value from increasing their depreciation deductions by making a disposal between companies which does not change the underlying ownership. Such disposals can include amalgamations. In a qualifying amalgamation, the transfer takes place at book value, so the avoidance would not work. But any amalgamation can be made non-qualifying through an election. These provisions will ensure that arm’s-length treatment is not given to transactions which are not, in fact, at arm’s length at all. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application to qualifying amalgamations Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed subsection FE 5(2) should not apply to qualifying amalgamations. Comment The rules for qualifying amalgamations already preclude the sort of avoidance which the provisions in the bill are intended to stop. It is therefore certainly intended that the proposed subsection FE5 (2) should not apply to qualifying amalgamations. 136 The current section FE 5, which will become subsection FE 5(1), already refers to “an amalgamation other than a qualifying amalgamation”, and is therefore confined to non-qualifying amalgamations. The proposed subsection FE 5(2), as drafted, is similarly restricted. It refers back to FE 5(1) by speaking of “the” amalgamating company, where FE 5(1) speaks of “an” amalgamating company. To repeat the phrase “on an amalgamation other than a qualifying amalgamation” would make FE 5(2) unnecessarily long. However, to make absolutely certain the point can be covered in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin that details the new legislation once it is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: More initiatives on depreciation Submission (13 – Business New Zealand) The Inland Revenue should be more proactive and better inform businesses of the opportunity to depreciate their equipment more rapidly when multiple shifts are being worked at their plant. They should also consider a less bureaucratic application process for rapid depreciation for firms operating over 35 hours per week. Recommendation These proposals are beyond the scope of the current bill, which deals only with depreciation on amalgamation. 137 INTEREST COMPONENT OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR FILM PRODUCTION EXPENDITURE Clause 13 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) While supporting the change, the Institute of Chartered Accountants suggests that consideration should be given to the application date of this provision and asks whether some protection should be given for returns already filed and positions already taken. Comment Under section EO 4(1) of the Income Tax Act, when a person reimburses another party for film production expenditure, that person can deduct that reimbursement as if it were film production expenditure they had incurred themselves. Conceivably, the amount reimbursed could cover interest as well as other, more direct film production expenses. An unintended consequence of clarifying last year the rules regarding the timing of interest deductions was that the reimbursement of interest expenses could no longer be deductible as film production expenditure. Clause 13 rectifies this problem. Because the amendment clarifying the timing of interest deductions applied from the 1997-98 income year, we have also proposed that clause 13 apply from the 1997-98 income year. The submission suggests that this date should be reconsidered and some protection given to those that have already filed returns based on certain presumptions. This is unnecessary because rather than being restrictive, the new provision is permissive (referring to “may treat”), removing the anomaly and thereby clarifying what most taxpayers will have already been doing since 1997-98. Taxpayers that have not treated reimbursed interest expenses as film production expenditure will not be required to make any change as a result of the amendment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (Matter raised by officials) We are proposing a minor drafting change to clause 13 to clarify that the policy intent is that the provision covers only the reimbursement of interest incurred in relation to producing the film. The change involves adding the words “in producing the film” after “other person” on line 17. 138 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 139 INTERNATIONAL TAX REMEDIALS Issue: Limiting branch equivalent tax account credits when foreign tax credits are claimed Clauses 42 and 43 Submission (Submission – 16 PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendments to limit branch equivalent tax account credits when losses are used and income tax is paid do not correctly limit the branch equivalent tax account credit when foreign tax credits are claimed. To achieve a correct result the provisions should be extended to include foreign tax credits and any amounts set off against a company’s income tax liability for the income year. Comment Officials agree that the proposed amendment should be extended in the manner suggested by the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interaction between conduit tax relief rules and branch equivalent tax account rules for consolidated groups Submission (Submission – 9W Russell McVeagh) Remedial amendments should be made to the rules for quantifying branch equivalent tax account debits and credits for a consolidated group that is entitled to conduit relief. The consolidated branch equivalent tax account rules should be clarified to ensure that branch equivalent tax account debits and credits are calculated before any conduit relief is given. This would bring the consolidated group provisions for branch equivalent tax accounts in line with the provisions for individual companies. The amendments should apply to the 1998-1999 and subsequent imputation years, which is the date the consolidated conduit provisions came into effect. Comment Officials agree that the current legislation is deficient in the manner set out in the submission. 140 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Quantification of branch equivalent tax account relief Submission (Submission – 9W Russell McVeagh) The current branch equivalent tax account rules prevent taxation of both the dividend and the attributed foreign income when a taxpayer either pays income tax or uses past losses to offset a tax liability on attributed foreign income. Double taxation, however, still arises when the tax liability on attributed foreign income is offset by current year tax deductions. As this is an anomaly, an amendment should be made to the branch equivalent tax account rules to remove this situation of double taxation. Comment Officials agree that a branch equivalent tax account credit is not created when the tax liability on attributed foreign income is offset by current year tax deductions, although that was the intention of the original branch equivalent tax account rules which allowed a branch equivalent tax account credit to be created only in proportion to the income tax paid. Subsequently, however, the branch equivalent tax account rules were expanded to also allow a branch equivalent tax account credit to be created when a past loss was used to offset a tax liability on attributed foreign income. Officials agree that it appears anomalous that past losses used as offsets should be able to create a branch equivalent tax account credit, while current year losses cannot. However, officials would prefer that more work is done to ensure that the original policy intent is not subverted and recommend that this submission be considered as a remedial issue on a future tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined but be considered for inclusion on a future tax policy work programme. 141 Issue: Limiting branch equivalent tax credits for Maori authorities Clauses 42 and 43 Submission (Matter raised by officials) For companies taxed as Maori authorities, the proposed amendments to limit branch equivalent tax account credits when losses are used and income tax are paid should be based on the Maori authority tax rate rather than the company tax rate. Comment A previous officials’ submission has recommended that when a Maori authority has offset New Zealand losses against attributed foreign income, the branch equivalent tax account credit created should be based on the Maori authority tax rate rather than the company tax rate, as the legislation currently allows. Officials also recommend that, for Maori authority companies (who elected to be taxed under the Maori authority rules) the amendment which limits the branch equivalent tax account credit when income tax has been paid and New Zealand losses used should also be based on the Maori authority tax rate rather than the company tax rate, as currently set out in the amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 142 RATIONALISATION OF TERMINAL TAX PAYMENT DATE PROVISIONS Clauses 20, 38, 54, 55, 65, 69, 90, 91, 92, 93, 99, 102, 122, 150, 151, 161 and 164 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The payment date for taxpayers without an agent or without an extension of time for filing a return should be abandoned, and instead be aligned with the date for those with an agent and an extension of time. The reason for this is that very little tax is paid on the “standard” terminal tax date as compared with terminal tax with the two- month deferral. Comment Officials do not support the submission because it is outside the scope of the proposed amendments. The submission’s proposal to align the terminal tax dates of taxpayers who have an agent and an extension of time with those who do not would involve deferring the payment of a significant amount of terminal tax and therefore have a fiscal cost, which was not the intention of the proposed amendments. The intention of the amendments was simply to rationalise the legislative provisions relating to terminal tax payment dates, mainly by reducing the three such provisions to a single provision. Officials consider that the submission’s proposal to align terminal tax dates (with some deferral of current terminal tax payments) should instead be considered as part of continuing tax system simplification. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (Matter raised by officials) A minor amendment should be made to improve the wording of proposed new section MC 1(2)(a). Comment The relevant wording of proposed new section MC 1(2)(a) refers to a person’s return of income “giving rise to the terminal tax liability”. This wording does not accurately reflect the law because a person’s terminal tax liability properly arises under the Income Tax Act itself. The wording should be replaced with wording along the lines of “for the income year relating to the terminal tax liability”. 143 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 144 REMEDIAL FRINGE BENEFIT TAX ISSUE Issue: Incorrect section reference in the FBT rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) Legislation enacted in the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 allowing employers to change the basis of calculating their fringe benefit tax (FBT) liability under the multi-rate FBT rules contains incorrect section references. Officials recommend that: • The incorrect section references in sections ND 1(4) and (5) of the Income Tax Act 1994 as introduced by section 59 of the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 be corrected to refer to subsection (2) rather than subsection (1). • The application date of this proposed amendment apply with effect from the date that the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 received its Royal assent, 17 October. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 145 SELF-ASSESSMENT REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Issue: New date for payment of tax Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to re-enact the effect of former section 142A(1)(b) to require the Commissioner to set a new due date where the liability to pay tax is increased from that calculated by taxpayers in their returns. Comment Section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires the Commissioner to set a new due date for payment of tax that is not a penalty. Section 142A(1) was recently amended by the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001, with the intention of making the section consistent with self-assessment. Part of the 2001 amendment included repealing former section 142A(1)(b), which required the Commissioner to set a new due date where the liability to pay tax was increased from that calculated by taxpayers in their returns. This provision applied mainly to withholding taxes such as NRWT, where the Commissioner makes an assessment in limited cases only, such as following an audit. The part of the 2001 amendment that repealed former section 142A(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act went further than intended. Currently, section 142A applies only if an assessment is already in existence, whereas this may not be the case with withholding tax. Officials therefore consider that it is necessary to re-enact the effect of former section 142A(1)(b) to ensure that section 142A can apply in withholding tax cases and require the Commissioner to set a new due date where the liability to pay tax is increased from that calculated by the taxpayer in their return. Because section 142A(1) applies only to situations where tax is increased, the current reference to “payment of the tax or increased tax” should also be replaced with “payment of the increased tax”. The proposed amendment does not result in a policy change and should apply from the 2002-2003 income year, which is the same application date as the main self- assessment amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 146 Issue: Definition of “assessment” Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “assessment” in the Income Tax Act 1994 should be relocated to the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Income Tax Act should also cross-refer to the new assessment definition in the Tax Administration Act. Comment The Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 enacted a definition of “assessment” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. There are several problems with this definition of “assessment” that arise because of its location in the Income Tax Act instead of the Tax Administration Act. First, the opening reference to “tax” in the definition is meant to refer to all tax types and not just income tax. However, “tax” is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 as meaning only income tax, whereas “tax” is defined in the Tax Administration Act to mean all tax types. Secondly, the reference in the definition to “tax law” was meant to refer to the Tax Administration Act definition of that term, as that term is not defined in the Income Tax Act. These problems would be resolved by repealing the definition of “assessment” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act and re-enacting it in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act (with any appropriate consequential drafting changes). A new Income Tax Act definition of “assessment” stating that the term has the same meaning as the Tax Administration Act definition should be enacted. These amendments do not result in a policy change and should apply from the 2002- 2003 income year, which is the same application date as the main self-assessment amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Recovery of excess tax credits allowed Submission (Matter raised by officials) Former section 165A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be re-enacted with the section heading of “Recovery of excess tax credits allowed”. The re-enacted section should also be made subject to other specific excess credit recovery provisions. 147 Comment The Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 repealed section 165A of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which allowed the Commissioner to recover an excess tax credit previously allowed as if it were income tax payable under the Income Tax Act 1994. This amendment was consequential to the main self-assessment amendments. Section 165A of the Tax Administration Act was repealed because the only explicit reference to that section in the tax credit provisions (section LC 3) had been repealed by an earlier amendment and, therefore, it was assumed that section 165A was redundant. However, this assumption was not correct. Although not explicitly referred to in other tax credit provisions in Part L, former section 165A allowed the recovery of certain excess tax credits previously allowed, such as resident withholding tax credits and imputation credits. These provisions previously contained their own excess tax credit recovery provisions which were repealed in 1996 when section 165A was originally enacted. It is therefore desirable that section 165A be re-enacted to allow the recovery of excess tax credits. The section heading should be changed from the previous “Recovery of refund due to excess tax credits allowed” to “Recovery of excess tax credits allowed”. This is because the provision allows the recovery of all excess tax credits and not just those which result in an actual refund being paid to a taxpayer. The re-enacted section 165A should also be made subject to the specific excess credit recovery provisions in sections LC 3, LC 4(11) and LD 1(6). The amendment should apply from the 2002-2003 income year, which is the same application date as the main self-assessment amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor drafting changes Submission (Matters raised by officials) In section ED 7(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994, “a amended assessment” should be replaced with “an amended assessment”. In section LC 4(11)(e), “date of the assessment” should be replaced with “date of the notice of assessment”. 148 Comment The changes should be made to correct minor drafting errors in the self-assessment amendments enacted by the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001. These minor corrections should apply from the 2002-2003 income year, which is the same application date as the main self-assessment amendments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 149 Miscellaneous amendments 150 REGULATORY IMPACT AND BUSINESS COMPLIANCE COST STATEMENT Submission (13 – Business New Zealand) Officials should be asked to provide the best quantitative estimates on the financial and economic impacts of the changes contained in the bill, in the short and longer term. Comment Officials are already aware of the need to conduct a robust compliance cost analysis when developing tax policy proposals, and also adhere to the regulatory impact and business compliance cost statement requirements mandated by Cabinet. Consequently, tax policy proposals submitted to Cabinet which have compliance cost implications for business include a business compliance cost statement. Furthermore, resulting tax bills in which such proposals are introduced incorporate these statements. This procedure has been followed in relation to the legislative changes proposed in this bill. In addition to meeting these existing requirements, tax policy officials are considering options for research into the tax-related compliance costs incurred by New Zealand businesses, with a view to establishing a robust benchmark for further analysis. The objective of the research would be to provide a continuing framework for monitoring the tax-related compliance costs of businesses, and to measure the impact on compliance costs of recent and proposed changes to the tax system. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 151 MISCELLANEOUS DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Commencement and application dates Nature of proposed changes The wording of clause 2 should be changed to reflect the existence of many application provisions relating to individual clauses. Those application provisions should be changed to improve the accuracy of the wording without changing its effect. Clauses affected 2, 5 to 8, 10, 11, 15 to 36, 38, 39 to 43, 44 to 58, 59 to 70, 72 to 93, 94 to 97, 99, 105 to108, 111, 113, 119, 122, 123, 125 to 127, 128, 129, 131, 133 to 135, 137 to 142, 144, 146, 148 to 154, 156 to 159, 161 to 164. Issue: Numbering Nature of proposed changes The numbering of inserted provisions needs to allow for the possibility of later insertions. A particular problem is the numbering of provisions that are inserted before an existing sequence. The practice of numbering inserted provisions has previously been inconsistent. It is proposed to standardise practice so that “B” (rather than “A”) is used in the number of the first provision inserted after an existing provision; “A” will be reserved for a provision inserted before the existing provision. Thus, “1B” will be inserted between “1” and “2”, while “1A” would be inserted before “1”. Similarly, “1BA” will be inserted between “1” and “1B”, and “1BB” will be inserted between “1B” and “1C”. Clauses 118 and 119 are examples of such insertions. Clauses affected 5B, 9, 13, 15, 18, 24, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38B, 39 to 45, 58B, 60, 64 to 68, 72, 74 to 78, 80 to 82, 85, 88, 89, 93B to 97, 105, 107 to 111, 113 to 115, 117, 120, 121, 122B, 124, 125, 127 to 129, 131, 137, 160B, 164. 152 REMEDIAL TRUSTEE INCOME ISSUE Issue: Incorrect section reference in trustee income rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section HH 7 (b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 contains a reference to section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The reference should be to section 17 of the latter Act. Officials recommend that: • the incorrect reference to section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be corrected to refer to section 17 of that Act; and • this proposed amendment come into force on 1 April 1995, and apply with respect to the tax on income derived in the 1995-96 and subsequent income years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 153 REMEDIAL APPLICATION OF TAX CODES Issue: Incorrect reference in section NC 8(1)(da) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section NC 8(1) provides the various tax codes for employees subject to the PAYE Rules. Sections NC 8 (1)(da) and (db) contain incorrect references to “Schedule 19, clause 6”. The references should be to “Schedule 19(5A) and (5B), respectively, in each section. Officials recommend that: • The incorrect references to “Schedule 19, clause 6” in sections NC 8(1)(da) and (db) be corrected to refer to “Schedule 19, clauses (5A) and (5B)”, respectively, in each section. • These proposed amendments apply to tax deductions from source deduction payments for pay periods ending on or after 1 July 1998. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 154 AMENDMENTS TO CORRECT DRAFTING ERRORS IN THE TAXATION (RELIEF, REFUNDS AND MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS) ACT 2002 Issue: Incorrect section cross references in section 59(1) of Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 59(1) of the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 amends section ND 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 to enable an employer who has previously elected to pay FBT on another basis to request the Commissioner to amend the earlier FBT liability. The internal cross references in the new sections ND 1(4) to (6) incorrectly refer to subsections (1)(b)(ii), (1)(c)(ii) and (1)(c)(i). The correct references should be, respectively, to subsections (2)(b)(ii), (2)(c)(ii) and (2)(c)(i). Officials recommend that: • the incorrect cross references be corrected by amending sections ND 1(4) and (5) of the Income Tax Act 1994; and • the proposed amendments come into force on 17 October 2002, that being the commencement date of the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: An amendment to the definition of “taxable supply” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 was omitted from the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 23(2) of the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 amends section ED 4(7)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 by replacing “services, and taxable supply” with “and services”. To operate as intended, the amendment to section ED 4(7) also requires an amendment to the section OB 1 definition of “taxable supply”. This amendment was omitted from the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 155 Officials recommend that: • the section OB 1 definition of “taxable supply” be amended by replacing “assigned by section ED 4(7) with “given to it by section 2 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985”; and • this proposed amendment should apply to the 2002-03 and subsequent income years, that being the commencement date provided for the amendment to section ED 4(7) by the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Incorrect section references in sections 14(3) and 66(30) of the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous provisions) Act 2002. These have the effect of rendering amendment to the definition of “consideration” potentially inoperative. Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 14 replaces section CJ 7 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Section 14(3) provides the basis on which the amendment commences and contains an incorrect reference to section 10(3). The reference should be to section 13(3). Section 66(5) amends the associated definition of “consideration” in section OB 1. The amendment in section 66(5) is given application by sections 66(29) and (30). The reference in section 66(30) to “section 10(3)” should be to section 13(3). As a result, section 14 and the amendment in section 66(5) have incorrect applications. In these circumstances, the appropriate method of correction of these errors is the amendment of sections 14(3) and 66(30). Officials therefore recommend that: • section 14(3) of the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous provisions) Act 2002 be amended by replacing ‘section 10(3)” with “section 14(3). • sections 66(30) of the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous provisions) Act 2002 be repealed and re-enacted with the correct section reference in the replacement section 66(30). • the proposed amendment and repeal and re-enactment should apply from 17 October 2002, that being the date of commencement of the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous provisions) Act 2002.

117 1 Taxation of Maori organisations 3 OVERVIEW Introduction The bill introduces legislation that modernises the tax treatment of Maori organisations that manage communally owned assets. They replace the current, specific tax rules that apply to Maori authorities. The proposed changes recognise that there is a continued need for specific tax rules for Maori organisations that manage assets held in communal ownership and face legal and economic constraints because of the nature of that ownership. They are set apart from other entities like ordinary companies and trusts by factors such as the difficulty of selling Maori freehold land and other tribal assets, the legal restrictions placed on the use of these assets, and the unique way in which such assets must be owned and administered. The proposed Maori authority rules are aimed at updating rules which date back to the 1950s, and simplifying tax compliance and tax administration for Maori authorities, their members and Inland Revenue. The proposed measures also correct a number of problems relating to the potential for double taxation of Maori authority income and the overtaxation of member distributions. Other key changes in the bill relate to: • standardising the tax rules that apply to the Maori Trustee to clarify that the new Maori authority rules will apply to the Maori Trustee in its capacity of agent in administering assets under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993; • extending the current deduction available to Maori authorities for donations to Maori associations to include gifts of money to organisations with “approved donee status”; • relaxing the public benefit requirement so that an organisation that meets the “charitable purposes” requirement will not be automatically excluded from the “charitable” income tax exemption simply because its members are connected by blood ties; and • clarifying the circumstances in which entities that administer marae may be eligible for charitable income tax exemption. Twenty-four submissions commented on the proposed measures. The main issues raised in submissions are briefly discussed below. Te Puni Kokiri were involved in the preparation of this part of the officials’ report on submissions on the bill. Proposed Maori authority rules There is general support for the proposed Maori authority rules from Maori organisations and the tax community. The measures are viewed as a pragmatic response to addressing the current problems of the potential for double taxation of Maori authority income and the overtaxation of distributions. 4 Submissions also consider that the policy approach of taxing entities as a proxy for their underlying owners is appropriate and should be extended to other entities such as superannuation and investment funds. The scope of the Maori authority rules attracted divergent views in submissions. Concerns were expressed about the restrictive nature of the “list” format of the definition of “Maori authority”. Many submissions supporting the Maori authority reforms stated that all entities that bear the hallmarks of communal ownership and restricted participation should be eligible to apply the proposed Maori authority rules. Excluding some of those entities would create “a gross inequity and evince grave and manifest disrespect for Maori custom”. Submissions also identified groups of Maori organisations that should be included, consistent with the proposed policy, which are currently excluded in the proposed legislation. These excluded organisations would need to be assessed as part of the registration process to determine whether they, in fact, fall outside the proposed definition. A small number of submissions consider that the definition of “Maori authority” goes too far. Allowing wholly owned companies to apply a lower tax rate of 19.5%, compared with ordinary companies, who face a 33% tax rate, elicited criticism and claims that the proposed measures are unconstitutional, discriminatory and economically harmful. The main proponents of the proposed Maori authority rules also seek to have the measures apply sooner than the 2004-05 income year, especially the lower tax rate of 19.5%. Relaxing the public benefit requirement There is general support for relaxing the public benefit requirement, although some submissions consider that the amendment does not go far enough. One submission considers that hapu should be charitable in their own right, a status afforded to them under the Treaty of Waitangi. Marae charitable tax exemption Submissions seek clarification that the proposed amendment would not preclude entities administering marae from seeking charitable status under the general exemption. They consider that the proposed exemption is too narrow – that is, the exemption should not be confined to entities administering marae on Maori reservations. They also consider that the exemption should apply in respect of funds applied to charitable purposes. 5 Key policy issues The proposed definition of “Maori authority” In considering the appropriate scope of the Maori authority rules, the government considered that if the definition of “Maori authority” was too broad there would be less justification for the lower entity tax rate and other concessions associated with the proposed rules. The proposed list of entities limits the scope of the rules to Maori organisations that manage communally owned assets whose ownership and administration is subject to certain statutory restrictions or government criteria or processes. For example, Maori land trusts, Maori incorporations, Maori Trust Boards and the Maori Trustee are all subject to specific legislation that imposes certain restrictions or constraints on their ability to develop or trade their assets. The Crown Forestry Rental Trust and the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission were established according to specific government processes and are subject to strict governance and management requirements. Entities that receive and manage assets of the treaty settlement redress or the fisheries settlement must comply with specific government criteria relating to governance, management and accountability, to be considered appropriate recipients of settlement assets. Companies wholly owned by a Maori authority or a group of Maori authorities were included in the definition of “Maori authority” on the basis that the underlying owners in the parent authority and the parent authority itself are subject to the restrictions or constraints that justify specific tax rules. Including these companies in the definition would reduce their tax-related compliance costs and is unlikely to result in anti- competitive behaviour (a concern expressed in some submissions). Excluding these companies could lead them to transfer their income to “parent” authorities. All the entities that could potentially fall within the definition of “Maori authority” share the common hallmark of communal ownership, which inevitably involves restrictions on the ability of individual members or owners in these entities to transfer their property rights. However, simply holding or administering communally owned assets for the benefit of members that just happen to be Maori is insufficient in itself to claim Maori authority tax status under the proposed policy. The proposed policy requires some form of statutory restriction or government criteria or process, such as for treaty settlements, which affects the ownership structures that are ultimately adopted by Maori organisations. Applying broad criteria such as communal ownership per se in the definition would create uncertainty and boundary issues that could risk the integrity and sustainability of the proposed Maori authority tax rules. Officials therefore do not support extending the definition to cover Maori organisations that are not subject to statutory restrictions or government process or criteria. 6 Current Maori authorities may be excluded The Committee has sought advice on whether current Maori authorities could be excluded under the proposed definition of “Maori authority” and, if they are, how Inland Revenue plans to deal with it. Since the proposed definition of “Maori authority” applies to a more limited range of Maori organisations than does the current definition of “Maori authority, there are likely to be some current Maori authorities who would not be eligible to apply the new rules. Where appropriate, officials have made every effort to capture organisations that meet the stated policy criteria in the proposed definition, as reflected by the recommendations contained in this report. Should there remain some organisations that are excluded but which should, in fact, be eligible to apply the Maori authority rules, they will need to approach the government individually and seek to be added to the list. This will allow the government to assess whether an organisation satisfies the policy criteria to be taxed as a Maori authority. The proposed public benefit amendment Proposed new section OB 3A(2) relaxes the public benefit requirement so that a trust, society or institution that meets the “charitable purpose” requirement will not be automatically excluded from qualifying for the associated income tax exemption simply because its members are connected by blood ties. The amendment applies to Maori and non-Maori organisations, but it is especially relevant to Maori organisations as many define their beneficiary class by a personal relationship (through blood ties) to a named person. In determining whether a trust, society or institution meets the public benefit requirement, other factors will still be relevant, such as the nature of the entity, the activities it undertakes, the potential beneficiary class, the relationship between the beneficiaries and the number of potential beneficiaries. These factors were enumerated in the Dingle v Turner 1 decision. The public benefit requirement as developed by the courts All entities other than those established for the relief of poverty must satisfy the public benefit requirement. Although the question of whether an entity meets this requirement is considered on the facts of each case, the courts have developed a number of general tests for determining whether the benefiting group is the public or at least an “appreciably significant section” of the public. 1 \[1972\] AC 601. 7 Through cases such as Re Compton 2 and Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities 3 , it has been established that the number of beneficiaries must not be negligible. In addition, those beneficiaries must not be determined on the basis of a personal relationship such as blood or contractual ties. If they are, the entity will not be for the public benefit. Instead, it will be for the benefit of private individuals and therefore not “charitable”. 4 Lord Cross, delivering the court's decision in Dingle v Turner has questioned the Re Compton and Oppenheim tests and suggested that the existence of a personal connection such as blood ties or contract should not be determinative of whether an entity provides a public rather than a private benefit. He was of the opinion that consideration should also be given to the nature of the entity and the charitable purpose for which it was established, the number of beneficiaries, and the degree of connection between the beneficiaries. Although the Re Compton and Oppenheim tests have continued to be applied in the English courts, Lord Cross’s comments have been noted with approval in three recent New Zealand cases. 5 Consequently, there remains a degree of uncertainty in New Zealand about whether trusts, societies or institutions that have beneficiaries determined by a blood or a contractual relationship will satisfy the public benefit requirement. The proposed charitable exemption for marae The proposed amendment is intended to confer an automatic “charitable” exemption on marae situated on Maori reservations that solely apply their funds to administer and maintain the marae’s physical structure. However, the way in which the amendment is reflected in the bill has created confusion as to its intention and application in practice. Firstly, it is unclear whether marae or marae-based organisations that do not qualify under the proposed amendment could seek charitable status under the general “charitable” income tax exemption (as amended by the proposed public benefit requirement). Secondly, the amendment is unclear as to whether the marae per se is the entity subject to the exemption or whether it is the entity that administers the marae that is subject to the exemption. The policy intention is that it is the entity responsible for the marae that is subject to the exemption, not the marae per se. Marae in this context is the land set aside for the use of hapu or iwi, with buildings on it, such as a meeting house and a dining hall. 2 \[1945\] 1 All ER 198. 3 \[1951\] 1 All ER 31. 4 In Oppenheim a gift for the education of the children of the employees and former employees of the company and its subsidiaries failed to qualify as a charity because the employees of a firm were not a public class. This was in spite of the fact that at the testator’s death the number of employees exceeded 110,000. 5 New Zealand Society of Accountants v CIR \[1986\] 1 NZLR 147; Educational Fees Protection Society Incorporated v CIR (1991) 12 NZTC 8,203; Latimer and Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, CA215/01. 8 There are a wide range of entity types that may be employed to administer marae. They include: • an entity established under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908; • an unincorporated body of persons, for example, a marae committee; • trustees of a trust appointed under a Maori reservation; and • a corporate body appointed under a Maori reservation. These entities should be eligible to apply the charitable exemption provisions as either a “trust”, “society” or an “institution”. Thirdly, the amendment applies solely to entities administering marae on Maori reservations. This is because the trustees of a Maori reservation are statutorily debarred from alienating the land subject to the reservation. This presents a difficulty for trustees of Maori reservations to qualify for the “charitable” tax exemption because of the rule that property must always be applied for charitable purposes, even in winding up situations. In practice, the usual way of avoiding this requirement while seeking exemption was to establish a separate discrete legal entity to administer the day-to-day affairs of the marae. The land remains vested in the Trustees of the Maori reservation, while a separate entity manages the affairs of the marae. The amendment provides relief from the alienation of property requirement for trustees of Maori reservations and avoids the need for these trustees to establish another entity to administer the marae. If the trustees of a Maori reservation wish to establish a separate entity to administer the day-to-day running of the marae the specific marae exemption would still apply, since the exemption applies to marae situated on Maori reservations. The final issue concerns the application of the general “charitable” income tax exemption. Entities administering marae that are not situated on Maori reservations must apply for exemption under the general charitable provision. Generally, such entities would not be subject to the same restrictions affecting Maori reservations, but even if they were they could still set up a separate discrete legal entity to administer the marae and apply for charitable exemption under the general provision in the same way as entities administering churches and public halls. 9 PROPOSED MEASURES “DISCRIMINATORY” Issue: Bill of Rights Act and Human Rights Act – implications Submission (1 – The One New Zealand Party, 10 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 23 – Chen, Palmer and Partners (supported by 23A – Independent Fisheries Ltd)) Chen, Palmer and Partners consider that parliament would be acting contrary to the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993 if it introduced tax rules which give a privileged tax status to certain commercial entities because they are owned by Maori. This is “discrimination” on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. The submission is concerned about the inclusion of wholly owned subsidiaries of Maori authorities in the proposed definition of “Maori authority”. Wholly owned subsidiaries may not be subject to the “restrictions or constraints” associated with managing Maori assets in communal ownership and so allowing them to apply a 19.5% rate, compared with other similar commercial entities who face a 33% rate, would give the former a competitive advantage. The submission recommends that wholly owned subsidiaries of a Maori authority be excluded from the proposed definition of “Maori authority”. The Retailers Association is opposed to taxing entities on the basis of ethnicity. The One New Zealand Party claims the bill gives a tax preference to one race of people, namely those who can claim Maori descendancy. Comment Officials do not agree with the view expressed in the Chen, Palmer and Partners submission that the proposed measures for Maori authorities are inconsistent with the Human Rights legislation. The reason for retaining specific tax rules for Maori organisations that administer communally owned assets is that these entities have unique characteristics that set them apart from other entities such as ordinary companies and trusts. These characteristics relate to certain constraints or restrictions imposed on the administration and ownership of communally held assets by specific legislation or by government process or criteria. Entities listed in paragraph (a) of the proposed definition of “Maori authority” clearly meet the description above. Paragraph (b) of the proposed definition includes wholly owned entities of a Maori authority or a group of Maori authorities. Wholly owned entities will often have their own governance structures and may be unfettered by the constraints of the parent authority, so it could be argued that they should be excluded from the Maori authority tax rules. 10 In determining the application of the Maori authority rules, however, officials consider that regard must be had to the ultimate owners and the restrictions or constraints on the ownership structures employed to administer their assets. Furthermore, including wholly owned entities in the definition will give rise to compliance benefits. If wholly owned companies were excluded, Maori authorities would have to carry out their commercial activities within the “parent” structure or in unincorporated bodies such as joint ventures or partnerships, or wholly owned entities could transfer income to the “parent” using a variety of methods such as deductible fees. Maori authorities could achieve the same tax result as if they had wholly owned entities undertaking the commercial activities but would incur higher transaction costs. The justification underlying the retention of specific rules for Maori authorities recognises that their ultimate owners are subject to certain constraints or restrictions imposed by specific legislation or government process. Although these owners may share a common ethnic tie, this is not the justification for applying the specific tax rules. Once it was clarified that there was a case for separate rules, the question of the appropriate tax rate arose. The reason for setting this rate at 19.5% is that most members of a Maori authority would be on a 19.5% tax rate. This view is based on the fact that approximately 90 percent of Maori are on incomes of less than $38,000, and 19.5% is the appropriate tax rate for this level of income. The rationale for applying the 19.5% rate to Maori authorities is not that their owners belong to a particular race but that this is the marginal tax rate of a large majority of the owners. These lower marginal tax rates apply according to income level, not ethnicity. For a policy measure to be unlawfully discriminatory it must make a distinction based on one of the prohibited grounds of discrimination listed in section 21 of the Human Rights Act 1993. Ownership structures and income levels are not prohibited grounds of discrimination. We consider, therefore, that the rationale for applying specific tax rules with a lower tax rate to Maori authorities should not be regarded as unlawful discrimination or inconsistent with the Human Rights legislation. Officials also note that any widening of the proposed definition that is not based on the rationale as outlined above may run the risk of violating the Human Rights legislation. The Attorney General is required to provide a view on whether new legislation contains proposals that are inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and, if so, to issue a “section 7” report to that effect. Since no such report was issued at the time the proposed measures were introduced, it follows that the Attorney General did not consider that the proposed measures breached the New Zealand Bill of Rights or the Human Rights legislation. Consultation with the Ministry of Justice on the Human Rights implications of the proposed measures was undertaken before the legislation was introduced. 11 Recommendation No recommendation is required. 12 DEFINITION OF “MAORI AUTHORITY” Clause 65(12) Issue: A “catch-all” provision should be included in the definition of “Maori authority” Submission (11W – Pukawa D3 Trust and Pukawa 5B Trust, 14W – Waipapa 9 Lands Trust, 15 – Te Ohu Kai Moana, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 17W – Rotohokahoka F6 Trust, 18W – Waiteti 2 Section 1A2 Trust, 19W – Waikuta 2 Trust, 20W – Fairy Springs Trust, 25 – Office of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu) The proposed definition should be broadened from its current “list” format to a “catch-all provision”. Submissions state that the definition may exclude Maori organisations that, by their objects, rules, constitutions or other governing documents, may also face the same restrictions and constraints that justify the specific tax rules for Maori authorities. Comment Whether an entity outside the proposed definition satisfies the policy criteria is a question of fact which can only be determined with regard to the specific entity’s founding documents or constituting legislation and the circumstances surrounding its establishment. Thus it is difficult to determine whether any given example of the classes of entities suggested by submissions should be included. Submissions suggested the following classes of entities as potentially falling outside the proposed definition but which should be included: • entities incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 (for example, established to run marae); • entities set up under the Maori Reserved Lands Act 1955 that do not have charitable status; • a company with a Maori reservation vested in it (for example, when a body corporate operates the marae); • iwi and runanga entities; • trustees of trusts formed to hold or administer Maori assets; and • entities upon which a settlement entity has itself settled assets but which are not wholly owned by the settlement entity – for example, trustees of trusts, charitable companies that are not wholly owned “subsidiaries” (as defined in the Companies Act 1993) and incorporated societies. 13 If it can be shown that any of these entities meet the criteria of the policy underlying the proposed definition, officials consider that they should be eligible to apply the proposed Maori authority rules. If an entity considers that it qualifies as a Maori authority it could seek recognition by way of legislative change to the definition of “Maori authority”. This approach is similar to overseas charities who seek approved “donee tax status” under section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Officials consider that this approach is preferable to a “catch-all” provision since such a provision could include Maori organisations that do not meet the stated policy criteria. Recommendation That the inclusion of the “catch-all” provision be declined. Note that if a Maori organisation considers that it is a Maori authority it will need to approach the government and seek to be added to the list. This will allow the government to assess whether the organisation satisfies the policy criteria to be taxed as a Maori authority. Issue: Commissioner of Inland Revenue should approve entities for Maori authority tax status Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 25 – Office of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu) If the “catch-all” provision is not adopted, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should be given the power to determine whether certain Maori organisations are eligible to apply the proposed Maori authority rules. Comment In light of our previous recommendation, officials do not support this submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 14 Issue: The definition should reflect the proposal as it was expressed in the discussion document Taxation of Maori organisations Submission (22 – New Zealand Maori Council) The proposed definition should be extended to include: (a) organisations for the benefit of all Maori; (b) organisations established for the benefit of iwi or hapu provided these groups are large enough to constitute an appreciably significant section of the public; (c) marae; and (d) organisations established for the benefit of all Maori within a sufficiently large community. Comment The proposed definition is much narrower than that which appeared in the discussion document Taxation of Maori organisations, released in August 2001. The discussion document definition was considered too broad, especially if the entity tax rate of 19.5% were to apply Maori authorities. The discussion document was intended only as a basis for consultation. The submission explains that proposals (a) to (c) reflect the expectation raised by last year’s discussion document and proposal (d) would cater for modern service organisations. It states that the prima facie test of whether the group benefiting from an organisation established for iwi or hapu constitutes an appreciably significant section of the public should be that it has an up-to-date roll of at least 800 members (including children). Furthermore, it argues the prima facie test of whether an organisation for the benefit of all Maori covers a sufficiently large community should be a community of at least 8000 (Maori and others). Given the government’s policy underlying the definition of “Maori authority”, proposals (a), (b) and (d) would not meet the requirements of that policy. In relation to proposal (c), we consider that entities administering marae should be considered under the general charitable exemption or the proposed specific marae exemption. The facts of each case will vary, but if neither of these exemptions applies, these entities are likely to be taxed as non-profit bodies on the basis that they share many of the hallmarks of such entities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 Issue: Entities administering land under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 6 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The proposed definition should be amended to include entities administering land pursuant to an order made under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993, rather than only persons established in accordance with an order made under that Act. Comment Clause 65(12), subparagraph (a)(i) of the proposed definition includes “a person established in accordance with an order made under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 (Maori land Act 1993)”. The intention of this provision is to recognise Maori land trusts and Maori incorporations constituted under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 as Maori authorities. The submission is concerned that the term “person” may not, in fact cover trusts and agencies established under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. The trust or agency is unlikely to be a “person” for the purposes of that Act, and the trustees and agents themselves are not established by court order. Officials note that the tax definition of “person” covers both individuals and non- individuals such as companies, local or public authorities and unincorporated bodies of persons. The term “company” means any body corporate or other entity which has a legal personality or existence distinct from those of its members, whether that body corporate or other entity is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere. An unincorporated body of persons may include trustees of trusts, partnerships, joint ventures and clubs and societies. Officials consider that the use of the term “person” is appropriate in a tax context since it can cover a Maori incorporation or a land trust established under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. However, we recognise that the term “person” may cause some confusion outside the tax context, given its ordinary, everyday meaning. The submission refers to “entities” but this term might not be appropriate as it is questionable whether a trust could be an “entity”. Given that either a trust or company could be constituted by court order, subparagraph (a)(i) should specifically refer to a trust or a company. Thus officials accept the submission point and recommend that subparagraph (a)(i) be redrafted so that it applies to trusts and companies constituted by court order in accordance with Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. 6 The following writers of submissions indicated their support for the submissions from the Federation of Maori Authorities: 11W – Pukawa D3 Trust and Pukawa 5B Trust, 14W – Waipapa 9 Lands Trust, 15 – Te Ohu Kai Moana, 17W – Rotohokahoka F6 Trust, 18W – Waiteti 2 Section 1A2 Trust, 19W – Waikuta 2 Trust, 20W – Fairy Springs Trust. 16 In addition, the submission point specifically refers to “administering land”, but this is too limited since Maori land trusts may also administer shares in a Maori incorporation. On this basis, we do not support the suggested reference to “administering land”. A further issue relates to those entities that administer Maori freehold land under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 but who are not constituted pursuant to a court order under that Act. Historically, such entities were created by statute to administer Maori land and other assets for the benefit of their owners. Those statutes have since been superseded by new legislation, and the entities have been reconstituted as non- statutory bodies, but they remain statutorily bound to comply with the provisions of the Maori land legislation. Officials are aware of several entities that are established under various Maori Purposes Acts from 1926 to 1981 to administer assets that may be subject to the specific alienation provisions of Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. Officials consider that such entities should be eligible to apply the Maori authority rules as this would be consistent with the underlying policy of the proposed definition. Therefore sub-paragraph (a) of the proposed definition should be amended to include entities subject to the restrictions imposed by Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. Recommendation That clause 65(12) be amended so that the proposed definition of “Maori authority” is more consistent with the policy intent of including entities subject to the legislative restrictions imposed by Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. Issue: Inclusion of the Maori Trustee’s agencies and trusteeships Submissions (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) • The proposed definition should be amended to include all agencies and trusteeships of the Maori Trustee. • Provision should be made to capture the Maori Trustee’s agencies within the Maori authority rules by deeming the Maori Trustee to have derived income processed by him in his capacity as agent. • Each trust or agency of the Maori Trustee should be taxed separately. 17 Comment Clause 65(12), subparagraph (a)(ii) of the definition of “Maori authority” includes “the Maori Trustee in the Maori Trustee’s capacity as collecting and distribution agent in respect of rents, royalties or interest”. The purpose of this provision is to apply the proposed Maori authority rules to the Maori Trustee when it acts as agent in the collection and distribution of rents, royalties and interest. The submission seeks to extend the Maori authority rules to apply to all agencies and trusteeships of the Maori Trustee on the basis that a uniform tax treatment for all entities under the Maori Trustee’s administration is critical to its efficiency in an environment with growing demands. Officials do not agree that all agencies and trusteeships of the Maori Trustee should be included in the proposed definition. The reason is that the Maori Trustee may also administer property by agreement with the owners of the relevant assets, although such administrations may not be subject to the provisions of Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. Furthermore, the Maori Trustee may act as trustee of a deceased person’s estate. Including such trusteeships and agencies in the proposed definition would be inconsistent with the proposed policy. Officials consider, therefore, that sub-paragraph a(ii) should be limited to situations where the Maori Trustee acts as agent in relation to assets administered under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. Sub-paragraph a(i) should cover the Maori Trustee’s role as a trustee under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. Officials accept that provision should be made to capture the Maori Trustee’s agencies within the Maori authority rules by deeming the Maori Trustee to have derived income processed by him in his capacity as agent. Such a provision was contained in section HK 14, whereby the Maori Trustee was taxable on that income as if entitled to it as a beneficiary, without any individual rebates. Officials also accept that the bill should be amended to clarify that each agency and trusteeship under the administration of the Maori Trustee should be treated separately for tax purposes. Recommendation That the bill clarify that each trust or agency of the Maori Trustee that falls within the proposed definition be taxed separately and that the Maori Trustee’s agencies that relate to assets administered under Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 can be taxed under the proposed rules. 18 Issue: Trusts set up to benefit Maori authorities Submissions (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The proposed definition should be amended to include trusts where all persons eligible to benefit are Maori authorities. It might be preferable to quarantine an activity in a trust rather than a wholly owned company. The ultimate ownership of the trust assets would rest with the Maori authorities subject to the restrictions and limitations justifying the tax treatment and, pragmatically, the inclusion of “wholly owned” trusts would ease compliance. Comment Officials do not support the suggested extension to the definition on the basis that it would be inconsistent with the proposed policy. If such a trust meets the policy criteria, it should seek recognition as a Maori authority by way of legislative change. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Other entities controlled by statute Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The proposed definition should be amended to include other entities holding or administering assets for, or on behalf of Maori pursuant to an Act of Parliament. The submission considers that the suggested extension to the proposed definition would include the following: • trusts created or administered under the Maori Purposes Acts, Maori Reserved Land Act 1955, various empowering Acts, and the Maori Soldiers Trust Act 1957; and • the Ngarimu VC and 28 th (Maori) Battalion Memorial Scholarship Fund. Comment Officials do not support the suggested extension to the proposed definition on the basis that it is inconsistent with the proposed policy. These organisations may not necessarily be subject to any specific statutory restriction or constraint on the administration of their assets. Officials also note that some of these organisations are administered by the Maori Trustee or are subject to Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 and may already be included, while others enjoy charitable status. If there is a 19 deserving entity it will need to approach the government and seek to be added to this list. This will allow the government to assess whether an organisation satisfies the policy criteria to be taxed as a Maori authority. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Other entities with restricted transferability of property rights Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The proposed definition should be amended to include other entities holding or administering assets on behalf of Maori (referred to as “Other Entities”) where: • the entity is restricted in its ability to transfer assets owned by it or the right of any individual to participate in the assets of the entity are not transferable; and • the entity exists to give effect to communal ownership in accordance with Maori custom. Participation in these entities is determined by whakapapa and sometimes other limiting factors. However, they differ from ordinary family trusts, where the settlor or settlors make an independent choice to share assets held individually by themselves, usually with their immediate family. The trust must be wound up within a specific timeframe (not more than the duration of a life in being at the time the gift to the trust was made, plus 21 years). Upon winding up, the assets of the trust must vest beneficially and legally in particular individuals (who will be free to dispose of those assets as they see fit) or in charities. That a family trust may be settled by or have as a beneficiary a Maori should not be sufficient to draw the trust into the Maori authorities regime. In contrast, the core assets of “Other Entities” are held for the benefit of a larger group, such as iwi or hapu, before being transferred to the entity and after it comes to an end. This form of property ownership does not readily transpose to the various property vehicles available in New Zealand’s western legal system. To the extent these entities seek recognition within the broader legal system, the choice of vehicle is difficult. Non-charitable trusts cannot hold assets in perpetuity, whilst incorporated societies do not permit the distribution of pecuniary gains to members, and companies require a shareholding structure that divides entitlements to communal assets in a manner inconsistent with traditional ownership. The most commonly chosen vehicle is a trust (charitable or otherwise) or incorporated society. Some entities, particularly those holding no significant assets, may have no specific vehicle and might, from a legal perspective, best be viewed as unincorporated societies. Others may have used (by choice or otherwise) structures imposed by statute (such as Maori Trust Boards or incorporations), or effected (as well as possible) by private legislation. 20 All of these entities bear the hallmarks of communal ownership and restricted participation. None can be excluded from the Maori authority rules “without creating a gross inequity and evincing grave and manifest disrespect for Maori custom and values”. It is not difficult to distinguish an iwi or hapu from a private family trust or business vehicle. In more difficult cases, the original reasons for vesting assets in the entity should resolve the issue. Any uncertainty in more difficult cases would be more than compensated by the benefits of consistency with the fundamental nature of an entity. The current list of entity types that may be accidents of colonial history skirts the hard question of their essential character. Inclusion of “Other Entities” would ensure a definition sufficiently flexible to function efficiently as the legal environment changes. Comment Officials do not support the suggested extension to the proposed definition. These “other entities” may not necessarily be constrained by specific legislation or subject to a specific government process or criteria. As mentioned earlier, communal ownership per se does not justify the inclusion of a Maori organisation in the definition of “Maori authority”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission Submission (15 – Te Ohu Kai Moana) The proposed definition should be amended to include successor bodies to the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission. Comment Officials consider that this matter should be determined at the time the successor body is established. Officials understand that legislation will be required to establish the successor body. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 21 Issue: Settlement entities Submission (15 – Te Ohu Kai Moana, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The proposed definition should be amended to include: • existing organisations that may be suitable for the receipt of treaty settlement redress and, in fact, hold such assets but were not established for that specific purpose; • organisations that receive and manage assets of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Settlement; and • organisations that can demonstrate that they meet the same structural requirements as settlement entities. Comment Clause 65 (12), sub-paragraph (a)(vi) was drafted with initial settlement entities in mind – that is, those entities established in accordance with the Treaty of Waitangi direct-negotiations process. However, the amendment does not reflect the fact that pre-existing entities that comply with the governance, structural and management requirements for settlement entities may also receive and manage assets. Officials consider the inclusion of these entities in the proposed definition would be consistent with the proposed policy. The current wording seems wide enough to encompass settlement entities of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Settlement, but some doubt has been expressed in submissions. For this reason, officials recommend that sub-paragraph (a)(vi) be clarified to reflect the fact that structures set up to receive assets of the fisheries settlement are similar to entities of the treaty settlement redress process and, therefore, should also be included in the definition of “Maori authority”. With respect to entities that can demonstrate that they meet the same structural requirements as settlement entities, this extension of the proposed definition would be inconsistent with the proposed policy underlying the definition. Such entities might exist without having been subject to specific legislation or any government process. The “entity” to which the sub-paragraph applies should be defined in the deed of settlement, or in the legal documentation in the case of entities receiving fisheries assets. 22 Recommendation That clause 65(12), sub-paragraph (a)(vi) be amended so that an entity that receives and manages assets as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement redress, or as part of the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Settlement is included in the proposed definition. Note that the “entity” to which this provision applies should be the entity that is defined in the deed of settlement, or in the legal documentation in the case of entities receiving fisheries assets. Issue: Wholly owned entities of a Maori authority Submission (15 – Te Ohu Kai Moana, 27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) Te Ohu Kai Moana submits that the proposed definition should include wholly owned entities of Maori authorities, rather than wholly owned subsidiaries. The term “subsidiary” implies that only where the entities involved are companies will clause 65(12), paragraph (b) of the proposed definition apply. Many Maori authorities are not companies. In a similar submission, the Federation of Maori Authorities and the Office of the Maori Trustee submits that clause 65(12), paragraph (b) of the proposed definition should be amended to include “a company wholly owned by a Maori authority or a group of Maori authorities”. Comment Officials acknowledge that the current wording of clause 65(12), paragraph (b) does not achieve its purpose. The reference to “wholly owned subsidiaries” restricts the provision to corporate structures and precludes Maori authorities that are trusts who have wholly owned companies. However, the reference to “wholly owned entities” is imprecise since it is not possible for a Maori authority to wholly own any entity other than a company. Officials consider that the word “company” would more accurately reflect the intended meaning. Recommendation That clause 65(12), paragraph (b) be amended to apply to a company rather than a subsidiary. 23 Issue: Current Maori authorities should be included Submission (29 – New Zealand Law Society) The proposed definition should be amended to include entities which are currently treated as a Maori authority. Comment Including all current Maori authorities in the proposed definition could mean including many entities that are not consistent with the policy underlying the proposed definition. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Companies wholly owned by Maori authorities should be excluded from the proposed definition Submissions (4 – C Gibbons and Holdings Ltd, 10 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 13 – Business New Zealand, 23 – Chen, Palmer and Partners 7 (supported by 23A – Independent Fisheries Ltd)) Several submissions argued that businesses owned by Maori authorities should be taxed as ordinary companies. Any concessions for such businesses should apply to all companies and trusts. Beneficiaries of such organisations were like shareholders of a private company, and much of their profit was reinvested. The New Zealand Retailers Association and Chen Palmer and Partners submitted that the lower tax rate applying to businesses owned by Maori authorities as a result of their inclusion would give them an unfair and distortionary competitive advantage. Chen, Palmer and Partners submitted that the new rules should achieve competitive neutrality for all companies, and limit the benefits of the proposed policy to distributions to authority members (the real beneficiaries). There would be incentives to structure businesses and assets to take advantage of the favourable tax rate. The argument that including wholly owned subsidiaries in the definition of “Maori authority” would allow parent authorities to apply a single tax framework, reducing tax compliance costs while quarantining commercial risk, failed because the benefits did not justify the resulting economic distortions. A non-Maori authority company setting up a business must bear the risks, and Maori authorities are likely to receive some income through non-Maori authorities, preventing the application of a single tax 7 Chen Palmer and Partners provided their submission on behalf of their clients Sanford Limited, Amaltal Corporation Limited, Vela Fishing Limited, Solander Group, Simunovich Fisheries Limited, Talleys Fisheries Limited, United Fisheries Limited, and Independent Fisheries Limited. 24 framework. The flow of imputation credits among grouped or related Maori authority companies would exacerbate the economic impact of the regime. Comment Companies wholly owned by Maori authorities are included in the proposed definition of “Maori authority” in order to promote the efficient commercial structuring of Maori authority assets, including quarantining commercial risk in separate companies. If these companies were excluded from the Maori authority rules, Maori authorities would be encouraged to carry on their commercial activities within the parent Maori authority. It would not be administratively feasible to differentiate streams of income from different kinds of assets held within the parent entity. Although Maori authorities are likely to have some income taxed under other rules – for example, dividends from ordinary companies, including companies owned entirely by Maori authorities in the definition is expected to reduce compliance costs relative to exclusion. Including these entities in the definition is also consistent with the grouping of ordinary, wholly owned companies for tax purposes, which offers certain tax advantages but encourages the efficient structuring of wholly owned commercial activities. Economic analysis suggests that the lower tax rate on Maori authority companies would not give them a significant competitive advantage and that Maori authority investment strategies will be distorted by tax considerations, whether or not their companies are included in the definition (refer “Issue: Maori authorities should face the same tax rate as other companies”). Indeed, if they are excluded, it will be possible for companies wholly owned by Maori authorities to transfer profits to a “parent” by way of management fees that are deductible from the company’s income and included in the “parent’s” income. Ordinary companies that share predominantly the same ownership are able to group and consolidate, reflecting the view that since the owners are the same, the income of the group as a whole should be considered, not the income of the individual companies. This avoids biasing Maori authorities towards carrying on all of their commercial activities within a single, parent Maori authority that may be inappropriate for the purpose. Allowing companies wholly owned by Maori authorities to be taxed either as Maori authorities or as ordinary companies allows them to choose the most efficient commercial structure. For example, they will be able to choose whether to group with other Maori authority companies, group with ordinary companies (which would, if officials’ recommendations are adopted, require them to elect out of the Maori authorities rules), or not to group at all. Officials consider that, on balance, including wholly owned companies in the definition of “Maori authority” will reduce compliance costs and will be less distortionary than excluding them. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 25 APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSED MAORI AUTHORITY RULES Issue: Clarifying the application of the Maori authority rules – new registration and election process Clause 24 Submission (15 – Te Ohu Kai Moana) The bill should clarify that a wholly owned entity of a Maori authority that otherwise qualifies to be taxed under the general tax rules should be taxed as a Maori authority only if it elects to do so. Entities should not be required to apply the Maori authority rules if they qualify under another set of tax rules. Comment Proposed new subpart HI provides entities that meet the proposed definition of “Maori authority” with the option of applying the general tax rules, if they meet the requirements of those rules. It is intended that Maori authorities would make this decision by filing the appropriate tax return at the end of the year. This approach would not require Maori authorities to provide any formal notification to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Officials have since revised this approach and consider that it would be more expedient and efficient if there were a formal registration and election process. Such a process would clarify the operation of the new subpart HI and rationalise the transitional measures for Maori authorities moving in and out of the new rules. The proposed new registration and election process is set out below. New registration requirement All entities meeting the proposed definition of “Maori authority” would need to register their tax status with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in the income year the proposed changes take effect – 2004-05. The intention of registration is to ensure that the proposed new rules are confined to the entities that meet the proposed definition of “Maori authority”. There could be some entities that are currently taxed as a Maori authority but might not meet the proposed definition of “Maori authority”. These entities would be identified as part of the registration process. 26 New election requirements In the post-reform period, a Maori authority could make a formal election to cease to be treated as a Maori authority. The Maori authority would cease to be a Maori authority for the purposes of the Income Tax Act and would no longer be eligible to apply the provisions that relate specifically to Maori authorities. Its applicable tax treatment would then depend on whether it is a trust or a company under the general tax rules – this is because, with the exception of the Maori Trustee in its capacity as agent, the listed entities in the definition are either trusts or companies. Timing of election rules Any election would take effect on the first day of the income year of the company or trust that succeeds the income year in which the notice is received by the Commissioner. However, in the case where a later income year has been specified, the election would take effect on the first day of the specified income year. The advanced notification of a change in status means that the change can take place in respect of an income year. Specific rules would be required for part-year cessation, especially in relation to entities that cease to qualify for Maori authority status part-way through an income year, or that wish to exit the rules (such as a Maori authority company that amalgamates with an ordinary company). Specific rule for the first year A Maori authority would also be permitted to elect out of the new rules in respect of the 2004-05 income year. For example, an entity is taxed as a company before the reforms and wants to continue to be treated as a company in the post-reform period. In this case the entity would have to make a formal election not to apply the Maori authority rules. This would occur as part of the registration requirement. To support this measure, a specific timing provision is required as an exception to the general timing rule mentioned above. Revocation rule The election to cease to be a Maori authority would remain effective until revoked by the company or trust. An election may only be revoked if appropriate notification in writing has been provided to the Commissioner. The revocation would take effect on the later of the beginning of the income year in which the notice of revocation is received by the Commissioner, or the beginning of the income year as may be specified in the notice. An automatic revocation would occur if an entity ceased to satisfy the definition of “Maori authority”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the bill be amended to reflect the new registration and election process. 27 Issue: Clarifying the tax consequences for movements in and out of the Maori authority rules Clause 24 Submission (Matter raised by officials) New section HI 6 and its table should be amended to reflect the new registration and election process outlined in the previous submission. Comment Proposed new section HI 6 and its table set out the specific tax consequences for companies and trusts moving in or out of the Maori authority rules. In order to accommodate the new election process consequential changes are required to new section HI 6 and the table. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarifying the consequences of re-entering the Maori authority rules and applying market value calculations Clause 24 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed new registration and election process requires consequential changes to section HI 7 and the table. Comment Rules governing the tax consequences for Maori authorities that re-enter the Maori authority rules are provided for in the proposed new section HI 7. These rules apply in situations where, under the proposed Maori authority rules, a Maori authority is taxed as a Maori authority, then taxed as a company or trust and then reverts to being taxed as a Maori authority again. A Maori authority re-entering the Maori authority rules would be subject to the same tax consequences that would have arisen had it wound up and disposed of its property at market value. The purpose of these rules is to minimise the risk of Maori authorities moving in and out of the Maori authority rules to obtain tax advantages. 28 New section HI 7 requires consequential drafting changes to accommodate the new election process. In particular, the provision should require that where a Maori authority has made an election to cease to be a Maori authority, and then subsequently revokes that election and reverts to being a Maori authority, market value calculations must be made. A problem exists, however, for companies and trusts that have made an election to cease to be a Maori authority in relation to the 2004-05 income year (that is, they continue to be taxed as a company or trust in the post-reform period) but in a subsequent year revert to being a Maori authority. Technically, these entities have “re-entered” the Maori authority rules, so market value calculations would be required to be made. Such calculations should not be required of entities applying the proposed rules for the first time. Recommendation That the bill be amended so that if a Maori authority that is a company or a trust makes an election in relation to the 2004-05 income year and subsequently reverts to being a Maori authority, market value calculations should not be required to be undertaken. If that company or trust subsequently makes an election and then revokes that election, the market value calculations should apply. Issue: Section HI 6 and HI 7 should also apply to individuals Clause 24 Submission (26W – Ernst & Young) The submission makes two points in relation to the transitional provisions: • The transitional provisions should be extended to provide for Maori authorities that are individuals. • The table in clause 24(1) should be given a brief title or included as a separate schedule to the Income Tax Act 1994, and references to the table in section HI 6 should be amended accordingly. Comment We disagree with both submission points. The proposed definition of “Maori authority” lists entities that either have a legal form of a company or a trust, so there is no need for transitional rules for individuals. The table forms part of sections HI 6 and HI 7 and must be read concurrently with those sections. We consider that there is a sufficient relationship between the table and its relevant sections. 29 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarifying the application of the company rules to Maori authorities Submission (Matter raised by officials) The rules should be clarified to ensure that a company that is a Maori authority cannot maintain an imputation credit account and that its distributions are not dividends. Comment It is intended that a Maori authority not maintain an imputation credit account. Ensuring this requires a specific provision in the Maori authority rules. It is also necessary to ensure that distributions by a Maori authority are not treated as dividends. Recommendation That the bill be amended to ensure that a Maori authority cannot maintain an imputation credit account and that its distributions are not treated as dividends. Issue: Trusts as Maori authorities should retain exclusion from beneficiary gross income and trustee income rules Clauses 21 and 23 Submission (26W – Ernst & Young) Maori authorities and their members should retain their exclusion from sections HH 3 and HH 4 – the rules relating to the taxation of income from trusts. Comment Officials agree with this submission. Current sections HH 3(6) and HH 4(8) should remain to clarify that a Maori authority and its members will be taxed according to the proposed Maori authority rules and would not be subject to the trust rules. The trust rules would apply only if the Maori authority has made a formal election to cease to be a Maori authority and meets the requirements to apply the trust rules. 30 Recommendation That clauses 21 and 23 be amended to make clear that Maori authorities will not be subject to the trust rules unless they make a formal election and also meet the requirements of the trust rules. 31 MAORI AUTHORITY TAX RATE OF 19.5% Clauses 68 and 78 Issue: Specification of the basic tax rate and resident withholding rate for Maori authorities Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The basic rate of income tax and the resident withholding tax rate for Maori authorities should refer to the lowest rates already prescribed in the schedules to the Act. This would achieve the policy objective of applying the rate that most closely reflects the marginal tax rate of members of Maori authorities, while avoiding the need to amend the Maori authority rate if the lowest rates were to change. Comment Officials consider that the basic rates of income tax and resident withholding tax for Maori authorities should be separately defined in the Act, as currently proposed in the bill. Any future change in the rates applying to Maori authorities should be given separate consideration. Parliament will have an opportunity to review the Maori authority tax rates annually when it confirms all other statutory tax rates. Some reasons for which the appropriate Maori authority rate in the future could be different from the lowest basic tax rate include a change in tax rate thresholds, a change in the income distribution of members of Maori authorities, or a change in government policy on Maori authorities. In terms of a process for reviewing the Maori authority tax rate, officials propose, as part of reporting on the confirmation of the annual tax rate, to review the data on the income distribution of Maori. If there is a significant change in the distribution, officials will undertake further analysis as to whether the tax rate should be amended. Other factors that may need to be taken into account include whether any weighting should be applied to the amount of the distribution. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 32 Issue: Extend tax rate to superannuation schemes and investment funds Submission (13 – Business New Zealand) The tax rates in New Zealand are too high and, as a step towards reducing them, the proposed 19.5% tax rate for Maori authorities should apply to superannuation schemes and investment funds. Comment The submission notes that savers in superannuation schemes and investment funds with marginal tax rates of 19.5% currently overtaxed by the 33% tax on the income of a superannuation fund or life insurance policyholders’ funds. 8 It should be noted that savers with a marginal tax rate of 39% are undertaxed. However, there are a number of problems with lowering the tax rate on these funds. Firstly, based on 1997 figures and adjusting for inflation, officials estimate that a little under half of those saving in life insurance and superannuation funds have marginal tax rates of less than 33%. Therefore a statutory tax rate of 19.5% on fund income would undertax at least as many investors as are currently overtaxed. Secondly, unlike the tax on Maori authority income, the tax on superannuation and life insurance income is a final tax, with no “square-up” mechanism such as the attachment of tax credits to distributions. Such a mechanism would be complicated by the imperfect match between the contributions made by investors and the income they (or their estate) finally receive. Possible square-up mechanisms have so far not been adopted, largely because of concerns about the complexity they would add and therefore the costs they would impose on taxpayers and Inland Revenue. In 1998 Parliament rejected legislation to deal with the overtaxation of savers in superannuation funds because of the industry’s concern about compliance costs associated with administering the mechanism to deal with the overtaxation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 8 The government is developing options for matching the tax rate on employer contributions to employment-related superannuation funds to employees’ tax rates. 33 Issue: Maori authorities should face the same tax rate as other companies Submissions (4 – C Gibbons and Holdings Ltd, 10 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 13 – Business New Zealand, 23 – Chen, Palmer and Partners (supported by 23A – Independent Fisheries Ltd)) Maori authorities, or at least businesses owned by Maori authorities, should be taxed at the same rate as other businesses and do not need a 19.5% tax rate. If adopted, this rate should apply to all companies and trusts. Beneficiaries of such organisations are like shareholders of a private company, and much of their profit was reinvested. Beneficiaries on higher tax rates would face a terminal tax liability, generating compliance and administration costs. The New Zealand Retailers Association submitted that commercial ventures not using inalienable property would be unfairly advantaged by being taxed at a higher rate (33%) than similar ventures owned by Maori authorities (19.5%). Maori authorities could reinvest 80.5 percent of retained income instead of 67 percent – a constant advantage of 13.5 percent. This would reduce their cost of capital and, all else being equal, allow a Maori authority to under-cut competitors. Chen, Palmer and Partners submitted that the new rules should achieve competitive neutrality for all companies. A 19.5% tax rate for Maori authority companies would be economically detrimental, giving Maori authority companies a competitive advantage by increasing their after-tax cash flow, distorting market share and cost of capital at the expense of competitors. The proposals set up incentives to structure businesses and assets to take advantage of the favourable tax rate. Efficient commercial structures do not depend on a tax rate of 19.5%. Moreover, Maori authorities are likely to receive some income through non-Maori authorities, so the vision of a single tax framework is an illusion. The flow of imputation credits among grouped or related Maori authorities would exacerbate the economic impact of the proposed regime. Comment The proposed tax rate for Maori authorities has been set at 19.5% because this is the statutory marginal tax rate applying to most of their members. Matching the tax rate applied to the entity to that of members brings savings in compliance and administration costs, avoids distorting the ratio of entity distributions to retained earnings, and is consistent with the view that, where practicable, an entity should be seen as a proxy for its members. (Practical considerations include the need to minimise compliance costs and to identify a rate that is likely to continue to be the appropriate one for a clear majority of members.) About 90 percent of Maori have an income tax rate of 19.5%. It is reasonable to assume that, as submitted by the Federation of Maori Authorities, members of Maori authorities have a similar income distribution to that of Maori generally, since membership is unrelated to income. In contrast, most company shares belong to shareholders with a statutory marginal tax rate of 33% or higher. Furthermore, from the point of view of equity, shareholders who are overtaxed on their company income can sell their interest at relatively low transaction costs and invest where they will be 34 taxed at a lower rate (for example, in their own homes), but this cannot be said of members of Maori authorities. Economic analysis suggests that the differential between the tax rate to be paid by Maori authority companies and ordinary companies would not bestow a significant competitive advantage. The considerations here are very similar to those applying to businesses enjoying a charitable income tax exemption, except that the differential is much smaller and the restrictions on the use of income are less stringent. Some submissions imply that Maori authorities are likely to indulge in anti- competitive pricing and production behaviour. Such behaviour is generally not sustainable, and would be subject to the scrutiny of the Commerce Commission. Profit-maximizing levels of price and output are not affected by the rate of income tax on a firm. (They are affected by the rate of a tax on gross revenue or output.) Price and output are set at the point where marginal cost and marginal revenue are equal: since costs are deductible from revenue when calculating taxable income, a change in the rate of income tax does not affect this calculation. Marginal cost and marginal revenue before and after tax intersect at the same level of output and the pre-tax price remains unchanged. Even though a Maori authority’s after-tax return on an investment may be higher than the return a normal business could obtain, its return on any other investment would also be higher. Therefore there is no incentive to “beat the market” on price. Maori authority companies may have greater access to debt finance than if they were taxed at 33%, but their overall access to capital may be no greater than that of other companies. Maori authority companies tend to be somewhat dependent on debt finance, and the “parent” faces unique problems in raising it. The “parent” cannot sell shares in itself, and financers are more reluctant to lend to them because of the restrictions on their ability to alienate assets such as land. The proposed difference between the Maori authority and company tax rates may favour Maori authority investment in enterprises wholly owned by themselves and other Maori authorities. The alternative of taxing companies wholly owned by Maori authorities at a higher rate than their “parents” would create a different distortion, encouraging Maori authorities to carry out their commercial activities within parent structures or to use tax planning mechanisms (such as using management fees to transfer profits from wholly owned companies to the parent, which would be deductible from the company’s income and included in the parent’s income). Although Maori authorities are likely to receive some income taxed at a higher rate, a common tax rate applied to its “hands-on” commercial activities will have compliance cost benefits. (Refer Issue: Companies wholly owned by Maori authorities). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 35 MAORI AUTHORITY CREDITS AND IMPUTATION CREDITS Issue: Maori authority credits and imputation credits – the same rules should apply Clause 44 Submission (4 – C Gibbons and Holdings Ltd, 10 – The New Zealand Retailers Association, 23 – Chen, Palmer and Partners) Maori authority credits and imputation credits should be treated the same for tax purposes. Chen, Palmer and Partners considered that the existing company imputation credit system should apply to Maori authorities, rather than the proposed Maori authority credit system. The proposed system parallels the imputation credit system in allowing shareholders to offset their tax liabilities using imputation credits attached to dividends. The application of the imputation rules to distributions to members of Maori authorities can achieve the underlying policy goal of the bill – taxing members at their marginal tax rates. Comment Officials acknowledge that the Maori authority credit system is based on the company imputation credit system. However, the Maori authority credit system will apply to trust structures as well as company structures, whereas the imputation credit system applies only to companies. Maori authority tax credits are an integral feature of the proposed tax rules, combining aspects of imputation and withholding taxes such as the operation of a memorandum account and the refundability of credits. They interlink with other features of the proposed tax rules such as the 19.5% tax rate and distributions. Incorporating these other features into the existing company imputation system and limiting them to Maori authorities would have increased the complexity of the current imputation credit account rules and increased compliance for companies in accessing and understanding how the tax rules apply to them. Officials consider it appropriate to apply separate tax rules in respect of the Maori authority credit account in order to ensure ease of use of the tax legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 36 Issue: Imputation credits should be refundable Clause 44 Submission (10 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 29 – The New Zealand Law Society) The Law Society and the Retailers Association consider that if Maori authority credits are refundable, imputation credits should also be refundable. The Law Society argues that non-refundability of imputation credits disadvantages charities, other tax-exempt entities or an investor whose marginal tax rate is less than 33 percent, since they are unlikely to be in a position to use imputation credits to offset other income tax or provisional tax. The Institute of Chartered Accountants submits that the government should consider allowing refundability of excess imputation credits. Comment Government policy is that excess imputation credits should not be refundable. This is primarily for reasons of fiscal cost and risk, particularly in relation to non-residents. If refundability were made available to residents but not to non-residents, New Zealand could be in breach of its non-discrimination provisions in its double tax agreements. The treatment of non-residents is consistent with the general treatment of resident shareholders. Under the previous rules that applied before the introduction of the current imputation credit system, non-resident investors were subject to company tax and non-resident withholding tax when dividends were paid. The non-refundability of imputation credits maintained the status quo treatment of non residents. In relation to the issue of non-refundability of imputation tax credits for tax-exempt entities such as charities, the government has indicated that it will review the current position once the planned charities commission is established and information from charities is provided. This will give the government a better indication of the likely fiscal cost of refunding imputation tax credits to charities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 37 Issue: Claiming refunds of excess Maori authority credits Clause 36 Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Inland Revenue’s systems should ensure that refunds of excess Maori authority credits can be accessed at minimum compliance cost to Inland Revenue and taxpayers. Comment Officials consider it appropriate that general rules apply to members seeking tax refunds in relation to Maori authority distributions. If a member has excess Maori authority credits he or she would need to request a summary of earnings, a pro forma tax calculation and, if it is to his or her advantage, a personal tax summary. Clause 78 of the bill provides for this in relation to charitable entities receiving a taxable Maori authority distribution. In developing its system to administer the Maori Authority tax rules, Inland Revenue will ensure that compliance cost implications for taxpayers are minimised. Recommendation No recommendation is required. Issue: Excess imputation credits should be refundable to Maori authorities Clause 34 Submission (15 – Te Ohu Kai Moana) Excess imputation credits should be refundable to Maori authorities. Many Maori authorities would not be able to use all of their imputation credits and so their effective tax rate on dividend income, after offsetting losses, would be higher than 19.5%. This result could provide a disincentive for Maori authorities to invest in companies taxed under the company rules. Comments Allowing imputation credits to be refundable to Maori authorities would be contrary to current policy on imputation credits. This is consistent with the current tax treatment afforded to other taxpayers who cannot utilise all their imputation credits. 38 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Maori authority credits on transition Clause 24 Submission (25 – The Office of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu) New section HI 6 should ensure that Maori authority credits arise when a company that has paid tax on undistributed income reverts to being a Maori authority. Comments The proposed rules for transitions are intended to ensure that a transition between tax rules does not give rise to additional tax advantages (for example, in relation to income earned under the ordinary company rules). When a company enters the Maori authority rules, any remaining credits in its imputation credit account would be extinguished and any undistributed tax-paid income would be able to be distributed tax free. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarify that Maori authority credits are to be refundable to exempt entities Clause 36 Submission (15 – Te Ohu Kai Moana, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The bill should be amended to enable exempt entities such as charities who receive Maori authority credits to obtain a refund of any excess credits. This would be consistent with the intention expressed in the commentary on the bill. Comment It is the intention of the proposed legislation that Maori authority credits should be refundable to entities earning exempt income as well as entities earning gross income. 39 As this clause is currently drafted, a refund of credits would only be available to persons receiving gross income. However, exempt entities such as charities do not receive “gross income”, as defined in the Income Tax Act 1994, they receive “exempt income”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 40 TAXATION OF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM A MAORI AUTHORITY Issue: Clarifying the application of new section HI 3 Clause 24 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 26W – Ernst & Young) New section HI 3 should be clarified so that amounts distributed which do not represent gross income derived by a Maori authority or a non-taxable distribution would not be taxable to members who receive those distributions. Comment The purpose of new section HI 3 is to establish which distributions are taxable to members who receive them. The section applies to taxable distributions to which Maori authority credits may be attached under new section MK 6, or from which resident withholding tax may be deducted under new section NF 1(2)(c). Section HI 3(1) deems amounts distributed by a Maori authority to have been distributed from gross income of the authority and to be gross income derived by the member who receives that distribution. Section HI 3(2) stipulates that section HI 3(1) does not apply to amounts distributed that do not represent gross income derived by the Maori authority. If section HI 3(1) applies, then all amounts distributed are from gross income of the authority, and section HI 3(2) may never apply. This means all distributions would be gross income and taxable in the hands of the members, with the possible exception of non-taxable distributions. Officials acknowledge that this result was not intended and should be corrected. Furthermore, proposed section HI 3(3) has the unintended effect of narrowing the meaning of “non-taxable distribution” specifically for the purposes of section HI 3. However, new section HI 6 also contains a reference to a “non-taxable distribution” which should also come within section HI 3. Recommendation That new section HI 3 be amended to clarify that section HI 3 does not apply to a distribution that is not sourced from gross income derived by the Maori authority or a non-taxable distribution. The amendment should also clarify that a non-taxable distribution includes a non-taxable distribution under new section HI 6 and a distribution of taxable income derived by the Maori authority in the 2003-04 or a prior income year. 41 Issue: Resident withholding tax and Maori authority distributions Clause 59 Submission (26W – Ernst & Young) New section NF 1(2)(c) should be amended to clarify that it applies to “taxable Maori authority distributions” only. Comment Officials consider that the suggested change is not necessary. New section NF 1(2)(c) is intended to apply resident withholding tax to taxable Maori authority distributions. This is achieved by the current wording of clause 59, which reads: “distributions to which section HI 3 applies from a Maori authority”. As mentioned in the previous comment, section HI 3 establishes which distributions are taxable to members who receive them. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Distributions and discretionary grants Clause 24 Submission (22 – New Zealand Maori Council) When a person receives a discretionary grant from a Maori authority, the person’s expenditure in relation to that grant should be deductible under section BD 2(b)(i). Comment Officials consider that the general deductibility rules contained in section BD 2(b) should apply to determine whether an amount of expenditure is deductible for tax purposes. Expenditure relating to discretionary grants made by a Maori authority would be deductible if it meets the criteria for deductibility in section BD 2(b). Thus, a member that receives a discretionary grant from a Maori authority would be able to deduct any related expenditure that the member incurred in deriving that grant. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 42 Issue: Education grants should be excluded from the definition of “distribution” Clause 24 Submission (22 – New Zealand Maori Council) The proposed definition of “distribution” in new section HI 2 should exclude educational scholarships to which section CB 9(d) applies. Comment New section HI 2 treats certain amounts distributed from a Maori authority to a member as a “distribution” for the purposes of the Maori authority rules. The meaning of “distribution” includes both cash amounts and non-cash amounts such as property transfers for inadequate consideration. This is necessary to deal with the wide range of financial and non-financial benefits that Maori authorities provide to their members. New section HI 2 includes payments made to members under an educational scholarship. Whether such a payment is taxable to the member under the Maori authority rules would depend on whether the payment is made from tax-paid income sources or non-taxable income sources. If the payment is sourced from exempt income, pre-reform income or is a non-taxable distribution under section HI 6, then the payment would not be taxed in the hands of the member. However, if the payment is sourced from Maori authority tax-paid income, Maori authority credits or resident withholding tax would apply – in other words, the payment would constitute a taxable Maori authority distribution. The tax treatment of distributions would also depend on the nature of the payment in the hands of the recipient members. Certain types of distributions would be exempt from tax in the hands of the members if certain criteria are met, such as an amount to which section CB 9(d) applies. Under this section, an amount paid as a scholarship or a bursary to attend an educational institution is treated as exempt income. If the payment meets the criteria under section CB 9(d) the recipient member would be able to claim a full refund of any Maori authority tax credits attached to their payment or any resident withholding tax deducted by filing a tax return or requesting an income statement at the end of the year. We consider that there is no reason to specifically exclude payments to which section CB 9(d) applies from the definition of “distribution”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 43 NON-TAXABLE DISTRIBUTIONS Clause 24(1) Issue: Non-taxable distributions: overtaxation and double taxation Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The definition of “non-taxable distribution” should be amended to include any distribution or part thereof that has not been fully credited with Maori authority credits. Under the proposed Maori authority rules, some overtaxation and double taxation could still occur if funds are distributed before they are taxed at the Maori authority level, or if there is insufficient tax paid in relation to those funds to allow the whole distribution to be fully credited. For example, a Maori authority distributes an amount of gross income that has not been taxed at the authority level because of an equivalent deduction, such as depreciation, which does not correspond to cash outlay in the income year. Another example is when a Maori authority distributes amounts that are recognised as gross income according to accounting principles earlier than they are recognised for tax purposes. In both cases there would be insufficient tax credits to attach to the distribution to avoid further tax on the distribution in the hands of the recipient member. These situations could also lead to the generation of surplus Maori authority credits that are not able to be attached to distributions. This proposed amendment would be consistent with the qualifying company rules under section HG 13. The rationale behind these rules is that a qualifying company’s ownership is so small that it is appropriate to look through the company to its shareholders. This is consistent with the taxation of Maori authorities as surrogates for the underlying members. Comment Officials acknowledge that the suggested change would greatly simplify the operation of the Maori authority credit account and thereby lower overall compliance costs for Maori authorities, and simplify the payment of distributions and the attribution of Maori authority credits. In addition, allowing Maori authorities to treat distributions as non-taxable to the extent that there are not adequate credits to fully credit them would: • eliminate overtaxation and undertaxation of the Maori authority’s income; • avoid having the timing of distributions distort the timing of income recognition under the general provisions; 44 • emphasise that the amount of tax paid by the Maori authority will determine the amount of income that will be taxable to the member, thereby avoiding the need for the Maori authority to pay additional tax or deduct resident withholding tax to fully credit the distribution; and • avoid the need to track income from its source to distributions. However, officials have a number of concerns about the suggested change. As noted by the submission, the suggested change is based on the qualifying company rules under section HG 13 of the Income Tax Act. Maori authorities generally do not share the same tax characteristics as qualifying companies and so, as a matter of principle, it would be inappropriate to apply the rules for qualifying companies to Maori authorities. There are strict requirements applying to qualifying company rules. For example, a qualifying company must have five or fewer shareholders and the directors and shareholders must elect to be a qualifying company, and the shareholder’s election must also involve electing to be personally liable for the relevant share of tax liability imposed on the qualifying company. In addition, a qualifying company cannot receive more than $10,000 of foreign non-dividend income in an income year. None of these tax characteristics applies to Maori authorities. Officials consider that relying on the quantum of tax credits in the Maori authority credit account and attributing these to distributions could have the unintended effect of taxing distributions sourced from exempt income such as Treaty settlement assets. One of the key features of the proposed rules preserves a current tax preference which permits Maori authorities to distribute non-taxable receipts tax-free to members. Although in theory the source of the distribution would not, in fact, be taxed, the potential for such distributions to be attributed with tax credits would indicate otherwise and this would be inconsistent with the proposed policy. On balance, we do not support the suggested change. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 45 GROUPING OF MAORI AUTHORITIES Issue: Grouping of Maori authority companies based on ordinary rules Clauses 24 and 65 Submission (15 – Te Ohu Kai Moana, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 23 – Chen, Palmer and Partners (under instruction from Sanford Limited, Amaltal Corporation Limited, Vela Fishing Limited, Solander Group, Simunovich Fisheries Limited, Talleys Fisheries Limited, United Fisheries Limited, and Independent Fisheries Limited), 25 – Office of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu, 27 – Federation of Maori Authorities (supported by 11W – Pukawa D3 Trust and Pukawa 5B Trust, 14W – Waipapa 9 Lands Trust, 17W – Rotohokahoka F6 Trust, 18W – Waiteti 2 Section 1A2 Trust, 19W – Waikuta 2 Trust, and 20W – Fairy Springs Trust), 27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) A number of submissions considered that wholly owned Maori authorities should be able to group in the same manner as groups of companies. The structure and operation of groups of Maori authorities will be similar to those of groups of companies, so the same rights should exist. Rights that should apply include: • exempt distributions between 100 percent owned Maori authorities (equivalent to section CB 10(2)) (Te Ohu Kai Moana, PricewaterhouseCoopers); • offsetting of losses between Maori authorities within a group (Te Ohu Kai Moana, PricewaterhouseCoopers, The Office of the Maori Trustee, The Federation of Maori Authorities and (supported by Pukawa D3 Trust and Pukawa 5B Trust; Waipapa 9 Lands Trust; Rotohokahoka F6 Trust; Waiteti 2 Section 1A2 Trust; Waikuta 2 Trust; and Fairy Springs Trust); and • transferability of Maori authority tax credits between group members Te Ohu Kai Moana (PricewaterhouseCoopers). Te Ohu Kai Moana and PricewaterhouseCoopers argue that without these rights, companies that would have applied the Maori authority rules may apply the general rules, defeating the purpose of changing the Maori authority rules. PricewaterhouseCoopers note that the possibility of permitting Maori authorities in a group to offset losses is mentioned in pages 13-14 of the Commentary. PricewaterhouseCoopers also submitted that imputation credits should be able to be transferred between Maori authorities within a consolidated group structure, and that, like dividends passed between companies in a 100 percent wholly owned group, distributions between Maori authority companies within a 100 percent wholly owned group should be tax exempt. 46 The Office of the Maori Trustee and the Federation of Maori Authorities, with the support of various other writers of submissions, argued that a wholly owned group of Maori authority companies should retain the ability to offset losses between companies in the group, and that this could be achieved by: • amending clause 24(1) so that the proposed section HI 1(2) stipulates that the Maori authority is still a company for the purposes of part IG; and • amending clause 65(6) so that the proposed definition of “continuity provisions” in section OB 1 reads: “(b) in relation to a Maori authority that is a company, means sections GC 2, GC 4, IE 1, IF 1, IG 2(1), and MK 5(1)(d)” Subpart IG allows companies within a wholly owned group to offset taxable income using losses in other companies in the group. The rationale for grouping – that owners should be taxed on the income of the group as a whole – applies equally to Maori authority companies. The Office of Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu submitted that the proposed rules relating to the ability of a group of Maori authorities to offset losses may need clarification. Chen, Palmer and Partners submitted that the normal company rules for grouping and consolidation should apply to companies wholly owned by Maori authorities, rather than specific rules. The parent entity does not need to belong to the group, the existing rules were readily understood, and applying them (or transparently parallel concepts) to Maori authorities would: • preserve competitive neutrality; • preserve the benefits of the new policy at the point of distribution to Maori authority members – the real beneficiaries; and • preserve the principle that Maori and other New Zealanders should enjoy the same benefits and opportunities under the law. However, Chen, Palmer and Partners also considered that if the 19.5% tax rate for Maori authorities were adopted, its harmful effects, for example on how Maori authorities structured their commercial operations, would be exacerbated by the flow of imputation credits among grouped or related Maori authorities. Comment The bill does not currently provide for the application or non-application of the grouping and consolidation rules to Maori authority companies. After further analysis, officials consider that without amendment to the bill, these rules could apply, permitting these companies (if they meet the necessary conditions) to group with each other or with ordinary companies. 47 Officials, in general, accept that the grouping and consolidation provisions of the Income Tax Act should apply to Maori authority companies. However, to limit the opportunity for Maori authority companies and other companies to use the grouping or consolidation rules to gain potential tax advantages, officials consider that the grouping and consolidation rules should apply only where companies share the same tax characteristics. Maori authority companies should not be able to group or consolidate with ordinary companies for tax purposes. For a Maori authority company to group with an ordinary company, the ordinary company would have to come under the Maori authority rules (which would require its purchase by Maori authorities, if it were not already wholly owned by the Maori authority). Otherwise the Maori authority company would have to revoke its Maori authority status. Furthermore, officials consider that inter-company distributions between wholly owned Maori authority companies (those that have elected to be taxed as Maori authorities) should be non-taxable in the same manner as inter-corporate dividends. If Maori authority tax credits are attached to such distributions, the recipient company will not be able to offset those tax credits against it own tax liability. The tax credits will be credited to the recipient’s Maori authority tax credit account. Similar rules apply in respect of ordinary companies. Recommendation That the grouping and consolidation rules in the Income Tax Act apply to Maori authority companies, but not to combinations of Maori authority companies and ordinary companies. That inter-company distributions between wholly owned Maori authority companies be non-taxable in the same manner as inter-corporate dividends. Issue: Wholly owned Maori authority companies: provisional tax offsets Clauses 24 and 44 Submission (27 – The Federation of Maori Authorities (FoMA) (supported by Pukawa D3 Trust and Pukawa 5B Trust, Waipapa 9 Lands Trust, Rotohokahoka F6 Trust, Waiteti 2 Section 1A2 Trust, Waikuta 2 Trust and Fairy Springs Trust), 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The bill should be amended to allow companies applying the Maori authority rules to continue to offset provisional tax payments between wholly owned group companies. This would be achieved by: • amending clause 24(1) so that the proposed section HI 1(2) stipulates that the Maori authority is still a company for the purposes of Part IG and section MB 9; and 48 • amending clause 44(1) so that equivalent provisions to sections ME 4(1)(b) and ME 5(1)(d) with their equivalent timing provisions are included in the proposed sections MK 4 and MK 5 respectively. Section MB 9 allows companies within a wholly owned group to offset any overpayments and underpayments of provisional tax. The rationale for grouping is that the same owners derive the income of the grouped companies and bear the cost of any resulting taxes. Taxing parts of a wholly owned group when the group as a whole has paid the right amount of tax would be inequitable. This rationale applies equally to wholly owned groups of Maori authority companies. Sections ME 4(1)(b) and ME 5(1)(d) deal with the crediting and debiting of imputation credits in relation to offsets of provisional tax by wholly owned groups of companies. Comments Officials agree that provisional tax offsets within a wholly owned group of Maori authority companies should be permitted. As suggested in the submission, this requires amendment to sections MB 9, and to the proposed sections MK 4 and MK 5. Recommendation That provision be made for Maori authority companies within a wholly owned group to offset provisional tax payments. 49 MAORI AUTHORITY COMPANIES – AMALGAMATIONS AND CO- OPERATIVE COMPANIES Issue: Application of the amalgamation provisions Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The amalgamation provisions in the Income Tax Act should apply to Maori authority companies. Comment The bill does not provide for the tax consequences of amalgamations of Maori authority companies, even though these companies, if they meet the necessary conditions, might be entitled to amalgamate with each other or with ordinary companies under the Companies Act 1993. Officials acknowledge that companies incorporated under the Companies Act that are taxed as a Maori authority would continue to be subject to the provisions of the Companies Act. Officials accept, in principle, that the amalgamation provisions contained in the Income Tax Act should apply to companies that are able to amalgamate under the Companies Act. However, officials are concerned about the potential for the amalgamation rules to be used to gain tax advantages, and so the application of these rules should apply in certain circumstances: • when all the companies subject to the amalgamation are taxed as Maori authorities; or • when all the companies subject to the amalgamation are subject to the normal company tax rules. This could mean that a Maori authority company would need to make an election to cease to be a Maori authority before it can amalgamate. In doing so, the Maori authority would be subject to the tax consequences under new section HI 6. The amalgamated company could be treated as a Maori authority if it satisfies the definition of “Maori authority”. Furthermore, officials consider that the amalgamated company in this situation would be treated as re-entering the Maori authority rules and, therefore, must face the tax consequences in new section HI 7. Recommendation That the amalgamation rules contained in the Income Tax Act apply to Maori authority companies provided that: • all the companies subject to the amalgamation are taxed as Maori authorities; or • all the companies subject to the amalgamation are subject to the normal company tax rules; and 50 • if the Maori authority company has elected out of the rules to amalgamate and the amalgamated company elects to be taxed as a Maori authority, it would be treated as re-entering the Maori authority rules and must apply new section HI 7. Issue: Co-operative companies wholly owned by a Maori authority Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) Consideration should be given to extending the co-operative company provisions to allow a Maori authority to attach Maori authority tax credits to a cash distribution or to a notional Maori authority distribution. Comment Under the co-operative company tax rules, a co-operative company can make a cash distribution to its shareholders based on the shareholder’s produce transactions 9 with it, rather than pay a rebate. 10 Imputation tax credits can be attached to the cash distribution. In addition, a co-operative company can make a notional distribution (similar to a taxable bonus issue) to its shareholders based on the shareholder’s produce transactions with it. Again, imputation tax credits can be attached to that notional distribution. Any actual distribution by the co-operative which represents a distribution of an amount previously treated as a notional dividend is not treated as a dividend. Officials acknowledge that a co-operative company could be eligible to be taxed as a Maori authority if all its shareholders are Maori authorities – that is, if the co- operative company is a wholly owned company of a group of Maori authorities. Given this, officials consider that similar rules to those that currently apply to co- operative companies that allow them to attach imputation credits to cash distributions and notional distributions should be included in the Maori authority tax rules. This would allow a co-operative company that is taxed as a Maori authority to attach Maori authority tax credits to such distributions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 9 A shareholder’s produce transactions is the supply or acceptance of produce or goods, such as milk, between a co-operative company and its shareholders. 10 A co-operative company is able to pay a rebate of the profits arising from its shareholders’ transactions to its shareholders. The amount of the rebate is deductible to the co-operative company and may be taxable to the shareholder if the shareholder transactions were taken into account in determining the taxable income of the shareholder. 51 APPLICATION DATES Issue: Earlier enactment date for proposed rules Submission (22 – New Zealand Maori Council) The proposed Maori authority rules should apply from the 2003-04 income year, rather than the 2004-2005 income year. Comment Officials consider that an earlier application date would not be appropriate. Maori authorities need sufficient time to inform themselves of the proposed changes and to make the necessary adjustments to their administrative and accounting systems. Likewise, Inland Revenue also requires sufficient time to develop and test appropriate systems and to undertake a comprehensive information campaign with Maori authorities and their tax advisers before the proposed changes take effect. If the application date was brought forward as suggested, systems changes and information initiatives would have been required by 1 October 2002 – being the earliest commencement date of the 2003-04 income year for Maori authorities with early balance dates. In addition, the proposed new election process would mean that Maori authority entities would need to have made elections as early as October 2002. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Income tax rate and resident withholding tax rate of 19.5% Clause 68(6), 68(7) and 70(3) Submission (11W – Pukawa D3 Trust and Pukawa 5B Trust, 14W – Waipapa 9 Lands Trust, 17W – Rotohokahoka F6 Trust, 18W – Waiteti 2 Section 1A2 Trust, 19W – Waikuta 2 Trust, 20W – Fairy Springs Trust, 27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The proposed income tax rate and resident withholding tax rate for Maori authorities should apply from the 2003-04 income year, rather than the 2004-05 income year. These components of the proposed measures should be implemented without delay, mitigating the inequities of the current rules until they are replaced in the 2004-2005 income year. 52 Comment Officials do not agree that the tax rate of 19.5% should apply from the 2003-04 income year. In reviewing the tax laws for Maori authorities, the definition of a Maori authority is being refined and clarified. This means that a number of entities that are currently Maori authorities will cease to be Maori authorities for the financial year 2004-05. Modifying the tax rate now would be inconsistent and incur a revenue cost, and it would be more efficient to bring all the changes in concurrently. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 53 COMPLEXITY OF THE MAORI AUTHORITY CHANGES Issue: Maori authority credits: transition may be too complex Submission (13 – Business New Zealand) The Finance and Expenditure Committee should consider whether the proposed imputation system for Maori authorities would be too complex, and consider how the likely traps in the transition to it could be avoided. Comment Indications from some submissions is that maintaining a Maori authority credit account would be relatively simple and that completing an annual return for this account would be one of the simplest parts of the income tax return process. Although it is accepted that the compliance requirements associated with these changes may not be well understood in the broader Maori community, this problem could be addressed as part of the implementation phase through an appropriate information programme. Recommendation No recommendation required. 54 APPLY GENERAL TAX RULES TO MAORI AUTHORITIES Issue: Maori authorities should be taxed according to their legal form Submission (10 – The New Zealand Retailers Association) The proposed rules for Maori authorities should not be enacted and Maori authorities should be taxed according to their legal form. Comment Tax rules are intended to tax entities in the most appropriate way, taking into account an entity’s specific characteristics, structures, conditions, and activities. This usually means applying tax rules that are consistent with an entity’s legal form, because legal form closely determines an entity’s specific characteristics. However, the proposed measures relating to Maori authorities recognise that certain Maori organisations have unique characteristics that set them apart from ordinary companies and trusts. These characteristics include the difficulty of selling Maori freehold land and other tribal assets, the legal restrictions placed on the use of these assets, and the unique way in which such assets must be owned and administered. Officials consider it inappropriate to apply the trust or company rules to Maori authorities without recognising the restrictions or constraints under which they must operate or the underlying marginal tax rates of the members. If income of a Maori authority were taxed at the company rate of 33%, members of a Maori authority would be over-taxed. They would need to file a tax return or request an income statement in order to claim back the overpaid tax. If the income of a Maori authority were taxed as a trust, members of a Maori authority would need to file a tax return as required under the return filing requirements for beneficiaries that derive income from a trust. Thus applying general tax rules may involve higher compliance costs for Maori authorities and their members and administration costs for Inland Revenue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 55 MISCELLANEOUS TECHNICAL ISSUES RELATING TO THE MAORI AUTHORITIES RULES Issue: Dividend withholding payments in the Maori Authority Credit Account Clause 44 Submission (26W – Ernst &Young) New subpart MK, which deals with the operation of the Maori Authority Credit Account, should be amended so that foreign dividend withholding payments (FDWP) can be credited and debited in this account. Comment FDWP is payable by a company that receives overseas dividends that are exempt under section CB 10 of the Income Tax Act. Like imputation credits, FDWP credits can be attached to dividends paid by a company. Officials agree that a Maori authority should be entitled to recognise FDWP credits and debits in its Maori Authority Credit Account and should also be able to attach FDWP to distributions in the same way as an imputation credit account company. Recommendation That new sections MK 4 and MK 5 be amended to provide for the crediting and debiting of FDWP in the Maori Authority Credit Account, in the same way as FDWP is credited and debited to an imputation credit account. Issue: A Maori authority company should be able to maintain a FDWP account Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill should clarify that a company that is taxed as a Maori authority (a Maori authority company) can maintain a FDWP account. Comment Subpart MG of the Income Tax Act allows a resident company to elect to maintain a dividend withholding payment account (FDWP account) for an imputation year. A FDWP account operates in a similar way to an imputation credit account. The credits to a FDWP account usually arise owing to FDWP credits attached to dividends received from other resident companies or FDWP payable by the company on certain 56 exempt dividends that it receives from overseas. A FDWP account company is able to attach FDWP credits to the dividends it pays in the same way as imputation credits. Officials consider that a company that operates a FDWP account should be able to continue to maintain that account when it opts to be taxed under the Maori authority rules. Unlike the imputation credit account, the FDWP account should not be subsumed into the Maori Authority Credit Account. The reason for this is that should the Maori authority company subsequently elect out of the Maori authority rules, any FDWP credit should be maintained. Under the proposed Maori authority rules, when a company that is taxed as a Maori authority opts out of those rules, any credit balance in its Maori Authority Credit Account is carried through to its imputation credit account. Because excess imputation credits are not refundable, whereas excess FDWP credits are, the conversion of FDWP credits to imputation credits on exiting the Maori authority tax rules would be penal. The ability to continue to maintain a FDWP account avoids the compliance costs associated with tracing FDWP credits and debits in a Maori Authority Credit Account to allow for the crediting or debiting of the FDWP account when the company exits the Maori authority rules. Furthermore, a Maori authority company should be able to elect to be a FDWP account company at any time. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Dividend withholding payment deductions at 19.5% Submission (Matter raised by officials) The rate applied to calculate an amount of dividend withholding payment to be deducted from a dividend received by a Maori authority company should be 19.5%. Comment Under the current rules, certain foreign-sourced dividends received by a resident company are subject to a dividend withholding payment deduction at the rate of 33%. This rate is linked to the company tax rate of 33%. Since a Maori authority company would be subject to a 19.5% tax rate, officials consider that the rate applied to calculate dividend withholding payment should be 19.5%. This would ensure that the amount of dividend withholding payment to be deducted and credited to distributions (dividends) by the Maori authority company would be based on the same rate and thereby avoid the accumulation of excess dividend withholding payment credits which might not be able to be utilised. 57 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Calculation of branch equivalent tax credits for Maori authorities when New Zealand losses are used Submission (Matter raised by officials) For companies that are taxed as Maori authorities, the provisions that allow a branch equivalent tax account credit to be created when New Zealand losses are offset against attributed foreign income should be based on the Maori authority tax rate rather than the company tax rate. Comment The international tax rules provide that attributed foreign income from a controlled foreign company is subject to tax in New Zealand, and foreign dividends received by a New Zealand company are subject to foreign dividend withholding payment. To prevent double taxation of the same underlying income when it is attributed and also when it is distributed as a dividend, the branch equivalent tax account mechanism was designed. The mechanism provides that if income tax has been paid first, a branch equivalent tax account credit arises which offsets the liability to foreign dividend withholding payment. Alternatively, if a dividend had been paid in advance of the income being earned in the controlled foreign company with foreign dividend withholding payment being paid first, a branch equivalent tax account debit arises which offsets the liability to income tax. A branch equivalent tax account credit can also be created when losses from New Zealand sources have been offset against attributed foreign income and so no liability to income tax arises. When losses from New Zealand sources are used, the calculation of the branch equivalent tax account credit is based on the company tax rate. For companies taxed as Maori authorities this is inappropriate as any subsequent dividend withholding payment liability, if a previous officials’ submission is accepted, would be based on a 19.5% rate. Officials consider that for companies taxed as Maori authorities, the branch equivalent tax account credit calculated when New Zealand losses are offset against attributed foreign income should be based on the Maori authority tax rate rather than the company tax rate. This would require amendments to sections MF 4 and MF 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 58 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Treatment of foreign tax credits Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) Maori authorities should be able to pass foreign tax credits received in respect of foreign-sourced income to their underlying owners (members). Comment When overseas income is treated as gross income derived in New Zealand, a credit for income tax paid overseas is allowed against the New Zealand income tax applicable to the overseas income. In most cases the credit is limited to the lesser of the actual overseas tax paid on the overseas income and the New Zealand tax applicable to the overseas income. Under current rules, there is no pass-through of foreign tax credits to the underlying owners, except when overseas income is derived by a trust and is paid out as beneficiary income. In terms of the exception, overseas income is not derived by the trust, but by the beneficiaries and so it is appropriate that the beneficiary is able to claim a credit for the foreign tax paid. In all other cases, the person (including a company) who derives the overseas income is the only person who can claim a credit for overseas tax paid. Officials consider that allowing Maori authorities to pass through foreign tax credits would be inconsistent with current tax policy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Record-keeping requirements of Maori authorities Submission (Matter raised by officials) Under the record-keeping provision, a company that operates an imputation credit account, a dividend withholding payment account or a branch equivalent tax account is required to keep sufficient records to allow for the ascertainment of every credit and debit balance to these various accounts and the amount of any imputation credits or dividend withholding payment credits attached to dividends paid. Similar rules 59 should apply in respect of a Maori authority that operates a Maori Authority Credit Account. Comment As a Maori authority will operate a Maori Authority Credit Account, which is similar to an imputation tax credit account, the same record-keeping requirements that apply to a company in relation to an imputation credit account should apply to a Maori authority in relation to its Maori Authority Credit Account. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Annual returns of income not required to be filed by members of a Maori authority Clause 79 Submission (Matter raised by officials) An individual is generally not required to file an income tax return if he or she earns employment income subject to the PAYE rules, interest or dividends subject to the resident withholding tax rules or interest or dividends from overseas that have been subject to withholding tax. Other non-return filing requirements must also be met. The current non-filing rules apply to a distribution from a Maori authority because that distribution is deemed to be a dividend subject to the resident withholding tax rules. However, this would not be the case under the proposed Maori authority rules, since distributions from a Maori authority are not specifically defined as a dividend. Comment The omission outlined above was not intended. Officials consider that the non-return filing criteria should be amended to specifically cover distributions from a Maori authority that have been credited with Maori authority tax credits or have had resident withholding tax deducted. The effect of this proposal is that under clause 79 of the bill, an individual whose total income exceeds $38,000 would be required to request an income statement or file a tax return if he or she also received a taxable Maori authority distribution greater than $200. A “taxable Maori authority distribution” is defined in clause 65(19) to mean a distribution to which a Maori authority credit has been attached or is treated as being attached under new section NF 8A. 60 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Provision of members’ names and IRD numbers Clause 87 Submission (Matter raised by the Committee) The Committee asked officials whether Maori authorities would be required to provide Inland Revenue with names and IRD numbers of all members who are on higher marginal tax rates than the Maori authority tax rate. Comments New section 68B in the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires Maori authorities to furnish a distribution statement to Inland Revenue for an income year. The statement shows the details on distributions and Maori authority credits in aggregate form. While there is no specific requirement for Maori authorities to provide the names and IRD numbers of members who received distributions during the income year, Inland Revenue may request further information of this kind under its information-gathering powers (section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Under the new section 31 of the Tax Administration Act, a Maori authority will be required to provide members with a notice of the amount distributed, and a copy of this notice could be requested. This proposed provision is consistent with the current requirement for companies to provide a company dividend statement. It is likely that if Inland Revenue suspected that a member of a Maori authority with a 33% or 39% marginal tax rate was not complying with his or her return filing obligations, it would require the Maori authority to provide details of any distributions to that member. Furthermore, trustees are not required to advise the department of the names and IRD numbers of beneficiaries who have received distributions from trusts. Recommendation No recommendation required. 61 Issue: Continuity rules: succession to interests in Maori authorities Clauses 24 and 65(6) Submission (22 – New Zealand Maori Council) The inherited interests in Maori authorities whose legal form is that of a company should be deemed to have been held by the inheritor from the time his or her predecessor in title held those interests. The submission seeks express recognition that succession following the death of a registered owner does not of itself breach the continuity rules. Comment Officials consider that the current continuity rules provide adequately for succession to interests in Maori authorities, so no amendment is required. New section HI 1(2) provides that a Maori authority that is a company is subject to the continuity provisions in the Income Tax Act. One of these provisions is section OD 5(2), which provides relief in situations where changes in ownership occur when a person inherits an interest in a company on the death of a registered shareholder. The person who inherits the interest is deemed to have held that share from the time the deceased person acquired that interest – so there is no breach in continuity of ownership. Officials consider that section OD 5(2) should address the submission’s concern in respect of inherited interests in Maori authorities, and would be particularly relevant to changes in the underlying ownership of Maori incorporations. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Maori authority trusts should retain exclusion from income assessable to beneficiaries Clause 17 Submission (26W – Ernst & Young) Maori authorities and their members should retain their exclusion from section GC 14(1). Clause 17 should be amended so that section GC 14(2) is not repealed, but is amended so that the exclusion applies to a Maori authority or a member of a Maori authority. 62 Comment The submission claims that since participation in Maori authorities is restricted, they would be regarded as an unsuitable vehicle to use in any scheme for the purpose of defeating the intent and application of section HH 3. It is therefore unlikely that any effect of defeating section HH 3 would be intentional and, if such an effect were to arise it would have been unavoidable. For this reason subsection GC 14(2) should be retained and expanded to include all Maori authorities, regardless of whether or not they have elected to apply Part HI. Officials agree with this submission but consider that the exclusion should apply only to Maori authorities and their members and not to trusts that have elected to cease to be a Maori authority. This position is consistent with the policy that when a Maori authority elects to apply the general rules it should be subject to all relevant provisions under the general rules. Recommendation That clause 17 be amended so that section GC 14(2) is not repealed but is amended so that the exclusion applies to a Maori authority or a member of a Maori authority. Issue: Definition of “tax advantage” and “tax credit advantage” Clause 18 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The definitions of “tax advantage” and “tax credit advantage” in section OB1 of the Income Tax Act should be consequentially amended to reflect the insertion of the new section GC 27A. The new section is an anti-avoidance provision which applies to arrangements to obtain a tax advantage in relation to Maori authority credits. Comment Officials agree that the definitions of “tax advantage” and “tax credit advantage” should be amended to reflect the new section GC 27A, which is modelled on the existing imputation tax credit anti-avoidance provision. The current definitions of “tax advantage” and “tax credit advantage” refer back to the imputation tax credit anti-avoidance provision and should also cater for the new Maori authority tax credit anti-avoidance provision. Officials also recommend that the definition of “account advantage” in section OB 1 be amended to include a reference to the new Maori authority tax credit anti- avoidance provision. The new provision includes a definition of “account advantage”. 63 Recommendation That the submission be accepted, and that the definition of “account advantage” be amended to include a reference to the new Maori authority tax credit anti-avoidance provision. Issue: Transitional provisions: market value calculations Clause 24 Submission (26W – Ernst & Young) • The reference to “market value” in new section HI 7(6)(a) should be clarified so that it refers to the market value of the property that is deemed to be acquired under section HI 7. • The reference in new section HI 7(6)(b) to “cost price” should be amended to “cost” to ensure that depreciation can be claimed on the property that has no “cost price”, such as property that was settled on a trust. Comment The proposed new section HI 7 deals with situations where a company or a trust re- enters the Maori authority rules. The purpose of new section HI 7 is to treat the trust or company as realising its assets at market value and subsequently re-acquiring them at market value. This is to ensure that before an entity re-enters the Maori authority rules, any tax liabilities on property such as trading stock is crystallised at the company or the trust tax rate. For depreciation purposes, however, the cost of the property would be the lower of the market value of the property on the deemed acquisition date or the original cost of the property to the company or the trust. This rule ensures that the Maori authority does not receive an uplift in the base price of the property for depreciation purposes. Officials agree that new section HI 7(6)(a) should be amended to refer to the market value at which the property is deemed to be acquired under the new section HI 7. In the depreciation rules, the term “cost of the property to the taxpayer” is used for the purposes of determining base value for depreciation purposes. Officials agree that the term “cost price” in new section HI 7(6)(b) is not consistent with the depreciation rules and should be amended to “cost”. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 64 Issue: Retrospective credit provisions, non-cash dividends and transfer pricing adjustments Clause 44(1) Submission (26W – Ernst and Young) The imputation rules allow for imputation credits to be attached retrospectively to a non-cash dividend that arises as a result of the transfer pricing rules. A similar provision should apply to Maori authorities in relation to non-cash distributions. Comment Officials acknowledge that a non-cash distribution could arise in a transfer pricing context, albeit in very limited circumstances. This could occur if a Maori authority disposes of property, such as trading stock, for inadequate consideration in a cross- border arrangement to a member who is treated as an associated person under the international tax rules. Given this potential, officials consider that Maori authorities should have the ability to attach Maori authority tax credits retrospectively to a non- cash distribution in the same way as a company can do so in relation to imputation credits. Recommendation That new subpart MK be amended to allow Maori authority credits to be attached retrospectively to a non-cash distribution that arises as a result of the transfer pricing rules. Issue: Further tax payable – references to non-existing subsection Clause 44(1) Submission (26W – Ernst & Young) Clause 44(1) should be amended so that the references to the non-existent “subsection (7)” in the proposed section MK 8(1) and section MK 8(3) are removed. Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That section MK 8(1) and section MK 8(3) be amended to remove redundant references. 65 Issue: References to dividend withholding payment credits Clause 33 Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section LB 1(3) should be amended after the second reference to dividend withholding payment credits and not just the first, as in the current draft of the bill. Comment Section LB 1(3) deals with the calculation of imputation credits or dividend withholding payment credits in relation to a beneficiary of a trust who derives dividends with an imputation credit or a dividend withholding payment credit attached. The bill amends the section to deal with the proposed Maori authority credits in the same manner. Clause 33(4)(b) inserts the words “, or distributions with a Maori authority credit attached,” after the word “attached”, which follows the second reference to dividend withholding payment credits. The submission appears to have overlooked this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Payments not resident withholding income – grammatical error Clause 60(4) Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The extra and first “or” that will remain after the insertion of the words “, or a distribution from a Maori authority” by clause 60(4) should be removed by that clause. If left unchanged, the clause would result in the wording: “...in the case of a payment of either interest or dividends or a distribution from a Maori authority.” Comment As argued by the submission, the first occurrence of the word “or” would be superfluous. For section NF 2(7) to be grammatically correct it will also be necessary to remove the word “either”, which cannot refer to more than two alternatives. 66 Recommendation That the necessary corrections be made. Issue: Definition of “member” of a Maori authority Clause 65(13) Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The definition of “member” should be amended to reflect the fact that membership of a Maori authority could take any of a number of forms such as owner, shareholder or beneficiary. A further amendment should be made to clarify that trusts and other Maori authorities can be a person or group of persons for the purposes of the term “member” in the Maori authority rules. Comment We agree that the definition of “member” should include a reference to owners, members, shareholders or beneficiaries to reflect the fact that membership of a Maori authority can take any of a number of forms. We also agree with that the phrase “group of persons” may be required to cover a number of trustees in a trust or an unincorporated group of persons. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “member” to remove reference to “distribution” Clause 65(13) Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The definition of “member” in clause 65(13) should be amended to remove reference to “distribution” in the definition of members. 67 Comment Officials agree with this submission. The proposed definition of “member” and “distribution” should be redrafted to avoid this circularity. Recommendation That the definitions be clarified. 68 EXTENDING THE DONATION DEDUCTION FOR MAORI AUTHORITIES Clause 7 Issue: Extension of the deductible donations available under section DI 2 Submission (22 – New Zealand Maori Council) The level of deductible donations should be increased to 20 percent for Maori authorities in recognition of their “... Special status..., close relationship to their people, and their present depressed status (arising from breaches of the Treaty).” The new section DI 2, proposed in clause 7 of the bill, would allow Maori authorities to deduct up to 5 percent of net income in donations to charities or Maori associations from 2004-2005. The cap should be raised because the definition of “Maori authority” is narrowly defined, and because Maori authorities are likely to direct their charitable giving to Maori who “are at a significant disadvantage in socio-economic terms compared with the rest of New Zealand....” Comment Under the current provision, the deduction for donations paid to Maori associations is capped at 5 percent of the Maori authority’s net income. The bill extends the provision to allow a Maori authority to claim a deduction for donations paid to organisations that have donee status. A similar provision in the bill for donations paid by companies has a cap of 5 percent. For consistency purposes, officials consider that the cap should be aligned. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date Submission (22 – New Zealand Maori Council, 27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) Clause 7(2) should be amended to provide that the proposed section DI 2 apply from the 2003-2004 income year rather than the 2004-2005 income year. These provisions will not be part of the proposed Maori authorities rules, so there is no reason to defer their application. 69 Comment Officials agree with the submission point. There is no reason that the amendment cannot apply from the 2003-04 income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the amendment apply from the 2003-04 income year. 70 RELAXING THE PUBLIC BENEFIT REQUIREMENT Clause 66 Issue: The amendment does not go far enough Submission (7 – Dunedin Community Law Centre) New section OB 3A should be amended so that Maori groups are not prevented from obtaining a “charitable” income tax exemption because of their cultural foundation of whakapapa (genealogy) and whanaungatanga (family ties). Even with the removal of the “blood ties” barrier, some iwi or hapu groups might fail the public benefit requirement owing to their small numbers or the degree of relationship between the beneficiaries. The suggested change would be consistent with the Court of Appeal’s comments in Latimer and Others v Commissioner of Inland Revenue, 11 in particular that “in the New Zealand context it is, we think, impossible not to regard the Maori beneficiaries of the trust, both together and in their separate iwi or hapu groupings, as a section of the public.” Comment Officials do not support the suggested change on the basis that it is inconsistent with the policy underlying the proposed amendment. The suggested change contemplates specific exemption for iwi and hapu-based entities from the public benefit requirement, whereas the proposed amendment is intended to apply to all trusts, societies or institutions whose beneficiary class is defined by reference to blood ties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Hapu should be recognised as charitable as of right Submission (22 – New Zealand Maori Council) Given the historic and constitutional position of hapu, hapu should be capable of being charitable in their own right, if they meet the following requirements: 11 CA215/01. 71 (a) they have 800 members (including children) on their rolls (circumventing the vagueness of the public benefit requirement and limiting dispute over the definition of hapu); (b) they have altruistic objectives (replacing the charitable purposes requirement, and going to the heart of the term “charity”); (c) their activities are not carried out for the private pecuniary benefit of any individual (as required under the present tax rules for charitable societies and institutions); and (d) they are accountable to their members (reinforcing (b)). Comment Questions of the constitutional status of hapu are outside the scope of this tax review. The question of whether hapu should be “charitable” in their own right extends beyond mere consideration of the public benefit requirement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The “public benefit” provision should avoid implying a law change Submission (22 – New Zealand Maori Council, 27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The provision that deals with the blood ties component of the public benefit test should be seen as a clarification rather than a law change. However, it could be read as implying that the blood-ties component of the public benefit test is to be considered when determining the tax status of trusts, societies or institutions established before its application date of 1 April 2003. This implication should be avoided. The New Zealand Maori Council considers that the amendment should apply immediately, with no stated commencement date, and should be declared to be for the avoidance of doubt. Comment Officials do not consider that the suggested change is necessary. The intention of the proposed amendment is to negate the view expressed in Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities 12 that a beneficiary class connected by blood ties cannot meet the public benefit requirement. The amendment applies from the 2003-04 income year. This means that in determining whether an entity meets the public benefit requirement before the proposed amendment is enacted, regard must be had to how the courts have determined the public benefit requirement. 12 \[1951\] 1 All ER31. 72 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarify that Maori collective entities come within the terms “society” or “institution” Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The bill should clarify that Maori collective entities other than trusts will come within the meaning of “society” or “institution” for the purposes of the charitable exemptions in section CB 4(1)(c) and (e) and the proposed section OB 3A(2). Entities such as unincorporated marae committees should not be excluded from these provisions simply because they may not satisfy the definitions of “society” or “institution”. Comment Neither the terms “society” nor “institution” are defined in the Income Tax Act 1994, but based on ordinary, dictionary definitions, both terms have a wide meaning: Society ... an association of persons united by a common aim or interest or principle... Institution ... an organisation... (Both from the Concise Oxford Dictionary of the English Language) Bodies that are registered under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 should fall within the meaning of “society”. In addition, on the basis of the very wide meaning ascribed to the term as set out above, virtually any body calling itself a society should qualify. In relation to companies, Justice Thorp in CIR v NTN Bearing Saeco (NZ) Ltd 13 found that a company would likely be considered to be an institution for the purposes of the “charitable” income tax exemption. He was not required to consider the issue in the case before him, but he did refer to the definition in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary and state that he considered that there were a number of parts of the definition which could apply to a company. On this basis there are reasonable grounds for maintaining that a company is an institution. Given the wide meaning of the terms “society” and “institution”, it seems reasonable that Maori collective entities should fall within either of the terms. Thus entities such as unincorporated marae committees should also meet the requirements of a “society” or “institution”. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 13 (1986) 8 NZTC 5,039. 73 Issue: Definition of “charitable purpose” should be more important than the public benefit requirement Submission (7 – Dunedin Community Law Centre) The purpose of an organisation seeking charitable tax status should be more important than the public benefit requirement, thus removing a significant impediment to Maori groups seeking tax exemption. Comment The key requirement for a “charitable” income tax exemption is that an entity must have a charitable purpose. “Charitable purpose” is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 as including: ... every charitable purpose, whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community”. The categories of relief of poverty, education, religion or other community benefits are known as the four “heads” of charity, and are based on the Charitable Uses Act 1601 (sometimes also known as the Statute of Elizabeth). They are not defined in legislation. Instead, their meaning is to be found in court decisions in New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere. Officials note, however, that the public benefit requirement and its relevance varies for different categories of charitable purpose. For example, the public benefit requirement is not a pre-requisite for charities for the relief of poverty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The public benefit changes should apply in general law Submission (22 – New Zealand Maori Council, 29 – New Zealand Law Society) The changes to “charitable purposes” should apply immediately for all purposes at law, rather than just income tax law. The proposed amendment would only clarify tax law, but the “blood ties” issue remains – for example, for the purposes of registration under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. This may cause confusion for some entities. 74 The Courts may not consider the proposed change to the public benefit requirement when determining charitable status under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. The reverse applied in the past, when the definition of “charitable” in tax law was narrower than the general law definition. 14 The New Zealand Maori Council also considered that the suggested change would be consistent with section 4 of the Ngati Rarua-Atiawa Iwi Trust Empowering Act 1993, and clause 5 of the Te Whanau-a-Taupara Trust Empowering Bill, which declare the relevant trusts to be charitable for all purposes at law. Comment Officials acknowledge that the submission raises a valid point that the government should consider. However, the submission seeks a change that goes beyond the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The amendment should not be adopted until the likely effects have been clarified Submission (31W – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Further analysis should be conducted and made available on the likely effects of the proposed amendment before it is enacted. The amendment should not be adopted until the following questions have been answered: • whether the intended result is that substantially all Maori entities are now intended to be tax-exempt under the charitable exemption, as compared to a prior position where that was not the case; • whether the effect of the amendment is to increase the level of assets or income held by Maori entities that are tax-exempt charities from a certain dollar level existing prior to the change to a new higher dollar level; and • whether essentially the same level of charitable exemption as existed before the amendment is passed is expected to exist after the amendment is passed and the intention is just to achieve greater clarity. 14 See Halsbury’s Laws of New Zealand, paras 287-288. 75 Comment The amendment is intended to remove the blood ties barrier of the public benefit requirement for all trusts, societies or institutions seeking “charitable” tax exemption. However, such entities must still meet the other requirements of a charity – that is, they must have a “charitable purpose”, that purpose must be for the benefit of the public or an appreciably significant section of the public, and the entity must not be carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual. It is not intended that substantially all Maori entities would automatically secure “charitable” tax exemption. The amendment is more relevant to those entities that define their membership by reference to whakapapa to a named person. Those Maori entities that have secured “charitable” tax exemption have been eligible because their beneficiary class is not defined strictly by reference to whakapapa to a named person. For example, the beneficiary class may encompass all Maori residing in the particular locality or include a number of hapu. Some entities that would not have been eligible for charitable status might become so as a result of the proposed change, and their assets may grow as a result. However, the intention of the amendment is not to target a specific level of growth in charitable assets or income. Any analysis of the additional revenue cost of the proposed clarification would be speculative, but with the continuing application of the other requirements of charitable tax exemption, officials expect that the cost would be modest. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The proposed amendment should not be adopted Submission (4 – C Gibbons and Holdings Ltd) The rules for obtaining charitable status should not be changed. To give credibility to the status of charities, the “public good” test must apply in order to avoid damaging the viability of private companies. Comments The amendment is limited to relaxing the blood ties component of the public benefit requirement. To qualify for a “charitable” tax exemption, an entity must still have a charitable purpose and must satisfy the other requirements of a charity, such as the charity must not be carried on for the private pecuniary gain of any individual. 76 The submission is concerned about the impact of charitable businesses on other businesses. In general, an income tax exemption would not alter such decisions as how much a business should produce, what prices it should charge, what price it should pay for assets, or what proportion of its income it should invest or consume, so long as the exemption applies to all income of the business. For example, there is no reason why an income tax exemption would encourage a business to pay a higher price for property than other bidders would. Even though its after-tax return on such an investment may be higher than the return that non-exempt businesses could obtain, its return on any other investment – for example, making a loan to a finance company – would also be higher. Therefore there is no incentive to “beat the market” on price. A charitable business is able to retain more income in an absolute sense and therefore grow its retained capital faster than other businesses. This advantage needs to be balanced against other constraints charitable businesses face. They do not have access to equity from other investors because paying out a dividend to a non-charitable owner would violate the requirements of charitable status. Furthermore, charitable businesses are not commercially driven in the manner of private businesses, in which the strong incentive of increased personal wealth encourages growth. The ability of privately owned businesses to compete with charitable businesses is borne out by the co-existence of charitable and non-charitable businesses in many industries in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of “member” for the purposes of new section OB 3A Submission (31W – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The definition of “member” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 should be amended so that it applies to beneficiaries of a trust. Comment The proposed section OB 3A(2) is intended to deal with blood-ties among beneficiaries of trusts, but as noted by the submission, beneficiaries of trusts are not “members” per se under general law. Officials agree with the submission and recommend that a consequential amendment should be made to ensure that beneficiaries of a trust are reflected in the new section OB 3A. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 77 MARAE CHARITABLE EXEMPTION Clause 66 Issue: The amendment should be removed Submission (7 – Dunedin Community Law Centre) The proposed exemption should be removed. They are too restrictive in terms of the location of marae and their ability to develop, are potentially discriminatory compared with the way churches and public halls are treated, and may preclude marae-based organisations from obtaining charitable exemption under the general rules. The proposed changes to the public benefit requirement and the changes to “charitable purposes” requirement proposed by the Charities Working Party mean that marae- based organisations could secure exemption without the proposed changes. Comment Officials consider that a specific exemption for marae would still be required for entities that administer marae situated on Maori reservations. The amendment would obviate the need for entities that administer the Maori reservation to establish a separate body for the specific purpose of administering the marae in order to avoid breaching the alienation rule associated with the reservation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Marae funds should be able to be applied to charitable purposes Submission (11W – Pukawa D3 Trust and Pukawa 5B Trust, 14W – Waipapa 9 Lands Trust, 17W – Rotohokahoka F6 Trust, 18W – Waiteti 2 Section 1A2 Trust, 19W – Waikuta 2 Trust, 20W – Fairy Springs Trust, 22 – New Zealand Maori Council, 27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The proposed exemption should be broadened to include marae applying their funds towards cultural activities, such as traditional tangi, and to wider social objectives such as the health, education, and welfare of its community. The Federation and Maori Authorities and the Office of the Maori Trustee consider that the proposed amendment would benefit very few marae, and involves culturally inappropriate restrictions. The proposed amendment would require separate entities for the administration and physical maintenance of marae and for the activities that take place there. Restrictions on the ability of marae to claim charitable status should 78 be directed at the elimination of the ability of individuals to derive private pecuniary profit – as currently provided in the charitable exemptions in CB 4(1)(c) and (e). The New Zealand Maori Council submitted that if the bill is not amended to allow hapu and iwi to be “charitable” in their own right, marae should be permitted to apply their funds to charitable purposes. Comment The government discussion document Taxation of Maori organisations, published in 2001, proposed that marae should be permitted to apply their funds to purposes that supported the activities traditionally carried out on the marae. Submissions received on the discussion document strongly opposed any move that would allow the courts to interpret the meaning of “supporting activities traditionally carried out on the marae” as this would be seen as the court determining the tikanga of the marae. Such a move would have been considered totally inappropriate. For this reason, the exemption proposed in this bill did not include marae activities. Restricting the amendment to apply to marae funds solely applied to the maintenance of the physical structures of the marae would mean that very few marae would benefit from it. Officials consider that denying a charitable income tax exemption on the grounds that some of a marae’s funds are applied to recognised charitable purposes other than the maintenance and administration of its physical structures would make the new provision less relevant and would be inconsistent with the general policy on charitable exemptions. In determining whether a marae is applying its funds for charitable purposes (other than to administer and maintain the marae’s physical structure), the current rules as to what is a charitable purpose would apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but note that officials recommend that new section OB 3A(1)(b) be amended to clarify that marae funds can be applied to charitable purposes. Issue: The exemption for marae should be extended Submission (22 – New Zealand Maori Council) If the bill is not amended to allow hapu and iwi to be charitable in their own right, the proposed exemption should be extended to cover marae that adhere to customary Maori practices, serve a significant number of Maori and are recognised by other marae in the area. Most urban marae are not on Maori reservations and some new marae, such as university marae and Kokiri marae, may have difficulty becoming reservations as they may not be on Maori freehold land. 79 Comment The specific marae exemption is intended to apply to marae situated on Maori reservations only. However, it was never intended that entities not meeting the specific exemption would be precluded from seeking charitable status under the general exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but note that officials recommend that the new section OB 3A (1) be amended to clarify that it does not prevent marae from qualifying for general “charitable” tax exemption. Issue: Marae should be included in the definition of “charitable purposes” Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The proposed exemption should be amended to “include” marae in the definition of “charitable purpose”. Comment Including marae in the definition of “charitable purpose” would mean that entities administering marae would be “charitable” under the general exemption provision. Such an inclusion would go further than the proposed policy permits. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The amendment should not be limited to marae on Maori reservations Submission (27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The proposed exemption should be amended so that it does not require marae to be situated on a Maori reservation for the exemption to apply. This requirement is unduly restrictive and is likely to prejudice urban marae. 80 Comment As mentioned earlier, the proposed amendment applies to entities that administer marae situated on Maori reservations and is intended to provide relief for such entities from the requirement that assets must be applied for charitable purposes in perpetuity. Consistent with the proposed policy, entities that do not meet the specific requirements of the proposed amendment can apply for charitable status under the general exemption provision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The amendment should apply from the 2003-04 income year Submission (22 – New Zealand Maori Council, 27 – Federation of Maori Authorities, 28 – The Office of the Maori Trustee) The proposed exemption for marae should apply from the 2003-04 income year, and not the 2004-05 income year, as currently proposed. Comment Since the amendment is not linked to the proposed Maori authority rules there is no reason the amendment should not apply from the 2003-04 income year. Recommendation That the amendment apply from the 2003-04 income year. Issue: Alienation of Maori land Submission (7 – Dunedin Community Law Centre) New section OB 3A should be amended to include a specific clause that prohibits the alienation of Maori land on the winding up of a charitable trust, and that any issue relating to the winding up of a trust involving Maori land must be referred to the Maori Land Court. This is in recognition of the impacts of the alienation of Maori land in the past. 81 Comment The proposed exemption is intended to provide relief for trustees that administered marae on Maori reservations from the requirement to alienate land subject to the reservation. Officials consider that the submission’s concern should be addressed as part of clarifying the intention of the amendment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 83 Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties 85 OVERVIEW The compliance and penalties legislation in the Tax Administration Act 1994 came into effect on 1 April 1997. It was designed to promote effective and fairer enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts by providing better incentives for taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations. The post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation began in October 1999. The discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, released in August 2001, represented the findings of the first stage of the review. This bill contains most of the proposals relating to shortfall penalties. The key ones are: • The penalties for lack of reasonable care and unacceptable tax position are being reduced to 10 percent if the breach is the taxpayer’s first breach of a required standard of behaviour. If the taxpayer does not take reasonable care in his or her tax affairs for the following four years, the shortfall penalty for any subsequent breach will be imposed at 20 percent. • The legislation is being amended to provide that a shortfall penalty can be imposed in cases where a tax position taken is unacceptable but the taxpayer has not “interpreted” the law. • The lowest threshold for the application of the penalty for having taken an unacceptable tax position is being increased from $10,000 to $20,000. • A $50,000 cap is being introduced on the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care, in cases where the shortfall is identified within a two-month period through voluntary disclosure or an Inland Revenue audit. Submissions were generally opposed to replacing the unacceptable interpretation penalty with an unacceptable tax position penalty, and generally considered that the measures relating to reducing penalties for good behaviour and the $50,000 cap on penalties need extending in various ways. In response, officials propose minor amendments in relation to most of the measures, extending the scope of the measures which are taxpayer-friendly, but not as far as requested in submissions. The main recommendations by officials to the Committee following submissions are that amendments be made to the bill to: • extend the good behaviour provisions to include all shortfall penalties; and • amend the proposal to ensure that a shortfall penalty for an unacceptable tax position is not imposed on calculation or processing errors. 86 PROPOSALS GENERALLY Clauses 109-113 Issue: Application date Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The legislation should be made clear as to whether it applies to penalties charged on or after 1 April 2003, or shortfalls incurred after that date. It is preferred that the new regime apply to penalties charged on or after 1 April 2003. Comment As currently drafted, the proposals relating to shortfall penalties generally apply on and after 1 April 2003. Officials agree with the submission that it could be uncertain as to whether the proposed amendments apply to penalties charged on or after 1 April 2003, or shortfalls incurred after that date. In relation to the good behaviour proposal, officials recommend that the proposal apply to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2000, apart from those instances where a shortfall penalty has already been imposed, in which case the higher penalty rate will stand. This will ensure that tax shortfalls identified after the date of enactment but relating to tax periods starting after 1 April 2000 benefit from the “good behaviour” provisions. It ensures that the reduced penalty rates take effect as soon as possible and is consistent with the submissions. We also propose that the application date make it clear that if a taxpayer has had a shortfall penalty imposed under the old rates, that penalty would not be taken into account in determining the rate of penalty to be charged on a subsequent breach. In other words, for the purposes of the “good behaviour” proposals, taxpayers start with a “clean slate”. In relation to the change allowing a penalty to be imposed in cases where the taxpayer has not taken an acceptable tax position, officials consider that it would be fairer if the proposed amendments applied to tax shortfalls incurred on or after 1 April 2003. If the proposal were to apply to penalties imposed after 1 April 2003, taxpayers who had tax shortfalls in similar periods might be treated differently, depending on whether the penalty was imposed before or after 1 April 2003. Recommendation That the submission be accepted to the extent that: 87 • the proposed amendment taking into account taxpayers’ good behaviour apply to tax positions taken on or after 1 April 2000, apart from those instances where a shortfall penalty has already been imposed, and that taxpayers will start with a “clean slate”; and • the amendment to allow an unacceptable tax position penalty to be imposed in cases where no interpretation was made apply to tax shortfalls incurred on or after 1 April 2003. 88 GOOD BEHAVIOUR Clause 111 Issue: Period too long Submission (10 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 13 – Business New Zealand) A more equitable approach is to reduce the clean period to less than four years and remove the proposal to apply the discount separately in respect of each tax type. (New Zealand Retailers Association) A four-year period is too long, and a two-year period would be more realistic in today’s environment. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The four-year “probationary” period of “good behaviour” for lack of reasonable care and unacceptable interpretation should be reduced to two years. (Business New Zealand) Comment The discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review recommended a seven-year period. Following the consideration of submissions on the discussion document, this period was reduced to four years. The proposal that the amendment apply separately to each type of tax was added after receiving the submissions on the discussion document. For example, the rate of the shortfall penalty imposed on a taxpayer for not taking reasonable care in relation to income tax will not be affected by a previous breach of the reasonable care test in relation to another tax type such as GST. The period needs to be sufficiently long to indicate that the taxpayer’s behaviour has changed, but short enough to be not overly burdensome on the taxpayer. Officials consider that for income tax, a two-year period is not long enough to demonstrate that a taxpayer’s behaviour has changed. A four-year period, we judge, gives a better guide as to a taxpayer truly having improved his or her behaviour. We consider that in the case of GST, PAYE and fringe benefit tax, a two-year period would be sufficiently long for a taxpayer to demonstrate improved compliance behaviour. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, in that the “good behaviour” period be reduced to two years for GST, PAYE and fringe benefit tax. 89 Issue: Mental element to be taken into account Submission (10 – New Zealand Retailers Association) A mental element should be taken into account if culpability is to be used to determine whether a shortfall penalty can be discounted on account of previous good behaviour. The line should be drawn at the point where the taxpayer is cognisant that the position taken is probably wrong in law or constitutes tax avoidance. This test would, quite rightly, preclude the discount being available in respect of evasion. But in cases of gross carelessness and avoidance, which are measured on an objective basis, it would mean that some taxpayers would be eligible for the discount. Comment It many cases it would be difficult for Inland Revenue to determine whether the taxpayer was cognisant or not. One of the purposes of the compliance and penalties legislation is to ensure that penalties for breaches of tax obligations are imposed impartially and consistently; drawing the line at the point where the taxpayer is cognisant would make the legislation more difficult for Inland Revenue to impose impartially and consistently. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Proposal should apply to all penalties Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 13 – Business New Zealand, 21W – KPMG) A past record of good behaviour should be taken into account for all penalties imposed under the Revenue Acts. If the primary submission is not accepted, past behaviour should be taken into account for those shortfalls that do not incorporate an element of deliberate action – for example, gross carelessness. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The “good behaviour” approach for lack of reasonable care and unacceptable interpretation contained in this bill should be extended more strategically across all penalties, with the exception of those for the worst behaviour. (Business New Zealand) Consideration should be given to extending this approach to other penalties, not just lack of reasonable care. (KPMG) 90 Comment Officials agree with the submission’s concerns in relation to shortfall penalties. We consider that good behaviour can be expanded to cover all shortfall penalties along the following lines: • The rate of all shortfall penalties can be halved if within the previous four-year period the taxpayer has not been liable for a shortfall penalty imposed as the result of an audit. • An exception to this general rule should be made in relation to shortfall penalties for evasion where it is considered that there should be no “good behaviour” period. In other words, having evaded once, a taxpayer will have the evasion shortfall penalty imposed at the rate of 150 percent on any subsequent shortfalls arising as the result of evasion. • The proposal will apply separately for each type of tax, such as PAYE, income tax and GST. This means a penalty imposed in relation to one tax does not prevent “good behaviour” being considered for another tax. • Tax shortfalls will be grouped and effectively counted as one offence. For example, if a taxpayer who has never had a tax shortfall is audited, and several breaches of the lack of reasonable care standard are ascertained, all of those tax shortfalls would be treated as the first offence. The reason for this is that we were concerned that there could be disagreement as to which shortfall was the “first”, and we wanted to ensure that where a taxpayer had made the same mistake in several periods, all were penalised at the same rate. • Breaches of the lack of reasonable care and unacceptable tax position standards will not count as first offences for gross carelessness, abusive tax position and evasion. But a first offence for these higher penalties will count as a breach of good behaviour in relation to the lower penalties. We consider that the higher penalties require some form of intent or significant non-compliance and that it would be unfair for a small error by way of lack of care to effectively expose the taxpayer to the full extent of these more significant penalties. • Voluntary disclosure will not count against “good behaviour”. It will only be when the taxpayer has been audited and a shortfall penalty is imposed that the “probation” period will begin. We are concerned that if this were not the case taxpayers could be discouraged from voluntarily disclosing tax shortfalls, as once they had made a voluntary disclosure they would face higher penalties on any other shortfalls for a period of four years. This proposal will mean that: • The shortfall penalty rate for first time evasion is aligned with the rate for evasion in Australia and Canada. • Taxpayers and Inland Revenue staff see that those taxpayers who repeatedly offend are more harshly penalised, reflecting their failure to begin complying voluntarily. 91 • The general concern that the shortfall penalty rates are excessive is addressed. (This is particularly the cases with voluntary disclosures where the rules are seen as penalising taxpayers who are attempting to comply.) One concern about this proposal is that the measure reduces the penalty applying to evasion from 150 percent to 75 percent for a “first offence” and therefore this measure could be seen as softening the seriousness of this offence. Our response is that the penalty for evasion when halved is now equal to the penalty imposed in Australia and Canada. We also consider that a 75 percent penalty is still substantial, and the legislation will now provide that increased penalties apply to those who re-offend. Further, we do not propose that the four-year good behaviour period apply in the case of evasion. The submission requested that good behaviour be extended to other penalties. The next stage of the compliance and penalties review will consider this issue. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, in part, and that the rates of shortfall penalties for first offences be reduced. Issue: More strategic approach required Submission (21W – KPMG) There needs to be a more strategic approach to encouraging voluntary compliance. What is needed is an approach that does more than just penalise certain behaviour, but has the twin objectives of both rewarding and penalising. Comment The current proposal reflects a strategic approach to ensuring compliance, with penalties reflecting culpability and with thresholds established to minimise compliance costs. The legislation does not expect, or require, that taxpayers get everything right when taking tax positions. The legislation requires that taxpayers take reasonable care, and where there is a significant amount of tax at stake that taxpayers take extra care to ensure that the tax positions they take are likely to be correct. Officials consider that it is not feasible to reward taxpayers simply for meeting their legal requirements other than in the sense that has been proposed, to take a taxpayer’s good behaviour into account by reducing the level of shortfall penalties. 92 Officials considered the option of not penalising taxpayers for their first breach but, on reflection, consider that such a proposal would be unfair to those taxpayers who never breach the standard. Also, such an approach could reduce the incentives on taxpayers to comply voluntarily, as first-time non-compliance is penalty-free. Recommendation That the submission be declined because the proposals already reflect a strategic approach to encouraging voluntary compliance. 93 UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITIONS Clause 111 Issue: General disagreement with the proposal Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21W – KPMG, 29 – New Zealand Law Society) The Institute of Chartered Accountants strongly disagrees with this proposal. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Extending the penalty as proposed is inappropriate and unwarranted. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) These changes are an unwarranted extension of the considerable penal powers that the Inland Revenue already has. (New Zealand Law Society) This proposal should not proceed. (KPMG) Comment The new shortfall penalty for unacceptable tax position is intended as a signal to taxpayers who take tax positions where there is a significant amount of tax at stake. It indicates that they should take extra care and that, when viewed objectively, their interpretations should be likely to be correct. However, the current interpretation of “unacceptable interpretation” allows taxpayers to avoid making reasonable efforts to determine what the law is. The proposed amendment addresses this concern. It ensures that taxpayers cannot choose to avoid interpreting the legislation on a complex tax issue, as a means of avoiding possible shortfall penalties. The current interpretation weakens the standard that larger taxpayers are required to meet, and makes a penalty more difficult to impose in cases where it is fair that it be imposed. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 94 Issue: Current legislation does reflect the original intent Submission (24W – Andrew Gibbin) The original intent of the legislation is not to impose penalties regardless of the behaviour of a taxpayer and whether or not the taxpayer has interpreted the legislation. Comment Officials consider that, as the proposed legislation is currently drafted, there is opportunity for taxpayers to take steps to ensure that a shortfall penalty is not imposed if the position they have taken fails to meet the “standard of being, viewed objectively, about as likely as not to be the correct tax position test”. Officials therefore consider an amendment is necessary. The submission’s concern is that this reform was not originally intended and should therefore not proceed. Officials consider that the original intent of the legislation was to impose a shortfall penalty regardless of whether or not the taxpayer had interpreted the legislation. We also consider, however, the fundamental issue is one of whether the unacceptable interpretation penalty has appropriate coverage, regardless of the intent of the original policy as it might or might not have been amended. The discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties 2: Detailed proposals and draft legislation notes: The earlier discussion document proposed that when the tax at stake was large, taxpayers would need to have a “reasonably arguable position” in support of the way they had applied the law. Failure to have a reasonably arguable position would result in a penalty. The fact that this would apply only where the tax involved was substantial meant that ordinary taxpayers would generally not be affected. 15 That discussion document makes it clear that the original intent was that taxpayers have tax arguments for the positions they take in a tax return. The introduction of the concept of interpretation was not intended to change this position. When it reported to Parliament on the 1995 Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties and Disputes Resolution Bill, the Finance and Expenditure Committee noted that it considered there was a conflict between the term “reasonably arguable position” and its definition in the bill. The Committee concluded that: ... the ordinary meaning of “reasonably arguable position” does not equate with “about as likely as not to be correct”. Therefore, we recommend that the bill be amended by changing the name of this penalty to “unacceptable interpretation”, and that this be defined as one that “fails to meet the standard of being, viewed objectively, about as likely as not to be the correct tax position”. 16 15 Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties 2: Detailed proposals and draft legislation, April 1995, paragraph 6.1. 16 Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill as reported from the Finance and Expenditure Committee Commentary, page v. 95 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The lack of reasonable care penalty should apply Submission (10 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 21W – KPMG) The proposed extension is unwarranted as cases where the taxpayer has not interpreted the law should be dealt with under the lack of reasonable care provision (which also carries a 20 percent shortfall penalty). The commentary states that “taxpayers could choose not to interpret the legislation on a complex tax issue as a means of avoiding the shortfall penalties”, but surely a taxpayer in that position would be guilty of not taking reasonable care, if not gross carelessness, in any event? (New Zealand Retailers Association) The correct penalty for taking a tax position without interpreting the law is the lack of reasonable care penalty. (KPMG) Comment Officials agree in some cases that the lack of reasonable care penalty can apply. There is a concern that there could be cases where a penalty cannot be imposed even though it is appropriate that the taxpayer be penalised. For example, a taxpayer investing in a scheme asks the promoter if an interpretation is necessary on a particular point and the promoter says that the point is very clear and an interpretation is not necessary; the taxpayer has taken reasonable care and no shortfall penalty can be imposed. In effect, the current legislation allows taxpayers to avoid making reasonable efforts to determine what the law is. The proposed amendment ensures that taxpayers are accountable for all of their tax positions. Officials recommend that the original intent of the legislation be made clear and that the legislation provide that a shortfall penalty could be imposed if the tax position taken is not as likely as not to be correct, including where the taxpayer has not interpreted the law. As stated earlier, the requirement for interpretation of legislation before a shortfall penalty could be imposed was unintentional. When the 1995 bill containing the compliance and penalties legislation was introduced this penalty was known as the penalty for lack of a “reasonably arguable position”. That bill commentary notes that a tax shortfall in this category must be the result of a taxpayer having taken an incorrect position on a question of interpretation. The standard requires the interpretation to be “about as likely as not correct”. 96 The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended that for the purpose of clarity the name of the penalty be changed to “unacceptable interpretation” and that this be defined as one that “fails to meet the standard of being, viewed objectively, about as likely as not to be the correct tax position”. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Contrary to the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s recommendation Submission (10 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 13 – Business New Zealand) This measure is quite inconsistent with the thrust of the Finance and Expenditure Committee and Committee of Experts recommendations. (New Zealand Retailers Association) The provisions regarding penalties for unacceptable tax positions should not proceed and instead the rules should be clarified, as recommended by the Finance and Expenditure Committee in its 1999 report. (Business New Zealand) Comment Officials note that the proposal conflicts with the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s recommendation in relation to its 1999 inquiry into the powers and operations of the Inland Revenue Department. That conflict was made clear in the most recent discussion document. As stated earlier, however, the proposed amendment addresses the concern that current legislation allows taxpayers to avoid making reasonable efforts to determine what the law is on more complex tax matters. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 97 Issue: Proposal should not apply to calculation and processing errors Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 29 – New Zealand Law Society) The legislation needs to exclude calculation and processing errors which do not involve interpretations being taken. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The New Zealand Law Society is concerned that if the amendments are enacted, the Inland Revenue Department will wield section 141B each time a major taxpayer, even if inadvertently or with the best care possible, gets it wrong. It will be too easy for the Inland Revenue to impose shortfall penalties on significant taxpayers who are, for instance, late in complying with filing and paying obligations or who transpose figures in their returns or who, through the confusing and unclear nature of certain tax forms, simply complete them incorrectly. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials agree with the submission. It was never intended that this penalty apply to calculation or processing errors. This penalty applies to shortfalls that arise because a tax position taken is not likely to be correct, whether or not the taxpayer actually interpreted the law. If a calculation or processing error is of such a magnitude that the error breaches the reasonable care standard, that shortfall penalty should apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “tax position” Submission (16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Clarification is required as to what is intended by amending the definition of “tax position”. Comment Officials have re-examined the amendment and now consider that the amendment is unnecessary. Instead, a minor clarifying amendment should be made to the current definition. We therefore recommend that the current amendment to the definition of “tax position” be replaced with an amendment clarifying the current definition. 98 Recommendation That the amendment to the definition of “tax position” be replaced with a minor amendment clarifying the current definition. 99 CAPPING SHORTFALL PENALTIES Clause 118 Issue: Proposal should be extended to apply to other penalties Submission (10 – New Zealand Retailers Association) The cap should apply in respect of other penalties. If culpability is the key, it should at least apply to the unacceptable tax position penalty as, by carrying the same 20 percent tariff that applies to the lack of reasonable care penalty, the two of them can be taken to involve the equivalent degrees of culpability. Comment This proposal is aimed at ensuring that those breaches of the reasonable care standard that are large in dollar terms which are speedily identified and corrected are not excessively penalised. Generally, the cap should not apply to the unacceptable tax position standard because at the time taxpayers take their position in their return they will be aware whether or not their interpretation meets the standard of being as likely as not to be correct. However, as that penalty will now apply in cases where no interpretation has been made, it is possible that at the time taxpayers took the position they were not aware that the position did not meet the standard of being as likely as not to be correct. Officials therefore agree that the cap should apply to the unacceptable tax position penalty. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the cap apply to the unacceptable tax position penalty. Issue: Time limit (10 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21W–- KPMG) The cap should not be subject to the two-month cut-off period. (New Zealand Retailers Association) At a minimum the proposed cap should apply to shortfalls identified through voluntary disclosure or Inland Revenue audit within the period within which the next annual income tax return is due to be filed. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) 100 In most cases the two-month time limit does not provide an adequate timeframe for taxpayers to determine whether a tax shortfall has occurred. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) KPMG agrees that the penalty for lack of reasonable care can give incongruous results when the error is quickly identified and rectified. However, the situations when the cap applies should be extended to cover a period of time prior to notification of an audit. (KPMG) Comment The government proposed capping shortfall penalties for lack of reasonable care because it was concerned that if the tax shortfall was identified quickly, the imposition of a shortfall penalty might be out of step with other penalties imposed under the Tax Administration Act. The cap is meant to apply only to those shortfalls identified in a short period of time. If the length of time were longer, for example, a year for annual income tax returns, the incentives for taxpayers to take care would be significantly reduced. If the taxpayer is notified of an audit within the two-month period and the shortfall is ascertained within that period then the cap will apply. To extend the time period to apply to all notifications of audit, regardless of when the tax shortfall arose, reduces greatly the incentives for taxpayers to comply voluntarily. Some taxpayers would be more prepared to risk that they will not be audited or, alternatively, that they will not be audited within a certain amount of time, and therefore would not take as much care when they file returns. Officials can, however, see the benefit of increasing the period of time to three months, which is the period between fringe benefit tax returns. This would provide an opportunity for taxpayers preparing a fringe benefit tax return to identify an error in the previous return and disclose that error, with the cap therefore applying. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part and in that the time period be extended to three months. Issue: The value of the cap should be reduced Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 16 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) While the Institute of Chartered Accountants agrees with the proposal to introduce a monetary cap, it should be $10,000 per tax position. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) 101 It is incorrect to state that lowering the cap from the proposed $50,000 level would remove an incentive to take reasonable care. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment A cap of $50,000 was proposed because that amount equates to the maximum criminal evasion penalty. It seems inappropriate that penalties for lack of reasonable care should exceed this amount, regardless of the amount of shortfall involved, in cases where the shortfall is identified promptly. One concern with the cap is that when the cap is breached, as the amount of the tax shortfall increases the shortfall penalty proportionally reduces. Officials consider that a $50,000 cap appropriately balances the need for a proportionate, but not excessive, penalty. While the appropriate level of a cap is a matter of judgement, concerns about adopting a lower cap include that the penalty may end up being only a small percentage of the tax involved. For example, for a large shortfall the $10,000 cap may only be 1 percent of the underlying tax, while taxpayers with similar errors but smaller discrepancies or discrepancies not detected within the four month window will face a 20 percent penalty. With a smaller cap, the resulting maximum penalty would be a small percentage of the tax shortfall. Therefore officials do not recommend any change in the level of the cap. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Penalties on voluntary disclosures Submission (10 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Voluntary disclosures should not be subject to shortfall penalties (it is appreciated that abusive tax position and evasion disclosures may need to be treated differently), as this would increase voluntary compliance without adversely affecting the revenue. (New Zealand Retailers Association) Shortfalls that are voluntarily disclosed should not be penalised, except through use- of-money interest. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) 102 Comment At the core of the compliance and penalties legislation is a standard of reasonable care. This means that each taxpayer’s actions in meeting their obligations should be at the standard expected of a reasonable person. In addition, for interpretative matters which involve significant amounts of tax, taxpayers must ensure that they have interpreted the law in a reasonable way. If no penalties were imposed for voluntary disclosures then there would be no reason for taxpayers to take care when complying with their tax obligations. For example, taxpayers could omit income from a particular source when they file their return and then, six months later, make a voluntarily disclosure that they had omitted the income. The concern with this position is that the tax return potentially ceases to be a taxpayer’s best attempt at assessing their tax liability as error in the return will not be penalised if disclosed at a later date. While use-of-money interest compensates the Crown for not having the use of its money, if taxpayers decided not to take reasonable care at the time they completed their tax return and then voluntarily disclosed shortfalls at a later date, the government would face a temporary loss of revenue. The next stage of the compliance and penalties review will consider whether the current level of penalty in the case of voluntary disclosure is appropriate. The submissions will be considered further as part of that work. Recommendation That the submissions be considered further as part of the second stage of the post- implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation. 103 PROMOTER PENALTIES Clause 114 Issue: Generally disagree with proposal Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 13 – Business New Zealand) The Institute of Chartered Accountants remains strongly opposed to this proposal. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The provisions on promoter penalties should be deleted. (Business New Zealand) Comment The government is concerned about the number of taxpayers investing in tax arrangements involving abusive tax positions where the arrangement has been promoted to the taxpayer. The compliance and penalties legislation currently imposes no penalty on the promoter and therefore provides no incentive for promoters to ensure that the tax effects that they claim for their arrangements are correct. The government is concerned that in many cases investors in such arrangements are not aware of the tax effects of their investment, while the promoter is. The proposed promoter penalty is aimed at reducing both the marketing of and investment in such arrangements involving abusive tax positions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Proposal should be delayed Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) This issue should be held over until the review of the proposals on closely related mass marketed schemes is complete. Comment While the proposals attack a similar concern, they are fundamentally different. The issues raised in the officials’ paper on mass-marketed tax schemes include the registration of certain types of investments, and place limits on deductions attributable to some investments. The proposal in this bill is aimed at penalising promoters of 104 investments where the investment results in the taxpayer taking an abusive tax position. The promoter penalty proposal and the mass-marketed schemes suggestions would operate independently of each other. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification that deduction be of the same type and quantum Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) The wording of section 141EA(2) should be clarified so that the deduction taken by the five or more persons (or the loss offset) must be of the same type and quantum as the deduction taken which leads to the abusive tax position. Comment Officials disagree with the submission. We are concerned that the effect of the investment may not necessarily be of the same type and quantum as the deduction taken which leads to the abusive tax position. For example, a taxpayer may have a loss arising from a decline in the value of shares, which are held on revenue account, which arises because of the decline in value of substantially overvalued fixed life intangible property owned by the company. In this case the loss is not of the same type as the decline in the value of the fixed life intangible property. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Threshold should be increased Submission (29 – New Zealand Law Society) The threshold of five or more persons in any income year is too low. Offering an arrangement to five people, particularly if they are related to the offeror, or are the offeror’s business associates, would hardly constitute “mass-marketing”. If the legislation is genuinely meant to attack mass-marketed schemes, then a more realistic threshold, such as 20 or more people, should be chosen. 105 Comment Officials agree with the submission. However, we consider extending the threshold to 20 or more people unduly broadens the scope, possibly allowing some promoters to avoid imposition of the penalty. We therefore recommend as a compromise that an arrangement must be promoted to ten or more people. Determining an appropriate threshold is a matter of judgement requiring a balance between including arrangements which are not widely promoted and excluding some arrangements that we do consider the promoter should be penalised for. Recommendation That the threshold be increased to ten or more people. Issue: Concerns relating to the definition of “promoter” Submission (29 – New Zealand Law Society, 31W – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) The definition of “promoter” includes any person who “is involved in formulating a plan or programme from which an arrangement is offered”. It will literally catch any person who happens, somewhere along the way, to have input into an idea that sometime in the future materialises in a mass-marketed scheme. The definition will catch persons who, after legal advice, abandon an inchoate scheme but find the exact arrangement marketed by someone else. It is conceivable that the definition could catch the Inland Revenue officer in the Adjudication and Rulings Division, who provides a binding ruling on the arrangement that eventually, after a number of iterations, becomes a mass-marketed scheme. (New Zealand Law Society) Virtually everyone who gives legal/accounting advice in connection with a public offering, and which is used for purposes of the public offering, comes within the definition of “promoter”. Because section 141EA applies a “no fault” liability standard on all promoters, the section creates a severe impediment to the provision of any tax advice for use in a public offering. This itself is a severe impediment to capital rising through capital markets. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Comment The definition of “promoter” is deliberately broad to ensure that those who do promote arrangements involving an abusive tax position are not able to structure their affairs so that they are not exposed to the potential application of the promoter penalty. Given that the goal of the penalty is to hold promoters accountable for their actions, and the penalty is based on the tax impact of the arrangement, which can be significant, they have strong incentives to try to structure themselves outside the definition. However, we do accept the submission’s concerns that people who are peripherally involved may be covered by the definition. We therefore recommend that the definition be amended to include only those who have a significant involvement. 106 Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the definition of “promoter” in section 141EB be amended to include only those who have a significant involvement. Issue: Clarification of the meaning of “invests” Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Section 141EA(1) needs to clarify the meaning of “invests” so that it cannot apply to amounts paid in fees. Comment Officials agree with the submission. We are also concerned that the concept of “invest” could be manipulated by promoters so that taxpayers who invest more than $50,000 would still qualify for the reduction in penalties. Officials consider that rather than referring to the amount invested, a better approach would be to consider the effect of the arrangement, that is, whether the tax deductions, tax losses, input tax credits or deferred output tax from the arrangement are less than a certain amount. We recommend that the threshold be set at $50,000. In order to capture multiple investments through intermediaries, officials recommend that for the purpose of determining whether the threshold is breached, interests be aggregated. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in that the reference to “invests” be removed and the threshold be changed to one where the tax effect of the arrangement is less than $50,000. Issue: Promoters’ right to dispute penalty and assessment Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 31W – Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) “Promoters” who may be liable to such a penalty should have clear and unambiguous rights to dispute both the penalty and the assessment. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) 107 Proposed section 141EA does not address the situation where a taxpayer settles, and pays a penalty or portion of a penalty, for an abusive tax position without actually being found liable for such a penalty by the High Court or otherwise. The difficulty is that a taxpayer may settle and accept the Commissioner’s view for reasons relating to litigation risk/costs of litigation and other factors that do not involve an express finding or acceptance that there is an abusive tax position. The concern is that such a settlement by the taxpayer results in automatic satisfaction of the standard in section 141EA(1)(a) (penalty “imposed on” the taxpayer) without any ability of the promoter to challenge whether or not there is in fact an abusive tax position. (Minter Ellison Rudd Watts) Comment Officials agree with the concerns expressed in both submissions. We recommend that promoters have a legislated right to dispute whether the arrangement involves an abusive tax position and also to dispute the imposition of the promoter penalty itself, including whether they are a promoter and the amount of the promoter penalty. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Penalty should not be based on 39% tax rate Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 29 – New Zealand Law Society) If, contrary to this submission, there is any penalty charged to a promoter in respect of a shortfall by a taxpayer, it should be based on the actual shortfall, and applicable tax rate or tax type, not an arbitrary amount based on gross income figure multiplied by an arbitrary tax rate of 39%. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Deeming the promoter to have a tax shortfall equal to the total of all tax shortfalls generated by the arrangement determined using a 39% tax rate, and imposing a penalty of 100 percent of the deemed tax shortfall is draconian. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment In the case of income tax, the majority of taxpayers investing in such arrangements will have a marginal tax rate of 39% as the benefits from these schemes are tax- related and maximised by those who have large incomes. The alternative of using the marginal tax rates of each of the investors would have significant administrative costs. For example, one arrangement may involve hundreds of investors and multiple income years. Officials consider the administration costs outweigh any increase in accuracy in using the marginal tax rates of the investors. Further, it should be noted that the calculation is used to determine the penalty on the promoter, not the investors. 108 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Determining the tax figure to which the penalty should apply Submission (Matter raised by officials) The promoter penalty should not be based on the actual tax shortfalls of the individual investors in the arrangement, but rather on the expected tax impact. Comment We consider that the legislation should be clear as to the amount to which the penalty applies. We recommend that the legislation be amended to provide that the penalty is calculated on the tax effect of the arrangement rather than actual tax shortfalls of the individual investors. This ensures that the promoter’s liability is independent of, and does not vary with, changes in individual taxpayers’ positions. This amendment also addresses a concern regarding taxpayer certainty. This will also mean that, in relation to other taxes, the appropriate tax rate is used to determine the penalty. For example, for an arrangement involving GST, the penalty would be calculated using a rate of 12.5% rather than 39%. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Aiding and abetting Submission (13 – Business New Zealand) The current law already allows Inland Revenue to take action against people, such as promoters of mass-marketed schemes, who “aid and abet” those taking unacceptable tax positions. The submission therefore asks whether this law change is really necessary. 109 Comment The penalty for aiding and abetting is a criminal penalty and hence the standard of evidence required is higher, that is, beyond reasonable doubt. It is, therefore, an administratively difficult penalty to impose. It is also a very difficult to prove that the promoter aided and abetted the taxpayer, as in many cases promoters will say that they merely offered the taxpayer an arrangement and it was up to the taxpayer as to whether or not to make the investment. Instead of attempting to make the aiding and abetting provisions apply, the government is proposing the promoter penalty as a way to prevent promotions of these arrangements. Officials therefore consider that it is appropriate to penalise promoters of arrangements involving abusive tax positions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 110 ONUS OF PROOF Clause 105 Issue: Guidelines Submission (21W – KMPG) Some guidelines need to be developed to give taxpayers and Inland Revenue some certainty about how this test will apply in practice. Comment This minor clarifying amendment to the onus of proof legislation puts in place a Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance recommendation that if a taxpayer proves, on the balance of probabilities, that the assessment is excessive by a specified amount, the court should reduce Inland Revenue’s assessment by that amount. Because the amendment affects only the decisions of the courts, and not Inland Revenue, there is no reason to issue administrative guidelines for the department. The scope of the amendment will be described in the relevant Tax Information Bulletin once the legislation is enacted. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Inland Revenue to apply onus of proof Submission (21W – KPMG) Inland Revenue should apply the onus of proof test when they are considering making adjustments to a taxpayer’s return or considering a matter raised by a taxpayer. Comment The amendment is only concerned with where an assessment is challenged and is within the judicial process. Officials consider that the issue of applying the onus of proof test when Inland Revenue is considering making adjustments to a taxpayer’s return or considering a matter raised by a taxpayer is outside of the scope of the post- implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation. Officials note that a post-implementation review of the disputes resolution process began recently and recommend that this issue be referred to that review for consideration. 111 Recommendation That the submission be considered as part of the post-implementation review of the disputes resolution process. 112 TAX IN DISPUTE Clause 100 Issue: Risk to the revenue Submission (12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 21W – KPMG) The Institute of Chartered Accountants rejects the proposal giving Inland Revenue the power to require payment of all of the tax in dispute when there is a risk to the revenue as there is no indication, or definition, of what is meant by significant risk. That if, contrary to the submission, the proposal proceeds, then a definition of significant risk or the specific circumstances that are considered to give rise to such a risk should be included in the legislation. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) KPMG supports the proposal to remove the requirement to pay 50 percent of the tax in dispute. However, it does not support leaving a residual discretion available to the Commissioner to collect payment of all revenue when there is a significant amount at stake. The submission expresses concern that the amendment will be interpreted as applying when a significant amount is at stake. If a residual discretion is available to the Commissioner to collect payment of all revenue when there is a significant amount at stake then there needs to be some objective criteria to determine the circumstances when the revenue is actually at risk. (KPMG) Comment The discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review recommended that: ... Inland Revenue will be given the power to require payment of all the tax in dispute in those rare cases where there is revenue at significant risk – that is, where there is a risk that the amount in dispute might never be paid. 17 Submissions on the proposals in the discussion document expressed concern that there was no definition of “revenue at significant risk”, so when the bill was drafted the words “risk to the revenue” were used instead. These words are currently used in section 138J, which allows the Commissioner to waive payment of non-deferrable tax in dispute if the Commissioner considers that payment of the tax will unduly prejudice the taxpayer’s business and there is no risk to the revenue in waiving payment. There is no definition of what is meant by “risk to the revenue”. 17 Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, August 2002, paragraph 5.21. 113 As noted in the Commentary on the Bill: The government is still concerned that in rare cases there is a risk that the tax will never be paid. For example, if a taxpayer enters a dispute merely to delay payment of tax and then leaves the country. To reduce the risk to the revenue, Inland Revenue will be given the power to require payment of all of the tax in dispute when there is a risk that that amount will not be paid. 18 Officials consider that requiring taxpayers to pay the entire amount in dispute will only occur in rare cases where there is a risk that the amount outstanding will never be paid. Further, officials consider that defining what is meant by “risk to the revenue” or providing a list of the specific circumstances that are considered to give rise to such a risk could result in taxpayers using that information to not pay their tax. The provision does not apply in cases where the amount being disputed is large, but rather where the Commissioner is concerned that the dispute is being entered into to delay the payment of tax and there is a risk that the payment will never be made. If a list of objective criteria were issued, taxpayers would be aware of every instance where the Commissioner would require payment and would structure their disputes so as never to meet the criteria and thus never be required to make the payment. Officials consider that this provision will be used in rare circumstances and that objective criteria are not required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Only 50 percent should be payable Submission (21W – KPMG) If the risk is significant only 50 percent of the tax should be required to be paid. Comment Officials disagree. The proposal that all of the tax in dispute is payable where there is a risk to the revenue ensures that if there is a risk that the tax will never be paid – for example, where there is risk of taxpayer flight – the tax in dispute is paid. To require payment of only half of the amount in dispute would mean that taxpayers could take very aggressive tax positions, dispute the amended assessment, pay half the amount in dispute and then leave the country. 18 Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, Commentary on the Bill, May 2002, page 34. 114 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Assessment must be made on reasonable grounds Submission (13 – Business New Zealand) Business New Zealand is concerned that the amendment requiring all the tax in dispute to be paid if there is a risk to the revenue could be used unreasonably and defeat the intent of the amendment. The clause should be amended to at least require such an assessment to be made on reasonable grounds. Comment The Courts have held that all public powers must be exercised in good faith. This requirement is a real barrier to the power to require all of the tax in dispute to be paid being used unreasonably. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Should review use-of-money interest rates Submission (29 – New Zealand Law Society) The Society supports the removal of the obligation and points out that the removal is an indication that, in the normal course of events, the government is no longer concerned about the risk of the taxpayer not being able to pay the tax ultimately upheld in the challenge or objection. That being the case, there is good reason to review the thinking behind the relatively high use-of-money interest rate taxpayers have to pay, which is based in the view that taxpayers are generally high-risk debtors. The removal of the requirement to pay 50 percent of the disputed tax upfront would suggest that the risk of taxpayers not meeting their tax obligations is less than it used to be. 115 Comment Officials disagree. The reason that the requirement to pay the tax in dispute can be removed is not because the government is no longer concerned about the risk of the taxpayer not being able to pay the tax ultimately upheld in the challenge or objection. The requirement is being removed because use-of-money interest provides the incentive to ensure that taxpayers do not dispute an amount payable merely to delay payment. If they did dispute an assessment and did not pay the amount in dispute and the assessment was subsequently upheld, they would be required to pay use-of-money interest. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section 138I Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 138I should be amended to give the Commissioner the power to require full payment of the tax being disputed if he considers that there is a risk to the revenue. The section heading should also be amended so that it more accurately reflects its contents. Comment The bill removes the current requirement for taxpayers to pay half of the tax in dispute, but also gives the Commissioner the power to require payment of the entire amount being disputed if there is a risk to the revenue. As the proposed legislation is currently drafted, the power to require payment of the entire amount applies only to disputes under the old objection procedures, which were generally raised before 1 October 1996. A similar change should be made to section 138I to provide that the amendment applies to cases under the new challenge procedures. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 116 OTHER SHORTFALL PENALTY ISSUES Issue: Penalties should be imposed on Inland Revenue Submission (10 – New Zealand Retailers Association, 12 – Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Inland Revenue should itself be subject to penalties in cases where it takes an unreasonable stance to the detriment of a taxpayer. (New Zealand Retailers Association) If the Commissioner takes a tax position against a taxpayer which, if it were taken by the taxpayer, would be an unacceptable interpretation or tax position under the prevailing law, or Inland Revenue policy at the time, any shortfall penalties and costs, including interest, paid by the taxpayer in relation to maintaining its acceptable tax position should be refunded to the taxpayer at Inland Revenue’s debit use-of-money interest rate at the time. (Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Comment A structured system of reversed penalties or increased rates of interest in cases of Inland Revenue error would serve only a punitive function and would not necessarily result in an improved service by Inland Revenue. For example, if a penalties system were to be funded out of Inland Revenue’s existing operating expenditure budget, resources would have to be taken from other projects. This would result in a lower quality of service to taxpayers as money allocated to services was diverted. This in turn could lead to further penalties, resulting in a downward performance spiral. Further difficulties might arise in determining whether Inland Revenue was actually at fault. Officials consider that using ex-gratia payments together with appropriate problem resolution services and requiring appropriate performance standards from staff provides a more effective approach to ensuring high standards of taxpayer service. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 117 MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES Issue: Small balances Submission (Matter raised by officials) The provision allowing Inland Revenue not to collect small amounts of tax should be amended to allow Inland Revenue to write off those small amounts not collected. Comment Section 174 of the Tax Administration Act allows Inland Revenue to refrain from collecting tax if the amount payable is less than $20. As drafted, the section allows Inland Revenue not to collect the amount but the debt remains outstanding. Officials propose that these small amounts be written off permanently. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date for the taxpayer financial relief rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) The application date for sections 73 (8) and (10), 86 (4), 87 (4), 88 (10), and 92 (4) of the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 should be amended to apply from 1 December 2002 rather than 1 July 2002. Comment The taxpayer financial relief rules are contained in the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. The bill’s progress was interrupted by the pre- election dissolution of Parliament in June and the convening of the new Parliament in late August. As a result of the delay, the application date of the rules had to be amended to apply from 1 December 2002 rather than 1 July 2002. Several dates were omitted in error and officials therefore recommend that these dates be amended. Recommendation That the submission be accepted.
