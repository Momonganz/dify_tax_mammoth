I firmly believe that savings should start with the Govt, not put taxes up to cover their own failings. SET AN EXAMPLE NZ GOVERNMENT BEFORE TAKING MORE FROM THE PEOPLE PROVIDING YOU WITH THE CASH THAT YOU'RE WASTING A THIRD OF. Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission in reply to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Interim Report. Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth. 2 I submit that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. 3 Yours sincerely,

Joint Income/Split Taxation For the promotion of healthy familes, stable relationships, well adjusted future New Zealanders, I submit that income to the family should be split between both partners. The current system penalises the stay at home partner (and the family), whom make the best choice for the future of their children and not the short term gain of the family unit. The couple that chooses to delay gratification, are making the better choices for the future of New Zealand and the delaying of gratification is one of the basis of Western Civilsation. Income splitting is a tax policy of attributing earned income of one spouse to the other and can be easily undertaken by forming a partnership, however the current system penalises those without the means or ability to setup these business partnerships and is both unfair and unmotivational. I submit that income to the family should be split between both partners, to ensure New Zealand's future growth and stable families. Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off.

Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth. I submit that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working G roup wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. \[1\] 2 Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Yours sincerely,

We reiterate comments to the Group in our submission dated 27 April 2018 on the future of tax in New Zealand. Our feedback in this submission focuses solely on the proposal to introduce director personal liability for PAYE and GST debts of companies. The prospect of director personal liability for company taxes is deeply troubling and may have far-reaching and unintended consequences. The IoD strongly opposes the proposal. About the Institute of Directors The IoD is a non-partisan voluntary membership organisation committed to driving excellence in governance. We represent a diverse membership of about 9,000 members drawn from listed issuers, large private organisations, small and medium enterprises, state sector organisations, not-for-profits and charities. Our Chartered Membership pathway aims to raise the bar for director professionalism in New Zealand, including through continuing professional development to support good corporate governance. Proposal to introduce director personal liability for PAYE and GST debts The interim report includes a recommendation that the Government explore measures to allow PAYE and GST debts of companies to be imposed on directors personally through a Director Penalty Notice regime. This was not raised in the Tax Working Group’s background paper on the future of tax in New Zealand. However, Inland Revenue informally consulted on this with key stakeholders, including the IoD, in 2016 and 2017. The proposal introducing director personal liability for PAYE and GST debt is deeply concerning and the IoD strongly opposes it. The proposal should not be viewed in isolation, but should be considered in the context of New Zealand’s operating environment including governance, commercial, economic, and tax considerations. Robust penalties and enforcement regime The IoD is supportive of the existing measures under tax legislation that hold directors and other people accountable for tax debt of companies, including PAYE and GST. The regime is robust and Inland Revenue has significant powers to hold people to account and is successful in taking action. Given this, we believe the proposal to introduce director personal liability is not necessary and it is likely to have significant unintended consequences outweighing any potentials benefits for the reasons discussed below. 2 Deterring directors from serving on boards Directors can be exposed to significant liability in their positions and this has been increasing over time across legislative and regulatory regimes. The reform under the Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 around directors’ personal liability is a recent example. There are other potential changes on the horizon affecting directors and companies, for instance, the criminalisation of cartel conduct. We are very concerned about the proposal because the increased liability could be a significant deterrent for directors and potential directors from seeking board roles. It is critical that boards attract high performing, effective, and progressive directors to help raise the standard of governance in organisations and trust and confidence in business in New Zealand Conformance and risk adverse boards Boards have a fundamental role in setting, driving and overseeing strategy. They must be continually engaged in strategic matters to ensure the long-term sustainability of their organisations. This is particularly important in today’s complex and challenging operating environment for many organisations. They also have a responsibility to set risk appetite and oversee and monitor risk management. The impact of increased director liability adds to boards’ growing regulatory burden and means they can spend disproportionally more time on conformance rather than performance. Our 2017 Director Sentiment Survey found that 72% of directors were spending more time on compliance related activities in the last 12 months. We are also concerned that the proposal will lead to boards becoming more risk adverse (ie not taking appropriate business risks). This could ultimately impact business success and shareholder value. Cost burden on business and directors Introducing director liability for PAYE and GST debts is likely to result in an increase in costs for companies and directors, including through increased compliance costs and insurance premiums for directors and officers. We are concerned that there has been inadequate cost/benefit analysis on this proposal and we do not see sufficient benefits to support the proposed change. There should be a compelling and clear case that will deliver a material net benefit to New Zealand, beyond just revenue collection. In conclusion, we believe that the current regime around PAYE and GST debt is sufficient and introducing director personal liability is likely to have far-reaching and unintended consequences outweighing any potentials benefits. We appreciate the opportunity to comment on behalf of our members. Yours sincerely Felicity Caird General Manager, Governance Leadership Centre Institute of Directors \[1\]

Why do Government employees pay Tax? This seems obvious, but why not just reduce your wages to net take home for all employees of the government (not gross), and then dont tax them. They are paid by the tax of those who DONT work for government, so their tax money just ends up back in the IRD to be used to pay them. A pointless act which needs people to administer it and that adds cost where no cost is needed.

Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. I submit that the Working Group recommend Lowering Company Taxes to increase the investment capital and therefore increase the number of people working or increase their wages which will improve the tax take over time. Taxes on savings You want to increase savings which in the long term will improve peoples lives. Also this money that people are saving has been taxed once at the point it was earnt. You should not tax savings if you want people to save, you are sending the wrong message. We are not stupid and know that there is not much point in saving as the government is just taxing this investment again and again. Environmental taxes There is absolutley no gain in sending money abroad to cut CO2 emissions. Firstly any money should be reinvested to cut down on or reuse waste in Newzealand. All you are doing is adding another tax burden on 2 people which you do not need, specially as you seem to have no interest in changing your wasteful habits whilst forcing us to change ours or pay. Behavioural taxes Add an extra tax to smokers to pay for medical costs. Or cut this completly. We all have our habits. change the systems so that if you have a particular habit you will have life long consequences. Take a leaf from the french governement, make it so our little excessess dont cost more than we can actually afford. Prohibition never worked and we fight it. Taxing this excessively just hurts the poor more, specially the children. They are the ones who dont get fed to feed their parents habits. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Just another tax. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Yours sincerely,

Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. This is especially so given (1) the high-inflation model that current government policies will create, and (2) already teachers, policemen, and nurses are in the top tax bracket that Sir Micheal infamouslly said was for "rich pricks". While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a t ax cut since Budget 2010: indeed this current current cancelled legislated tax cats. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth. I submit that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. Taxes on savings 2 With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity.

Indexing of Local Body rates. A critical part of taxation is fairness. I submit that by allowing local councils to increase their rates (an indirect tax, but still a tax!), every year by whatever level they can possibly squeeze, crush out of the ratepayer, central government is actively avoiding dealing with this critical tax related cost to householders and ratepayers. This is undeniably unfair! This is currently being done by quietly shifting central government burdens (housing, roading, transport, essential infrastructure etc) onto local bodies - and then allowing local bodies to charge what they can (Not what they NEED, but what they can), year after year after year. As I ma sure you are aware, rates increase over the CPI every single year - but pay rates do not! This needs to be addressed by central government NOW! Central government should legistlate to ensure that local bodies can ONLY increase rates by the CPI / Rate of inflation as an essential business discipline. To do otherwise, is to allow local bodies to continue to waste enormous sums of money, deliver ill defined and poorly planned services and products, increase their head counts without regard to costs, and as a result of poor business practices bleed their ratepayers dry at the same time. NO real business would operate in this manner. Councils have a totally capative audience who cannot "move to another supllier) and this monopoly position is abused by EVERY Council. Councils know that they can get away with charging whatever they want and NO ONE is empowered to stop them (And please dont argue that it is a democracy and we can vote them out - everyone KNOWS that the mandarins run the councils - NOT the councillors). As much as we want to "chuck the bums out", there is seemingly NO WAY to oust the council staff (from their excessively paid positions). By allowing local bodies to continue to mindlessly grind on with annually increasing rates over the CPI, without delivering ANY effeciencies, or new benefits to the ratepayers - all the while increasing what is an "indirect tax" is simply wrong, wrong , worng! Rates increases (again a "tax" on everybody) should be held to the rate of inflation and NO MORE! Legistation that requires Local bodies to only increase rates by the CPI must be considered as part of your tax working group deliberations and recommendations.

October 2018 New Zealand Shareholders Association Submission to Tax Working Group Relationship of Submitter The New Zealand Shareholders Association (NZSA) is the only nationwide organisation representing the retail investor “buy side” of the market. We are recognised as such by all market participants including MBIE, regulators and listed corporates. Our submission is written from the perspective of independent investors, many of whom hold shares in both New Zealand and offshore companies (primarily in Australia). Executive Summary Although NZSA understands the Governments desire for a Capital Gains Tax (CGT), the Tax Working Group (TWG) itself acknowledges that it is a particularly complicated tax to administer. A key feature of New Zealand’s tax legislation, which has been widely recognised and lauded over many years, has been its simplicity. Unfortunately, many of the possibilities canvassed in the Interim Report would result in this no longer being the case. The complexity of a CGT significantly reduces its efficiency owing to high compliance costs. The introduction of a CGT is also likely to decrease efficiencies in capital allocation, as investors focus on limiting the increased tax burden rather than looking to optimise their asset allocation. The reality is that heightened complexity will turn people away from the capital markets. We are particularly concerned with two aspects of the TWG interim report. • Firstly, there are some recommendations where “form takes precedence over substance” resulting in different outcomes for the same basic transaction. This is never good law and will result in poor compliance. • Secondly, the TWG interim report is seriously deficient in several important areas by failing to identify preferred options or even the options themselves. We are unsure how taxpayers and groups such as ourselves are expected to address what is in fact a fragmented and unfinished process. We are most concerned that this whole process is being rushed which undermines the opportunity for fully informed consultation. However, if the Tax Working Group (TWG) determines to proceed with recommending a CGT, despite its disadvantages and high costs, then we believe that share investment should be exempt as the capital component is in fact already taxed. This is explained further below. NZSA is strongly opposed to a CGT on unrealised assets, primarily due to the cash flow problems that would result for investors along with the recognition that unrealised gains can be transitory. Only realised gains should be liable. P 0800-6972-7478 | F 09-281 0297 | E admin@nzshareholders.co.nz | W www.nzshareholders.co.nz Postal Address| PO Box 2494, Shortland Street, Auckland 1010, New Zealand. There should be no exemptions, to ensure capital is not directed away from some areas to other less productive ones or to favour one type of vehicle over another. This will also require the inclusion of some asset classes that are proposed to be exempt. Matters such as the rate of any CGT, ring-fencing or roll-over provisions are either not aligned with overseas regimes or introduce further distortions and unfairness as currently proposed. We are concerned that direct investment in shares will be diverted to non-productive exempt vehicles. Not only will this result in limited CGT being paid but it may also deprive the capital markets of resources, resulting in sub optimal performance and leading to lower economic activity. The unintended consequence could be lower levels of revenue for the Government to either spend or redistribute, rather than the windfall gains expected. An absolute certainty if a CGT is introduced is that a whole industry will spring up to advise on compliance and avoidance. Not only is this an expensive waste of resources, but it will disproportionately benefit the very wealthy who will find ways around the tax to the detriment of the clear majority of investors who are simply trying to provide for a more comfortable retirement. If an additional tax on share investments is to be imposed, we believe that a Risk Free Return method tax would potentially be the most equitable and would be less likely to lead to unintended consequences. NZSA has made limited comment on environmental taxes and taxation of overseas entities as these are peripheral to our mandate. In both cases we urge that responses are proportionate based on a combination of proper cost benefit analysis, international best practice and recognition of New Zealand’s interests and sovereignty. Submission on Specific Matters. Capital Gains Tax on Shares. The NZSA is concerned that the push to introduce a capital gains tax to share transactions fails to acknowledge that gains on shares are not tax free. This is a fallacy for the following reasons: • Over time, a company’s share price will approximate the net present value of future cash flows i.e. free cash flow • Free cash flow is post tax cash flow • It is already accepted in the TWG interim report that double taxation should not happen. Imputation credits ensure that dividend income for shareholders doesn’t suffer this. • Capital gains for shares predominantly reflect after tax retained earnings and the future incremental after-tax earnings that are expected to be derived from these retained earnings. • Therefore, a CGT would represent a double taxation. The company will, as the cash flows arise, pay the tax. Any shareholder who sells his shares is in essence receiving post tax gains. As a result, we can see no reason why a discriminatory double taxation process masquerading as a CGT should be introduced on share transactions. The following notes are designed to address the most egregious consequences that might arise if a CGT is in fact recommended on shares once the currently incomplete TWG recommendations are finalised.

Capital Gains on Foreign Direct Investments We note the Group has acknowledged the current FDR at 5% is excessive in relation the reality of income or gains actually achieved. This illustrates the problems of setting an arbitrary rate (in this case in 2007) and not reviewing and adjusting the rate to take account of the changes in the business environment resulting in it becoming both inappropriate and, in this case, excessive and inequitable to the taxpayer. In addition, the complexity and high cost of complying with the existing FIF regime, especially for smaller portfolios is already a significant disincentive for investors to diversify. In addition, we observe that the current FIF regime allows for a $50,000 exemption. This exemption was set over a decade ago and is now too low. The level needs to be reviewed and updated and a higher threshold should also apply to a CGT if this is introduced. We are greatly concerned that if the FIF regime is maintained, the TWG plans to consider removing the “comparative value” option. We believe that this would be a backwards step that would unfairly penalise equity investors who invest in the knowledge that they will sometimes experience volatile returns. A “gains” style tax in years where investors have experienced capital losses is inequitable, harsh and is likely to discourage offshore investment. Investment in Australian Listed Companies New Zealand investors commonly invest in both New Zealand and Australian listed companies. The wider range of companies available on ASX allows for greater portfolio diversification. A disadvantage of investing in Australia is that, as a result of franking credits not being recognised, New Zealand investors are double taxed on dividend distributions. We are concerned that the impost of an additional tax, such as a capital gains tax, will unnecessarily discourage New Zealand investors from diversifying their investments to include ASX listed companies. Exemptions The TWG appears to favour an exemption for Kiwisaver, PIE Funds and possibly other managed funds. This would introduce a “form over substance” test which in our opinion would be bad law. The effect would be to force investors into vehicles that often have high costs relative to returns. The stated intention of the review is to remove incentives to invest in one form of asset over another. We submit that forcing investors to use managed funds by means of an exemption does exactly the opposite. In this case we would expect that an exemption equal to any benefit gained by managed funds should be available to direct investment in shares. The proposal to exempt some classes of asset such as collectibles is another example of the discriminatory nature of what is being proposed. A surge in this type of asset investment is inevitable, particularly by wealthier investors who do not require regular income, unlike most direct share investors who seek income (which is taxed) to supplement their retirement. Roll-over Relief P 0800-6972-7478 | F 09-281 0297 | E admin@nzshareholders.co.nz | W www.nzshareholders.co.nz Postal Address| PO Box 2494, Shortland Street, Auckland 1010, New Zealand. We are similarly concerned at suggestions for roll-over relief should be available to certain types of managed funds but not to individual direct investors. Again, this would introduce a “form over substance” test which in our opinion would be bad law. It would likely have the effect of forcing people into high cost managed funds rather than allowing the most efficient use of capital. Rate of Capital Gains Tax We are minded that other jurisdictions apply a lower Capital Gains Tax rate than the full marginal tax rate as recommended in the Report. For example, the US taxes short term capital gains at the ordinary income tax rate, but long-term capital gains are taxed at around 50% of the ordinary rate. A single taxpayer with income between US$38,000 and US$425,000 is taxed at a flat 15% on long term capital gains. CGT on Unrealised Gains We note with concern a suggestion that an unrealised capital gains tax in some form could be applied annually rather than the option of a tax being applied only to realised capital gains. We believe that this would be unfair and inequitable. It would potentially lead to taxpayers being forced to sell down part of their portfolio to pay the tax. It would inevitably lead some taxpayers to invest into a CGT exempt asset (such as the family home or collectibles) resulting in limited tax revenue being realised. Forcing the sale of some assets for other than sound commercial reasons is again the opposite of the stated intention to remove incentives for some assets at the expense of others. Ring Fencing The proposal that all capital gains should be taxable in full at the time the liability arises, but that capital losses should be ringfenced against future capital gains is completely unfair. The TWG characterises CGT as simply taxing “alternatively derived income”. In that case, taxable income must include earned income and capital gains realised, less expenses to earn that income and capital losses realised. No other option than allowing capital losses, as well as gains, at the time they arise meets the criteria. Risk Free Return Method If an additional tax on share investment is to be introduced, NZSA considers that the most equitable form, with the lowest likelihood of unintended consequences might be the introduction of a risk free return (RFRM) based tax covering domestic and offshore listed share investments. A RFRM tax would be more predictable for investors and, as a result, would be easier to plan and budget for than a standard CGT on either realised or unrealised gains. A RFRM tax could also replace the FIF regime which would then result in a standard approach being applied to all share investments. Capital Gains on Listed Debt Trading The law currently addresses this issue with all gains whether from interest income or gains on sale being taxable at marginal rates. Environmental Taxes We believe any environmental taxes should be a balanced and proportionate response to clearly defined issues. They must be justified on the basis that the cost will result in at least an equal benefit. They should P 0800-6972-7478 | F 09-281 0297 | E admin@nzshareholders.co.nz | W www.nzshareholders.co.nz Postal Address| PO Box 2494, Shortland Street, Auckland 1010, New Zealand. avoid unintended consequences. They should not just be imposed to placate international pressures but must recognise New Zealand’s sovereignty. They should recognise New Zealand has a low-level contribution to global carbon emissions. They should not produce unreasonable negative economic and social outcomes. Taxes raised should be used to address the specific environmental issues identified not diverted to other areas. Nor should carbon trading schemes, that simply transfer poor environmental outcomes from one jurisdiction to another without actually reducing emissions, be countenanced. International Income Tax. NZSA acknowledge the Groups comments at Chapter 11 and its recommendations that the Government continues to participate in OECD discussions on the future of the international tax framework. We support the recommendation that the Government be ready to implement an equalisation tax if a critical mass of other countries (including Australia) move in that direction. We also support the recommendation that the Government ensures, to the extent possible, that our double tax agreements and trade agreements do not restrict our taxation options in these matters. We are however mindful that there is significant public disquiet that international companies appear to pay very little income tax in relation to the revenue they derive in New Zealand. We are also aware that international companies can use various devices such as intellectual property charges, service agreements and transfer pricing to avoid the same tax impost as a locally based company. We are concerned that these may be artificial in some cases and bear no relation to the realty of the situation. We believe that to ensure the integrity of the tax system and demonstrate to New Zealand tax payers that the tax system is even handed, the Government must take the appropriate steps to address the current situation.

Equality Network response to the Interim Report of the Tax Working Group 30 th October 2018 About the Equality Network The Equality Network is a non-partisan network of organisations working to improve the well-being of all New Zealanders by reducing income inequality. The aim of the Network is to enhance and support member organisations as they work for a fairer New Zealand. The Network aims to act as a “hub” for information sharing and communication for groups aiming to reduce inequality in New Zealand. There are currently 39 groups participating in the network. See our website www.equalitynetwork.org.nz for more details. Contact person for these comments is Equality Network Coordinator, Rae Julian info@equalitynetwork.org.nz Summary The Equality Network welcomes the Tax Working Group’s (TWG) Interim Report and acknowledges the depth of analysis undertaken to this point. The report shows that the TWG have done much work to review the many thousands of comments and submissions received. These comments by the Equality Network draw on the key messages called for in our 2017 Election Statement 1 . The immediate changes the Equality Network is calling for are for the rebalancing of income and wealth to promote a decent life for everyone: • Income for all that provides the necessities of life, including fairer income support. • A tax on very high levels of wealth and higher top tax rates on the highest incomes to ensure everyone contributes their fair share and enable our families and whanau to thrive. Inequality and Tax: The Equality Network welcomes the strong emphasis in the Interim Report on reducing inequality and imbalances in the system. The report acknowledges that tax plays a critical role in reducing inequality. However, while there are worthy measures in the report, more needs to be done to create a coherent system to reduce inequality. The Equality Network recommends that the TWG set out more clearly in its final report how the changes being proposed to the tax system will help reduce inequality. New Zealand currently rates lowly for the redistributive effect of the tax system. The final report should include proposals for goals to reduce inequality, such as New Zealand being among the most equal countries in the OECD. Reducing Tax on Lower Incomes: The Equality Network is pleased that the TWG is considering reducing income tax rates for lower and middle income earners. This will help reduce income inequality. But further measures should include a steeper progressive tax scale, with more tax on very high incomes (e.g. over $150,000). While an increase in higher income taxes is not included in 1 Equality Network 2017 Election Statement http://www.equalitynetwork.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Equality- Network-final-statement-backgrounder-Jul2017.pdf the TWG Terms of Reference, an analysis of options for tax on higher incomes should be included in an Appendix covering options for future consideration. Tax on Capital Income: The Equality Network would also like to see all income, regardless of source, taxed. This would be a real step forwards towards a truly fair tax system. It is good that the TWG is considering a more comprehensive tax on capital income. It is not clear from the analysis provided in the Interim Report how far such an approach would reach in taxing the currently un-taxed wealth gains enjoyed by a relatively small group of the wealthiest in our country. The Equality Network recommends that the final report of TWG include a detailed analysis assessing the proportion of current wealth holdings would be reached by the proposed tax compared to the reach of existing tax settings. Wealth Tax and Financial Transaction Tax: It is disappointing that the Interim Report already rules out further consideration of a net wealth tax and a financial transactions tax. This misses a vital opportunity to explore ways to reduce inequality, widen the tax base and strengthen the sustainability of tax revenue in the future by taxing areas not currently taxed and that are likely to continue to grow and become more important in the future. The Equality Network recommends that the TWG in its final report includes a recommendation to further explore the introduction of a net wealth tax in this country. The TWG has not followed the recommendation from the OECD that countries such as New Zealand that do not have other forms of wealth tax such as estate and gift duties should consider a net wealth tax. The TWG in its interim report has also ruled out further work on a financial transactions tax for New Zealand, despite acknowledging that such taxes generate reasonable revenue in other countries and would contribute to a more progressive tax system. The Equality Network urges the TWG to change this and recommend that an active work programme be established to design a workable financial transactions tax for further consultation. GST on Financial Services: The Interim Report does not recommend extending GST to include financial services, despite acknowledging an “in principle case” for doing this and that it would help make the tax system more progressive. The initial conclusion that there is no feasible means for doing this seems at odds with the options considered such as a financial activities tax (FAT) that do seem feasible or at the very least need further investigation. The Equality Network urges the final report to include a recommendation to explore and consult on a process for including GST on financial services. Tax and Benefit System Interface: The Equality Network would like to see a deeper consideration of the links between the tax system and welfare, including secondary employment taxes and the abatement of benefits once a certain income level is reached. The Interim Report has specifically excluded further discussion of a number of issues on the basis that they will be covered by the work of the Welfare Advisory Group (WEAG). Child support, abatement rates for benefits, thresholds for access to Working For Families tax credits and other assistance are all issues that impact low and middle income earners and the TWG needs to commit to shared work with the WEAG to ensure that the final reports of both working groups adequately address this vitally important area. The Equality Network urges the TWG to include specific ideas and initial analysis in the appendix to the final report and/or clear information about the analysis being provided to the WEAG to help it address these issues in its final report next year.

Very gratefully received from the team and myself at BDO. In light of the discussion, I thought I would take the opportunity to quickly highlight some comments (I can’t necessarily write for all, but will myself) in relation to a CGT: 1. Appreciate that CGT should not be applied retrospectively and that to achieve this is a revaluation of the base cost of assets to market value (where market value exceeds cost) at a certain date. However, there are concerns with the practicality of this approach; particularly given it is probable Inland Revenue will require documentary evidence of valuations within a specified timeframe (perhaps within six months of year-end). Is this realistically achievable? Apologies, no other solution at this stage other than voicing a concern. \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 2 2. With Inheritance Tax being “off the table”, how do you deal with death and a realised CGT? Do we effectively need a IHT backstop to CGT to achieve desired objectives, or is death another form of rollover? Yet more complexity and concern that IHT will effectively be introduced by stealth. 3. I appreciate your comments re: DTAs etc, however is there any merit in considering a “xenophobic” CGT for non-resident owners? Or at least a CGT that applies to non-resident owners who suffer a CGT in their country of domestic tax residence? These are my very quick thoughts. I will canvass the Group to see if there are any more comments to make, acknowledging that you are working with very tight timeframes.

Hon Todd McClay Minister for Stated Owned Enterprises February 2016 Introduction Thank you for the opportunity to make a Submission in response to the Interim Report of 20 September 2018. 1 I am making this further Submission as I believe that the Tax Working Group (TWG) has been mislead in its reliance on the Australian Henry Review concerning the charitable purposes exemption from income tax and commercial activities, and has failed to take into consideration the views of many tax experts in New Zealand, beginning with the Ross Committee in 1969, as well as English case law from the 1920s. A summary of the tax reviews is included at Appendix 1. Further, the specific issue is that of the unrelated trading by charities, one which was resolved in England in the 1920s, where a pragmatic approach is now taken based on the scale of 1 Tax Working Group, “Future of Tax Interim Report” (Interim Report) (20 September 2018) at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax-interim-report . \[1\] 2 commercial operations in order that small scale businesses operated by charities are not unduly disadvantaged, as described in the author’s Submission of 30 April 2018 to the TWG. The author’s opinion on this issue can be summarised as follows: • Previous tax reviews have argued for the taxation of commercial activities undertaken by charities (see Appendix 1); • The issue, based on tax policies developed in England, concerns trading activities that are unrelated to the charitable purposes of the entity and are therefore liable to income tax; • The ability to accumulate cash is a direct consequence of not having to pay income tax and provides an entity with a clear advantage over a competitor that is an income tax- payer; • The underlying issue, which dates from Adam Smith is unchanged – that of equity and fairness in tax policy; • The Income Tax Act 2007 already contains provisions that allows companies and Maori Authorities to claim donations to donee organisations, of which registered tax charities are a subset, to the extent of their taxable income as deductible items thereby reducing their income tax obligations. Requiring charity-related companies to conform does not create any additional compliance costs, and no more than any other company that already makes such donations, currently at a cost to the revenue currently forecast for the 2017/2018 year at $15 million. 2 • This issue is one that needs to be addressed through the Select Committee process in order that those with an interest can exercise their democratic right to be heard. • Had previous Governments taken the advice of tax experts since 1969 this situation would have been resolved long ago. • It is only through the Charities Act 2005 that the public can now see the effect of this failure of tax policy given that in order to be exempt from income tax charities are required to file annual returns and financial statements which has exposed the extent of this failure to public and media scrutiny. 2 Treasury, “2018 Tax Expenditure Statement” (17 May 2018) at 5 at https://treasury.govt.nz. 3 What is “unrelated trading?” To explain what the author means by “unrelated trading,” the sale in 2015 to a Chinese buyer, Kiwi Forests Investment Limited which is owned by Golden World International Limited, Hong Kong, of 2,366 ha of forestry blocks in the Waiararapa by the Schools Amalgamated Forest Trust (the Trust) for $17 million is a useful example. 3 We begin with the Pemsel classifications: relief of poverty, advancement of education, advancement of religion, and trusts for other purposes beneficial to the community. 4 As Christ’s College was the majority holder in the Trust we will discuss this issue in relation to Christ’s. Christ’s College charitable purposes fall squarely under the advancement of education. If, as part of the College’s curriculum, young men were taught about silviculture (the growing and cultivation of trees), both in the classroom and in the forest (albeit that the forest is in the North Island), that is clearly the advancement of education and therefore is a related purpose. On the other hand, if the sole purpose of the forest was to grow high-grade pinus radiata for commercial profit, in competition with other forestry operations, that is not a related purpose of which the net profits should ultimately be liable to income tax. To mitigate that income tax liability the trading entity can choose the extent to which it wishes to make donations to the College and other members of the Trust, thus making a commercial decision about what funds to retain for the ongoing viability of the forest without jeopardising the business activity. 3 LINZ, “Case 201420053 – Kiwi Forests Investment Limited” at www.linz.govt.nz.

This situation suggests two questions. Was this land purchased with the intention of resale, thus triggering a tax liability? What has happened to the 310 ha of land that was not sold to Kiwi Forests Investments Limited which, based on the rate per hectare for the land that was sold, would have been worth $2.2 million? The financial statements for the Trust clearly demonstrate that this was a commercial undertaking for profit and had nothing whatsoever to do with advancing education. Concerns regarding the Interim Report Passive investments The opinion of the Interim Report about passive income is interesting. As at 5 October, data from Charities Services reported cash and bank balances of $6 billion, and investments of $14 billion, in round figures $20 billion. By way of example, one national charity holds in excess of $60 million, yet spends an average of $2.5 million annually on its main charitable purpose of medical research while each year continuing to generate significant net surpluses from its donors and at the same time increasing its investment holdings. While those funds are understandably invested, income from its New Zealand investments, as with all charities, benefit from an exemption from Resident Withholding Tax (RWT). Further, where a separate charitable trust has been established solely for the purpose of investing funds why should those funds not be liable to income tax given that such an activity is clearly not consistent with the Pemsel concepts? The author is aware that some charities set up a second trust solely for the purpose of investing donations and bequests received, then drip- feeding funds to the operating arm of the charity. However, people donate in the expectation 5 Schools Amalgamated Forest Trust, 256321 at www.societies.govt.nz. 6 Schools Amalgamated Forest Trust CC48330 at www.charities.govt.nz. 7 Schools Amalgamated Forest Trust, above n 6. 8 Schools Amalgamated Forest Trust, above n 6, Statement of Financial Position as at 30 June 2014. 5 that their contributions will be applied to charitable purposes, not invested in perpetuity, unless they explicitly make such a provision as a condition of the gift. Reserves policies The author notes and agrees with the view of the TWG “that some charities may have good reasons to accumulate funds.” 9 The failure this time is not in tax legislation, but of the Charities Act 2005 which, unlike its counterpart in the UK, does not require trustees to provide a written publicly available document that explains the trustees –not the chief executive - reserves policies in detail. For example, the charity mentioned above has no publicly available document that explains why its $60 million of investments have accumulated year-on-year for many years, yet expenditure on medical research has remained virtually constant, while at the same time still expecting donors to continue making contributions – which may also qualify for tax credits. This raises another issue in that tax credits are a direct cost to the revenue –currently $258 million 10 – so the taxpayer has subsidised donations that have been banked, not applied to the purposes for which the charity solicited the funds in the first place. Charities do not, as far as the author is aware, solicit funds purely on the basis to build up investments for a rainy day in the future, which may or may not eventuate. The failure to provide Charities Services with its current reserves policy every year regarding accumulated funds should render a charity liable to income tax on the income from the invested funds on the grounds that the funds, having already been subsidised by other taxpayers through refundable tax credits and RWT exemptions, have not been applied to charitable purposes. Competitive neutrality To conflate the taxation of passive income with income from unrelated commercial trading income, on the basis that if passive income is income tax exempt therefore so should trading income also be exempt, is wrong. 11 Charities have a choice – opportunity cost – invest, trade, or apply funds to their charitable purposes. That choice should be influenced by tax policy, not the other way round: either apply the funds to charitable purposes and be exempt from income tax, or be liable to income tax on income from unrelated investment or trading activities. 9 Interim Report, above n 1, cl 17 at 121. 10 Treasury, above n 2 at 5. 11 Interim Report, above n 1, cl. 14 at 120. 6 Commercial trading activities The author argues that the Henry Review was in error in stating that “\[income\] tax concessions do not confer a competitive advantage.” 12 In recent years, the author has been contacted by a number of businesses, large and small, who claim that their very survival is being affected by the unfair advantage conferred on their income tax exempt competitors. One prominent business operator wrote to the National government about the impact on their long-established family business by an income tax exempt competitor, only to be rebuffed. The author is not at liberty to identify those businesses and individuals publicly because of their fear of repercussions, the most serious and disappointing one being racist accusations of Maori bashing. It is a sad day in New Zealand when a tax policy cannot be openly discussed because of such accusations. Note in particular the opinion of the 1998 Report of the Committee of Experts on Tax compliance in 1998. 13 The report noted that (emphasis added): 14 \[b\]usiness income derived by charities is exempt from tax under section CB 4(1)(e). However, some charities may engage in business activities unrelated to the charitable purpose for which they are provided a tax exemption. This exemption gives charities a competitive advantage over taxpaying business competitors. The report recommended that (emphasis added): 15 the government should review the tax treatment of charities and other tax-exempt entities that engage in commercial activities unrelated to their purposes. No reason exists in principle why business income, unrelated to the core purpose, should not be taxed. This Report, echoing the philosophy of English tax law, states explicitly that “\[n\]o reason exists in principle why business income, unrelated to the core purpose, should not be taxed.” The opinions in the Henry Review were not based “in principle,” no doubt having been influenced by charity businesses that would have been disadvantaged if required to pay income tax, which is not based in tax policy, of which the underlying concept is one of equity and fairness. The author suspects, that many of those businesses are operated by faith-based charities which have 12 Interim Report, above n 1, cl. 13 at 120. 13 Rt Hon Sir Ian McKay, Tony Molloy , John Prebble, and John Waugh, “Tax Compliance A Report to the Treasurer and Minister of Revenue by a Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance” (December 1998). 14 McKay, above n 50 at §4.16. 15 McKay, above n 50 at §4.17. 7 significant influence over politicians. The Catholic Church allegedly holds in excess of $30 billion across Australia, and benefits from “exemptions from almost all forms of taxation \[with\] minimal public accountability.” 16 This also explains why faith-based charities are exempt from filing with the Australian charities regulator, the Australian Commission for Nonprofits and Charities (ACNC): “\[i\]n terms of accountability, main churches were able to get a concession from the government when it enacted the \[ACNC\] Act so that it’s subject to much less reporting, if the entity qualifies as a basic religious charity.” 17 The author notes and agrees with the opinion of the TWG that “\[o\]n the other hand, a charitable business that does not distribute its income will be able to accumulate capital faster than an equivalent tax-paying business.” 18 The author also agrees with the TWG “that the accumulated assets and income of all charitable businesses and charitable organisations should be used for charitable purposes in order to qualify for the \[income\] tax exemption.” 19 The key word that is missing from that statement is “related’ – ie “related charitable purposes.” Further, it should not be accepted as an intention that at some time in the distant future that a company will be wound up and its proceeds distributed to charitable purposes in order to qualify for an income tax exemption today. An omission from the Interim Report It is interesting that while the Interim Report refers to the Henry Review, 20 no mention is made in the Interim Report of the 2008 case, Word Investments, which confirmed the income tax exemption of trading by Australian charities, with the Henry Review noting that “\[t\]he High Court of Australia’s decision in the Word Investments case has significantly increased the scope for NFP organisations to undertake commercial activities.” 21 This was an issue that Henry Review considered that the establishment of a national charities commission would address by monitoring, regulating and providing advice to the sector. 22 After referring to “Samuelson’s 16 Royce Millar, Ben Schneiders and Chris Vedalago, “Catholic Church’s massive wealth revealed” (12 February 2018) at www.smh.com.au. 17 Emily Boruke, “Catholic Church national wealth estimated to be $30 billion, investigation funds” (12 February 2018) at www.abc.net.au. 18 Interim Report, above n 1, cl. 14 at 120. 19 Interim Report, above n 1, cl. 16 at 121. 20 Ken Henry et al, “Australia’s Future Tax System Report to the Treasurer” (Henry Review) (December 2009) at http://taxreview.treasury.gov.au. 21 Henry Review, above note 20 at B3 Tax concessions for not-for-profit organisations. 22 Henry review, above n 21 at B3. 8 invariant valuations theorem,” a textbook theory which few people other than economists have probably ever heard of, the Henry Review found that “NFP income tax concessions do not generally violate the principle of competitive neutrality where NFP organisations operate in commercial markets.” 23 This is where the author considers the Henry Review to be flawed. Tax policy is not about “competitive neutrality.” It is solely about equity and fairness. As noted by Kirby J. (dissenting) in Word Investments: “\[i\]f the economic transfer costs of the exemption for ‘charitable’ and ‘religious institutions’ have divided the Parliament and official inquiries in the past, it is little wonder that courts, including this Court, have also been divided in such cases.” 24 The author also disagrees with the judgment in Word Investments in which it is notable that the one dissenting decision of Kirby J explains why such trading should be liable to income tax. A summary of the key points made by Kirby J is provided at Appendix 2, but notably (emphasis added): • “First, there is the need to avoid an abuse of claims to be a ‘charitable institution’ and the potential misuse of such claims for the purposes of tax avoidance. Secondly, there is a legitimate concern of competitors operating in the same market as the actual business operations of Word. By linking the business operations of Word with the ‘charitable purposes’ of Wycliffe or Wycliffe International, Word is allegedly afforded an unfair economic advantage that its competitors ... do not enjoy.” \[170\] • “\[T\[he real discrimen for the characterisation of an entity propounded as a ‘charitable institution’ is what that entity actually does and what purposes it actually pursues.” \[174\] • “ .... It is obvious to me that Word’s own activities were not themselves charitable. What was charitable was the ultimate proposed destination of the profits that Word derived from its investment and commercial funeral business activities.” \[177\] • “ ... the unrelatedness of a revenue-raising activity, for ‘charitable purposes,’ will deprive the entity of characterisation as a ‘charitable institution’.” \[180\]. To rephrase Gonthier J in a Canadian case cited by Kirby J: Is the pursuit of purposes still a means to the fulfilment of the organization’s primary purposes, or have they become an end in itself? 25 The author suggests that in most cases in New Zealand, they are an end in themselves. 23 Henry Review, above n 20, B3-2 Existing NFP tax concesions and regulatory arrangements are complex. 24 M.J. Gousmett, “Charities and business activities” NZLJ (March 2009) 57 – 60 at 58. 25 Kirby J at \[186\] citing Gonthier J in Vancouver Society of Immigrant and Visible Minority Women v Minister of National Revenue \[1999\] 1 SCR 10 at 44-45. 9 Even past governments in New Zealand from many years ago have recognised the unfairness in operating commercial activity in competition with the private sector. More recently, as stated in a letter from the Hon Todd McClay to the author: 26 \[v\]arious sections of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA) define the taxation obligation of public authorities. \[Certain\] State enterprises and mixed-ownership enterprises are excluded from the public authorities exemption in the ITA. ... \[T\]his is because as commercial trading enterprises, which often compete with privately owned companies, the general principle is that they should be subject to tax on their income in the same way that private companies are, despite being owned by the Crown. If this is the case then should this principle not also apply to commercial activities that are unrelated to charitable purposes? Alternatively, why should the rules being stated by the TWG not apply to those government-owned enterprises by also exempting them from income tax? Why should there be two sets of rules concerning the taxation of commercial entities being operated by government on the one hand and the charity sector on the other? Case Study: Ngai Tahu Charitable Group In the author’s previous Submission to the TWG he chose not to name charities, but in order to further explain his thinking it is now necessary to do so through using Ngai Tahu Charitable Group by way of a case study. The author begins by acknowledging the impressive commercial successes achieved by Ngai Tahu following its Treaty of Waitangi settlement and acknowledge that this ongoing success is beneficial to its 61,000 registered members. 27 This is not a case of “Maori-bashing,” as Ngai Tahu have suggested in the media in the past, but is one of a failure of tax policy given that at the time that the charitable purposes exemption from income tax was introduced into law, the scale of such operations was likely unforeseen by Parliament. Recently the Press reported on Ngai Tahu’s announcements of its financial performance for the year ended 30 June 2018. 28 However, in the past Ngai Tahu have not filed their results until December each year, therefore the author does not have access to that information and can only rely on the Press report for the purposes of this Submission. 26 Hon Todd McClay, Private correspondence concerning SOE’s to the author, (29 February 2016). 27 Chris Hutching, “Ngai Tahu posts $150m profit, grows cautious” Press (26 October) at 21. 28 Hutching, above n 27 10 Rather confusingly, the Press reported two different profit figures, one of $150 million and a second of $273.2 million, which includes the recent $190 million Treaty settlement top-up. The Press also reported that a “dividend” of $61 million had been returned to the 61,000 registered Ngai Tahu members – an average of only $1,000 per member. Using that information, had Ngai Tahu’s companies paid that sum as a deductible donation to the Ngai Tahu Charitable Trust, Ngai Tahu would have contributed between $6 million and $24.9 million to the government’s revenue base while still retaining sufficient funds for the further development of its business empire (see below). However, that is not the case, and Ngai Tahu have instead benefited to an even greater extent from the full income tax exemption of between $23 million and $42 million. Profits retained, due to being exempt from income tax and after “providing a dividend of $61 million for cultural, social and economic programmes for the 61,000 registered members,” 29 (an average of $1,000 per member), will be between $21.2 million and $89 million. The Press ran another story about Ngai Tahu’s successes only a few days later, about Ngai Tahu Farming’s many activities throughout the South Island. This makes for impressive reading and person who was not familiar with Ngai Tahu would have no idea that Ngai Tahu Farming is one of the iwi’s 39 tax charities which are registered with Charities Services with a collective net worth of in excess of $1 billion as at 30 June 2017. Ngai Tahu Farming Limited is wholly owned by Ngai Tahu Corporation Limited which in turn is owned by Ngai Tahu Charitable Trust, the sole trustee being TRONT – Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu – as corporate trustee. 29 Chris Hutching, above n 27. 11 Ngai Tahu as reported in Press 26 October 2018 Dividend 61,000,000 Registered members 61,000 Average per member 1,000 Tax effect if Ngai Tahu's companies claimed donations as deductible item Net profit 150,000,000 Donations to NTCT 61,000,000 Donations claimed as deductible items Profit before tax 89,000,000 Tax at 28% 24,920,000 Contribution to society Retained profits 64,080,000 Profit after tax 273,200,000 Australia/Maori Authority tax Less top-up 190,000,000 83,200,000 Less Donation to NTCT 61,000,000 Donations claimed as deductible items Profit before tax 22,200,000 Tax at 28% 6,216,000 Contribution to society Retained profits 15,984,000 Loss to IR under the present regime Net profit 150,000,000 Donations to NTCT 0 No donations claimed as deductions Profit before tax 150,000,000 Tax at 28% 42,000,000 Income tax forgone - subsidised by society Retained profits 108,000,000 Profit after tax 273,200,000 Australia/Maori Authority tax Less top-up 190,000,000 83,200,000 Less Donation to NTCT 0 No donations claimed as deductions Profit before tax 83,200,000 Tax at 28% 23,296,000 Income tax forgone - subsidised by society Retained profits 59,904,000 12 Appendix 1 Taxation Reviews Report of the Taxation Review Committee (Ross Committee) (1967) Report of the Taxation Review Committee. 30 It is in keeping with our recommendations regarding the taxation of business profits of other exempt organisations \[ie trading charities\] that veterinary and other similar clubs and societies or associations should be subject to tax on the profits derived from trading activities. Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform (McCaw Report) (1982) The Report of the Tax Force on Tax Reform, 31 chaired by P.M. McCaw (McCaw Report), whose Terms of Reference required the Task Force amongst other requirements “\[t\]o undertake a thorough and systematic review of all aspects of central government.” 32 However, at Chapter 12 the Task Force gave consideration to life insurance and superannuation, building societies, co-operatives, and charitable organisations. 33 The Task Force recognised that “\[b\]ased on information made available \[to the Task Force\], the cost of business incentives in revenue forgone is in the vicinity of $470 million per annum,” with a “strong” recommendation that those incentives “be subject to a rigorous assessment of costs and effectiveness on a regular basis.” 34 The Task Force “further recommend\[ed\] a more explicit accounting of all concessions and incentives to improve government management procedures in this area.” 35 In this regard, the Task Force also discussed the concept of tax expenditure budgeting, noting that in order “\[t\]o meet the fundamental objectives of government accountability and \[to achieve\] efficient and effective management, requires, as a first step, more explicit accounting of the cost of tax expenditures and their allocation (where possible) to the government’s economic and social programmes.” 36 Of significance is the observation by the Task Force that “\[b\]ecause they 30 The Taxation Review Committee, “Taxation in New Zealand Report of the Taxation Review Committee” (October 1967) Wellington, R.E.

The term “tax expenditure” is a concept created by former United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Policy, Stanley Surrey, which The Budget Reform Act of 1974 defined as “\[t\]hose revenue losses attributable to the provisions of the Federal tax laws which allow a special exclusion, exemption, or deduction from gross income or which provide special credit, a preferential rate 13 escape effective government control, tax expenditures seem to be more difficult to terminate.” 37 Further, the Task Force also considered that “concessions intended to act as incentives ... \[that are\] provided through the tax system \[are\] inefficient.” 38 Regarding the income tax exemption of commercial activities undertaken by charities within the same sector as income tax liable for-profit entities, the Task Force recommended that while charitable organisations should be permitted to undertake their traditional fundraising activities, at the same time the government should “minimise” the scope for avoidance and reduce the advantages which accrue to income-tax exempt charities which operate in competition with taxable businesses. 39 It must not be overlooked that “both the Ross Committee \[1967\] and the McCaw Report \[1982\] suffered from the same major disability: “the lack of relevant data,” with the McCaw committee being “both surprised and frustrated by the lack of reasonably up-to-date statistical information which could be made available to \[the committee\].” 40 Government Economic Statement (1987) In 1987, the Minister of Finance, Roger Douglas, released his alternative economic statement 41 in which he proposed a raft of controversial measures, including the taxation of charities. 42 Amongst other measures, Douglas proposed the removal of personal tax rebates and deductions, 43 alternative funding support for charitable activities, 44 a reduction in the company tax rate, 45 the taxation of superannuation funds, life offices and related organisations, 46 measures to eliminate tax avoidance and to broaden the tax base by introducing a tougher international tax regime, taxing exempt organisations at normal rates and a new petroleum mining tax regime. 47 Douglas specifically targeted charities and sporting bodies, mutual associations, primary producer co-operative companies, primary producer and marketing of tax, or a deferral of tax liability ... .” Stanley S.

However, some charities may engage in business activities unrelated to the charitable purpose for which they are provided a tax exemption. This exemption gives charities a competitive advantage over taxpaying business competitors. The report recommended that (emphasis added): 52 the government should review the tax treatment of charities and other tax-exempt entities that engage in commercial activities unrelated to their purposes. No reason exists in principle why business income, unrelated to the core purpose, should not be taxed. The committee made reference to the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) regime applied in the United States and suggested that “\[t\]he government may wish to refer to the relevant United States legislation in designing rules for New Zealand.” 53 Tax Review 2001 (McLeod Report) The report in October 2001 54 In its submission, the New Zealand Business Roundtable of the report noted that: 55 \[i\]n particular, the pattern of domestic investment is distorted by significant differences in the effective marginal tax rates applying to income from alternative investments. Those differences in effective marginal tax rates arise from: • differences in the tax treatment of different forms of income • ... 48 Douglas, above n 41 Annex 5 at 33-37. 49 Douglas, above n 41 at 33. 50 Rt Hon Sir Ian McKay, Tony Molloy , John Prebble, and John Waugh, “Tax Compliance A Report to the Treasurer and Minister of Revenue by a Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance” (December 1998). 51 McKay, above n 50 at §4.16. 52 McKay, above n 50 at §4.17. 53 McKay, above n 50 at §4.19. 54 Rob McLeod (Chair), David Patterson, Shirley Jones, Srikanta Chatterjee, and Edward Sieper, “Tax Review 2001” (available at www.treasury.govt.nz). 55 New Zealand Business Roundtable, “Submission on the Tax Review 2001) (March 2001) at 49 at http://nzinitiative.org.nz. 15 • Differences in the income tax treatment of different entities (e.g. Maori Authorities, qualifying companies, mutual associations and cooperatives, and charities) ... Further, the authors noted that: 56 \[s\]ome of these differences are due to practical problems associated with the assessment and collection of tax on certain types of activities ... other differences are due to explicit decisions made by past governments to use the tax system as a means of encouraging certain ‘desirable’ activities and discouraging certain ‘undesirable’ activities. Unfortunately, it is not clear to what extent the concessional tax treatment of certain activities is due to the practical difficulties associated with taxing those activities as opposed to a deliberate decision by the government to assist or deter certain activities. ... We believe the Review has an important role to play in affirming the view that the tax system should, as far as feasible, tax all activities and classes of entities on a neutral basis. It should also identify those activities that are currently subject to concessional tax treatment and determine the extent to which those concessions arise from either explicit government policies aimed at subsidising particular activities or entities, or practical income measurement problems. Tax and Charities (2001) The 2001 report “Tax and Charities” focussed specifically on the non-profit sector, making some interesting comments made concerning the income tax exemption, trading by charities, and tax policy. 57 While the issue of competitive advantage was raised, the final price of products was competitive with for-profits, therefore pricing was not the issue. 58 The issue, it was suggested, was the competitive advantage a charity could gain through the ability to accumulate tax-free profits thus enabling “a faster accumulation of funds \[which would allow it\] to expand more rapidly than its competitors.” 59 This was “the real competitive advantage that trading activities owned by charities have over their competitors.” 60 On that basis the Discussion Paper proposed that “\[t\]rading operations owned by charities would be subject to tax in the same way as other businesses, but with an unlimited deduction for distributions made to relevant charitable purposes.” 61 Ultimately, it was not until 2007 when the new concessions for charitable giving by donors, companies and Maori Authorities were 56 New Zealand Business Roundtable, above n 55 at 49. 57 Policy Advice Division, Inland Revenue Department. “Tax and Charities – A government discussion document on taxation issues relating to charities and non-profit bodies” (June 2001) at www.ird.govt.nz. 58 Tax and Charities, above n 57 at §9.2 – §9.5. 59 Tax and Charities, above n 57 at §9.6. 60 Tax and Charities, above n 57 at §9.6. 61 Tax and Charities, above n 57 at §9.7. 16 adopted by the removal of the caps on donations and deductions. 62 However, the issue of taxing the trading activities of charities was not pursued further by the government. 62 See Taxation (Business Taxation and Remedial Matters) Act 2007 (19 December 2007) No 109. 17 Appendix 2 Summary of key points by Kirby J in Word Investments • Wycliffe Bible Translators (Australia) was endorsed by the ATO from 1 July 2000 as an income tax exempt charity under subdiv 50-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) \[12\]. • Word Investments Limited was founded by members closely associated with Wycliffe who wanted to use Word to raise money in Australia and give it to Wycliffe for the carrying out of its purposes, which, at least to some degree, are fulfilled overseas. \[2\]. • Word gives it profits (less sums retained by it) to Wycliffe and other similar Christian organisations \[for their charitable purposes\]. \[3\]. • Word was incorporated under the Companies Act 1961 (Vic) on 8 August 1975 as a company limited by guarantee. \[3\]. • From about 1986, Word began to accept deposits from members of the public. Depositors received little or no interest, but Word invested the money at commercial rates of interest. • Between 1996 and 2002, Word operated a business of conducting funerals, not all of Christians, for profit. \[5\]. • Word’s profits generated from its investment business and the funeral business were sued to support Christina activities in the form of Bible translation and missionary work largely carried out by Wycliffe and other bodies to whom the non-retained profits were given. \[5\] • On 2 May 2001, the Commissioner declined Word’s application for endorsement as exempt from income tax on the basis that “\[c\]ommercial enterprise charities are not considered to be charities. This is the case irrespective of whether charitable consequences flow from the entity’s activities.” \[7\]. • During the hearing, the Commissioner argued that “there was no nexus between the profit and the effectuation of a charitable purpose.” \[36\]. • Kirby J. (dissenting 4:1): It was “agreed that, generally, the taxation legislation in issue here was written against the background of the Statute of Elizabeth \[1601\] and Pemsel \[1891\]. \[78\]. • Kirby J: “Ultimately, the question is whether Word, performing what are undoubtedly commercial business activities, could itself qualify as a ‘charitable institution’ with religious purposes and thus be exempt from paying income tax.” \[91\] • Kirby J: “However, it remains the fact that Word is attempting to secure for itself a special privilege provided by a statutory exemption of charitable and religious institutions from the general liability to pay income tax.” \[107\] • Kirby J (citing Lord Simonds in Oppenheim v Tobacco Securities Trust Co Ltd \[1951 AC 297 at 307: “\[i\]t must not, I think, be forgotten that charitable institutions enjoy rare 18 and increasing privileges, and that the claim to come within that privileged class should be clearly established.” \[111\] • Kirby J (citing the Australia\[n\] Industry Commission, Charitable Organizations In Australia Report No 45 (June 1995) at K 5 \[Table K.1\]: “The report contrasted the international treatment in comparable countries of commercial activities of non-profit organisations – \[Australia, Belgium, Israel, Spain, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States and West Germany\]. It found that the law in most of those countries subjected non-profit organisations, including charitable and religious institutions, to taxation in respect of income derived from their commercial activities.” \[118\] • Kirby J: It follows that, arguably, if the expansion of the exemption to a company such as Word is to be sanctioned by law, it should be done by express legislation enacted for that purpose by the Parliament after a full debate about the issues of principle and policy that are raised. \[126\] • Kirby J: “\[Word’s\] claim for exemption as a ‘charitable institution’ from income tax liability should be rejected.” \[169\] • Kirby J: “First, there is the need to avoid an abuse of claims to be a ‘charitable institution’ and the potential misuse of such claims for the purposes of tax avoidance. Secondly, there is a legitimate concern of competitors operating in the same market as the actual business operations of Word. By linking the business operations of Word with the ‘charitable purposes’ of Wycliffe or Wycliffe International, Word is allegedly afforded an unfair economic advantage that is competitors ... do not enjoy.” \[170\] • Kirby J: “\[T\[he real discrimen for the characterisation of an entity propounded as a ‘charitable institution’ is what that entity actually does and what purposes it actually pursues.” \[174\] • Kirby J (citing Scott J in Attorney-General v Ross \[1985\] 3 All ER 334 at 343): “The activities of an organisation after its formation may serve to indicate that the power to carry on non-charitable activities was in truth not incidental or supplementary at all but was the main purpose for which the organisations was formed. In such a case the organisation could not be regarded as charitable.” \[175\]. • Kirby J: “ .... It is obvious to me that Word’s own activities were not themselves charitable. What was charitable was the ultimate proposed destination of the profits that Word derived from its investment and commercial funeral business activities.” \[177\] • Kirby J: “Unless the ultimate destination of the designated profits to other independent corporate entities applies retrospectively to colour the characterisation of Word by reason of its subventions, the 1997 Act \[Div 50 of Pt 2-15\] demands that Word itself be characterised as a business for profit. The ultimate destination of that profit or part of it cannot alter that conclusion.” \[178\] • Kirby J: “ ... the unrelatedness of a revenue-raising activity, for ‘charitable purposes,’ will deprive the entity of characterisation as a ‘charitable institution’.” \[180\].

Behavioural taxes Porter Group Limited (PGL) is in favour of tax on tobacco and alcohol continuing progressively and for a new tax on sugar . In addition, PGL would like the Working Group to consider taxes on meat and dairy products to offset the carbon effects of methane as opposed to or in part reduction of taxing farmers. PGL submits that the Working Group should recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government implement a sugar tax and consider taxing meat and dairy products to offset the carbon effects of methane as opposed to or in part reduction of taxing farmers. Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. PGL submits that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. PGL submits that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation. Taxes on savings 2 With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. PGL submits that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. PGL submits that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Beyond the points made above, PGL endorses the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Yours sincerely, Porter Group Limited

INTRODUCTION 1.1. Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu (“Te Rūnanga”) refers to the Tax Working Group’s Future of Tax: Interim Report (the “Interim Report”) and our earlier submissions, both in writing and to the Tax Working Group (“the TWG”), on the Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper. 1.2. Te Rūnanga would like to thank the TWG for the opportunity to comment on their Interim Report, and set out below our comments and submissions on some key areas that are of particular relevance and significance to Ngāi Tahu. 2. TE RŪNANGA O NGĀI TAHU 2.1. This response is made on behalf of Te Rūnanga. 2.2. Te Rūnanga is statutorily recognised as the representative tribal body of Ngāi Tahu whānui and was established as a body corporate on 24th April 1996 under section 6 of Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Act 1996 (“the Act”). 2.3. We note the following relevant provisions of our constitutional documents: Section 3 of the Act States: “This Act binds the Crown and every person (including any body politic or corporate) whose rights are affected by any provisions of this Act.” Section 15(1) of the Act states: “Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu shall be recognised for all purposes as the representative of Ngāi Tahu Whānui.” 2.4. The Charter of Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu constitutes Te Rūnanga as the kaitiaki of tribal interests. 2.5. Te Rūnanga respectfully requests that this response be given the status and weight due to the tribal collective, Ngāi Tahu whānui, currently comprising over 60,000 members, registered in accordance with section 8 of the Act. 2.6. Notwithstanding its statutory status as the representative voice of Ngāi Tahu whānui “for all purposes”, Te Rūnanga accepts and respects the right of individuals and Papatipu Rūnanga to make their own responses in relation to this matter. 3. INTERESTS IN THE FUTURE OF TAX: INTERIM REPORT 3.1. Te Rūnanga notes the following interests: Treaty Relationship • Te Rūnanga have an expectation that the Crown will honour Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the principles upon which the Treaty is founded. Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 4 of 9 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Kaitiakitanga • In keeping with the kaitiaki responsibilities of Ngāi Tahu whānui, Te Rūnanga has an interest in ensuring that there is equitable and sustainable management of the tribal pūtea and factors that influence indicators of wellbeing for future generations. • At all times, Te Rūnanga is guided by the tribal whakataukī: “mō tātou, ā, mō ngā uri ā muri ake nei” (for us and our descendants after us). Whanaungatanga • Te Rūnanga has a responsibility to promote the wellbeing of Ngāi Tahu whānui and to ensure that the management of Ngāi Tahu assets and the wider management of resources supports the aspirations for economic and social development of iwi members. 3.2. The Act provides for Ngāi Tahu and the Crown to enter into an age of co-operation. An excerpt of the Act is attached as Appendix One, as a guide to the basis of the post- Settlement relationship which underpins this response. 3.3. The Crown apology to Ngāi Tahu recognises the Treaty principles of partnership, active participation in decision-making, active protection and rangatiratanga. 3.4. With regards to the Ngāi Tahu takiwā, Section 5 of the Act statutorily defines those areas “south of the northern most boundaries described in the decision of the Māori Appellate Court”, which in effect is south of Te Parinui o Whiti on the East Coast and Kahurangi Point on the West Coast of the South Island (see map attached in Appendix Two). 4. COMMENTS ON THE FUTURE OF TAX: INTERIM REPORT Taxation of Capital Income 4.1. Ngāi Tahu does not support the introduction of a broad regime to tax capital income. 4.2. We are concerned about the impact that the taxation of capital, beyond those forms of capital that are already subject to tax, would have on our settlement asset base which was provided to compensate for both historical breaches and wrongs by the Crown and the return of culturally significant sites to Ngāi Tahu. 4.3. Our settlement was negotiated in good faith in a period where the significant majority of our commercial redress (land and other capital assets) would not be subject to tax. Comprehensive taxation of capital income would significantly impact on the ability of the Ngāi Tahu Group to meet the social and cultural needs of Ngāi Tahu whānui. Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 5 of 9 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu 4.4. A risk free rate method would have a significant impact and may result in the sale of assets by Māori organisations to meet tax liabilities as a number of the settlement assets are locked into low yields which were part of the settlement process, e.g. forestry land assets with existing rights. Rollover relief to accommodate communal / collective assets 4.5. If the TWG’s recommendation is that a broad taxation of capital income occur, we submit that the design of that regime must take into account the unique manner in which Māori assets are held. 4.6. In particular, the design of rollover relief needs to take into account the manner in which Māori assets are held collectively and may pass from generation to generation to different Papatipu Rūnanga, hapū, whānau or sub groups of the wider iwi membership base over time. 4.7. The design of rollover relief needs to take into account the fact that Ngāi Tahu assets are legally held by entities established to meet Crown requirements, for the benefit of all members, and the taxation of capital income should not impose a tax cost where the assets pass from legal entity to legal entity but still within the beneficial ownership of Ngāi Tahu. 4.8. This is of particular importance in the case of cultural non income generating assets as well as income generating assets. Subsidiaries of Māori authorities 4.9. Ngāi Tahu supports the extension of the Māori authority rules to include subsidiaries of Māori authorities. We submit that the rules be extended to include subsidiaries that are wholly owned by a Māori authority or group of shareholders that are wholly Māori authorities. We also welcome the TWG’s group recommendation that the Māori authority tax rate remain at 17.5% and that further consultation occur on technical aspects to improve the operation of these rules. Tax exemption for charities 4.10. Ngāi Tahu supports the TWG’s comments on the treatment of business income derived by charitable organisations and submits the existing tax exemption for charities deriving business income should be maintained. 4.11. The Ngāi Tahu Group will be concerned if changes are made to limit access to the tax exemption on business income based on the amount that is distributed or applied to the benefit of a charitable purpose. 4.12. Any change to the tax exemption for charities needs to take into account the intergenerational view of Ngāi Tahu and other Māori organisations. That is, it should reflect that Māori organisations do not necessarily distribute all funds each year for charitable purposes and instead look to rebuild an asset base that will sustain the ability to deliver on the cultural and social needs of iwi on an intergenerational basis. Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 6 of 9 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu 4.13. We submit that it appears that concerns relating to the taxation of business income appear to relate to distributions in a private trust / foundation context as opposed to communal or widely held trusts. We submit that the TWG’s recommendation be directed toward recommending that any changes in this area be targeted to address those entities rather than a broader change that may impact Ngāi Tahu and other Māori charities. Thank you for taking the time to consider our comments. Please let us know if you have any queries in relation to the points contained, or if you would like to discuss any of these points further. Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 7 of 9 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu APPENDIX ONE: TEXT OF CROWN APOLOGY The following is text of the Crown apology contained in the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. Part One – Apology by the Crown to Ngāi Tahu Section 6 Text in English The text of the apology in English is as follows: 1. The Crown recognises the protracted labours of the Ngāi Tahu ancestors in pursuit of their claims for redress and compensation against the Crown for nearly 150 years, as alluded to in the Ngāi Tahu proverb ‘He mahi kai takata, he mahi kai hoaka’ (‘It is work that consumes people, as greenstone consumes sandstone’). The Ngāi Tahu understanding of the Crown's responsibilities conveyed to Queen Victoria by Matiaha Tiramorehu in a petition in 1857, guided the Ngāi Tahu ancestors. Tiramorehu wrote: “‘This was the command thy love laid upon these Governors ... that the law be made one, that the commandments be made one, that the nation be made one, that the white skin be made just equal with the dark skin, and to lay down the love of thy graciousness to the Māori that they dwell happily ... and remember the power of thy name.” The Crown hereby acknowledges the work of the Ngāi Tahu ancestors and makes this apology to them and to their descendants. 2. The Crown acknowledges that it acted unconscionably and in repeated breach of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi in its dealings with Ngāi Tahu in the purchases of Ngāi Tahu land. The Crown further acknowledges that in relation to the deeds of purchase it has failed in most material respects to honour its obligations to Ngāi Tahu as its Treaty partner, while it also failed to set aside adequate lands for Ngāi Tahu's use, and to provide adequate economic and social resources for Ngāi Tahu. 3. The Crown acknowledges that, in breach of Article Two of the Treaty, it failed to preserve and protect Ngāi Tahu's use and ownership of such of their land and valued possessions as they wished to retain. 4. The Crown recognises that it has failed to act towards Ngāi Tahu reasonably and with the utmost good faith in a manner consistent with the honour of the Crown. That failure is referred to in the Ngāi Tahu saying ‘Te Hapa o Niu Tireni!’ (‘The unfulfilled promise of New Zealand’). The Crown further recognises that its failure always to act in good faith deprived Ngāi Tahu of the opportunity to develop and kept the tribe for several generations in a state of poverty, a state referred to in the proverb ‘Te mate o te iwi’ (‘The malaise of the tribe’). 5. The Crown recognises that Ngāi Tahu has been consistently loyal to the Crown, and that the tribe has honoured its obligations and responsibilities under the Treaty of Submission on Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Page 8 of 9 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu Waitangi and duties as citizens of the nation, especially, but not exclusively, in their active service in all of the major conflicts up to the present time to which New Zealand has sent troops. The Crown pays tribute to Ngāi Tahu's loyalty and to the contribution made by the tribe to the nation. 6. The Crown expresses its profound regret and apologises unreservedly to all members of Ngāi Tahu Whānui for the suffering and hardship caused to Ngāi Tahu, and for the harmful effects which resulted to the welfare, economy and development of Ngāi Tahu as a tribe. The Crown acknowledges that such suffering, hardship and harmful effects resulted from its failures to honour its obligations to Ngāi Tahu under the deeds of purchase whereby it acquired Ngāi Tahu lands, to set aside adequate lands for the tribe's use, to allow reasonable access to traditional sources of food, to protect Ngāi Tahu's rights to pounamu and such other valued possessions as the tribe wished to retain, or to remedy effectually Ngāi Tahu's grievances. 7. The Crown apologises to Ngāi Tahu for its past failures to acknowledge Ngāi Tahu rangatiratanga and mana over the South Island lands within its boundaries, and, in fulfilment of its Treaty obligations, the Crown recognises Ngāi Tahu as the tangata whenua of, and as holding rangatiratanga within, the Takiwā of Ngāi Tahu Whānui. Accordingly, the Crown seeks on behalf of all New Zealanders to atone for these acknowledged injustices, so far as that is now possible, and, with the historical grievances finally settled as to matters set out in the Deed of Settlement signed on 21 November 1997, to begin the process of healing and to enter a new age of co- operation with Ngāi Tahu.” Page 9 of 9 Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu APPENDIX TWO: NGĀI TAHU TAKIWĀ

I would like to commend the Group for its in-depth and accessible analysis of the tax issues and opportunities that face New Zealand in 2018. I would like to express my support for the Group’s work on the taxation of capital, and in particular its decision to create analytical models to support its consideration of any future changes to the way that capital is taxed in New Zealand. The issue of capital gains tax is an issue of fairness (about taxing all wealth and substantive income equally) and of tax system integrity. If a taxpayer has the ability to arrange their affairs in a manner that generates tax-free capital in favour of taxable income, the tax system is flawed and open to abuse by those who have the means to restructure and obtain costly professional advice. The lack of an effective tax on capital means that wealth accumulates in the hands of the wealthy without being taxed, leaving the lower income earners (who primarily derive taxable income in the form of wages) a relatively higher tax bill than is proportionate to their cumulative share of the capital and income of New Zealanders. I am of the view that New Zealand should introduce a comprehensive capital gains tax. The reasons for this are as follows:  The distinction between capital and income that has been the foundation of tax policy to-date favours those who are asset-rich and have the means (financial and otherwise) to adopt behaviours and tax-planning structures that ensure that they derive their income in the form of capital rather than income. This creates distortions as people pursue tax-favourable outcomes, rather than overall efficiency, logic, or public good, and violates the fundamental principle that tax should be an integral but background aspect of our society.  Capital is concentrated in the hands of the wealthiest members of our society, and failing to tax that wealth means that the tax system fails to appropriately recognise what a taxpayer's actual "income" is and to redistribute wealth effectively. As the Group highlighted in its interim report, “capital gains are concentrated amongst those with high incomes and wealth” (see page 32, paragraph 17). Broadening the tax base ensures that all forms of economic wealth are taxed appropriately.  Although a capital gains tax could never function as a “silver bullet” in the current housing market, it must be acknowledged that under the current tax rules most investors can buy and sell \[1\] 2 residential property (which has only been appreciating in recent years) without paying tax on any gain derived at the point of sale. I am of a generation where home ownership was not only normal but achievable for the average wage earner. Many of my contemporaries own multiple properties (family homes and investment properties) because they were able to buy homes cheaply in days gone by, and then leverage those homes in order to buy additional properties that appreciate and generate tax-free gains in the long run. While wealthy land-owners enjoy these benefits and increase their net-capital, my adult children have been shut out of the property market despite earning above-average salaries. This cycle of wealth capitalisation, reinvestment, and tax- free gain only serves to keep the rich rich. Page 31 of the Group’s report states that it will need to be satisfied that “the fairness, integrity, revenue, and efficiency benefits from reform outweigh the administrative complexity, compliance costs, and efficiency costs that arise from the proposed additional capital income taxation” before it can recommend the implementation of a capital gains tax. I urge the Group to prioritise fairness, justice, and equity over concerns of administration and simplicity of tax system design. As the Group’s Interim Report points out, capital gains taxation will increase compliance and administrative costs, but virtually every other OECD country has been able to manage and deal with these consequences. After all, if ease of administration were the foundation of taxation, we would do away with our tax system altogether. The basi c premise of taxation is to collect revenue to fund public good and to redistribute wealth. This principle should, above all else, be at the forefront of the Group’s consideration of the taxation of capital. Finally, I note that I have read The New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services's submission on the Interim Report and I agree with the points it made. Thank you again for the opportunity to make a submission. Yours sincerely, Phil Harington \[1\] 3

Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth. I submit that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group w ants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. 2 Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity. PREMIUMS PAID FOR MEDICAL INSURANCE BE CLAIMED AS A TAX CREDIT. THis should encourage more people to take out medical insurance which should relieve the financial pressure that the District Health Boards are under by transferring more health costs from the public sector to the private sector. More and more the media are showcasing details showing the increasing financial stress and strain the public health sector seems to be under. This would be one way to help relieve that as well as reward people who are prepared to provide for their own health needs. As people get older and need healthcare more medical insurance becomes very costly. Tax credits for premiums paid would be very helpful here. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. 3 Yours sincerely, Tony Allen

Feedback on Future of Tax: Interim Report 1 31 October 2018 31 October 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 By email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz THE FUTURE OF TAX INTERIM REPORT Introduction and overview Trustpower Limited (Trustpower) welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback to the Tax Working Group (TWG) on the Future of Tax: Interim Report. By way of background, Trustpower employs around 700 staff spread across many regions in NZ, with a head office in Tauranga, many regional site offices, including a call centre in Oamaru. Trustpower is an active participant in New Zealand’s energy markets as both a multiproduct retailer and renewable electricity generator. We have had a long-standing commitment to renewable energy. Our generation portfolio comprises nearly 100% hydro-generation. Trustpower acknowledges the Government is seeking to understand how issues such as climate change, agricultural emissions, and water quality can be addressed through taxation. The Interim Report recognises there is an opportunity to make greater use of resource and environmental taxation to improve environmental outcomes and diversify the tax base. It is this key area which is the focus of our submission. Feedback on Interim Report As a hydro-electricity generator and non-consumptive user of water resources, the prospect of environmental taxes, royalties for water use, or economic resource rental, are of considerable interest to Trustpower. Trustpower’s earlier submission sought clarity around the objectives and purpose of employing such taxes. The Interim Report has suggested that the potential is for tax not only to be a means of raising revenue, but also an instrument to achieve specific policy goals by influencing behaviour. NZs low emissions future New Zealand’s hydro-generation portfolio will play an important role in supporting the government’s climate change and renewable electricity targets as we move to a low emissions future. The introduction of a royalty that affects hydroelectricity could shift the economics of future investment in favour of thermal plant, or toward variable renewables that in turn affects reliability and security of supply. Feedback on Tax Working Group Interim Report 2 31 October 2018 Environmental Taxes The Interim Report (Box 9.1) provides a draft framework for taxing negative environmental externalities. Water Quality Trustpower would be concerned if an environmental tax triggered a rigorous and costly process to ascertain source and extent of contribution to degradation – it is unclear what potential exists for a hydro-generator to be caught in this complex debate? Trustpower has long been an advocate for proportional responsibility, and considers this is best dealt with through rules and regulation at source, rather than after diffuse and accumulated impacts arise, are measured and attributed. For this reason we question whether it would pass the framework test for measurability and similarly for unintended distributional impacts. Water Abstraction Tax The TWG identified water abstraction as one of the five specific areas requiring further attention. Hydro generation has been named as a large water user that could potentially be in scope for water taxes, despite being non consumptive. We would very much like to be involved in these discussions going forward, and to understand the rationale for this suggestion. Hydro Generation Royalty The suggestion of a royalty charge on water usage could have several potential impacts: i. the passing of any royalty through to market offers; and ii. an incentive for a hydroelectricity generator to spill water rather than generate; and iii. increase the cost of decarbonisation; and iv. decrease the value of the hydro investment. We note that Mercury’s earlier submission stated “A royalty imposed after investments have been made would have a similar impact to any other form of tax (such as a wealth tax) levied on an existing investment; it would reduce the value of that investment. However, unlike a wealth tax, a royalty on hydroelectricity generation would tax the wealth of a small subset of population – those who had invested in firms operating renewable hydroelectricity generation. It is not evident to Mercury, how a tax targeted on just those investors (including the Crown) could improve the structure, fairness or balance of the tax system.” Trustpower concurs with this statement. Royalties are designed to provide a fair return to the owner of a resource. There remains a question as to the ownership of water in New Zealand. We understand the Government is in discussions over iwi rights and interests in water, and this is of particular interest to hydro generators, whose investors may be faced with equity and fairness issues themselves. Without having anything concrete to comment on at this time, our feedback asks for consideration and caution over the following matters – i. Non consumptive water use does not contribute to resource scarcity. This raises the question of how many times the resource use might be taxed? Feedback on Tax Working Group Interim Report 3 31 October 2018 ii. Wariness of employing an approach that might affect investment decisions, and hydro electricity production decisions. iii. Water that is used to generate electricity is a public good for the displacement of fossil fuel use – potential charges should therefore be different. iv. Linked to the above, unintended consequences in relation to the NZ hydro/electricity market and more broadly on climate change and renewable energy goals of the government. v. The likelihood that costs may be passed on to consumers. vi. Awareness of distinctly different impacts depending on what mechanisms and metrics would be used, e.g. kWh, m3, or m3/sec charges. vii. The need for meaningful consultation once the policy drivers are understood and options can be developed /shortlisted. Finally, it is Trustpowers view that taxation on hydro-generation will most likely lead to other unintended consequences, and for that reason, should be carefully considered in balance with the Governments renewable electricity objectives, electricity pricing, and on investors in the hydroelectricity sector. Trustpower would welcome the opportunity to speak with the TWG and the secretariat to discuss the points raised, if required. Regards, ANNABEL DAVIES RISK, REGULATORY, STAKEHOLDER MANAGER \[1\]

M M J J W W F F u u n n d d s s M M a a n n a a g g e e m m e e n n t t L L t t d d 3 1 October 2018 Submission to the Tax Working Group Relationship of the Submitter MJW Funds Management Ltd (MJWF) is a niche funds management business that provides discretionary investment management services (DIMS) to a range of wholesale clients. The focus of this submission is on factors that impact on individual New Zealand equity investors should tax legislation change. Overview MJWF acknowledges the Tax Working Group’s (TWG) interest in the introduction of a capital gains tax (CGT) as outlined in the Interim Report. However, as the TWG recognises, a CGT is likely to introduce considerable complexity to the tax system. Complexity inevitably results in higher compliance costs for tax payers. It can also result in inefficient capital allocation, as taxpayers become more focused on tax concerns than on optimal asset allocation. Direct equity investment is one way that New Zealanders can save for their retirement and/or provide for the future of their families. New Zealand savers are frequently criticised for over investing in residential property at the expense of other asset classes. In the view of MJWF, equity investment needs to be encouraged for the benefits it provides to both investors and those seeking capital to grow their businesses. For equity investment to be supported as an opportunity for saving, a means of diversification and as a source of growth capital for New Zealand businesses, any tax changes need to be manageable and easy to comply with. Taxing Share Price Gains The TWG Interim Report assumes that gains from shares, in the absence of a CGT, are tax free whereas share prices over time reflect the net present values of discounted cash flows based on expected future tax paid earnings (not pre-tax earnings). In this way, share prices already reflect “after tax” values. The introduction of a CGT would therefore lead to double taxation of investor returns. \[1\] Taxing New Zealanders’ Australian Listed Shares MJWF notes that Australian held share investments are already subject to a double tax on distributions due to the lack of recognition of franking credits. The imposition of a third level of tax on Australian listed company holdings will clearly be a disincentive to invest in Australia. This would be unfortunate since the breadth of ASX listings presents excellent diversification opportunities for New Zealand investors that are not available through NZX. Rollover Relief If a standard CGT is to be introduced, MJWF believes that rollover relief would be a valuable provision that would reduce the disincentive to invest in equities. MJWF notes with concern, comment in the Interim Report that suggests that rollover relief might be considered for managed funds but not for individual investors. To avoid perverse incentives, and from the equity and fairness perspective, it is essential that individual investors are not treated differently from those who are in managed funds. Risk Free Return Method (RFRM) Tax Of the options available to introduce a capital tax, the RFRM is in our view the simplest to work with and the most equitable. It has the advantages of being easily understood, more predictable and, as a result, easier for investors to budget and plan for than a standard CGT on either realised or unrealised gains. A RFRM tax is also the tax form that, in our view, is least likely to lead to tax lead changes in investor behaviour. In keeping with the idea of applying a simple tax change to share investment, MJWF believes that a RFRM based tax could be applied across both domestic and international share portfolios. For markets beyond Australasia, this could provide the opportunity for a RFRM based tax to replace the current FIF regime. If the FIF regime is not replaced, we belief the option to use the “comparative value” method should be retained on fairness grounds.

SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP – Joanna Saywell 1 | Page 1. INTRODUCTION My name is Joanna Saywell, I was an asset manager for our local authority and I am a civil engineer. I have been a residential landlord for seven years. We have five rental properties and have owned our current home for nearly four years having moved from Wellington to take up employment in Feilding. We bought our five rental properties as long term investments so that we could have a passive income from rents in our retirement. All our rental properties have required at least spent on them to bring them up to a standard where we have felt comfortable with renting them out. In most cases this expenditure was needed to rectify years of delayed maintenance and improve insulation and electrical safety. All these works are considered Capital Improvements and so cannot be offset against rental income. Despite spending up to on two of our houses when we bought them, their Government Valuations remained relatively static for six years. 2. INCOME TAX I believe that the tax working group should have paid more attention to income tax inequalities. Since benefits such as pensions and unemployment allowances are paid from taxes they should be assessed and included in the overall income assessment for individuals. This would be fairer for those that are temporarily unemployed or are able to get part-time work. Currently the benefit system punishes people who work part time or receive an overseas pension by reducing their benefits by the amount of their additional income. This creates a disincentive to work or claim overseas pensions. There should be a low income threshold below which there is no tax liability e.g. at just above the old age pension. Then both benefits and other income over and above this threshold could be taxed at 11% until the minimum wage is reached. All the existing income tax thresholds need to be raised to ensure that the only people on the highest income tax bracket are the top 10% of earners, as it was when the current tax brackets were set. 3. TAX ON RENTAL PROPERTY – RING FENCING OF LOSSES Most property investors have one or two rental properties. Typically these were bought with an 80% loan with the rent set to cover the mortgage interest and standing charges (currently averaging about $8,000 per property). With current limits on lending, investors need a 40% deposit in order to purchase a rental property. This yields a return, before tax, of 2.3% on money invested or 11% of the rental income. It only takes a few weeks without \[1\] \[1\] SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP – Joanna Saywell 2 | Page rent for a loss to be incurred. Many small investors subsidise their rental properties for the first few years until they have paid off more of the mortgage. If the investment sum were placed in a term deposit it may yield as much as 3.5% before tax but the value of the investment sum would reduce in real terms due to inflation. Small investors can cope with minor losses on their rentals if they are able to offset these losses against their other income tax liabilities. Ring fencing losses benefits the rental companies and investors with large portfolios at the expense of the smaller (majority) of investors. Typically, rent goes to pay mortgage interest (54%), insurance, depreciation of chattels, maintenance (20% excluding GST), tax including GST and rates (18%) and landlord/property manager (8% after tax). Clearly taxes are a considerably higher proportion of the rent than the income for the investor. I believe that ring-fencing of losses would be unfair, particularly to small investors. It will lead to a reduction in available rental property and an increase in rents overall. 4. CAPITAL GAINS TAX I don’t see any suggestion of a CGT on shares (although these are reported to increase in value more quickly than property), nor the sale and purchase of franchises where these are dependent on goodwill. Current tax guidance states that capital gains tax is due on the sale of any properties bought with the intention of re-sale for a profit (property speculation) regardless of how long the properties have been owned. Capital Gains Tax is not applied if the intention at purchase was to keep the property for rent. The example given by the tax office is a case of a home owner who tried to sell her house before going overseas to work. She failed to sell so instead rented out her house while she was overseas. She eventually returned to New Zealand twenty years later and sold her house without living in it again. She was charged tax at current income tax rates on the total capital gains on the increased value of the house from when she first put it on the market to when she sold. The IRD reason that her intention, when she first rented out the property, was to retain the property until she could sell it at a profit. Recent governments have struggled to understand how the Inland Revenue Department can determine the intention of an investor at purchase and so have introduced the “Bright-Line Test” which is designed to catch property speculators who buy properties, renovate and sell for profit. I believe that a person receiving their main income from buying a property, renovating that property and then selling the property at a profit should be taxed on their income. Buying and selling within two years is a reasonable indication of intention at purchase. SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP – Joanna Saywell 3 | Page However, investors who want to have a few rental properties may find that they have difficulty getting tenants for a particular investment property so may need to sell in order to purchase a similar property in a more popular rental area. If they have only had a property for less than two years, chances are that they have lost money so the Bright-Line test would mean that they could claim sale losses against tax. Without the Bright-Line test, if their intention had been to rent the property indefinitely, they would have been unable to claim for their losses. As a property investor I support the Bright-Line Test as a means of demonstrating intention when applied over a two year period. The recent extension to the Bright Line Test to five years may catch investors who experience fluctuations in rental demand but should enable them to claim any losses against tax when formerly these could not be claimed. I can understand that extending the time to five years is a good way of claiming tax from speculators that habitually renovate and sell one or two properties every two or so years. I am not sure whether there are exemptions for people who need to move to retain their employment (for example people in the armed forces) but I think this needs to be allowed for. When I lived in the UK there was a Capital Gains Tax on property used for income. Own homes were exempt but if a portion of the home was used for business and building costs (e.g. mortgage) were claimed then CGT could be levied on that portion of the sale (less the CGT allowance for inflation). I believe that CGT should be limited to properties sold within two years of purchase. However, if CGT is introduced for all property other than owner occupied homes then there should be an adjustment for inflation (CGT allowance) that is either linked to the construction index or the annual rate of inflation. There should be no CGT on property that forms part of an estate as it then becomes an inheritance tax. 5. INFLATION The main problem with a CGT is that there needs to be an allowance for inflation, otherwise the tax becomes a tax on inflation which is clearly ridiculous. Despite comments in the discussion document, I cannot think of any items that are taxed on their inflation component. There are several commodities that need time to age, such as vintage wine and cheeses but the value of the item is in its flavour not its cost to produce plus inflation. Cars, yachts and antiques can fluctuate in value depending on rarity and demand but generally lose value over time. Shares in large companies can vary considerably but, we are told, generally increase in value over time at a higher rate than property. Large sums are needed to make financial management cost effective and this is outside the reach of most small scale property investors. SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP – Joanna Saywell 4 | Page 6. DEPRECIATION Utility providers, such as local authorities have a large assortment of valuable assets, paid for by customers or ratepayers, these are regularly re-valued, taking into account the original cost of installation, the remaining useful life and the current cost of replacement. Recently, most local authorities make allowances for replacement of assets by setting money aside in their annual budgets. They call this “funding depreciation” and is an expense every year. This fund is then used for replacement of assets. Note that this is a maintenance expense not a capital expense. Interestingly utility asset values never appear to increase over time, other than by installing new assets. As noted in the discussion document, there is now no allowance for depreciation of rental properties despite their design life being very similar to utility assets. Existing houses are rarely sold at or above their replacement cost. So any capital gains are mainly land related. Hence a CGT just on rental property is actually a Land Tax. 7. CONCLUSION I believe that income taxes need to be fairer for those requiring temporary benefits or living on pensions. I believe that the higher tax threshold needs to be increased with more intermediate steps, including a minimum where no tax is paid. I also support efforts to increase tax revenue from overseas corporates (such as banks) that are taking their New Zealand profits off shore. The government seems determined to reduce the number of small investors. The current CGT rules already target property speculators so there should be no reason to ensure investors are required to pay CGT on rental properties, particularly where this looks like a Land Tax. If CGT is applied across the board then there should be CGT allowances index linked to inflation. Any increase in taxes in one area should provide tax savings to the majority of taxpayers by a reduction in income tax or rates.

Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth.  I submit that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working G roup wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. 2  Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change.  I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity.  I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity.  Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Yours sincerely, Derek Stubbs

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 31 st October 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 WELLINGTON 6140 Commentary on Interim Report I would like to thank the Group and the Secretariat for its work in preparing an impressive and thorough interim report. I wish to make some brief comments on the interim report, primarily relating to matters on which the Group sought my input. Summary of submission 1.I support the proposal to establish a taxpayer advocate service. I also support a truncated dispute resolution process for small disputes. 2.I support the establishment of a Deputy Ombudsman position with sole responsibility for complaints involving Inland Revenue and the proposed new Crown debt collection agency. Such a role should help preserve integrity in the tax system. 3.I consider establishing a permanent tax working group similar to the Australian Board of Taxation would be beneficial. It would build on the work of the Group and provide a forum for strategic tax policy advice for the Government and society at large in a non-political environment. A.Taxpayer Advocate Service 1.I am pleased to see the Group recommend the establishment of a taxpayer advocate service and I agree with the suggestion that it report directly to the Minister of Revenue. I believe it will be important that the proposed service is properly resourced as it is likely demand for its services will increase as it becomes more widely known. 2.I believe a truncated disputes resolution process for small disputes involving say, under $50,000 of tax, is appropriate. I consider such a process should be acceptable to Inland Revenue as enabling it to resolve disputes more speedily and better focus its resources. It would also help maintain the integrity of the tax system. 2 B. Tax Ombudsman 1. I welcome the recommendation to increase the skill of the staff of the Ombudsman’s office, but I am disappointed that the report stops short of proposing a specifically dedicated tax ombudsman. As noted in the report I prepared for the Group in July, the worldwide trend is for the establishment of specific tax ombudsman. 2. I consider the existence of an independent arbiter with specific oversight of Inland Revenue is an important foundation in building trust between Inland Revenue and the public. Apart from this, I believe there are three major reasons for establishing a Deputy Ombudsman with specific responsibility for tax matters: ➢ Changes from 1 April 2019 will mean more taxpayers will be engaging with the tax system; ➢ A Deputy Ombudsman would buttress the role of the proposed taxpayer advocate service; ➢ The potential impacts of greater data sharing by Inland Revenue. 3. At the time I prepared my report for the Group I had not had time to consider the implications of the proposals contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 1 The proposed changes to be introduced from 1 April 2019 are expected to mean that an additional 750,000 tax refunds will be automatically generated for wage and salary earners. This will represent a significant increase in the numbers of taxpayers actively engaging with the tax system. 4. A specific Deputy Ombudsman would buttress the proposed tax advocacy service. As the Group proposes it would also have oversight of the new Crown collection agency which is likely to generate additional complaints once operational. I suggest that additional expertise should come from the private sector, rather than appears to be the case at the moment, seconded Inland Revenue staff. This should bring a different perspective to resolving disputes which would also build faith in the Ombudsman’s office. (From discussions with Mr Ali Noroozi, the just retired Inspector-General of Taxation in Australia, he considered the value of his office was reinforced by public perceptions of its independence). 5. Every year the volume of data received and shared by Inland Revenue increases. According to its 2018 annual report, during the year the 1 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/news/2018-06-29-bill-introduced-to-modernise-and-simplify-nz-tax- system 3 department received 520,561 “contact records” from the Department of Internal Affairs. During the same year the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) shared details with Inland Revenue relating to 94,378 child support and 7,041,500 student loan cases. Inland Revenue in return shared details with MSD relating to 1,373,489 Community Service Card holders, 402,047 child support cases as well as proactive information sharing for 743,346 benefits and student cases 2 . In addition, from 1 April 2017 information regarding serious cases of non-compliance may be disclosed to credit reporting agencies. 6. I consider Inland Revenue has an exemplary record for maintaining the integrity of information entrusted to it. The recent Radio New Zealand story regarding incorrect details being sent to a third party is a rare example of a privacy breach 3 . Nevertheless, with such huge volumes of data being shared around mistakes are inevitable. It is therefore important that the public has trust in both Inland Revenue’s internal complaints management service and ultimately in the Ombudsman’s office as a scrutineer of Inland Revenue. 7. In this regard, I refer the Group to Inland Revenue’s latest Four-Year Statement of Intent 4 released on 18 th October 2018. In its Te Kāhu Mataroa section page 11 of the SOI notes “\[Trust\] is vital for motivating people to pay their taxes and for the successful implementation of policy. This trust has been eroding in many countries. The situation is not yet clear in New Zealand, but longer term it may mean Inland Revenue cannot rely on operating in an environment of high trust. There are already differing levels of trust in Inland Revenue and the wider public sector between different ethnic, socio-economic, and demographic groups.” 8. Against this backdrop of failing trust in institutions combined with greater data exchange and more taxpayers engaging with the tax system, I believe establishing a specific Deputy Ombudsman would be an important step in strengthening taxpayers’ perceptions of the integrity of the tax system. It would also represent an increase in social capital consistent with Treasury’s Living Standards Framework. 9. As a tax agent, I have had a number of clients who I consider had legitimate grounds for complaint with Inland Revenue over how their cases were handled. However, none chose to take the complaint forward for fear of 2 Page 208 Inland Revenue Annual Report https://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/reports/annual- report/annual-report-2018/ 3 https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ninetonoon/audio/2018668093/ird-privacy- breach-raises-data-handling-concerns 4 https://www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/reports/soi/soi-2018-2022/soi-2018-index.html 4 prompting investigation and further expense. Just as with the current tax disputes process where the cost of entering into the process acts as a barrier, the reticence of taxpayers to complain about potential maladministration may mean the level of dissatisfaction with Inland Revenue is being suppressed. If so, then this represents a threat to the integrity of the tax system. The combination of the Taxpayer Advocate Service and a Deputy Ombudsman with specific oversight of Inland Revenue should act to counter such concerns. C. Tax Policy 1. I endorse the Group’s commentary regarding the role of Treasury in developing tax policy and on the importance of maintaining senior tax technical expertise within Inland Revenue. I also support its recommendations regarding the principles which should be applied to public engagement. 2. I have been impressed by the Group’s engagement and the quality of its output as it has dealt with a quite enormous workload. In my view the massive workload of the Group illustrates the need for some form of permanent Tax Commission/Tax Working Group sitting outside of Inland Revenue and Treasury. I note that Mr. David McClay, the last chair of the former Rewrite Advisory Panel made a similar recommendation in his submission to the Group. 3. As the Group notes, the current Generic Tax Policy Process is designed with the Government’s economic and fiscal strategy together with its three-year revenue strategy in mind. Inland Revenue policy-making will then be driven by its responsibility for administering the tax system with a priority on responding to threats to the system’s integrity. Overall, this is a shorter term, and by its nature, quite political process. 4. Currently, bigger scope and longer-term issues relating to the current and future structure of the tax system are only examined when the Government specifically tasks a Tax Working Group to do so. Such working groups have a limited life span and may also, such as the case for the Group, be restricted in scope. The expertise and institutional knowledge acquired during a working group’s existence is lost once the group completes its review. Inevitably, this is a more pressured and political process which is not ideal when considering the tax system. 5. I suggest establishing a Tax Commission similar to the Australian Board of Taxation which consists of a mix of public and private sector tax specialists. Its role is to provide “a business and broader community perspective to improving the design of taxation laws and their operation 5 .” An example of its role is key 5 http://taxboard.gov.au/ 5 recommendations it made which resulted in the establishment of the office of the Inspector General of Taxation. 6. The proposed Tax Commission would have a specific focus on longer-term tax policy. It would build on the work of the Group and provide an opportunity for private sector input outside the shorter-term pressures of the current GTPP. The composition of the group should be structured to ensure as wide a range of sector interests are represented, particularly amongst groups such as small businesses which are not well resourced to have much, if any input, into the GTPP. As with the Australian Board of Taxation, the Ministers of Finance/Revenue could request it conduct research into an area of tax policy outside the normal GTPP timeline. Outside the time constraints of the GTPP or a short-term working group the Tax Commission could focus its research and recommendations on the longer-term implications of tax developments both in and outside New Zealand. Over time, the Tax Commission should be seen as a neutral voice in tax policy representing a broad cross-section of society. \*\*\*\*\* I would be pleased to discuss any of the matters raised in this submission with members of the secretariat.

Level 5, Rangitāne House PO Box 883 Blenheim 7240 Ph: 03 5786180 Email: admin@rangitane.org.nz www.rangitane.org.nz 31 October 2018 T ax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 WELLINGTON Tēnā koutou katoa T AX WORKING GROUP FUTURE OF TAX: INTERIM REPORT W e refer to the Tax Working Group’s Future of Tax: Interim Report (the “Interim Report”). We would like to thank the Tax Working Group (“the TWG”) for the opportunity to comment on their Interim Report and set out below our comments and submissions on some key areas that are of particular relevance and significance to Rangitāne o Wairau. R ANGITĀNE O WAIRAU – WHO WE ARE R angitāne o Wairau have resided in the northern South Island for many generations since the arrival of their tupuna Te Huataki in the sixteenth century. Rangitāne have close whakapapa connections with other Kurahaupo Iwi (Ngati Apa ki te Ra Toa and Ngati Kuia). Ou r Rohē stretches from the Waiau-toa (Clarence) River in the south to the Wairau, including the Nelson Lakes, north to Kaituna and the Marlborough Sounds and west to the Whakatu (Nelson) area. Rangitāne customary rights often overlapped and intersected with Kurahaupo and other Iwi, especially in the Waiau- toa, Nelson Lakes, Marlborough Sounds and Whakatu Districts. Non- exclusive and shared occupation and use rights in these areas were governed by whakapapa connections and customary protocols between Iwi. Ra ngitāne have continued to live on our land, we retain our tribal structures and chiefly lines and maintain our ancestral connections with the whenua. K EY AREAS OF COMMENT 1.T axation of Capital Incom e The Rangitāne o Wairau Group does not support the introduction of a broad regime to tax capital income. We are concerned about the impact that the taxation of capital, beyond those forms of capital that are already subject to tax, would have on our settlement asset base which was provided to compensate for both historical breaches and wrongs by the Crown and the return of culturally significant sites to Rangitāne o W airau. O ur settlement was negotiated in good faith in a period where the significant majority of our commercial redress (land and other capital assets) would not be subject to tax. Comprehensive taxation of capital income would significantly impact on the ability of the Rangitāne o Wairau Group to meet the social and cultural needs of Rangitāne o Wairau. A risk free rate method would have a significant impact and may result in the sale of assets to meet tax liabilities as a number of the settlement assets are locked into low yields which were part of the settlement process, eg. forestry land assets with existing rights. 2. Rollover relief to accommodate communal / collective assets If the TWG’s recommendation is that a broad taxation of capital income occur, we submit that the design of that regime must take into account the unique manner in which Māori assets are held. In particular, the design of rollover relief needs to take into account the manner in which Māori assets are held collectively and may pass from generation to generation to different hapu, whanau or sub groups of the wider iwi membership base over time. The design of rollover relief needs to take into account the fact that Rangitāne o Wairau assets are legally held by entities established to meet Crown requirements, for the benefit of all members and the taxation of capital income should not impose a tax cost where the assets pass from legal entity to legal entity but still within the beneficial ownership of Rangitāne o Wairau. 3. Subsidiaries of Māori authorities Rangitāne o Wairau support the extension of the Māori authority rules to include subsidiaries of Māori authorities. We submit that the rules be extended to include subsidiaries that are wholly owned by a Māori authority or group of shareholders that are wholly Māori authorities. We also welcome the TWG’s group recommendation that the Māori authority tax rate remain at 17.5% and that further consultation occur on technical aspects to improve the operation of these rules. 4. Tax exemption for charities Rangitāne o Wairau Group supports the TWG’s comments on the treatment of business income derived by charitable organisations and submits the existing tax exemption for charities deriving business income should be maintained. The Group will be concerned if changes are made to limit access to the tax exemption on business income based on the amount that is distributed or applied to the benefit of a charitable purpose. Any change to the tax exemption for charities needs to take into account the intergenerational view of Māori organisations. That is, it should reflect that Māori organisations do not necessarily distribute all funds each year for charitable purposes and instead look to rebuild an asset base that will sustain the ability to deliver on the cultural and social needs of iwi on an inter-generational basis. We submit that it appears that concerns relating to the taxation of business income appear to relate to distributions in a private trust / foundation context as opposed to communal or widely held trusts. We submit that the TWG’s recommendation be directed toward recommending that any changes in this area be targeted to address those entities rather than a broader change that may impact Rangitāne o Wairau and other Māori charities. Thank you for taking the time to consider our comments. Please contact us if you have any queries in relation to the points contained, or if you would like to discuss any of these points further.

Information and transparency ................................................................................................. 13 1 1. Introduction 1.1. This submission is made on behalf of the 27 unions affiliated to the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions Te Kauae Kaimahi (CTU). With over 310,000 members, the CTU is one of the largest democratic organisations in New Zealand 1.2. The CTU acknowledges Te Tiriti o Waitangi as the founding document of Aotearoa New Zealand and formally acknowledges this through Te Rūnanga o Ngā Kaimahi Māori o Aotearoa (Te Rūnanga) the Māori arm of Te Kauae Kaimahi (CTU) which represents approximately 60,000 Māori workers. 1.3. The NZCTU welcomes the opportunity to make this submission in response to the Interim Report published by the Tax Working Group. In addition to this submission, the CTU’s digital campaigning arm Together.org.nz has also undertaken a survey of members asking about attitudes to taxation, with similar themes to the UMR research we submitted to the Tax Working Group in April 1 . A summary of this survey will be submitted separately to this document. 1.4. Taxes are the way that we as a society pool our resources. They are an inescapable counterpart of the government spending that is needed to promote and sustain a good society. The tightly-constrained current level of government spending is not consistent with the aspirations of the New Zealand public for health, education, infrastructure, housing affordability, progress towards the carbon-zero goal, reducing inequality, and provision of quality public services in general. Both the 30%-of-GDP target in the Group’s Terms of Reference and the “revenue neutral” suggestion in the Ministers’ letter of 20 September 2018 place higher priority on arbitrary fiscal bright-lines than on the well-being of our people, society and environment. We urge the Group to rise above those restrictions on its reporting mandate. As it observed in its earlier Submission Background Paper (p.10), “If the Government is to continue providing healthcare and superannuation at current levels, then the level of taxation will need to increase, or spending on other transfers or publicly provided goods and services will need to fall.” 1.5. Given that it is apparent that current levels of provision of healthcare are failing New Zealanders in critical ways (such as in mental health and decrepit or inadequate hospital infrastructure), and there is evidence of widespread failings in other public services, ranging from regulatory failings in building, road safety and employment relations through financially unviable institutes of technology and polytechnics, to critical housing shortages, as well as impoverishing main benefit levels, it is not only healthcare and superannuation that demand higher levels of revenue from taxation. 1 https://www.union.org.nz/kiwis-desire-for-tax-offers-hope-for-underfunded-public-services/ 2 1.6. The NZCTU: • Notes that the Tax Working Group has found that amongst high-income countries, New Zealand has one of the least effective tax systems for reducing income inequality, and also one of the least effective benefit and income support systems; • Is pleased that a capital gains tax is being seriously considered. It is only fair to tax such income on the same basis as other income, and because wealth is so unevenly shared, would be a significant step to reduce inequality, while plugging some major holes which the wealthy are using to avoid income tax; • Is disappointed that a land or wealth tax is no longer on the table. While recognising practical difficulties with implementing them, there is an increasingly pressing need to push back against New Zealand’s high wealth inequality; • Is also disappointed that there has been no move to address the absence of taxes on wealth transfers, in particular gifts, which are within the Terms of Reference and are presently treated inconsistently between the Income Tax Act and the Social Security Act; • Greets with interest proposals for making saving for retirement easier for low and middle income people, and agrees that across-the-board tax incentives would favour high income savers, who have less difficulty in saving; • Welcomes the serious consideration given to a variety of environmental taxes, but agrees with the Tax Working Group that they are often regressive and so need to be offset by assistance to low and middle income people so that they are not disproportionately affected, or designed to ensure this; • Regrets that an extension of GST into financial services by means of a Financial Activity Tax has not been recommended, and urges the Tax Working Group to reconsider; • Is disappointed that a reduction in the GST rate is not recommended because, as the Tax Working Group recognises, GST is regressive, hitting low income households hardest, but recognises the cost of a reduction in GST is substantial; • Urges once again that the Government be advised to make the income tax scale more progressive to offset the effect of GST, including discussion of the possibility of a higher top rate in future, notwithstanding that the Terms of Reference do not provide for this vital consideration; 3 • Welcomes work to ensure that there is no tax advantage to employing people as contractors as opposed to employees, and to ensure self- employed pay their taxes; • Agrees that company income taxes should not be lowered, since lowering them would mostly benefit overseas shareholders and the wealthiest New Zealanders, with no evidence of beneficial effects for New Zealand as a whole; • Continues to advocate the raising of the company tax rate to at least 30% and ideally 33%; • Welcomes the work the Tax Working Group has done on the feasibility of ensuring that multinationals providing digital services do not escape a fair level of taxation, and urges urgency in implementing the relevant taxes; • Agrees that directors should be made personally liable for companies they head not paying their taxes. This is similar to other areas where directors are using the protection of companies to avoid their responsibilities for their employees’ employment rights, health and safety, and avoiding paying creditors; • Supports recommended moves towards much less secrecy in providing information about taxes and who pays them, but believes more could be done to ensure corporate tax payers are open to public scrutiny and analysis. • Welcomes the explicit attention paid to Te Ao Māori in the Interim Report. 1.7. Specific recommendations made in this submission are as follows. The Tax Working Group should - • Take note of the potential for fiscal destabilisation in the event of a systemic loss in asset values, if deduction of capital losses against income for tax purposes is allowed under a capital-income tax or under an income tax system with capital gains included as income. Such a crash in market- based asset valuations is a strong possibility given the current worldwide bubble in asset values. Rigorous ring-fencing of capital losses, to be used only to offset previously-taxed capital gains, is crucially important; • Give systematic consideration to the economic stabilisation role of the tax system, which has been completely overlooked in the Interim Report; • Recommend the inclusion of wealth transfers (specifically, gifts) in the recommended definition of income for tax purposes, to bring the tax legislation into line with the Social Security Act’s definition of income; 4 • Foreshadow the possibility of increasing the top rate of income tax, notwithstanding that the Terms of Reference preclude (at this time) making any actual recommendation in that direction; • Reconsider the Interim Report’s rejection of a wealth tax, in light of the OECD’s clear and explicit statement that capital income tax on its own, if not supplemented by inheritance and gift taxes, is inadequate to tackle wealth inequality; • Recommend the creation of a New Zealand wealth register, as foreshadowed in our previous submission paragraph 12.8, and in the Ministers’ letter of 20 September which has asked for “better approaches to understanding the wealth, capital income, and effective tax rates of individuals particular\[ly\] those in the top decile”. Such a register should encompass both financial and non-financial wealth, along the lines of the Danish model. • Keep in play the option of a Financial Activities Tax to compensate for the financial sector’s exemption from GST, noting that this option was not among those explicitly ruled out in the Ministers’ letter of 20 September; • Recommend a significant expansion of the scope and depth of statistics on the tax system, and in particular call for the regular production and publication of data on the taxation paid by High Wealth Individuals; • Include capital gains in the definition of income used when estimating effective tax rates by decile, and revise Figure 3.3 of the Interim Report accordingly. 2. Improving equity 2.1. The NZCTU notes that the Tax Working Group has found that amongst high- income countries, New Zealand has one of the least effective tax systems for reducing income inequality, and also one of the least effective benefit and income support systems. 2.2. Figure 3.3 on page 17 of the Report makes dramatically apparent the very weak progressivity of the income tax scale, and the near-complete reliance on transfers to achieve mitigation of inequality. These are useful lessons, but it looks as though even the very mildly progressive effective tax rate shown across the top half of the income distribution does not reflect the true situation. 2.3. Figure 3.3 significantly overstates the actual effective tax rates facing the top one or two deciles of the income distribution, because capital gains have not been included in the denominator of the tax rate. This needs to be remedied in order to avoid giving false impressions – both of high tax effort at the top of the distribution, and of a progressive structure of tax overall. 2.4. We therefore request the Tax Working Group, either prior to or as part of its final report, to provide a reworked version of Figure 3.3, showing the average 5 effective tax rates by decile when the best available estimates of capital gains are included in the denominator of the tax-rate calculation. 2.5. New Zealand’s “broad-base-low-rate” model originated from the quest to maximise tax revenue as “efficiently” as possible, in a setting where “efficiency” was defined in a way that excluded consideration of equity matters. The present state of New Zealand’s tax scale is the result of resolving the often-cited equity/efficiency trade-off almost entirely in favour of narrowly-defined “economic efficiency” 2 . It is therefore no surprise to see in Figure 3.4 that the redistributive impact of the New Zealand tax system is comparable with inegalitarian countries such as the USA, and far below the Nordic countries which sustain proper welfare states. 2.6. It would be useful to see how that chart would change – how far up the ranking New Zealand might be moved – if all redistributive options allowed by the constraints of the Terms of Reference and the recent ministerial correspondence with the Group were to be implemented. 2.7. We suspect that the answer to this question would be that the very restricted scope of the Tax Working Group’s brief will allow very little progress towards greater redistributive outcomes, as measured by Gini coefficient reductions. 2.8. We nevertheless strongly urge the Group to be as ambitious as possible in its thinking about a package to reduce inequality, and to extend its thinking to potential packages that may have been “excluded from its terms of reference but which could benefit from being considered in the context of its recommendations”, as explicitly provided for in the Terms of Reference. 2.9. The NZCTU reiterates its view that an increase in the top rate of income tax is desirable, notwithstanding the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference. 2.10. The NZCTU supports the proposal to increase progressivity by lowering tax rates and raising thresholds at the bottom of the income distribution, and increasing welfare benefits. 2.11. The Tax Working Group should pay close attention to all options within the Terms of Reference to maximise the redistributive function of the tax system. 3. Ring-fencing capital losses 3.1. The NZCTU supports the Tax Working Group’s recommendation that capital income, including capital gains, be included in the definition of income for tax purposes. 2 We would point out that defining “efficiency” in terms of maximising revenue subject only to the constraint of “allocative” or “productive” efficiency is a narrow conception, far removed from the more general and relevant notion of efficiency in progressing the Living Standards Framework and the Sustainable Development Goals. In the latter case, mitigating inequality of income and wealth is an essential component of efficiency – not a separate, opposed objective. 6 3.2. In our first submission in April 2018 we noted several issues that would need to be confronted in the event that the Group opted to go down this route. Paragraph 11.6 of that submission noted that At the date when a capital gains tax is introduced, firms and individuals will have on their books a wide array of assets whose current valuations are far in excess of their historic cost, representing capital gains which have not been taxed. Downward revaluation of those assets subsequent to the start of CGT ought not to be deductible. 3.3. Paragraph 11.7 further said We agree with the Background Paper that “if capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis, tax base maintenance considerations suggest that capital losses should be ring-fenced”, notwithstanding that on the face of it this is a departure from the Hicksian income definition discussed above. 3.4. The strong arguments for not making a capital-income tax symmetrical with respect to gains versus losses are greatly reinforced when a valuation-day approach is chosen as recommended in paragraph 108, page 155 of the Interim Report. This makes the scale of post-valuation-day gains or losses directly and heavily dependent on the state of asset markets on the day the tax comes into effect. 3.5. The potential fiscal costs of allowing non-ring-fenced losses to be offset against other taxable income in the event of a major market meltdown following valuation day are sufficient to conclusively make the case for ring- fencing all capital losses - not just those foreshadowed in paragraph 105 on page 155 – to be applicable only against previously-taxed capital gains. 3.6. The fiscal consequences of a “run on the Consolidated Fund” triggered by a cascade of tax-deductible asset write-downs are potentially devastating, and would eliminate the option of using other, less regressive, fiscal options to confront an economic downturn (see, for example, the discussion of household cash bonuses in section 4 below). 3.7. A further argument for ring-fencing capital losses is the need to avoid a situation where the state in effect underwrites unwise or speculative investments by taking on a share of the risk represented by the marginal tax rate, while having no say in the decision to embark on the investment – that is, no control over whether the investment is prudent. 3.8. The existing tax law already makes provision for the deductibility against income in general of loss of value of capital assets, via depreciation allowances. To offer tax reductions via both depreciation allowances and deductibility of capital losses opens the way to a wide range of opportunistic behaviours designed simply to avoid tax, often in cases where the taxpaying party is in no genuine need of tax relief. This is particularly true in the case of assets which potentially both depreciate in an economic sense and experience significant changes in market values. The principal asset class for which this holds is real estate. In this case, whether depreciation occurs is strongly contested by experts, with the result that depreciation on buildings is currently not recognised for tax purposes. We suggest that whether or not 7 depreciation on buildings does occur, tax deductions should not be allowed for depreciation if deductions are allowed for losses of capital value. 3.9. Opportunistic behaviour of the sort foreshadowed in the Interim Report pages 149-150 paragraph 71, page 154 paragraph 101, page 155 paragraph 106, and page 156 paragraph 109 is to be anticipated as a major threat to revenue in the absence of rigorous loss ring-fencing. 3.10. We therefore submit that all capital losses be ring-fenced so that they can only be used as a deductible expense against previously-taxed capital gains. While it may be argued that this adds some complexity to the tax system in that it requires capital value changes to be differentiated from other income, this is a relatively minor drawback compared to the risks of full deductibility. In any case, capital value changes will have to be identified separately in order to justify them. 3.11. Related to the ring-fencing issue is the treatment of “rollovers” under a realisation-based capital-income tax (Interim Report pages 149-150). Where assets change hands, the capital gains already accrued must be either deemed to have been realised at the moment of transfer, and taxed accordingly; or left untaxed until some later time. The first of these options runs into the difficulties of the accrual approach discussed on pages 142-143 of the Report; the second could enable taxation to be deferred indefinitely by continually avoiding any “sale” of the assets. If rollover relief is provided, it should not enable such indefinite deferral of tax liability. One option would be to specify a time horizon – possibly five or ten years - within which the asset must be actually realised, or else deemed to have been realised, with tax charged at that point. This would provide sufficient time for the beneficiary of the asset transfer to make provision for the eventual cashflow impact of the tax. 4. The stabilisation role of tax 4.1. The Interim Report lists (page 4) three respects in which the tax system “underpins the living standards of New Zealanders”, the third of which is “as a policy instrument in its own right”. However when this third role is developed on page 11 and in Chapter 10, it turns out to include only the microeconomic role of tax as “a policy instrument to influence behaviours”. 4.2. In thus limiting its discussion, the Interim Report has excluded the key macroeconomic function of the tax system as one of the “automatic stabilisers”, that work by loosening the fiscal stance in economic downturns, and tightening it in booms. 4.3. A key determinant of the effectiveness of the tax system as an automatic stabiliser is the progressivity of the tax scale, something that has been dramatically reduced in New Zealand over the past couple of decades. This weakening of the counter-cyclical link between the fiscal stance and the phase of the business cycle leaves the New Zealand economy more vulnerable and less resilient in the face of an economic downturn than was the case in the past. 8 4.4. In addition to having nothing to say about automatic stabilisers, the Interim Report contains no discussion of ways in which discretionary adjustments to tax rates have a potential role to play in stabilisation policy. 4.5. In this connection we draw the Group’s attention to the very significant role that lump-sum transfers to households and/or individuals, delivered through the tax-transfer system, can have in providing a rapid discretionary fiscal response to a sharp downturn in the macro-economy. This sort of one-off stimulus played a major role in Australia’s fiscal response to the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-09 and could be a crucial addition to New Zealand’s available policy options to enable a similarly rapid and effective intervention here. 4.6. The A$21 billion lump-sum-cash component of the Australian stimulus packages in 2008-09 amounted to 2% of GDP paid out, primarily to low- income households, in two successive injections. There is solid evidence that the payments were effective both in sustaining aggregate demand and in reducing income inequality 3 . 4.7. Such payments can be characterised in various ways: “cash-bonus payments” 4 , “tax bonus payments” 5 , “negative poll taxes” or “negative income taxes” 6 , one-off tax rebates, or one-off benefit bonuses. They represent a flexible rapid-response option to be deployed alongside more traditional forms of fiscal stimulus operating through increased government expenditure on, for example, infrastructure investment. 4.8. It may be suggested that allowing non-ring-fenced capital losses as deductibles would strengthen the automatic stabilisers. This argument carries very little weight and should not prevail over the strong case for rigorous ring- fencing. Capital-loss deductions would benefit mainly those at the top of the wealth and income pyramid where the marginal propensity to consume is lowest, which means their counter-cyclical impact would be less than the impact of lump-sum cash distribution as described above. Furthermore, the distributional effect of capital-loss deductibility would be regressive, whereas that of lump-sum distributions would be positive. 4.9. We recommend that the Tax Working Group should address the stabilisation role of taxation in its final report. 3 Hyslop, D.

R.L. Edwards, New York 1972, p.37. 9 5. Wealth transfers: gifts and inheritance 5.1. Our April 2018 submission noted (paragraph 11.1) that “one obvious gap in the income tax base at present is that ... wealth transfers (such as gifts and inheritances) are not treated as income”. We accept that the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference rule out a separate inheritance tax, but we reiterate our view that gifts and inheritances are income, just as capital gains are, and that all should be subject to income taxation at the prevailing rates. 5.2. As our previous submission pointed out (paragraph 11.3) “it is a striking anomaly in New Zealand’s system of taxes and transfers that whereas the principle \[that income includes wealth transfers and windfalls\] is vigorously pursued in relation to (relatively poor) beneficiaries, it is set aside in the tax treatment of capital gains and wealth transfers accruing to the rich”. 5.3. Given the emphasis placed in the Interim Report (page 15) on the “broad base/low rate” policy framework, it is all the more important that exclusions from the broad tax base be explicitly justified in terms of the criteria of (page 13) “efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and administrative costs”. Neither gifts nor inheritance warrant exemption from taxation under these headings. 5.4. In the treatment of welfare beneficiaries, gifts are routinely treated as income, leading directly to reductions in benefits and hence a squeeze on beneficiary budgets. The recent High Court judgment of Davison J 7 , while drawing a welcome line between loans and gifts and appropriately reversing the Social Security Appeal Authority’s treatment of both as income, made clear at paragraph 90 the legal position that gifts are income for the purposes of the Social Security Act. 5.5. Noting that the Tax Working Group is interacting with the Welfare Working Group, this would appear to be a crucial area in which the two parts of the tax- transfer system need to be better aligned. On the assumption that the Social Security Act is not likely to be amended to remove the treatment of gifts as income, we submit that consistency requires the inclusion of gifts as income for taxation purposes. This has nothing to do with the amount of revenue that taxing gifts might or might not yield. It is a matter of simple consistency and natural justice. The “integrity of the tax system” is definitely at stake here. 5.6. Gifts are not excluded by the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference, and we submit that they ought to be included along with capital gains in the Group’s recommended extension of the income tax base. 5.7. The Report’s practice (paragraph 105 page 43) of categorising estate duty and gift duties under the heading of “wealth taxes” obscures the issue. Whereas wealth is a stock in the hands of an individual or other entity, transfers of wealth via inheritance and gifts involve flows, as distinct from stocks, and are an addition to the income of the recipient. 5.8. Taxing gifts and bequests separately from the income tax system, by means of taxes imposed on the donor or the estate, rather than the recipient, does 7 F v Ministry of Social Development 2 July 2018 \[2018\] NZHC 1607. 10 have obvious negative connotations from an equity standpoint. We have not advocated, and do not advocate, the revival of separate estate and gift taxes. However, we reiterate that as income in the hands of the recipient, wealth transfers ought to be included in any proper accounting of the recipient’s income for tax purposes. 5.9. We therefore urge that wealth transfers be recognised as a potential base for income tax, and specifically that the Tax Working Group should address the merits of bringing gif ts into the definition of income for tax purposes. This issue lies squarely within the Terms of Reference 5.10. Notwithstanding the Terms of Reference, we still believe that the issue of inheritance as income in principle should be at least acknowledged. 5.11. Note that the discussion on how to measure capital gains on assets transferred at death or by gift on page 143 paragraph 28 of the Interim Report is entirely separate from the issue discussed here, namely taxation of the aggregate value of the wealth transferred. 6. Wealth tax and land tax 6.1. The NZCTU is disappointed that the Tax Working Group has not followed its 2009 predecessor in recommending a land tax, has not elaborated more fully on the vital role of local-body rates (“a narrow-based wealth tax in real estate” – page 16) in sustaining local government, and has rejected a wealth tax on grounds which seem to us very weak. 6.2. The Group’s case for not looking further at a wealth tax is found on pages 43- 44 of the Interim Report, paragraphs 106-108. The Report offers no principled grounds for abandoning the idea. Instead, the arguments against wealth taxes are entirely pragmatic: they “tend to have significant exemptions and simplified valuation rules”, they “can create major distortions to savings and investment decisions”; they “tend to suffer from high levels of evasion and avoidance”; they are “difficult to apply” and “many types of assets are hard to value”. 6.3. In recommending against a wealth tax, the Tax Working Group relies heavily on a 2018 OECD report 8 which, we submit, has been cherry-picked for negatives while overlooking crucial qualifications made by the OECD. 6.4. At the outset, the OECD study makes a particularly strong statement in favour of addressing wealth inequality 9 : Wealth inequality is far greater than income inequality, and there is some evidence suggesting that wealth inequality has increased in recent decades. In addition, wealth accumulation operates in a self-reinforcing way and is likely to increase in the absence of taxation. High earners are 8 OECD (2018), The Role and Design of Net Wealth Taxes in the OECD, http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264290303-en . 9 OECD (2018) p.11. 11 able to save more, meaning that they are able to invest more and ultimately accumulate more wealth. Moreover, investment returns tend to increase with wealth, largely because wealthy taxpayers are in a better position to invest in riskier assets and generally have higher levels of financial education, expertise and access to professional investment advice. 6.5. The OECD then lays out (pages 11-12) a clear line of reasoning for recommending against wealth taxation when compared with the alternatives. We have added emphasis to some parts of the reproduced passage below: \[T\]he report concludes that from both an efficiency and equity perspective, there are limited arguments for having a net wealth tax in addition to broad- based personal capital income taxes and well-designed inheritance and gift taxes. While there are important similarities between personal capital income taxes and net wealth taxes, the report shows that net wealth taxes tend to be more distortive and less equitable. This is largely because they are imposed irrespective of the actual returns that taxpayers earn on their assets. The report also argues that capital income taxes alone will most likely not be enough to address wealth inequality and suggests the need to complement capital income taxes with a form of wealth taxation. The report finds that there is a strong case for an accompanying inheritance tax on efficiency, equity and administrative grounds ... \[T\]he report finds that there are stronger arguments for having a net wealth tax in the absence of broad-based personal capital income taxes and taxes on wealth transfers. 6.6. In the light of these comments it has to be recalled that in its Interim Report the Tax Working Group (i) has been barred (by its Terms of Reference) from recommending inheritance tax; (ii) has not addressed other wealth transfers, and (iii) has in fact proposed “capital income taxes alone” as its sole solution to wealth inequality – precisely the option rejected by the OECD. We recommend that the Tax Working Group revisit the OECD report on wealth taxes, and pay closer attention to its conclusions. 6.7. We submit also that the Interim Report’s concluding argument in paragraph 108 that “a wealth tax is ... a complex form of taxation that is likely to reduce the integrity of the tax system” requires a good deal more than mere assertion. There may well be a trade-off between the equity benefits of taxing the rich to reduce inequality, on the one hand, and the general need to protect the “integrity of the tax system” on the other. “Integrity” is always hard to protect when faced with the manoeuvring, avoidance, data concealment and emigration threats of the rich. This is true in relation to income tax as much as to wealth tax. 6.8. It is unfortunate but true that reducing wealth inequality is an extremely difficult policy problem, and it seems inevitable that any and all attempts to reduce that inequality will be opposed strongly, creatively, and often effectively, by the rich. That is not, however, a solid reason for not trying. 6.9. The Crown has faced practical difficulties in extracting revenues from the rich and powerful at least since the reign of King John. Tackling inequality in 2018 will require the Crown to confront, and face down (on the basis of democratic 12 consent through Parliament) the opposition of strong vested interests. We submit that the Government did not set up the Tax Working Group simply to advocate surrender to those interests. 7. Broadening the GST tax base: financial services 7.1. The NZCTU once again submits that financial services ought not to be exempted from tax on their value-added. Although the authorities may not at present have the necessary information to extend GST into financial transactions, it is certain that the banks hold this information. We suspect that they would be perfectly capable of implementing the extension of GST to their activities if the exemption were to be removed. 7.2. Insofar as financial services continue to be excluded from the GST system, a Financial Activity Tax (FAT) ought to apply as an alternative means of taxing value added in this sector. The Tax Working Group’s sole expressed reason for rejecting a Financial Activities Tax is that (page 90 paragraph 31) “it creates ‘tax cascades’ in which additional tax is imposed at each stage of the production process”. In the IMF document cited in our previous submission in support of a FAT 10 , the cascading issue was discussed on page 126. The solution proposed there, insofar as cascading is an actual issue, was not to leave the financial sector exempt from tax, but rather to apply a rate for FAT below that set for VAT (GST). 7.3. While acknowledging that cascading is an issue, we reiterate that, as the Interim Report acknowledges (paragraph 27 on page 89), the absence of any tax on financial services’ value added is both distortionary and unfair. 7.4. There are a number of ways in which cascading can be mitigated, including (for example) allowing financial sector firms to claim rebates of all GST invoiced through to them from upstream suppliers of non-financial goods and services. 7.5. A GST-like FAT could be considered by requiring financial sector firms annually to estimate their total FAT for the coming year and strike a tax rate that they apply to the margins of all transactions that in total will raise the estimated FAT for the year. Customers would be informed of the FAT content of transactions in the same way GST is notified, and downstream businesses would be able to claim it back. A washup would occur at the end of the year to calculate any FAT owing or overpaid by the financial sector firm, with any correction applied to the tax rate struck in the following year. IRD (perhaps in cooperation with the Reserve Bank) would be given the power to audit the margins and tax calculations. 10 In Stijn Claessens, Michael Keen, and Ceyla Pazarbasic (eds), Financial Sector Taxation: the IMF’s Report to the G-20 and Background Material, September 2010, https://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2010/paris/pdf/090110.pdf . 13 7.6. We submit that a Financial Activity Tax remains a serious option and deserves revisiting before the final report is written. 7.7. We emphasise once again that a FAT is different from a FTT, and has not been ruled out by the Ministers’ letter of 20 September. We encourage the Group to address them separately, rather than just submerging the FAT under the FTT as in paragraph 12.5 on page 92. 8. Company tax 8.1. A review of the numbers in Tables 14.1 and 14.2 on page 101 of the Interim Report dramatically illustrates the extraordinarily favourable tax treatment of New Zealand-resident shareholders relative to their counterparts elsewhere in the OECD. With imputation or its absence taken into account, New Zealand has an overall statutory top rate of 33% compared with 47% in Australia, 48% in the USA and 57% in France. The essential point is that in countries with double taxation of company profits, a nominal company tax rate that looks low can in fact be quite high, relative to New Zealand. 8.2. The New Zealand company rate on its own, at 28%, is significantly below Australia’s 30%.There is certainly no case at all for reducing the company tax rate. On the contrary, the case for an increase, at the very least sufficient to align the rate with that in Australia, looks compelling on the basis of these figures – all the more so given the absence of any evidence that reducing the rate in the past has had any positive effect on foreign investment. The company tax rate should at least be returned to 30%, but ideally raised to parity with the top personal rate. 8.3. We note that the Interim Report offers no discussion on the proposal section 15 of our submission last April recommending an excess-profits tax. The NZCTU remains in favour of such a tax. 9. Information and transparency 9.1. The NZ CTU strongly supports the call on pages 124-126 of the Interim Report for much greater transparency and more thorough statistical analysis of tax data. The Australian Tax Office publishes far more comprehensive and informative tax statistics than New Zealand, and could serve as a model. In particular we congratulate the Group for making available the invaluable paper on High Wealth Individuals 11 . We strongly urge the Group to recommend production of analysis along these lines by Inland Revenue on an annual basis. 9.2. Figure 3.4 on page 18 of the Interim Report usefully shows New Zealand’s low ranking, relative to other OECD economies, in the redistributive impact of its 11 Available at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/information-release-high-wealth-individuals-wealth- accumulation-review 14 tax-transfer system. This also is an example of the sort of descriptive material that ought to be published on a regular basis. 9.3. Looking deeper into the information requirements of a more efficient and comprehensive income tax system, there is a clear need for IRD and Statistics New Zealand to collaborate in producing income statistics based on the Hicksian definition and providing more detail on the effective tax rates that are exhibited by hard-to-measure groups and sectors within the economy. 9.4. The recent work by Cabral and Gemmell 12 on using expenditure as well as income data to identify underreporting of household income is a useful step in that direction. More research into effective tax rates and income reporting by sector is needed, as is better analysis of the farming sector’s avoidance practices and “farming for capital gain” 13 . 9.5. It seems clear that reported incomes in the purportedly lowest decile of the income distribution are distorted by inclusion of a significant number of self- employed small businesses that are taking advantage of opportunities to conceal or under-report their actual income, while sustaining disproportionate levels of expenditure. 14 An important consequence of this is to obscure the situation of the genuinely disadvantaged individuals in that decile. 9.6. Recommendations for more focused statistical analysis and better targeted survey research would be welcome. 9.7. We note with interest that the Ministers’ letter of 20 September has asked the Group to advise on how the available data on wealth distribution could be improved. This request points directly towards the usefulness of a comprehensive wealth register along the lines of the Danish system. Such a register would include, inter alia, bank deposits, property titles, holdings of shares and bonds, closely-held companies, unincorporated businesses, real estate. Much of this information could be collected from administrative sources. 9.8. A wealth register of this sort would be not just a valuable addition to knowledge about the distribution of wealth in New Zealand; it would also meet the clear potential need for detailed wealth data, in the event that a future New Zealand Government decides to proceed with a wealth tax. A well-established 12 Cabral, Ana Cinta G. & Gemmell, Norman, 2018. "Estimating Self-Employment Income-Gaps from Register and Survey Data: Evidence for New Zealand," Working Paper Series 7625, Victoria University of Wellington, Chair in Public Finance. 13 The popular impression that “farming for capital gain” is common, is lent weight by the background paper “Effective company tax rates in New Zealand: Supplementary Background Paper for Session 12 of the Tax Working Group June 2018” (available at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/twg- bg-3996763-effective-company-tax-rates-in -new-zealand) which at paragraphs 39 and 40 reports that typically half of small and medium companies in agriculture report a loss in the years studied and that “Untaxed realised gains are significant for this industry.” 14 See for example Perry, B. (2018). Household Incomes in New Zealand: trends in indicators of inequality and hardship 1982 to 2017. Wellington, New Zealand: Ministry of Social Development, pp.27, 266. Retrieved from https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications- resources/monitoring/household-incomes 15 wealth register will be a pre-requisite for the efficient administration of such a tax. 9.9. Across the OECD the demand for taxation of wealth is likely to grow, not recede, in coming years.

The Tax Working Group submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Wednesday 31 October 2018 Tax Working Group Submission on the Interim Report I am a landlord with a modest holding of property. I have invested in housing as means for my savings to try and keep pace with inflation. I do not fully understand the share and fund market but I do know they all say I should consult my financial advisor. I was deterred by a strong recommendation that I have a minimum of $1M to invest before I spoke to an independent financial advisor. Investing in property seemed the only way the average Kiwi could start investing for retirement until KiwiSaver came along. There are a number of proposals in the interim report that alarm me. I can see the desire for the government to get another form of taxation however rental property does not give high returns and capital growth is often non-existent for long periods, especially in the provinces. Capital Gains Tax Realisation I am concerned that a capital gains tax on realisation will discriminate against individual investors compared to companies, trusts, and other entities. At some stage an individual (or his estate) would have to sell his properties and capital gains would be payable. A company or trust , on the other hand, is able to hold that property for much longer deferring tax. Risk Free Rate of Return I believe the risk free rate of return on equity for calculating capital gains tax mentioned in one of the proposals is unfair. •It increases risk for the investor in that the investor can be required to pay tax on non-existent profits. In a long period without any capital gain it could force unnecessary sales of property,or even bankruptcy on an otherwise healthy, if unspectacular, investment. •It does not reflect the costs of maintenance or depreciation •It will have the effect of taxing capital investment in a property to the detriment of tenants. A $4,000 heat pump might not increase the value of the property but that capital investment would be added to the investor's equity in the property and that increase would be the basis for an increase in capital gains tax even though it is a cost, not a gain. Inflation I find imposing a capital tax without an allowance for inflation is objectionable. There is no profit or gain in holding a house for30 years if, at the end of the term, it still only buys the basket of goods that it could at the beginning of that term. All that has happened is the value of the money has fallen. Alistair Saywell  A \[1\] The report argued that inflation is taxed in other situations. Income tax thresholds lag inflation but normally by only a few years so income tax does suffer some tax due to inflation it is relatively small. In the case of sales stock being marked up and sold at a higher price than previously so as reflect the costs of replacement stock, that happens only incidentally and does not carry on beyond that year. In the case of a long term investment like rental property, even a 2% rate of inflation can show huge apparent gains that don't reflect the reality that the house is not worth any more, say, sacks of potatoes, than when it was originally purchased. Exemptions The exemption of the family home will continue the trend of building larger homes and investing more money into that home. It seems unfair that my properties (basic but comfortable) will attract capital gains tax while a luxury house worth more than all mine in total will pay no tax. The exemption of cars, boats, works of art, etc. is proposed due to the apparent difficulty in determining what might be a profit or loss and what might be due to "consumption". However, this seems to promote inflationary bubbles for antiques, classic cars and boats, and art works. Ring Fencing I find the ring fencing proposals iniquitous. I have suffered losses in the past on housing and while I was younger I had time to make this up. With an average property taking several years before it starts making a profit most tax credits from a loss will have evaporated before any offset of tax could be made on them if some catastrophe forced a sale at a loss and I had to re-start. Increase in Rents The effect of a capital gains tax will be to increase rents. Standing costs of Rates, insurances, and provision for and actual maintenance are around $8,000. Add bank interest costs and there is not much margin left from a $20,000pa rental income; extra tax must be paid from increased rent. Recent increases from legislative requirements, rates increases, and bigger insurance premiums have already forced us to increase rents and I worry about our tenants and the disruptive social impact further costs will create. Thank you for your consideration Regards Alistair Saywell page 2 A

Date 30.10.2018 To The Tax Working Group c/0 Tax Working Group Secretariat P O Box 3724 Wellington Email secretariat@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Submission to the Tax Working Group I wish to make the submission outlined below concerning the proposed tax on unrealized capital for equity investments made through the New Zealand Stock Exchange. I do not wish to speak to my submission and make the comment that it has been a very short timeframe to lodge submissions and very concerned that this might be the only opportunity for people to make submissions to such an important document. Background I am a small retail shareholder of a portfolio of company shares, property shares and fixed interest investments, also a Trustee of a small family trust. As I mentioned above, the portfolio is small but forms an integral part of providing retirement income in addition to my single superannuation benefit so that I can remain living in the family home, pay insurance & rates AND pay for my medical insurance premiums which is very important to me as the public health system is very poor in the treatment of cancer patients particularly in a very timely manner using outdated drugs! I understand from the draft report that there is a proposal to introduce a variety of tax changes including the introduction of tax on different forms of capital gain. Also within this area of taxation, there is a proposal to include a tax on shares and other financial entities where the tax is to be calculated on any increase in value for each entity over each financial year. That is, a tax on improved theoretical or book value rather than realized value. What happens if there is a recession or downturn? I established my portfolio to provide income which was taxed when we were earning to accumulate finance to enable us to establish a portfolio in the first place and which we already pay tax on the dividends paid to me. Any capital gain should and usually reflects inflation and this allows for changes to income levels (usually by way of dividends) and so provides some inflation proofing to the income received. Superannuation barely covers basic living costs! \[1\] Page .........2 Submission I am against any form of capital gains tax on unrealized capital of any form! While I am not against paying income tax on any capital realized on the sale of share equity, I feel that where a capital loss is made on the sale of share equity, there should equally be a tax claim on the loss value. Also there should be some allowances made for inflationary influences on money values so any tax should be made after adjustments for inflation. The share market has been pretty good over the last few years and many shares have gained in value but despite this there are others that have lost value eg CBL, Mainzeal, Wynard, Pacific Edge, Seadragon, Fletcher Building, Sky Television, Pumpkin Patch, Pike River Coal to name a few where shareholders have lost all or a lot of their investment. Share values are also affected by exchange rates and global events. In fact the value of a portfolio varies daily according to share market trading. If the Tax Working Group is to target the share market and tax unrealized capital gains, then it should also target business balance sheets and tax their changes in book value of business assets. I hereby reiterate I AM AGAINST ANY FORM OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON UNREALIZED CAPITAL OF ANY FORM! (Mrs) Jane E Lyndon

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. www.innercitywellington.nz Page 1 of 3 Inner City Wellington’s Submission to the Tax Working Group on the Interim Report Introduction 1. Inner City Wellington (ICW) submitted during the previous round of submissions. We were pleased to see that seismic strengthening costs are informing the discussion leading to the recommendation to reinstate depreciation for commercial, industrial and multi-unit residential buildings. 2. ICW’s understanding of this recommendation is that it will not apply to residential owner- occupiers in multi-unit residential buildings. It will only benefit investor-landlords in residential multi-unit residential buildings. 3. ICW submits that there must be equity of treatment for all owners facing costs due to mandatory seismic strengthening requirements. 4. Commercial property owners and many investor residential landlords will be GST registered, and able to recover 15% off the costs imposed on them. Residential owner-occupiers, in general, cannot do this. Who benefits from the investment in mandatory seismic strengthening? 5. Mandatory seismic strengthening of earthquake-prone buildings is primarily driven by public safety. While private residential owner-occupiers may benefit from the increased protection of strengthened buildings, their property rights have been removed. 6. There is a significant public benefit gained from private owners undertaking mandatory seismic strengthening on earthquake-prone buildings. Mayor Lester’s recent letter of 15 October 2018 to the Minister for Building and Construction acknowledges this: ‘... the responsibility for strengthening earthquake-prone buildings sits in the first instance with the building owner. However, there are significant public benefits in assisting owners to strengthen, including the protection of human life and infrastructure, making the city resilient so there are minimal interruptions to critical economic activity, and the protection of important public buildings and heritage’. 7. The public safety and economic resilience drivers are the common theme in the media and from central and local government politicians. 8. Owners of commercial property gain an immediate private benefit on completion from being able to increase the rental and lease costs for property as tenants want buildings with a high seismic rating. To a lesser extent, investor residential landlords may see a similar private benefit through increased rentals, though landlords of earthquake-prone buildings are still getting market rental. 9. More importantly, the benefit is only realised once the owner-occupier sells their home. With the latest re-valuations in Wellington due to be released imminently, data will increasingly be available to assess the private benefit, or not, of strengthened buildings that have been sold. www.innercitywellington.nz Page 2 of 3 10. Residential owner-occupiers do not see an immediate private benefit from the funds invested in their property. The property valuation may recover the discounted value following the removal of the earthquake-prone status, but there is no guarantee that owners will see an increase that reflects the investment made. The interest paid on increased loans or loss of interest from savings used for the strengthening further depletes any capital gain. 11. ICW’s submission is that residential owner-occupiers are, in most cases, unable to claim GST refunds and are excluded from the possible re-instatement of depreciation on buildings, and there should be some tax relief to recognise the public benefit that is gained from their investment. Contribution to tax revenue by residential owner-occupiers 12. The following table provides costs and taxes paid for completed seismic strengthening projects in wholly or predominantly residential owner-occupier apartment buildings, and two buildings where planning and cost scoping is well underway. The calculation on the amount of profit and the PAYE are conservative. 13. For Buildings D and E, there would be between 1 and 3 years where residential owner- occupiers would have to find and pay for alternative accommodation; these costs are not included \*Project is in planning stages, costs are based on quantity surveyor estimates. Building B and C had a 28% and 16% increase in the tender prices. Strengthening work has not begun. 14. There is a significant contribution from residential owner-occupiers to Crown revenue for what is predominantly a public benefit. From only three buildings there is nearly $900,000 in taxes. Building D covers three physical buildings (3-4 levels in height) that have a Wellington City Council heritage status, with just over $1.6m in taxes to be paid by the owners in two body corporates. Forced into poor economic decisions by a one-size-fits-all policy 15. In Building E, the owners are very unlikely to complete the work as it is uneconomic. The owners are private home owners, not developers. Their only remaining options are to sell at Bldg ABldg BBldg C#Bldg D\*Bldg E\* Construction costs$1,565,319$534,817$1,528,400$7,906,050$25,000,000 Professional fees$313,064$156,532$384,725$1,976,829$6,250,000 Added value$173,924$178,272$319,021 Other costs$68,004 Contingency $5,000,000 Estimated total cost of project$2,052,307$869,621$2,300,150$9,882,879$36,250,000 Estimated breakdown of costs: Profit @ 5%$102,615$43,481$115,008$494,144$1,812,500 Materials @ 55%$1,128,769$478,292$1,265,083$5,435,583$19,937,500 Wages @ 40%$820,923$347,848$920,060$3,953,152$14,500,000 Income tax on profit of contractors @ 28%$28,732$12,175$32,202$138,360$507,500 PAYE on wages paid @ 17.5%$143,661$60,873$161,011$691,802$2,537,500 GST on project (only # GST reg Body Corp)$169,315$71,744$189,762$815,338$2,990,625 Tax Paid/Due\* to Government$341,709$144,792$382,975$1,645,499$6,035,625 Building Levy; Building Research Levy 1.45%$22,697$7,755$22,162$114,638$362,500 www.innercitywellington.nz Page 3 of 3 bargain-basement prices or do nothing and wait for the Council to initiate the legal processes, which includes the potential imposition of fines. 16. Both options force the owners out of their homes recovering little or no money, and in many instances leaving them with no home. 17. Some residential owner-occupiers may not make these investments if they had a choice about risks and their own safety in an earthquake – as residential owners in single household buildings do. The policy development has focused on public safety of commercial buildings occupied by tenants and people in public spaces around them – not the home-owners. Conclusion 18. Residential owner-occupiers are contributing 17% of the total cost in the Crown’s general fund to be used as the Government determines. 19. The mandatory seismic strengthening programme should be tax neutral for all owners. 20. Residential owner-occupiers are seeking financial recognition of the fact that they do not receive all the benefits ‘gained’ from an ‘investment’ imposed by legislation. The majority of the benefits are for public safety and the city and country’s economic resilience. 21. ICW seeks tax relief that recognises this contribution by residential owner-occupiers for a public benefit so there is equity for the tax relief available to GST-registered owners and those able to depreciate their buildings. 22. ICW would welcome an opportunity to meet with the Tax Working Group. For further information, please contact: Geraldine Murphy, Deputy Chair Inner City Wellington \[1\]

For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 From:Freda Woisin <action@campaignnow.co> Sent: Wednesday, 31 October 2018 7:53 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Reply submission to Tax Working Group's interim report and proposals Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission in reply to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Interim Report. Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. It is worrying that the governance of our tax collection system, seems Ad hoc. The taxes gst/ levies etc are gathered, redistributed through agencies, to top up rents, food, family benefits, which in turn subsidies, landlords, businesses. With the present housing crises, Government is putting citizens into motels. All because of poor long term stategies/immigration changes including extended families that put pressure on NZ welfare system, across political divide over the past 50 years, now due to unforseen factors we are getting snookered with rising collective debt. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth. I submit that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. 2 Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. As a single person, over the past 54 or so years as a taxpayer, there has been no or little government/public retirement scheme incentive(mr Muldoon squashed that option for us baby-boomers (think what that accumulated fund could have been used for as investment in NZ's infrastructure today?) We rely historically on the 'investment propeerty to prop up our retirement, sadly this is not an option for the majority of our tamariki and mokopuna. Definitely a siesmic change in mindset and culture is needed. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. In my view, Cenral Governments, Regional goverments/councils, district councils, Department of Conservation, NIWA ,Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Ministry of Primary Industries, have been remiss in not leading from the front regarding the Waste Minimistion Act 2008, to which all Councils have bylaws to promote waste minimisation and management. Now, we in Aotearoa (this whenua that is our home, gives us sustanance, shelter, water and wellbeing) are confronted in 2018 with at least 100 years of degrading and polluting our environment, rubbish, toxic dumps,slashing and burning, rubbish pits on private land and massive landfills- still kicking-pardon the pun- the can down the road. N ick Smith, Minister in the past Government launched a tyre recycling venture, how is that going? Grass roots citizens are leading the charge, lobbying for plastic/glass bottle deposit schemes, targeting fast-food companies, promoting composting, replanting vegetation along waterways. Action and collaboration is urgently needed - otherwise it will cost us all in the end. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is 3 progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Yours sincerely, Freda Woisin

SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP FUTURE OF TAX PREPARED BY AMP CAPITAL INVESTORS (NEW ZEALAND) LIMITED 1 November 2018 Confidential communication – This document is solely for the use of the party to whom it is provided. AMP Capital Investors (New Zealand) Limited TABLE OF CONTENTS Introduction 1 Economic efficiency and fairness 1 Specific comments and recommendations 1 Quality of legislation 1 Capital Gains Tax 1 Other considerations 3 Contact us 1 SUBMISSION | PREPARED BY AMP CAPITAL INVETORS (NZ) LIMITED 1 INTRODUCTION > We take this opportunity to thank the Tax Working Group and Officials for the effort and consideration they have undertaken in producing the interim report. > We do not necessarily agree with some of the comments in the report, and set out below are our thoughts and concerns on the content of the interim report. ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AND FAIRNESS > A major principle behind the proposals for the Tax Working Group is fairness. > Any capital gains tax (CGT) needs to be a comprehensive in order to be fair – that is, providing a level playing field. > Given the family home has been excluded from the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference, the introduction of a capital gains tax would not meet the criteria of a comprehensive CGT. SPECIFIC COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS > Taxpayers will have implementation issues for any proposals adopted from the interim report, due to the timing of the next Government forming in November 2020, confirmation of legislation by that Government likely to be December 2020, and the effect of legislation being 1 April 2021. ─ Businesses will be reluctant to undertake information technology (IT) design, build and testing prior to any proposals, such as the taxing of capital gains, until they are confirmed by the then Government. ─ This leaves a short period of time of four to five months to undertake IT build and testing before the effective date of legislation. ─ Depending on the design of the proposals, including the complexity of any capital gains tax, it is likely 12 to 18 months will be needed to undertake IT build and implement the appropriate changes. ─ Corporate taxpayer’s IT resources are, and will be, in the lead up to 1 April 2021, utilised to build other tax changes and reporting due to Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, eg payday reporting and Common Reporting Standards (CRS) requirements. ─ Inland Revenue will also need to undertake IT system changes for the implementation of Government proposals, and they will have the same issues as taxpayers. ─ We recommend that the implementation of any Tax Working Group proposals adopted by the then Government is deferred to at the earliest 1 April 2022, due to the issues outlined above. Quality of legislation > There is a short timeframe for drafting the legislation of around three months for any Tax Working Group proposals adopted by the Government based on the current timings. > Given the potential complexity of some of the proposals, ie taxing capital gains, it would be better for Policy Officials to spend more time designing, drafting and obtaining feedback from taxpayers. This requires longer than the usual six weeks on the proposed legislation, rather than rushing it through and having to spend time fixing issues and errors. > It is a waste of both Policy Officials and taxpayers’ time to go back and deal with fixing issues, errors on legislation and making changes, due to practical implications because it’s been rushed through the process. Capital Gains Tax > There needs to be consideration and understanding of the impact on the New Zealand capital markets of introducing new tax regimes like taxing capital income (CGT), as well as how non-resident investors will be treated under such a regime. > The effect of any capital gains tax introduced on New Zealanders needs to be considered and factored in, including: ─ as taxpayers will be paying CGT to the Government on certain assets this will lead to lower level of retirement savings for individuals, ─ individuals will have lower levels of income in retirement due to having decreased level of retirement savings or assets, ─ the lower levels of retirement income will result in more reliance on superannuation provided by Government, SUBMISSION | PREPARED BY AMP CAPITAL INVETORS (NZ) LIMITED 2 ─ whether moving to an EET (Exempt-Exempt-Taxed) approach for retirement savings would mitigate some of the impact of CGT on individual’s retirement assets, savings and income. Under an EET regime, contributions are made out of gross income, investment earnings would be tax exempt and withdrawals would be taxed. > If CGT is introduced, a staged approach should be considered and this could be determined by asset class. This would allow sufficient time for: ─ consideration of whether a CGT on a particular type of asset is appropriate, such as shares ─ the targeting of asset classes that are considered problematic, ie residential properties ─ consideration and resolution of issues relating to specific types of assets, such farms that have a business part as well as a family home portion, and ─ Inland Revenue and taxpayers in agreeing the cost base of assets in a timely manner (four years). > The more complex the CGT rules or regime, including exemptions, roll over relief and change in use of assets, the more IT system design, build and testing as well as processes and compliance work that will need to be undertaken by taxpayers, their advisors and Inland Revenue. > The introduction of a CGT regime will introduce significant record keeping requirements for all taxpayers. ─ Has thought been given to how taxpayers will meet the record requirements of the cost of an asset when an asset is sold say in 20 years’ time? ─ Further, how will the current statute bar rules work under a CGT regime, especially when assets are realised after significant time periods? ─ Should there be upfront agreement between Inland Revenue and taxpayers on asset cost bases? ─ What will be the ongoing filing requirements for asset cost bases for taxpayers? > Has a proper costs/revenue analysis of CGT been undertaken for this proposal that considers everyone, ie all forms of taxpayers, Inland Revenue, etc? Does this include the initial costs of complying, eg valuations, ongoing costs, and additional New Zealand superannuation payments due to lower retirement savings been undertaken? > There needs to be consideration and removal of any double taxation issues, such as taxing capital gains in listed PIEs and then taxing entities such as multi-rate PIEs on the shares they own in listed PIEs. PIE CONSIDERATIONS > The purpose of the PIE regime is to ensure the same outcome is achieved between individuals investing directly and those investing through managed funds. If this fundamental methodology is to remain, then the following considerations need to be undertaken. > Any double taxation issues for PIEs and PIE investors are eliminated. > If the accrual method is adopted for taxing all shares in PIEs: ─ this would provide a practical and workable solution given it is currently used for some forms of investments ─ this would remove the fair dividend rate (FDR) method and hedging issue ─ this should also be extended to all other investors. If it is not possible to extend this to other investors, then a rate of discount should be provided to all PIEs, so that their investors are not disadvantaged, ie they achieve a similar outcome to those investing directly. > If the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules and the fair dividend rate (FDR) method is adopted for taxing all equities: ─ it would assist if this regime is simplified. That is, there is only one method to apply that is only FDR, rather than having FDR and CV (comparative value) for any non-ordinary shares ─ the current rate of FDR at 5% is too high in comparison to the actual risk return rate and should be reset ─ the rate of any applicable FDR should be regularly reviewed, ie biennial, and any reset or change in rate, if required, be issued via determination by Inland Revenue ─ the FDR hedging rules were introduced to overcome the FDR and hedging issue. These rules are complex and in practice difficult to apply. Consideration needs to be given to simplifying these rules as well as widening the application of them, such as to PIEs that invest in other PIEs that hold securities subject to FDR ─ FDR is the tax methodology that most investors struggle to understand, including how the rate is set. Education from all parties, including Inland Revenue and Government, will continue to be important so that individual taxpayers understand the approach. SUBMISSION | PREPARED BY AMP CAPITAL INVETORS (NZ) LIMITED 3 Other considerations > The adoption of any transition rules and/or transition period for moving from the current approach to any new approach, eg for the introduction of taxing capital income. > The current unpaid role of institutions as tax collectors and data/information gatherers and providers for Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Government needs to be considered. These entities should be compensated for the costs they incur in undertaking these roles for Inland Revenue and the Government. > The introduction of new prescribed investor rates (PIRs) for KiwiSaver funds which will be different to those for multi-rate PIEs. ─ We query whether this proposal will achieve its objective of lower income taxpayers saving more given their level of income. ─ For providers of PIE IT platforms, new PIRs for KiwiSaver PIEs may cause some issues as PIR rates will be determined by PIE entity type rather than across all PIE types. ─ Generally, KiwiSaver and retirement schemes invest in wholesale funds (that are also PIEs) which hold the securities etc. There needs to be practical consideration undertaken on how the different PIRs and any income or information requirements will work throughout all PIE layers. ─ For providers that have investors who hold KiwiSaver funds and other investments not entitled to the new PIR rates, eg a superannuation fund, their system will need to store two tax rates for investors. This will most likely expand the data held and require IT system build. ─ There will need to be an educational piece around individual investors understanding why they can only have a particular tax rate for a specific entity type, if PIRs are different between KiwiSaver and retirement schemes. EDUCATION OF NEW ZEALANDERS > There will need to be a large piece of work on educating what the proposals adopted means for all taxpayers – from large corporates to individuals. This would include explaining what and how adopted approaches work. > There will also need to be a behaviour change piece, as taxpayers will need to file individual income tax returns, or at the very least go in and confirm information held by Inland Revenue due to taxing capital income or gains. This will be a major change in behaviour for at least one, if not more, generations of New Zealanders who have not filed income tax returns under the current regime. > Inland Revenue and wider Government will need to take a large role in educating all taxpayers on what any rules are, and changing behaviours such as all taxpayers filing income tax returns, even if this is through a confirmation approach.

Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on ordinary New Zealanders. Capital taxes need To be carefully considered, measured and aimed at capturing those who exploit the market through speculative ‘flips’ and land bankers rather than the general populous. Recognition of the limited cashflow of most Nw Zealanders is also required. We are cash poor by asset rich. A gain is only realised on sale and the focus needs to be specific to that rather than considering a tax payable every year. How can that be funded unless one earns significant income. In Auckland, even high earners are struggling to own homes. Let’s be realistic. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. A tax should avoid the family home or a family holiday home at all costs and focus on investment classes of property. I also have significant concerns relating to a proposed tax on holiday homes which is unworkable and would result in the large scale sell- off of holiday homes, flood the market, and result in a significant slump. I own a holiday home that was paid for by selling up I n Auckland, shifting to Tauranga and having enough left over to buy a holiday home so that we could have a place for our family for holidays and memories. That my family owns a holiday home is not because we are rich and the proposed tax would mean we would have to sell - it’s unaffordable and unrealistic. We would lose a lot of money selling in a flooded market. 2 Adding to my objections, the home hasn’t gone up in value. Whilst I do agree that some people benefit from large gains on such dwellings they are specific to locations. Our place has gone up in 10 years, yet would be penalised by a tax equivalent to a third of our take home income. How is that rational or realistic? We pay all our taxes now and work hard. I submit that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes and it needs to focus on investment classes of capital. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. Aside form that the emissions trading scheme assumes the rest of the world plays fair and equally when we know that it does not. Until a world wide consensus and unequivocal participation is reached a tax in NZ will be to the detriment of NZ businesses, achieve nothing and ignore the real issues of pollution and environmental damage. I support cleaning up our world but a tax does not do that. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low- price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. \[1\] 3 Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Yours sincerely, Brady Nixon

I've included some comments below on aspects with relevance to Trade Me's operations. Independent contractors We support the suggestion on page 96 that there is further investigation into technology platforms to assist self-employed contractors to meet their tax obligations. We believe this is preferable to extending the withholding tax obligation to payers. We regularly engage contractors (of varying scale). We think it's important that any policies that are considered in respect of payers to independent contractors are simple enough for an accounts payable officer to easily interpret and implement. GST We support a broad GST regime with few exceptions. We support the the status quo being continued in respect to fees for financial services and fresh fruit and vegetables. We see a huge range of goods traded over our site and have experience interpreting product requirements in respect of these goods. It would be very complicated to apply a different GST regime to different types of food. Retirement savings We have concerns regarding the option discussed on page 50 re the removal of ESCT from all employer matching contributions for employees earning up to $48k per year. How would employers administer this? For example, if an employee changed their employer within a year, we wouldn’t know whether or not that employee’s total remuneration for the year exceeded the $48k threshold. Additionally, an annual bonus payment could push an employee unexpectedly over the threshold which would create practical issues. Rather than requiring businesses to implement this change, we’d support the IRD crediting back to the relevant employee’s KiwiSaver fund any ESCT deductions where an employee did earn under $48k in a particular financial year. Capital gains tax We have two main areas of concern - maintaining the liquidity of capital markets and lock-in risks. Liquidity of capital markets If there is a shift to taxing the capital gains on shares in New Zealand companies but no change to the tax treatment of shares held in overseas companies, this could dis-incentivise kiwis from investing in New Zealand shares and increase investment in foreign shares. As a result, we support further consideration into what a capital gains tax would do to capital markets, and ensuring any new regime doesn’t have an adverse impact on the liquidity of New Zealand capital markets. Lock-in risks \[1\] 2 We're concerned that if a capital gains tax is introduced and it applies to capital gains of business assets or shares, companies will sit on under-performing assets rather than shift their capital into higher performing assets. It’s important that the tax regime encourages productivity, and that businesses can respond quickly and efficiently to changes in the economic environment. We operate within a group environment, and support that there should be no capital gains tax on internal corporate restructures. We consider that there should be no capital gains tax on payments for goodwill (on the basis these payments can conceptually be considered as a pre-payment of future taxable income). In a residential property context, we support a sensible rollover relief policy. It's crucial that any framework for a capital gains tax ensures the residential property market remains fluid and competitive. If the policy settings are inappropriate then this will further exacerbate current issues with housing affordability. Kind regards Lucy Lucy Elwood Head of Legal & Regulatory | Trade Me \[1\]

L evel 1, 56 Victoria Street, Wellington Central, Wellington, PO Box 10612, Wellington 6423 2 9 October 2018 Hon Sir Michael Cullen Chair of the Tax Working Group PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Dear Hon Sir Michael Response to Interim Report of the Tax Working Group In principle Spirits New Zealand supports the Tax Working Group’s (TWG) interim position recommending a review of the current structure of the excise system as applied to beverage alcohol. 1 We believe that the current system is complex and does not properly reflect externalities by beverage alcohol type. A system based on the volume of alcohol in beer, wine and spirits would be preferred as long as the assessment of this structure properly takes into account the true impact of each category. If this was the case then we believe we would see a flattening of excise levels without a reduction of tax take. Although we understand the TWG’s position to separate a review of the structure of the excise system from the level of excise applied we would contend that the two are inexorably linked and that they would need to be considered in parallel. We are aware, therefore, of a set of views put forward by, in particular, Alcohol Healthwatch purporting to make a case for a marked increase in the tax levied through alcohol excise. We do not intend to make a point by point rebuttal of their submission at this time but refer the TWG to our original submission that points out that evidence suggests the relationship between consumption and price is complex. Because of the linear nature of excise the impact of tax increases will have different impacts on different cohorts within a drinking population with light to moderate consumers reducing consumption significantly more than heavy drinkers. This position is supported by a most recent paper by Pryce, Hollingsworth and Walker (2018) 2 published after the first round of submissions had closed. In the conclusion to this paper the authors’ state: The results suggest that price-based policies may not be effective at reducing consumption amongst heavy drinkers without penalising lighter drinkers. 1 Tax Working Group Interim report pp 75 - 78 2 Pryce, R., Hollingsworth, B., & Walker, I. (2018). Alcohol quantity and quality price elasticities: Quantile regression estimates. European Journal of Health Economics. doi:10.1007/s10198-018-1009-8. \[1\] And in addition: If the price of alcohol increases by 10%, the lightest quartile of drinkers reduce their consumption by 7.1% compared to 3.5% for the heaviest quartile of drinkers. And lastly on this matter we note that the above comment has a cost/benefit implication based on the devised public health benefit of a reduction in heavy drinking as opposed to the impact on lighter drinkers and so on. We would point out that some groups often reference the public health cost of heavy drinking based on a recently (re) published review of externalities by BERL. We note this review has received some level of criticism from other economists 34 We acknowledge the TWG’s work to date in this area and, if government proceeds with a review, will expand in some detail on the brief comments made here.

Property Council supports the concept that all forms of income are treated equitably for ta x p urposes. While we initially gave conditional support, we do not think that the benefits from generally extending the taxation of capital income, including to real property, would outweigh the costs and negative consequences. We have come to this conclusion based on working through the various design features of the capital income taxation options outlined in Appendix B of the Tax Working Group’s Interim Report. Some of the key considerations for Property Council’s members include the need to minimise (or avoid) double taxation where commercial property is held through a company structure and to ensure that commercial property can continue to effectively and efficiently remain part of the productive economy. 1.2. A better approach, in our view, is to continue with New Zealand’s current practice of targeting specific problem areas, such as with the current bright line test for residential property (e.g. if the issue is housing affordability). For example, a targeted approach might be for listed companies with significant property assets, that are held for long term investment, to be taxed on share gains only (because that is where capital gains, if any, are typically realised) with those companies trading directly in property being taxed on property transaction but not share price gain. However, if the Tax Working Group recommends extending capital income taxation to commercial property, we outline some key design features that need to be given particular consideration. 1.3. Property Council strongly urges the Tax Working Group to follow through on its initial work which suggests that removal of tax depreciation on buildings in 2010 was the wrong tax policy. This has created significant tax disincentives to undertake much needed building improvements. We recommend that the Group’s final report includes the reinstatement of tax deprecation on commercial building structures as a matter of priority. 1.4. We also recommend that some form of tax treatment of seismic strengthening costs is implemented. 2.Pr operty Council Background 2.1. Property Council’s goal is the creation and retention of well-designed, functional and sustainably built environments which contribute to New Zealand’s overall prosperity. We support legislation that provides a framework to enhance economic growth, development, liveability and growing communities. 2.2. Property Council is a member-led, not-for-profit organisation offering a collective voice for the commercial property industry. The property industry is currently the largest industry in New Zealand with a direct contribution to GDP of $29.8 billion or 13%. In a sense the property sector is a foundation of New Zealand’s economy and caters for growth by developing, building and owning the buildings that house businesses. 2.3. Our membership includes some of the largest commercial property holders in New Zealand, including several significant NZX listed companies. These companies own commercial property providing reliable rental income return on savings invested by retirees through Kiwisaver and other superannuation funds. Our members include companies that undertake a range of large- scale residential and commercial development projects, including large commercial buildings, industrial parks, and retail precincts. 2.4. Property Council membership canvasses a broad range of commercial property ownership and management models – from those who own one or two properties directly through to large institutional and listed property entities. Our membership’s view on capital gains tax is equally broad and nuanced. As a consequence, our feedback focuses on the broad principles about the tax system’s interaction with the commercial property sector and proposes solutions of broad relevance to the industry as a whole. Individual members and sub-sectors are likely to have slightly different views on matters of detail. 3.Int roduction 3.1. Property Council wishes to thank the Tax Working Group for acknowledging our submission and engaging with our members through your development of you Interim Report. We again wish to offer our assistance in helping the Tax Working Group work through some of the issues to ensure a fair and equitable tax system moving forward. 3.2. Commercial property is an inextricable part of the productive economy. Almost all businesses need a building (or buildings) from which to operate. This is as true for manufacturing and logistics as it is for tourism and hospitality as it is for professional and financial services. Their machines, computer servers or kitchen/dining areas need to be housed somewhere. It is crucial that any extension of capital income taxation to the commercial property sector does not disincentivise the investment needed to house businesses in fit-for purpose buildings (and for those buildings to be regularly upgraded to remain fit-for-purpose). The ability for commercial property to evolve will become even more important as the economy transitions ever more rapidly as expected it will in the near to medium future. 4.De sign of Capital Income Taxation 4.1. In looking at how to design a capital income system that will minimise disincentives for investment in commercial property, Property Council sees that there are a number of important ‘factors’ that need to be considered: •Commercial property is part of the productive economy •Commercial buildings depreciate and become obsolete • Investment in commercial property undertaken via multiple vehicles and business structures, each with unique characteristics and challenges – a one size fits all approach will not work • Commercial property tends to be capital intensive • Commercial property investors target rental income (rather than specifically capital gains), in contrast to residential property investment which tends to be low rental yield, high capital gain 4.2. To consider those ‘factors’ Property Council considers that the important ‘principles’ when considering the design of a capital income tax should be: • Double taxation should be avoided (or minimised) where investment in commercial property is via a corporate or other similar entity structure. • Compliance and administration costs (for both the taxpayer and IRD) should be minimised to the maximum extent possible. In particular, the current ease of compliance for investors under the PIE tax regime should not be disturbed. • Disincentives to upgrading assets should be avoided (or minimised), given the importance of safe and environmentally friendly building stock for New Zealand’s economic and social prosperity. 4.3. We believe that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to design a general system of capital income taxation that would fully achieve the above objectives having regard to the various design issues outlined in Appendix B of the Tax Working Group’s Interim Report. Therefore, we question the ability to deliver a workable system. 4.4. However, we comment below on the key design considerations if the Tax Working Group decides to recommend extending capital income taxation to encompass commercial property gains (and losses) in its February 2019 Final Report. When to Tax Capital Income 4.5. Taxing capital income in relation to commercial property on realisation is the simplest and fairest option. We do not support taxing on an accrual basis (whether annual gains or under a Risk Free Return method (RFRM) basis). 4.6. The primary reason for this is that to pay the tax on an accruals basis will be an issue for many landlords. While this is true regardless of ownership structure, it will be particularly acute for small commercial property investors (including “mum and dad” investors who might hold one to two properties). 4.7. Similarly, an RFRM for commercial property is not supported on the basis that this would also create cashflow, valuation and ultimately fairness issues – with tax being charged regardless of actual commercial property value movements. We believe an RFRM would be akin to a “land tax” (albeit including on value of capital improvements), which the Tax Working Group does not support, and suffers the same drawbacks. 4.8. Taxing on a realisation basis would address the cash flow constraint for commercial property investors and be most consistent with other forms of income taxation. This would also be consistent with the Tax Working Group’s intention of extending the income tax regime rather than introducing a new standalone tax regime. 4.9. The Interim Report appears to favour a “valuation day” approach, if capital income taxation on realisation is adopted. Property Council strongly supports grandfathering of any historical capital returns to ensure fairness – property owners should not be penalised via tax on past capital growth. 4.10. While a valuation date (coupled with a ‘median’ rule) would ensure that only gains from the application date are taxable, it will force all commercial property owners to seek independent valuations. This will come at considerable cost, and scope for dispute with Inland Revenue (including even if an independent valuation is sought). 4.11. One option to mitigate this risk is to apply any change only to acquisition of new property (i.e. on or after 1 April 2021). Alternatively, there needs to be flexibility – e.g. for valuations undertaken within a prescribed period, say 6 months, either side of the application date should be accepted. This will help avoid a rush on valuations (and the consequent price increases from valuers in sudden increased demand) and accommodate entities that do not have a 31 March balance date. It will also allow companies to ‘align’ their entry valuation with any pre-exiting valuation schedule they may already have for other commercial purposes. Companies (and individuals) should also have the option of using the ‘Council valuation’ if they do not wish to pay for a separate valuation. This may potentially under or over value their property at the application date. However, these “unders and overs” should net out such that Government is not unduly impacted. 4.12. An accrual basis would introduce a lot of risk and subjectivity to the tax system. Accrual taxation would require annual valuations which are not only costly but also subject to variation, whether accidental or otherwise. This could result in either a large windfall gain or unexpected loss for the taxpayer (and vice versa for Government’s revenue stream). 4.13. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that commercial property values can move quite rapidly both up and down. An accrual-based capital gains tax could cause the tax take to vary widely, especially during down periods. Conversely taxing on realisation should better smooth the ups and downs. This will lead to greater stability in the tax take. Compliance Costs 4.14. Overseas experiences with capital gains taxes has shown that most are complex, with multiple rules and exceptions that are costly to administer. That is contrary to key principles of the New Zealand tax system which is “simplicity” and “ease of compliance”. 4.15. To date New Zealand has dealt with particular policy problems by devising specific rules to account for the issues specific to the particular type of asset. Property Council supports that philosophy in preference to a broad-based extension of capital income taxation that attempts to be a one size fits all approach. While at first glance having bespoke rules might seem complex and cumbersome, overseas experience shows that having a broad capital gains tax leads to many perverse consequences that require numerous exceptions (for example, we note the Tax Working Group’s conclusion that most private assets should simply be excluded due to complexity). These exceptions lead to a greater risk of loopholes, tax avoidance and unintended outcomes than designing specific rules to address the specific issues at hand. 4.16. Compliance costs become even harder to predict when one tries to account for the large variety of different ways individuals or companies might own property. Taxing capital income might be quite simple for a single investor who owns one or two properties directly when they sell. It will be easy to assess who to tax and how much to tax on sale. It gets increasingly complex when more people own a portfolio of properties some of whom might use the income to retire on while others want to reinvest for rental income or long-term returns. The picture gets even more complex when the owner is a private company with multiple shareholders, especially if the income from the company and/or shares are also taxed – raising the spectre of double taxation (which we discuss below). Complexity increases again for listed companies and entities, which can be further muddied if they are PIEs, not to mention the different treatments of listed versus multi-rate PIEs. The sheer multitude of these different vehicles for commercial property investment makes it equally difficult for taxpayers to comply and Inland Revenue to assess compliance. It significantly increases the risk of loopholes and perverse consequences. 4.17. Additional compliance costs will also be incurred by the need for valuations of assets to ensure the correct amount of tax is paid. This will be particularly acute if an accruals-based capital taxation system is adopted, but will also be a problem under a realised gains system. We foresee potential disputes with Inland Revenue over starting valuations, unless any recommendation applies a “new assets acquired” only approach. Double Taxation 4.18. A key concern for the commercial property sector is the high likelihood of double taxation under a capital gains tax regime that applies both to commercial property gains at the entity level and investors’ share value movements. This is because the majority of commercial property investment is done through companies and other entities (both listed and unlisted), which are opaque for tax purposes. Those entities’ share prices are linked to both the rental income from the properties as well as the overall value of their asset base. Taxing the entity on realised capital gains of its property assets, but also separately taxing the investor on their share price gains (which will be closely correlated to those property gains) will give rise to double taxation if investors are taxed before the property is sold. 4.19. A key feature of the current New Zealand tax system is avoiding (or minimising) double taxation. This is done through a variety of mechanisms including imputation and more successfully, in our view, the PIE rules for both listed and unlisted entities. In theory the risk of double taxation should be ameliorated through the imputation system, but in practice this will not be the case as it requires tax to be paid at the company level first for this to be available to minimise double tax for investors’ gains. The actual tax situation of different property investment companies and different investors varies widely – for example, it is much more straight forward for private companies as they will have a greater degree of control over investment decisions to align with the activity of their shareholders. 4.20. The situation is not straight-forward for widely-held commercial property-owning entities (see below). Mechanisms to avoid double taxation will be needed but are likely to be complex. This will increase compliance and administration costs and the risks of non-compliance. PIE Regime 4.21. Because of the capital intensive and long-term nature of commercial property it is a very risky asset class to invest in directly and can require significant capital investment over time. Given the critical importance commercial property plays in the productive economy (essentially housing all businesses) this is an economic risk. Taking a portfolio approach to commercial property investment sensibly spreads the short-term risk and allows realisation of predictable long-term income. This is a key reason why many superannuation funds, including Kiwisaver funds, take a portfolio approach to investing in commercial property. 4.22. The PIE taxation regime was introduced in New Zealand to help level the (tax) playing field for investment directly and through entities holding diversified investments (including diversified commercial property), recognising that tax should not disadvantage intermediated savings. Property Council membership includes both listed and multi-rates PIEs. While specific to New Zealand, it is a system that has worked very well and is simple for investors to understand. Property Council strongly supports continuation of the PIE regime and its key features and the need to address any double taxation risks. 4.23. The impacts from potential extension of capital income taxation to listed (and multi-rate) PIEs are varied and complex. We have not sought to deal with these issues in our submission. Property Council endorses and supports the separate submission made by some of our listed property PIE members specifically on the issues for the PIE regime. Roll-over Relief and Asset Lock In 4.24. On the whole, commercial property investment is generally a long-term strategy. It tends to be driven by rental income returns rather than capital gains. Capital gains when assets are sold tend to be re-invested by buying more property and in upgrading existing assets rather than distributing the gains to shareholders. This is the way most Property Council members operate. 4.25. A key risk in introducing any form of taxation of capital gains is that building owners will be disincentivised to sell or upgrade their buildings to avoid a tax bill (asset lock-in). This is a drag on the productive economy as commercial property needs to remain fit-for-purpose to enable New Zealand businesses to improve their productivity and profitability. This is particularly risky given that we know the New Zealand economy will need to evolve and transition rapidly as the global economy, the nature of work and how it is carried out, and societal expectations around building safety and environmental impact, change rapidly. 4.26. A key way to prevent asset lock-in is through availability of rollover relief from capital gains tax liabilities provided the company or investor uses the proceeds of any sale to reinvest in a similar capital asset (through the acquisition or development of new assets or redevelopment of existing assets). This encourages commercial property owners to upgrade their properties, which may include selling one and buying a bigger and/or more fit-for-purpose property. Rollover relief is, we believe, important for commercial property investors, particularly smaller investors, who are buying into the same market they are selling in. Taxing the capital appreciation when the intention is to reinvest will compromise their ability to invest in a new, better, asset and act a disincentive to make investment decisions that are for the overall benefit of “NZ Inc” thus damaging the productive economy. We believe it is important to take this wider perspective, rather than just applying a tax lens. 4.27. Property Council acknowledges the downside for Government is that rollover relief will defer tax revenue. The incentive to reinvest the proceeds of sale will also increase as the accumulated tax liability increases over time. Putting some boundaries around what is needed to qualify for roll-over relief and how long that relief can be claimed may help mitigate the risk for tax collection purposes. 4.28. However, this again illustrates to us the difficulties of designing a capital income taxation regime that is workable, which raises sufficient revenue for Government but does not create skewed economic and investment incentives for commercial property owing businesses. Designing a rollover relief mechanism to suit the wide variety of investment strategies of various commercial property owners will be complex, especially since some will buy new high-quality properties, some will buy lower value properties to upgrade (using some of the capital) and others will use the capital to upgrade existing properties. Ensuring equity across these different but perfectly legitimate scenarios will be difficult and require trade-offs, increasing compliance and administrative costs with any proposals. Deduction of Capital Expenses 4.29. A key principle underlining the Tax Working Group’s suggestion that capital income taxation be extended to cover more assets is equity and consistency between asset classes. On that basis any capital gains tax on commercial property needs to allow deductions for capital expenses. This will ensure that property assets are treated similarly to expenses on all other business assets. Revenue from taxing commercial property capital income gain 4.30. Property Council notes that any design of capital gains tax will be complex and likely involve high compliance costs for taxpayers. This will be especially true to avoid potential double taxation if both commercial property assets are taxed at the entity level and shareholders of these entities are also taxed. 4.31. Most commercial property companies sell assets for strategic reasons to implement a changed property investment strategy or to upgrade other properties in the portfolio. These strategic sales are often done regardless of whether the properties are sold at a profit or a loss. 4.32. Calculations by some Property Council members show that the majority of their strategic sales are neutral or at a loss when capital expenditure and other expenses are accounted for. Importantly where there have been capital gains, none of the companies distributed those profits to shareholders, rather the gains were reinvested in further commercial property or used to strengthen the balance sheet of the company through de-leveraging. This suggests that the revenue raised from the commercial property sector from extending capital income taxation may be small. In the case of listed property entities, it may also suggest that capital gains should be reflected in their share prices and any realised capital gains made on shares will be taxed at the shareholder level. 5. Depreciation 5.1. Property Council believes the previous Government’s decision to remove tax depreciation on commercial building structures conflated residential and commercial property as a single asset type and did not recognise the different economic roles they play. We are pleased that Officials advice to the Tax Working Group supports the view that commercial property does in fact depreciate. 5.2. We think the case for restoring depreciation is strong, principled and stands on its own merits. In relation to the latter, it should not be linked to decisions around extending capital income taxation to commercial property. 5.3. Depreciation of business assets used to generate taxable income is a cost of doing business. We believe it is illogical for one business asset – commercial property – to be treated very differently from other business assets. New Zealand is currently one of only a handful of countries in the world that does not allow depreciation of commercial property. 5.4. Commercial building structures, like machinery and durable consumer goods, become obsolete over time and need replacing or upgrading. Building structures, including their services and fitouts all become obsolete over time. Obsolescence of commercial buildings occurs as business needs, tenant expectations, standards (building and environmental) and technology changes over time. 5.5. While our primary focus is on the depreciation of commercial buildings (office, retail and industrial), multi-unit residential buildings also become obsolete overtime to a significantly greater degree than standalone residential buildings. This is because multi-residential buildings have similar building standard regulatory risk and are generally engineered and constructed to a similar high standard as commercial buildings. 5.6. By not recognising that commercial building structures become obsolete and depreciate, current tax law is acting as a disincentive to continuous improvement of New Zealand’s building stock. This has hindered building owners undertaking building upgrades and seismic strengthening. This represents an economic cost in unrealised productivity increases and environmental gains that could be gained from the building stock being upgraded. 5.7. Property Council therefore strongly urges the Tax Working Group to recommend reinstatement of tax depreciation on commercial property structure in line with the officials recommendation “that tax depreciation for commercial, industrial and multiunit residential buildings be reinstated at a 2% straight-line or 3% diminishing value rate” (7.6 of Appendix C). This would recognise the contribution the commercial property sector plays in the productive economy, remove current tax disincentives to earthquake strengthening which is necessary to promote safe and sustainable buildings. To be clear, this recommendation would not provide landlords with a tax incentive. It is simply about reflecting the true economic cost from technical obsolescence, for tax purposes, similar to any other business asset. 5.8. Property Council recognises that there is a fiscal cost to reinstating depreciation on commercial buildings and in order to achieve the Government’s objective of a ‘revenue neutral package’ that cost will need to be made up from revenue raising elsewhere. As noted above we do not believe extension of capital income taxation to commercial buildings is likely to generate a large amount to revenue. Therefore, the Tax Working Group will need to look at other ways to ensure restoration of tax depreciation can be revenue neutral. We appreciate this may appear self- interested, however, the 2010 tax changes disproportionately affected commercial property landlords who effectively funded a large chunk of the previous Government’s tax cuts for individuals and businesses. This is simply correcting that previous tax policy error. 6. Seismic Strengthening 6.1. Property Council strongly agrees with the TWG finding that “the current approach \[to treatment of seismic strengthening\] results in a counter-intuitive outcome: deductions may be claimed if a building collapses in an earthquake, but no deductions may be claimed on expenditure that will prevent the building from collapsing.” It is a public good and a public safety issue as much as it is a private property issue. The treatment of seismic strengthening is an anomaly in the tax system that needs to be urgently corrected, regardless of whether the TWG recommends a capital gains tax or not. 6.2. If a capital gains tax is recommended, seismic costs can be dealt with either as expenditure deductions from the capital gain or through use of depreciation rules. The advantage of using depreciation rules is that that will work regardless of whether there is a capital gains tax or not. Depreciation of seismic strengthening costs can also be implemented immediately. The depreciation rules can be set to account for early movers who have already strengthened their buildings so they are not disadvantaged for making their buildings safe before the rules were changed. 6.3. The details of how a depreciation mechanism for seismic strengthening might work are set out in Property Council’s letter to the TWG of 12 June 2018 and are not repeated here. 7. Transactional, Wealth and Land Taxes 7.1. Property Council supports the Tax Working Group’s conclusions recommending against further consideration of financial transaction taxes and any form of wealth tax, including land taxes. We agree that these would be complex form of taxation that would likely reduce the integrity of the tax system. 8. Conclusion 8.1. In Property Council’s view, having now worked through the various design issues for extending the taxation of capital income (in Appendix B of the Interim Report), we believe that it will be incredibly difficult to design a system that is workable, and acceptable – i.e. achieves the Government’s fairness objectives, raises sufficient revenue, is simple for taxpayers to understand and apply and for Inland Revenue to administer, and does not double tax investors in companies or penalise investment decisions (including reinvestment). 8.2. On that basis, Property Council’s revised view, is that the various costs of extending taxation of capital income more comprehensively are likely to outweigh the benefits. Therefore, we strongly urge the Tax Working Group to consider whether such a change is warranted and, importantly, sustainable over time. We believe that issues (e.g. housing affordability) could be better addressed through ‘bespoke’ solutions 8.3. If the Group’s final recommendations do include further extensions to the taxation of capital income, we have outlined above the key design considerations which are of concern to Property Council’s members. 8.4. Separately, the current tax system disincentivises the upgrading of commercial building stock. This is a drag of the productive economy and will limit the ability of the New Zealand economy to evolve and transition rapidly to changing global and societal trends. To that end we recommend that tax depreciation of commercial property structures is reinstated as there is clear evidence that commercial properties do depreciate. 8.5. Property Council thanks the Tax Working Group for the opportunity to provide feedback on the Interim Report. We would also like to speak to our feedback and ask that the Tax Working Group consider this. 8.6.

One option mentioned in the Interim Report (at page 106) concerns the tax loss continuity rules: The \[Tax Working\] Group believes the existing loss continuity rules are appropriate for most companies, but may not be working well for small start-up firms. These firms require equity capital to grow, but are often inherently loss-making. The existing loss continuity rules may be constraining their ability to grow through additional equity capital. Any relaxation of the rules would need to be carefully calibrated to ensure that the change does not facilitate trading in losses among larger firms. 2.The current loss continuity rules are not, in our view, appropriate. The current rules are a barrier to businesses (large and small) raising the additional capital they need in order to grow. 3.We submitted to the TWG on 27 April 2018 regarding a proposal to improve the current policy settings. The proposal is to supplement the current rule (requiring 49% continuity of ownership to carry forward tax losses) with a rule that losses can also be carried forward so long as the company's business (regardless of size) remains the same or similar. Submission 4.The TWG should recommend this proposal as: (a)The proposal would remove a barrier that inhibits large and small businesses from raising new capital. In a recent speech, the Secretary of the Treasury observed that "the question of properly functioning markets isn't simply about whether big or small firms can compete. It's about all markets and whether they are functioning well." 1 1 Gabriel Makhlouf, Secretary of the Treasury "Improving Living Standards: We Need to Talk About Productivity" (Queenstown, 7 September 2018). 3632645 v1 2 of 2 (b) The proposal would make the tax system more neutral, by reducing the asymmetric tax consequences of successful risk taking (resulting in profit on which tax is paid) compared to unsuccessful risk taking (resulting in a loss that not only does not result in a refund, but may have no value if a change of ownership occurs). (c) Inland Revenue officials have already undertaken work regarding both the substantive proposal and possible implementation costs, and have estimated the cost at between $30 million and $60 million per annum. By comparison, the Government intends to spend over $1 billion over four years on its R&D tax credit package. The proposed same or similar business test for carrying forward tax losses would represent, at a relatively modest cost, an important companion reform to the R&D tax credit package, and would remove an impediment to businesses accessing additional capital in order to grow. (d) Implementing the proposal would bring New Zealand into line with the rules in comparable countries. 5. We would be happy to provide further information or meet with the TWG if that would assist.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submission on Future of Tax Interim Report Making the extension to taxation of capital effective and practical Taxing capital gains is equitable It is equitable as well as efficient to equally tax all forms of income generated from capital – whether that is interest, rent or capital gains realised after a short or long time. This is clearly not the situation currently. Take the example of two rental properties of identical value purchased with the help of a mortgage – one has high rent so generates a good annual cash return but gets little capital appreciation, and the other has low rent so barely breaks even after expenses but gets good capital growth. If they are both held for 10 years and then sold, the seller of the high rent property has paid considerably more in income tax than the seller of the low rent property who gets a big tax-free capital gain on sale. It could be that both investors have put in identical amounts of capital and earned identical amounts of cash, but one pays far more tax than the other – where is the equity in that? Taxing capital gains on realisation causes problems and will raise little revenue initially Capital gains are generally lumpy, being irregular and often large (like the sale of rental properties). Taxing these capital gains only when realised (when a sale occurs) causes a number of problems like discouraging sales of capital assets (lock-in) and giving an advantage from tax deferment. It also means there would be no significant revenue raised for some years from taxing all realised capital gains – assuming only gains accrued after the tax change is introduced are taxed (as qualifying assets are sold). Delaying taxing capital gains until realisation makes the tax impost hugely uncertain The delay caused by taxing capital gains only when realised also makes the amount of the tax hugely uncertain. A ‘retirement nest egg’ rental property could well be owned for 20 years before selling for example. Trying to look ahead over such a long period means it will be very uncertain how much tax, if any, will apply to the gain on sale. It is inevitable that several different governments of different political hues will come and go over such a time frame. The taxation of capital gains is a contentious issue so there is bound to be ongoing lobbying for various concessions and exemptions that will make their way into the regime. The delay and uncertainly will severely blunt the effect of taxing gains on realisation The delay and uncertainty that comes from taxing capital gains only on realisation means investors are highly likely to heavily discount their possible capital gains tax liability when thinking about the price they will pay for a capital asset they intend to hold for a while. People are generally not good at acting rationally when making decisions about the longer term anyway – which is why there are usually various incentives or compulsions for saving for retirement. This inevitable discounting of the impact of the future taxation of capital gains may explain why capital gains taxes appear to have done little to lessen house price inflation in many countries around the world. Taxing capital gains as they accrue creates a different set of problems An alternative to taxing capital gains on realisation is to tax them as they accrue – like taxing annual increases in value. While this would mean investors would start paying tax on any capital gains almost straight away, this option brings a whole different set of problems. First there is the practical difficultly of fairly determining how much gain has accrued each year. Secondly, there is the serious potential liquidity problem of taxing the accrued gain on an asset that has generated little or no cash. The accrued gain could in some years be huge compared to the ‘cash return’. Example A An Auckland rental property of $1 million might rise in value by 15% in a good year so generating an accrued income of $150,000 compared to its net rental income of maybe $31,000! Even assuming there is no mortgage against the property, at tax rate of 33% that would leave a cash deficit of $39,270 or $755 a week! Not surprisingly, the Tax Working Group (TWG) is not proposing to tax capital gains as they accrue. A less problematic alternative is taxing deemed returns A kind of compromise between taxing capital gains on realisation and taxing them on accrual is taxing deemed returns like the TWG is considering for certain classes of assets. If applied more generally, a deemed-return tax would take a capital asset like a rental property and assume the risk free rate of return is earned, maybe 2.5% of its value, and treat this as income earned regardless of actual expenses. An alternative could be to deem a higher rate of return, reasonable for the asset class, and allow expenses to be deducted. There still has to be a valuation process but getting total precision with the value would not be as crucial as with taxing accrued gains (when the difference between the current value and value in the preceding year would be all important). The rating valuation system may generally give a sufficiently accurate value. Taxing deemed returns would still create significant liquidity problems for some Applying a deemed rate of return tax wouldn’t produce the lumpy income that taxing accrued gains would. However, while taxing deemed returns would produce a reasonably consistent income figure, it could still impose significant liquidity problems. Rental properties, for example, often do not break even after expenses and interest. While some landlords are willing to have properties that make a loss for several years or more because of the likely capital gains down the track, imposing a substantial tax impost each year in addition to having to cover the loss could hit them hard. Example B Applying the deemed rate of return approach to a $1 million Auckland rental we might use a risk-free rate of 2.5%. This gives a deemed income of $25,000 per year or $480 a week. A reasonable rent for such a property might be $700 a week with expenses of $100, leaving $600 a week profit and generating a return of 3.1% so the deemed income approach leaves the landlord better off, at least in a year with low property expenses. Example C If the $1 million rental is purchased with a mortgage for 60% of the price, an interest rate of 5% and term of 20 years, this gives a weekly repayment amount of $911 – a shortfall of $311 a week but if it is changed to an interest-only mortgage the cost is reduced to $577 a week which allows the rental to just break even. There is virtually no surplus cash to pay tax on the $480 a week of deemed income – which with a marginal tax rate of 33% generates a tax liability of $190 a week or $8,250 for the year. A better alternative would be a ‘minimum provisional capital income’ A more pragmatic proposal for extending the taxation of capital with less likelihood of causing a significant liquidity squeeze would be to deem a ‘minimum provisional capital income’ (MPCI) to be earned from qualifying assets. The rate for calculating the MPCI could be set at a very low percentage like 0.5% of the value of the capital asset. It would mean at least a minimal amount of regular income is attributed to qualifying capital assets, with an eventual ‘wash up’ on the realisation of those assets. The MPCI works like an advance payment of capital gains tax. Since a MPCI would apply from day one, investors would take notice but at the same time the low amount of minimum income imposed means it should not be an undue burden. Because it is a minimum, it also wouldn’t apply if the asset was actually producing taxable income greater than the MPCI. Example D If the MPCI calculation rate is 0.5% then our $1 million Auckland rental property generates a minimum provisional capital income of $5,000 or $96 a week, which at a marginal tax rate of 33% gives a tax liability of $1650 or $32 a week compared to negligible taxable income and tax for income tax purposes when there is a $600,000 5% mortgage. Example E If the mortgage on the rental is $200.000 then the interest cost is $192 a week, leaving a surplus for tax purposes of about $400 a week or $20,000 a year. The MPCI does not apply in this case as the minimum income of $5,000 is surpassed. Since the MPCI is provisional, there is a wash-up when the asset is sold and the exact gain (or loss) determined. Any incremental MPCI already returned (the difference between the income otherwise calculated for income tax purposes and the higher income of the MPCI) is allowed to be taken into account. This incremental MPCI goes into a capital income credit account (CICA) each year to be carried forward until the asset is sold. Example F To illustrate how the wash up works we go back to our $1 million Auckland rental with a $600,000 5% interest only mortgage generating no income for income tax purposes, so has the whole $5,000 of MPCI (on which tax is paid) going into the CICA each year. If this happens for 5 years in a row (for the sake of simplicity) and the property is then sold for a capital gain of $200,000, there is $25,000 in the CICA to credit against the realised gain so the taxable gain on wash-up is $175,000. Example G If market is flat market so there is no capital gain then the $25,000 in the CICA is used in the sale year to offset any other taxable income of the taxpayer. Any amount not able to be used is carried forward to use in following years. MPCI calculation rate can be gradually increased and reduced if necessary Because the MPCI is provisional, the rate applied to calculate it doesn’t have to be set in reference to anything and can easily be varied from year to year. This allows a ‘suck and see’ approach with an initial very low calculation rate applied to see what happens to qualifying capital assets. The rate can be gradually ramped up over time so investors are not unduly shocked, and any falls in the price of assets it hits the hardest are limited. The rate can be reduced if necessary. Dealing with intangible assets The MPCI would apply only to intangible assets that can be easily valued so not business goodwill, for example, unless it was purchased goodwill. Dealing with capital losses The TWG acknowledge if capital gains on qualifying assets are always taxed then there is an equity argument for allowing the recognition of capital losses, but this has to be managed to discourage gaming. Capital losses at wash-up could be restricted to being gradually realised over say 5 years. Example H If we take the circumstances of Example F but there is a capital loss on sale of $10,000, the balance in the CICA of $25,000 is allowed as an immediate reduction in taxable income. A capital loss of $2,000 is also able to be used in that year with a further $2,000 loss able to be used in each of the following 4 years. Submitted by Anthony Morris, 31 Oct 2018

Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be treated no differently. Inflation (which appears to be gathering momentum) pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, resulting in a higher tax burden for the same gross income. Whilst the Working Group claims that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds”, New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010; this is why the National Party promised substantial tax cuts, following the general election - but those cuts were abolished by the current coalition government. In the last eight years, average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD; the result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. It should be the Government's primary objective to increase New Zealand’s productivity and thereby encourage greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment: this approach can only lead to fiscal stagnation, at best, and stagflation at worst. I submit that the Working Group should recommend against implementing new capital taxation. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement, then there should be an exemption to cover the inflation component of interest income from tax. Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order t o ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. 2 Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of further increasing the tobacco excise, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. The cost of alchol abuse, to the health and social services, is unsustainable; scarce resources are diverted from other, more pressing needs. Alcohol has never been cheaper, relative to average income. I submit that alcohol should be subject to unit pricing, and that the scale adopted should represent an approximate increase in duty of 100%. Sugar taxes cannot reasonably be imposed unless and until there is more robust research into competing models of taxation in this area. Arguably, a similar case can be made with regard to the salt content of manufactured foodstuffs. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Yours sincerely, Dr Graham Cliff

I also note that the government has today announced more in the tax take than was projected, so there is no plausible reason why this tax working group is STILL going ahead and looking for ways to get hold of even more money from us, the public. Indexation of income tax brackets Inflation pushes up the cost of living without adding any additional value. Therefore, income tax thresholds should be indexed to inflation, otherwise people just keep getting put into higher tax brackets and end up paying more tax, but realistically, being no better off because their money doesn't buy as much. Capital gains taxation This is a terrible idea. It reeks of "asset envy". My husband and I have worked very hard for decades and have managed to pay off the mortgage on the first modest little home we bought in one of the lowest socio-economic suburbs in Wellington. This meant that we went without holidays or overseas holidays for decades, and without eating out unless it was on a very special occasion; we also restricted our grocery spending and scrimped on clothing etc. We have never been on a benefit but have worked hard - sometimes my husband has worked 7 days a week for 10 -12 hour days - in order for us to raise our children and pay down our mortgage. We recently moved to a lifestyle block 2 hours away to give our younger children the opportunity to learn how to grow food, raise animals, and live in a less stressful environment etc etc. We have a huge mortgage on our lifestyle block. We currently commute each week between the different houses to enable us to work for $$ in the city so we can hopefully retire to the country in 10 years time. To be asking us to pay MORE tax on one of these properties (we already pay rates which is a tax) is criminal. We already pay the highest rate of tax and get no relief for the fact that we are raising children. We are being responsible people and you are wanting to penalise us. We already pay for the benefits of several people every year and now we'll be asked to pay for them whilst we are trying to keep our own heads above water. The cost of living has risen dramatically in NZ over the past few years and it is becoming increasingly harder to provide our family with food and clothing. To be asking us, as Gareth Morgan put forward in his election 2017 policy, to pay tax on the assets we have bought with great personal sacrifice and with ALREADY-TAXED money is theft as far as we are concerned. We are attempting to start a small business with our adult children and if you tax us more, we'll have even less capital to start it off with. We don't want our children dependent on the state, although we're aware that this is what socialist governments thrive on. 2 As far as we're concerned, equality of opportunity is fine, but there will never be equality in outcomes which is what we believe this working group and the current government is attempting to bring about through taxation. There will always be people who have no ambition, or are not willing to put their head down to get a good education, or are just too lazy or don't know how to put their money to work and we certainly don't want to be supporting them in their lifestyle choices whilst we have had to make significant sacrifices over decades to acquire the skills and abililties and character qualities necessary to be able to purchase the assets and maintain them as well. I also think of the many families we know who own baches (some of them worth very little) and who will be penalised by an asset tax. It is a noble thing to acquire a property and maintain it and pass it on down to the next generation so the same property remains in the family's hands for generations - this is a noble and good thing - building a legacy and passing on the character traits of hard work on to the next generation. This is what we need to be encouraging New Zealanders to be doing rather than working out convoluted methods of taxation which will sap ambition and drive and will keep everyone dependent on governments. If you do go ahead and implement any sort of tax like this, then income taxation thresholds should be drastically dropped. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. I particularly think of my own widowed mother who earns hardly anything in terms of real purchasing power because inflation has eaten away at her savings each year. SUGAR TAX I disagree with implementing anything like a sugar tax. The Government isn't our nanny, for goodness sake. This goes way beyond the mandate for a government. The public doesn't need the government putting punitive taxes on special treats we might like to partake of - and personal responsibility should win the day here rather than sugar taxes. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Yours sincerely, Sara Becker

It is evident that the Group has approached its task by prioritising its effort and by obtaining broad based advice. It is also evident in the approach taken to considering the role the tax system can play in delivering environmental and ecological outcomes that the Group has been mindful of the issues raised in the Mercury submission. Mercury endorses the established principles of tax policy design Mercury agrees with the Group that the established tax design principles of efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and administration costs, and coherence, remain valid when considering the costs and benefits of tax reform. We commend to the Group an approach where all taxes, including those investigated to address negative environmental externalities and taxing natural resources, are assessed against those principles. We endorse the Group’s view that these established principles of tax policy design complement the systems perspective offered by a broader living standards analysis (page 13 of the Interim Report). Mercury supports the Group’s addition of predictability and certainty to the established principles. These additions are especially important when critical economic activities, such as electricity generation, require investors to commit large sums of money to assets which will not return all of that investment for many years or decades. Investors in long-lived assets seek assurance that the rules will not change in ways that are not predictable, otherwise they will require a higher return to reflect that risk (and hence costs to consumers will be higher) or the government may be asked to underwrite some of the risk increasing costs to taxpayers. (Prior to establishing the wholesale electricity market, the taxpayer absorbed cost overruns of hundreds of millions on electricity generation projects such as the Clyde Dam and the Tongariro Power scheme.) Mercury agrees with the Group that the environmental challenges New Zealand faces mean more profound changes in economic activity will be required and that the transition will take a number of decades. At a conceptual level, we can appreciate how a tax system may in theory contribute to achieving more efficient use of our natural capital. The Group sees potential for taxes to be used as one way of embodying kaitiakitanga into our economic and financial frameworks. If designed well, taxes could advance sustainable development objectives and better societal outcomes as defined by the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework. As the Interim Report points out, in practice there is much to consider in the design of any such instruments. It is critical in our view that any proposed environmental taxes be very carefully assessed and tested to ensure the desired outcome is achieved without unintended consequences for the productive sector of the economy or unduly impacting on the equity and other objectives reflected in the established tax design principles. | Page 2 of 4 Mercury welcomes the discussion on environmental taxation Mercury welcomes the discussion on environmental and ecological outcomes in Chapter 9 of the Interim Report. It was encouraging to see a deliberative approach to water taxes as a possible, medium term endeavour. As the discussion illustrates, the design of an effective environmental tax is a significant technical challenge; it would be easy to do it badly. A comprehensive enquiry is required to assess the practicality and implications of introducing taxes on water pollution or water abstraction. In the case of water abstraction taxes, Mercury would favour market approaches such as water trading over resource rental taxation but we recognise that market approaches rely on a resource management system with different characteristics than what we have currently. Mercury agrees with the Group’s approach to assessing the suitability of taxation as an instrument We agree with the principles for assessment of suitability of taxation as a policy instrument relative to other instruments: Ease of measurement, behavioural responsiveness to price signals, risk tolerance (sufficient time to develop and refine a tax instrument) and the environmental problem is sufficiently large scale to justify administrative costs. In addition, the benefits of environmental taxes would be greater where users have a range of abatement options available. We would add that any consideration of the behavioural responsiveness to a tax on discharges of contaminants to freshwater or on the use of freshwater would require consideration of several points on the intervention logic: • Whether imposing a tax would in fact increase the cost of using water and/or discharging contaminants (given regional and seasonal variability in water resources and patterns of water utilisation) • Whether the increase in price would be significant enough to prompt the desired reduction in discharges or in use (given the elasticities of different types of water use) • Whether such a reduction in discharge or use would make a material difference to environmental and ecological outcomes • The costs of compliance and/or incentives to participate in the tax versus seeking alternative means (we note that in the case of water use and discharge there are strong incentives to “cheat” and detection and monitoring can be difficult). As a principle, the Group has considered the total revenue that may be raised by an environmental tax but has not commented on the potential use of the revenue raised. If the purpose of a tax was to address an environmental externality, such as the discharge of pollutants into a waterway, it would in our view be more appropriate to use any revenue raised to address the environmental effect on that waterway. A similar logic could be applied to the solid waste levies recommended by the Group. Environmental taxes would seem to be a different form of taxation to income taxes and where resource use is being targeted it would seem appropriate that any revenue raised be directed back in some way to the benefit of the natural resource. If treated as consolidated fund revenue it raises all of the issues identified above as being an additional impost on productive sectors. The Group should explain and clarify the additional design principles Mercury seeks clarification of the general principles for design for externality and resource use taxes (set out in the lower half of box 9.1 and in box 9.2 of the Interim Report). There is potential, in our view, for the additional principles to cause confusion. The Group may have reasons for adopting these additional principles but in our view it hasn’t articulated these reasons well. Specifically, it would be useful for the Group to • justify the need for an additional set of principles (that is, in addition to the established tax design principles) to apply to taxing negative environmental externalities or resource use • articulate more clearly how the established design principles (of efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and administration costs, coherence, predictability and certainty) can be “built-off” with the addition of other design principles | Page 3 of 4 • clarify how the additional principles relate to the established principles of tax policy design (for example, the principle that the price of the tax should reflect the full cost of externalities is an ‘efficiency’ principle, whereas the principle for local variation is arguably related to equity and compliance/administration costs?) • consider adding a first-order principle, that the objective of the externality or resource tax should be clear and unambiguous (in terms of the behavioural goal sought for environmental taxes, or in terms of the revenue goals associated with taxes on natural resource use). Such objectives may relate back to the societal outcomes in the Living Standards Framework • clarify the fourth principle, price should vary locally according to “impacts”. This principle might be clearer if impacts can be expressed in terms of the objectives for tax. As with all taxes, Mercury is keen to ensure that there is appropriate consideration of unintended consequences in the design of any environmental tax or tax on natural resource use. As the Group’s discussion of environmental and ecological outcomes illustrates, determining the objective for any environmental tax is key. If the purpose of an environmental tax on water is to manage externalities of land use from the diffuse discharge of contaminants, then this would suggest a targeted approach for that purpose. If, however, the purpose is to create incentives for changes in patterns of water resource use then the approach would be entirely different, as would be its impact in terms of equity and efficiency. As noted in our earlier submission, learning from international experience suggests it is difficult to design resource rentals or taxes on the abstraction of water in a manner that is fair and does not result in unintended consequences. Consequences of particular concern to Mercury are the propensity for a tax on the non- consumptive use of water (or other renewable energy sources) to act as a distortionary wealth tax on investors due to the privatisation or partial privatisation of most hydro generation assets; it would be counter-productive to New Zealand’s transition to a low carbon economy to penalise investors in renewable generation assets and raise the cost of generating electricity from renewable energy sources. A tax on renewable energy sources would distort the currently well-functioning electricity market, and negatively impact on electricity prices exacerbating the situation for households who are vulnerable. These concerns were outlined in our previous submission. Given New Zealand’s substantial investment in hydro-electricity, and our country’s reliance on this source of energy, any tax on water should be very carefully considered in light of the impacts on hydro-electricity. Mercury supports recognition by the Group of hydro-electricity’s non-consumptive nature and availability of water downstream for further efficient use. Any government policy setting should recognise the contribution electricity will play in the transition to a zero-carbon economy. Mercury is expecting the Group to make specific recommendations on some environmental taxes but not others Mercury is expecting the February Report will make specific recommendations in relation to solid waste discharge levies, the Emissions Trading Scheme and traffic congestion charges. We agree with the conclusions that the Group has reached in respect of the Emissions Trading Scheme. We understand it is less likely that there will be specific recommendations for taxes on discharges of contaminants to freshwater or on the use of freshwater. We are not expecting any announcements in relation to freshwater taxes because of the high level of uncertainty arising from other government policy work programmes which relate to the resolution of iwi rights and interests and freshwater policy, as well as the significant design considerations that would need to be resolved before advancing potential water tax instruments. If we have misjudged this, and should be expecting announcements on water-related environmental or resource taxes, we would appreciate the opportunity to comment on any such policy proposals. | Page 4 of 4 Mercury would be happy to discuss directly with the Group any aspect of our feedback on the report.

This submission focuses on Chapter 9 of the Interim Report, which discusses what role the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes. Broadly and with some qualifications we agree with a number of the report’s findings as set out on pages 131 to 132 of the Interim Report. In particular, Meridian considers: -Tax instruments may deliver positive environmental and ecological outcomes but are not well suited to many environmental problems. Regulation will often be a better approach. Environmental taxation and regulation should be considered together for the most positive outcomes. -There could be benefits from strengthening the ETS. -Over the medium to long term, we agree there could in theory be benefits from greater use of tax instruments to address challenges in both water pollution and water abstraction. This issue must however be considered carefully. It may be that there are much better means of addressing these challenges. We also agree that addressing Māori rights and interests in fresh water must be central to any changes. The main qualifications or points of additional emphasis that Meridian would stress are that: 2 Meridian Submission – Future of Tax: Interim Report 1. In relation to the environment, the merits of taxes and other revenue-raising policy tools must be considered alongside the merits of other tools and approaches – we anticipate that in many cases regulation, and in particular the strengthening of existing regulation, will be a better approach than the introduction of new taxes; 2. The Group’s draft framework, criteria and design principles (Boxes 9.1 and 9.2 on pages 63 and 64 of the Interim Report) for assessing whether environmental taxes will be effective or more suitable than other policy instruments such as regulation or spending or education, need to be considered alongside the broader tax policy design principles mentioned on page 13 of the report, including the established principles of tax policy design: i. efficiency, ii. equity and fairness, iii. revenue integrity, iv. fiscal adequacy, v. compliance and administration costs, vi. coherence, and vii. predictability and certainty. Consistency with both sets of principles should be a pre-requisite to the introduction of any new environmental taxes. 3. Key to the successful introduction of any environmental tax will be adequate identification of the objective that is sought to be achieved or the problem the tax will address. There should then be an assessment of whether a tax is the best policy option for achieving the objective or addressing the problem. It’s not clear to us from the Interim Report that any such objective or problem has been clearly identified for any of the environmental taxes discussed. Further, at times, the discussion of environmental taxes seems to proceed on the assumption that taxation (rather than, for example, regulation or education) is by definition the best policy instrument for advancing the unspoken objectives implicit in this section of the report. 4. Hypothecation of tax revenue is not best practice. Yet it seems to be assumed in much of the discussion relating to environmental taxes. We suggest this needs to be revisited. Consideration of the objective or problem being addressed (see point 3 above) would probably assist. 3 Meridian Submission – Future of Tax: Interim Report 5. The discussion of environmental taxes does not consider the distributional impacts of environmental taxes. We believe this is a significant omission that should be covered off in any more detailed consideration of the pros and cons of introducing such taxes. For example, some forms of water charge may be reflected in the costs to domestic consumers of water and in the prices of food and electricity. 6. Currently the externalities imposed by water use are managed under the Resource Management Act. If an environmental tax was proposed that was intended to reflect the full cost of externalities relating to such use then this would be a significant change to the current approach to environmental and resource management in New Zealand. The extent of overlap and interaction with the Resource Management Act would need to be carefully considered for any new environmental tax proposed. For example, issues that might arise include: a. Are resource consents for the relevant activities or uses still required if the full costs of externalities are now reflected in taxes imposed on the use? b. Would existing consent holders be relieved of existing mitigation obligations and obligations to act in accordance with conditions in resource consents? c. If a distinction is drawn between existing consent holders and new applicants for consent does this have the potential to drive unintended consequences? Meridian’s more general comments on the New Zealand tax system are set out in our earlier submission on the Tax Working Group’s Submissions Background Paper.

SUBMISSION ON THE INTERIM REPORT OF THE TAX REVIEW GROUP This submission focuses on the Group's interim recommendations relating to a possible capital gains tax. Are 'Capital Gains' appropriately described as 'Capital Income'? 2 The rationale in the report seems to be that 'realised capital gains provide a basis for consumption in the same way as labour or interest income' (see paragraph 11 of Chapter 5 of the Group's Interim Report), hence why it equates 'capital gains' with 'capital income' and chooses throughout the report to refer to 'capital gains' as 'capital income', and therefore like all other forms of 'income' appropriately subject to tax - and at the same rate as other forms of 'income'. 3 Yet capital assets, whether in the form of property, shares, term deposits or other forms of investment, are generally seen as capital rather than consumption items which are set aside as savings to be retained for future requirements like retirement or assistance to family. They may also be accessed for major expenditure needs such as housing improvement or overseas travel but for most people they are viewed differently from funds in hand in the bank required for everyday living. 4 Where this distinction becomes relevant is that the taxation of capital and savings, separately and on top of income derived from these, may negatively impact on these through discouraging such investment and saving and encouraging greater consumption. Part of the concern is of course that too much capital at present gets directed toward residential property to the detriment of alternative investment in other more productive areas of the economy. But it is not clear how the changes proposed by the Working Group will, at least on their own, really address this issue since it is proposed to tax capital gains not only on non-residential property but also on shares (along with the existing tax on financial instruments). Furthermore, it is arguably not so much non-residential rental housing which is non-productive (after all, people need houses to live in if they do not own their own) so much as owner-occupied homes, at least where large sums are invested in these going beyond essential albeit good standard housing requirements (e.g. where a 'mansion effect' might occur - see paragraph 14 of Appendix B). 5 There seem to be good grounds for considering some level of taxation of capital gains (e.g. fairness, equity, to help address inequality) but care is needed to keep in mind that society needs to encourage saving, not least for retirement when individuals will no longer be able to rely on labour income and will be reliant on income from capital - as well as the actual capital itself. This applies as much today for the presently ageing population as it will for future generations as they too age. 6 The report does make the interesting point that such taxation may be a mechanism to help to contribute to inter-generational equity. In a situation where a reducing labour force will be being asked to support from taxation a growing ageing population, this is a fair point. But future generations will also need in turn to accumulate capital to help them in their retirement. Accordingly, an appropriate balancing of interests will need to be achieved. 7 If a capital gains tax is to be introduced, there may however be merit in calling it that, rather than treating it as another additional form of income tax, so that the qualitative difference between them is not lost. The Form of a Possible Capital Gains Tax 8 The Tax Group's Interim Report chooses to focus on just two possible options, involving the taxation of gains on realisation or based on a risk-free rate of return. It would have been useful somewhere to learn about the range of forms which capital gains taxes have taken in other jurisdictions (including the Australian inclusion of a 50% discount where the asset has been held for more than 12 months and the Canadian approach of taxing 50% only of the gain) and the lessons which might be drawn from their respective merits or shortcomings so as to inform assessment of the two options flagged or lead to consideration of other possibilities. 9 Both options discussed by the Group involve the targeting of particular types of gain rather than a more broad-based approach. Thus, personal use assets are excluded which seems sensible for the reasons given in paragraphs 17 and 18 of Appendix B. In the case of higher value jewellery, fine art and other collectibles, these are not necessarily bought as investments and in any case their value can be both volatile (e.g. antiques), difficult to assess and often then hard to realise. This contributes to the likely high cost and complexity of their inclusion. Accordingly, their exclusion also seems reasonable. 10 Of the two options flagged, the taxation of gains on actual realisation seems the fairest and most appropriate and it seems from Appendix B that this is the Group's favoured option (see paragraph 23 of Appendix B). This seems an appropriate preference. 11 As the Group notes, the actual realisation approach has the advantage that the taxpayer has the funds released by the realisation of the value of the asset to draw on in meeting the tax due. There is also a clearly determined value on which the calculation of the tax is based. It is therefore relatively simple and fair. 12 It also seems appropriate that, if the property is sold at a loss, then the amount of such loss (against the purchase price) can be offset against other 'income' (or gains). The Group seems to contemplate however that such losses will only be able to be offset against gains from the sale of other like assets, not against a taxpayer's other sources of income (e.g. labour income, capital 'income such as interest, dividends, and rent). The problem with this is that, for many taxpayers, they may only own one or two non-residential rental properties or a small commercial/industrial property and perhaps as well a small quantity of shares. Accordingly, the facility to offset a loss against sales of other property or of shares may be quite limited. Ideally, therefore, they should be allowed to offset against other income, especially if capital gains are to be treated as a form of 'income'. If the taxable gains (and losses) are being ring-fenced around gains or losses on the sale of the same class or classes of assets, then a generous period of time should be allowed over which they may be permitted to offset any loss or losses. 13 In the case of the alternative approach based on a risk-free rate of return, it is noted that this form of tax would replace the taxation of income from a property subject to this regime so that any income (e.g. rental) derived from the property, and any expenses associated with earning that income, would be ignored for tax purposes. The problem with the proposal is that we do not know at what level the 'risk-free rate of return' would be pitched. If the risk-free rate of return was based on the Government 2-year bond rate as suggested in paragraph 78 of the Report, and interest rates rise, this could see a substantial movement in the rate of tax being levied and it would not take into account the level of actual rental income received or the expenses incurred in deriving it. Nor is there any evidence that the Group has undertaken any empirical work to assess the sort of net returns which owners of properties which would be subject to this tax customarily derive such that there could be confidence that the level of the tax was reasonable and affordable. If it were pitched too high, it could have very serious impacts for owners as it may exceed their net 'income' from the property, ultimately forcing them to sell because of the absence of sufficient cash generated from the rental income, less expenses, to cover the liability. 14 Further, it would require an annual assessment of (net) market value which could be onerous, expensive and difficult. If a current rateable value were relied on for a property value, this might in certain market conditions overstate the market value of the property. 15 Other downsides are: • it would seem potentially to encourage owners to take on higher levels of debt in order to reduce their equity (and thereby their tax exposure); • it could discourage owners from making improvements to their properties since doing so would increase the taxable value of the property unless they borrowed money to fund the improvements; • it may encourage owners to minimise maintenance and repair expenditure since such expenditure would cease to be a tax deductible expense; and • any increase in costs (e.g. in getting regular updated valuations) might be passed on to tenants, contributing to rising rents, or cause owners of such properties to exit the market, benefiting new home-buyers but reducing properties available for rent, thereby also putting pressure on rent levels. The Level and Nature of the New Tax 16 The Group has proposed that the gains to be taxed should be regarded as 'income' and therefore taxed at the marginal rate of the taxpayer in the year in which the gains are realised. There is a question flagged above as to whether these 'gains' should really be treated as 'income', even if it is decided that they should be taxed. For the Submitter's view is that these gains are different, for the reasons given above. This is evidenced by the fact that the gains are the product of the holding of an asset for a number of years, such that taxing them at a taxpayer's marginal rate of income tax in the year of realisation has a certain measure of artificiality and possible arbitrariness. 17 It might therefore make more sense to set a separate rate specifically applicable for the taxation of capital gains. Some countries seem to have done this. In the United Kingdom, the rate for gains on property seems to be 18% for those on their 'basic' income level (10% for other assets) and 28% for those on a 'higher income' (20% for other assets). Others like Denmark, Germany and the United States seem also to have rates set independently of the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax though differential rates may apply based on which sort of income tax bracket a taxpayer falls in. 18 It is submitted that an option worth consideration might be a flat rate equivalent say to GST (i.e. 15%) for payment on gains made from asset sales to be covered by the new regime. The logic of such an equivalence would be that some taxpayers opt to use their savings to spend or consume and pay GST on their purchases while those who save and then enjoy gains on the value of those savings might pay an equivalent amount. This might be a mechanism for avoiding the risk of disincentivising saving and investment through the levying of too burdensome a tax on gains made from investments. It might also pitch the new tax at a level which would attract wider acceptance. Having a fixed rate would also avoid the taxable gains in the tax year of realisation pushing most of the gains above a taxpayer's otherwise applicable marginal rate of tax which would likely be the case for any taxpayer on a marginal rate less than the maximum of 30%. 19 An alternative would be, as some others have done, to have two rates of tax on capital gains, pitched at different levels based either on the marginal rate of income tax of the taxpayer (as seen in the United Kingdom's two-tiered rates) or based on the nature of the gain (property, shares) being taxed (as seen also with the United Kingdom's differentiated rates for gains from property and shares respectively). 20 It appears that the Group would treat gains made on the sale of rural (farm) land in the same way as any other land (commercial, industrial, residential) to be subject to the new taxation regime. But real care is needed to avoid a situation where substantial damage might be done to the economics of our traditional forms of pastoral farming for which levels of annual income can for many be quite low and certainly very cyclical and for whom the capital gain acquired on retiring from the business has often been the means of supporting the retiring farmer in retirement. The proposed roll-over provision would seem relevant for farmers expanding their business to larger properties and perhaps also for those looking to transfer a farm on to a son or daughter. But the particular challenges for farming of a capital gains tax warrant careful consideration. Transitional Rules 21 The Group favours having the new tax take effect for all covered properties (i.e. excluding family homes) on the date of entry into force. They do not favour following the Australian approach of having the new law apply only to properties as they are acquired after the entry into force of the new law. The Group acknowledges the advantage in the Australian approach of removing extensive valuations when the law comes into effect but is concerned that taxpayers may be encouraged to sit on existing properties of the type that would otherwise be taxed so as to accrue the capital gain without the tax. 22 However, an important consideration (see paragraph 13 of Chapter 2 of the Interim Report) is that taxation should be predictable and certain. The move to a system involving the imposition of a more broadly-based capital gains tax is a major change for taxpayers. Taxpayers to this point have ordered their affairs on the basis that there is no broad-based capital gains tax on property and shares. And, where a new tax on capital gains has been introduced (as for the two bright-line tax changes), these changes have been implemented prospectively for new transactions/purchases occurring after the date of entry into force. It would be appropriate here too to follow the same approach so that taxpayers who have made decisions on the basis that there is no such tax do not now suddenly find that the basis on which they acquired the property in question has materially changed. 23 While this would entail a longer transition, it would also enable a more orderly and fairer one and one in which the change might be better understood and accepted. The alternative of having to have all existing property subject to the new tax specially valued will prove extremely burdensome and probably costly for taxpayers affected. In the case of property, rateable values are not likely to be a satisfactory proxy as they can be at quite significant variance to the actual market. There is also a particular difficulty if values at the time of entry into force are actually lower than the original purchase price of the asset, plus in the case of property the cost of any improvements since. Accordingly, there might need to be an option to take a higher assessed 'value' than the market value at the time of valuation based on actual cost at the time of purchase (plus, in the case of property, the actual cost of any improvements). 24 If the length of time before the tax takes effect in this scenario for currently held property and shares is still a concern, it might be possible to allow for a transition of say 5-10 years for holders of existing shares and covered property such that, for existing owners of such assets, the legislation would kick in in 5-10 years time at which point any taxpayers still owning such assets would need to secure valuations effective on that date. This would avoid a long tail of say 30 years as mentioned in the Group's report. A solution would still need to be identified for assets which at the point of valuation have a lower market value than the original cost (plus any improvements). 25 The Group observes (paragraph 31 of Chapter 6 of the Interim Report) that, if taxation is extended to capital gains on the sale of land (excluding the family home), some existing provisions imposing tax on the gains made on some sales might need to be amended or repealed. Clearly this will be affected by the nature of the transitional arrangements but presumably existing provisions (e.g. the bright-line test) would continue to apply for all land (other than family homes) not yet subject to the new tax regime (e.g. if this regime applies only to new acquisitions made after entry into force of the new law). The Encouragement of More Productive Investment 26 One of the consistent reasons given for the introduction of a capital gains tax is to encourage capital and investment into more productive sectors of the economy through providing a greater range of choice for individuals wanting to invest their savings. The extension of capital gains taxes not only to all categories of non-family homes and property but also to shares, supplementing the capital gains tax already in place for financial instruments (and certain property sales), will not immediately help since the present level playing field between property and shares would continue (aside from the continued exclusion of family homes from the tax) with both becoming subject, on the basis of the Group's current thinking, to the same level of capital gains tax. More fundamentally, it is not always clear how much the encouragement of increased investment into shares (or financial instruments) will necessarily help fund more productive investment since most share investment is simply acquiring shares already issued; it is seldom funding new share issues or new debt instruments to aid the expansion of businesses. Whilst outside the role of the Working Group, it is important that efforts be made to deepen the range of investment opportunities for tangibly supporting economic productivity and growth. 27 One idea mentioned by the Group (paragraph 14 of Appendix B) in relation to the family home, often argued to be one of the areas of least 'productive' investment, is to set an upper limit around the exemption to be allowed for the family home. This would seem an idea worth exploring since, if there is to be a capital gains tax on all other property, there is a risk that taxpayers may be encouraged to increase their investment in their family home not so much to accommodate their needs as a family so much as to increase the value of the property and thereby reap greater benefit from this proposed family home exemption. Roll Over Provisions. 28 The proposed inclusion of these seems reasonable. 29 While not an issue of roll-over, drafters need to be careful to ensure that, when title to land or shares is changed to allow for a change of trustees in a Trust, this change of name is not unwittingly regarded as a sale or disposal. Such changes of trustee can be required because professional trustees in Trusts formed some years ago are now having to retire and are being replaced by incorporated companies whose lawyer directors become the replacement professional trustee. This form of replacement will avoid the need for future changes of professional trustee and the associated adjustments to property and mortgage titles and share registers. But, where any change of trustee does occur, with associated transfers of title from the old to the new trustees, the change does not alter the nature and identity of the tax entity which owns the asset and should not therefore give rise to any suggestion that a sale or disposition has occurred such that a capital gains tax on the transaction might become payable, whether on that transaction or on a future transaction based on the asset having through the replacement process kicked in the application of the new capital gains tax regime. Gift Duty 30 Passing reference is made to gift duty and the Group does address issues around the taxation of Trusts and companies, identifying as the main tax-related issue being in relation to closely-held companies. 31 There has been commentary in the media indicating concern about the way in which some business people seem to have been able to shift assets to entities beyond the reach of creditors in circumstances which appear unjustifiably to prejudice unsecured creditors (e.g. sub-contractors). It is not clear whether these actions have been undertaken in a way which would contravene the business person's obligations toward their creditors in which case it may be possible to re-open the transactions and claw back the money affected. But is there any evidence that the abolition of gift duty has made it easier for business people to transfer funds out of a business through gifting to a separate entity in circumstances where such transfer is seen as unreasonable in terms of their duties to creditors? Administrative Changes 32 It is suggested that it may be desirable to have some form of contemporaneous documentation to be filed with IRD on an annual basis, itemising the cost of assets subject to the new rules. Care should be taken about creating more and potentially quite onerous and detailed annual reporting obligations. Clearly taxpayers will, if changes are introduced to impose a capital gains tax on sales of certain property and all shares, have to keep records of all future purchases and improvements (if the law is applied only to future acquisitions). If it applies to all covered property and shares already held, but affecting only increases in value from the date of entry into force of the law to the date of sale, then documentation will be required to establish starting values. In this scenario, maybe taxpayers could be given a period of 1-2 years to document all affected property and shares with the relevant values at the time of entry into force duly recorded, with a reference to the basis for the valuation. As mentioned already, there may also need to be a process for valuation which allows for the situation where the original cost price (plus improvements in the case of property) actually exceeds the value of the property or shares at the time of entry into force.

Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth. I submit that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working G roup wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. 2 Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Excise taxes and GST There should be no GST applied to any excise or tax. This double-dipping is totally unfair. Yours sincerely, RIchard Cook 3

However, in the event that new capital taxation is implemented, then any revenue should be used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas, in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. Taxes on savings To tax people on their savings is underhand and punitive. People who save should be rewarded, not penalised. With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. 2 If the Working Group wants to encourage people to save more for their retirement, they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is outrageous and unacceptable. People responsible enough to save should not be treated as 'cash cows'. The message it sends is that the government is encouraging New Zealanders to be on welfare because that way they will get a free ride on the suckers who save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate that can be more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase.

Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme. Behavioural taxes Hiking tobacco excise even higher is not going to stop smokers from smoking. It simply means that they spend less on decent food and household requirements. Visit any supermarket checkout and see this for yourself. In addition, it has created an extremely unsafe environment for retailers, with increased theft and attacks, injuries and even fatalities among smaller shopkeepers. The policy of having an annual increase has been an abject failure and is having unintended safety consequences for the general public. If the government is so concerned about tobacco usage and its health effects, then tobacco sales should be confined to government shops with appropriate security. With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes are sheer stupidity. People should be able to purchase and eat sugared foods if they wish. Putting additional taxes on is not going to reduce consumption or stop any overeaters from getting obese. If anything, then GST should be removed from so-called 'healthy and essential foods' and imposed on 'luxury/non-essential items' as they do in Australia. 3 Food and drink are about choice. Those who make poor food choices to the extent that they are affecting their health need a better understanding of nutrition, not for the government to act as 'mum' or 'dad' and stop them from buying certain items. I submit that the Working Group should NOT recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government NOT implement a sugar tax. I also endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 November 2018 1 NZCTU Survey on the Tax Working Group’s Interim Report In April 2018 the NZCTU commissioned UMR Research to conduct an online survey of New Zealanders about their views around taxation. We shared the results of that survey in our feedback on the Tax Working Group’s “Future of Tax” background paper in May 1 . In response to the Working Group’s Interim Report, the NZCTU has conducted a further online survey of Together.org.nz supporters to re-test our initial findings and provide specific feedback to a number of particular issues raised by the Interim Report. Most importantly, our research continues to show widespread support for an increased tax take to fund levels of social and public service in the future. Sixty-seven per cent agree the Government should increase total tax take to maintain and grow social services and support. This exactly mirrors the UMR findings in April. At the same time, 83 per cent support a different mix of new taxes with a broader range of revenue sources(in contrast the current nine- tenths of tax revenue that comes just three sources – income tax, company tax and GST). Given the discussion in the Interim Report about new revenue sources, our latest survey also provides a clear hierarchy of preferences for reducing inequality through taxation: • Ninety-three per cent support cracking down on multinational tax avoidance, with 90 per cent strongly agreeing (n=756). • Eighty-four per cent support taxing polluting businesses, including climate emissions, with 70 per cent strongly agreeing (n=760). • Eighty-four per cent support a tax free threshold on the first few thousand dollars of personal income, with 67 per cent strongly agreeing (n=757). • Seventy-six per cent support a higher tax bracket for personal incomes significantly higher than $70,000, with 54 per cent strongly agreeing (n=755). • Seventy-four per cent support extending income taxes to include capital gains in some form - excluding the family home - with 55 per cent strongly agreeing (n=760). • Seventy one per cent support a tax on wealth such as rental properties and shares, but still excluding the family home, with 51 per cent strongly agreeing (n=759). 1 See https://www.union.org.nz/kiwis-desire-for-tax-offers-hope-for-underfunded-public-services/ 249 500 11 Tax take relative to the size of the economy Keep the tax take at the same proportion of the economy. Increase tax take to maintain and grow social services and support. Did not answer. 1 November 2018 2 In relation to the integrity and administration of the tax system, our latest survey also finds extremely strong support for the Interim Report’s ideas. Ninety-four per cent agree that the Government should give Inland Revenue greater powers to track income, tax, and net wealth of high net-worth individuals, and 96 per cent agree that Inland Revenue should produce an annual tax transparency report that shows the tax paid by large multinational and domestic companies.

Our feedback focuses on practical, process-oriented and resourcing issues that may arise from implementing an extension of taxation of capital income, or the risk-free rate of return, on assets. We underscore that our feedback does not support or contend with any of the policy considerations and recommendations described in the Interim Report relating to capital income. Overall, we agree with the comments in the Interim Report that the effectiveness of any policy for the taxation of capital income “will be dependent on its design.” The Generic Tax Policy Process (“GTPP”) 1. At \[80\], Appendix B, of the Interim Report, the Tax Working Group asserts that: “Implicit in the Group’s approach is that the income brought into the tax base by taxing more realised capital gains should be taxed in the same way as any other income, unless there is some reason to do otherwise. The rules taxing more capital gains can be seen as no more than expanding the definition of what is a revenue account asset, albeit in a reasonably far- reaching manner” \[emphasis added\]. 2. The Tax Working Group therefore describes the policy considerations on imposing tax obligations on capital income as an “extension of the taxation of capital income” throughout the Interim Report – not a new tax for which new, separate tax legislation is required. 3. While we generally agree that many “supporting provisions and mechanisms” do already exist in the current tax framework to enable the implementation of rules that tax capital income, we question the conclusion that the changes proposed are merely an expansion of the ‘revenue account asset’ definition. Instead, we consider that any choice to tax capital income in a more complete manner is a fundamental change in our tax framework. Such policy considerations will have a significant impact on taxpayers as it demarks a distinct and significant conceptual change in the obligations taxpayers have to Inland Revenue. 4. In summarising the interactions between a potential tax on capital income and other tax regimes, at \[74\] to \[76\], Chapter 6, the Tax working Group identifies that “these issues are complex and will require industry and stakeholder consultation.” Further, at \[244\] and \[245\], Appendix B, the Tax Working Group acknowledges that “there are a number of other issues largely relating to how the new rules would integrate with existing tax rules” and “we expect that there will also be other issues that will arise as a result of industry and stakeholder consultation and of course through the Generic Tax Policy Process.” 5. At the same time, members of the Tax Working Group and associated Ministers of Parliament have indicated an appetite to make legislative changes to effect these policy recommendations before the 2020 general election – which, at latest, must be held by 21 November 2020. 6. With the Final Report expected from the Tax Working Group in February 2019, we question whether there will be sufficient time before the general election to completely and effectively work through the GTPP on a reasonable and sustainable timeline. We submit that the best tax policy will be developed where the GTPP is fully worked through over a realistic timeframe. 7. We would find it useful to understand where in the GTPP the Tax Working Group imagines Officials will begin the process of developing policy recommendations in to draft legislation – i.e. the strategic, tactical or operational phase? 8. If the policy recommendations are intended to launch Officials into the operational phase, beginning with detailed policy design, does the Tax Working Group imagine that Officials will still undertake to consult with the public and industry through green and white papers? We submit that supporting a robust and on-going public discussion will be fundamental to the success of any new tax policy for capital income. 9. Depending where responsibilities start and finish, we also submit that the Tax Working Group should either set out a concrete plan for the development of any proposed changes to the taxation of capital income from the issue of the Final Report through to the implementation phase; or encourage Ministers to have a clear plan which is articulated to the New Zealand public once the Final Report is delivered. A staged approach 10. At \[45\] to \[52\], Chapter 6, the Tax working Group explores policy ideas on “how far to extend the existing \[capital income\] tax net” – considering a targeted versus broad-based approach. The Tax Working Group acknowledges, at \[50\] that the design principles in Appendix B largely focus on a targeted approach which, when taken together, “the outcome will be a broad-based taxing of nearly all capital gains.” 11. We submit that the Tax Working group may wish to consider a targeted approach which phases additional asset classes in over time until the treatment of capital income is as broad-base as is considered appropriate once the potential effects and compliance costs of each expansion of the tax are fully worked through. For example, Officials could initially implement tax policy for capital income from land and land interests. 12. Implementing policy using a targeted approach over time, but building a broad-base approach to capital income, may be more effective in ensuring that the Government, Officials and taxpayers have sufficient time and resources to properly develop proposals through the GTPP, consulting with industry and public stakeholders on specific technical and administrative issues for each asset class. 13. However, we also accept that any approach to policy development which singles out specific asset classes for taxation, even for a short period, is likely to have important and complex impacts on the overall horizontal equity of the tax system in New Zealand. We appreciate the inherent complexity involved in these policy considerations, acknowledging the trade-offs between compliance costs, horizontal equity and the overall integrity of the tax base Taxpayers’ compliance and administration burden 14. We concur with the Tax Working group’s comments at \[34\] to \[36\], Chapter 6, that “the extension of capital income taxation will significantly increase compliance and administration costs”; specifically that “unlike most other complex areas of tax law, the capital gains rules must be interpreted and applied by ‘ordinary’ taxpayers.” 15. We are concerned about the significant additional costs of compliance and administration that will fall to taxpayers for the foreseeable future if all the policy changes contemplated are implemented. While we acknowledge that some proposed design principles will limit or minimise compliance costs in some respects, we think there is a high level of risk that many taxpayers will find it hard to adapt to the fundamental conceptual changes imagined – many will have to reform their internal systems and seek professional support. 16. Specifically, we are concerned that the policy considerations described in Chapter 6, and the design principles in Appendix B, will be hard to reconcile with the Business Transformation project. 17. We concur with the Tax Working Group’s assessment at \[241\], Appendix B, that taxing capital income broadly will be hard to reconcile with changes made through the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill to “automatically assess an individual’s tax refund or tax to pay.” This is because “any taxpayer may have made a capital gain in any tax year, \[so\] the number of cases in which Inland Revenue would be confident to automatically assess based on reportable income would reduce.” 18. We submit that the Tax Working Group should include final recommendations on how the Government can properly reconcile proposed changes to the taxation of capital income with the technical details and overall policy intentions of the Business Transformation project – specifically, mechanisms to ensure many taxpayers are not automatically assessed when certain capital income is earned. It will be best for the overall development of the tax framework if the two regimes fit together seamlessly. 19. Further, it is worthwhile to note that there are multiple design principles which may be effective in limiting taxpayers’ compliance burden. While we support the Tax Working Group’s exploration of these principles, we consider that there are risks to horizontal and vertical equity if concessions are made (e.g. providing rules of thumb for simple valuations, or using withholding tax processes). Resourcing – Officials 20. Finally, in \[36\], Chapter 6, the Tax Working Group identifies that they “expect the extension of the taxation of capital income to put additional demands on Inland Revenue in terms of tax assessment, advice, collection and enforcement.” We concur with this assessment and consider that the resourcing of Inland Revenue needs to be strongly considered in making conclusions about the appropriate time frames for developing and implementing any changes to the taxation of capital income. We welcome the opportunity to discuss our submission points with the Tax Working Group.

Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year (like National and John Key did). While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to inflation. Capital taxation I'm actually fine with a capital gains tax, as long as only real gains are taxed. I don't think it's fair that New Zealanders should have to pay tax on illusionary gains caused by inflation. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/full-expensing-the-best-idea-in-politics- youve-never-heard-of Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. This especially hurts the elderly and those who want to save for retirement, without exposing themselves to sharemarket volatility or investing in an overheated property market. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. 2 Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. I really hope someone down there reads this, but I accept that I'll probably just get an automated reply and the government will do whatever it wants. Yours sincerely,

This will be particularly important in the New Zealand context. 2.2 We support the TWG's recommended further tax changes to the treatment of KiwiSaver. However, we consider that the TWG's recommended changes to the taxation of KiwiSaver should be extended to all registered retirement schemes. If the TWG recommend a CGT, then assets in registered retirement schemes should be excluded. 2.3 We support the TWG's approach that it will not change the Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) regime and that the single level of taxation at the PIE level should be maintained. 2.4 If the TWG recommend a CGT, it should also consider a CGT exemption for assets held within a PIE. If, however, the TWG recommends that CGT applies to assets within a PIE, we consider there should be an option to calculate that tax on a deemed risk free rate of capital return basis. 4445380\_1 2 2.5 We support the suggestion to increase the $10,000 limit for the automatic deduction for legal fees for tax purposes. Capital Gains Tax (CGT) 3 The introduction of a CGT (or an extension of income tax to capital gains) would have a significant impact on the structure of New Zealand's tax framework. New Zealand's current income tax framework (both legislative, judicial opinion and common understanding) has developed over many years on the basis that New Zealand does not tax capital gains. Companies, individuals and foreign investors have proceeded on that basis. 4 We would recommend that CGT is not introduced without sufficient time to consider all of the potential issues. In general, we consider the proposed timeframe for the introduction of CGT is too short. CGT and roll-over relief for replacement business assets 5 The TWG Interim Report has indicated that, if CGT is recommended, then roll-over relief should also be allowed. However, the report states that the TWG is still considering the extent to which roll-over relief should be provided. In particular, the TWG has not confirmed whether roll-over relief would extend to situations where business assets are disposed of and the proceeds are reinvested. The Interim Report goes on to outline a number of disadvantages that could arise from this type of roll-over relief. 6 We are concerned that the TWG would consider recommending CGT without a broadly drafted roll-over relief applying where business assets are disposed of and the proceeds are reinvested, particularly in the context of the New Zealand economy. 7 New Zealand is a relatively small economy with a limited number of large companies and access to capital is constrained. The economy relies heavily on small businesses: for example shops, farms and agricultural businesses. Those businesses have tended to grow organically. Individuals, who are able to develop a small business into a larger business, will often look to sell that business and buy another one when they become constrained, for example, by the size of the shop, farm, or land available. 8 If CGT applies to these situations and there is no roll-over relief where the business sales proceeds are reinvested (or partly reinvested) in a replacement business, then it will create an impediment to the growth of these small businesses into medium sized (and ideally large) New Zealand businesses. 9 Further, roll-over relief would be important to protect business owners in the event of unexpected capital realisations. The TWG's report refers to intended transactions. However, the broad nature of CGT is that it can apply in a number of unexpected situations and potentially any value shift between individuals can trigger capital realisations. Examples include: forced sales; changes to partnership/joint venture agreements; separations; and court settlements. It seems inequitable that a business owner might have to pay a CGT in these situations, which would prevent them from being able to buy an equivalent sized business and continue trading. 4445380\_1 3 10 The TWG report also refers to the equivalent relief in the US tax code 1 . However, it would seem that there are regimes in more comparable jurisdictions that should be considered. 11 The UK's business asset roll-over relief 2 provides a broad roll-over relief for businesses which acquire new assets within three years from (or up to one year before) selling or disposing of the old assets and also allows partial relief where, for example, a business reinvests part of the proceeds from selling the old assets, or where old assets were only partly used in a business. The UK approach would seem to be a more appropriate approach in the New Zealand context and we consider a reasonable timeframe for reinvestment would be one year before or three years after the relevant sale. 12 In summary, we consider that for CGT to be workable in the New Zealand context a broad based roll-over relief will be necessary that applies to proceeds reinvested within a reasonable period of time. Retirement savings 13 Retirement savings is one of the most important areas being considered by the TWG and is critical for the future wellbeing of all New Zealanders. Any recommendations in the TWG's final report in relation to retirement savings must be comprehensive and consider all forms of retirement savings. 14 KiwiSaver has been successful in raising individual levels of retirement savings in New Zealand. We support the TWG's recommended further tax changes to the treatment of KiwiSaver, comprising: 14.1 the removal of the employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) on employer’s matching contribution of 3% of salary for KiwiSaver for employees earning up to $48,000; 14.2 a 5% reduction of the lower PIE tax rates but only for KiwiSaver funds; 14.3 simplifying the way PIE rates are determined for KiwiSaver members; and 14.4 the suggestion that the member tax credit (MTC) could be increased to 1:1 basis. 15 However, the TWG's Interim Report suggests that KiwiSaver is the only way that New Zealanders are saving for retirement. Individual retirement savings in New Zealand are held 1 US Internal Revenue Code, section 1031. 2 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, section 152. 4445380\_1 4 in a wider range of registered retirement schemes 3 . Registered retirement schemes comprise: 15.1 KiwiSaver; 15.2 Superannuation Schemes, which lock in funds until retirement; and 15.3 Workplace Savings Schemes, which typically lock in funds until retirement or on leaving service from an employer. 16 Superannuation Schemes and Workplace Savings Schemes (excluding KiwiSaver) make up a significant proportion of New Zealand's total retirement savings, and at June 2018 held funds of in excess of NZD 24 billion (in comparison to KiwiSaver which holds funds of in excess of NZD 50 billion) 4 . These schemes offer certain advantages to individuals and employers, including enabling higher contribution rates by employers and other features such as life and disablement insurance. If the TWG's objective is to make the 'tax treatment of retirement savings scheme fairer' 5 , the current and proposed tax treatment of KiwiSaver (and complying superannuation funds) should be extended to all registered retirement schemes. 17 We assume the intention is that the TWG's proposed tax changes to KiwiSaver would also apply to Complying Superannuation Funds as they comply with the KiwiSaver rules 6 . 18 Finally, the TWG should consider and address the high rate of tax that applies to defined benefit workplace savings schemes, where there is no facility to apply anything other than the top 33% ESCT rate and (at best) the 28% widely held superannuation fund investment income tax rate even where most or indeed all members may have already retired and begun receiving a pension. 19 The taxation of lifetime annuities in New Zealand also needs to be considered, where investment income relating to the funds underpinning any such annuity are taxed at 28% and then the annuity itself may be subject to tax on distribution in some cases. 20 We consider that the TWG's recommended changes to the taxation of KiwiSaver should be extended to all registered retirement schemes. CGT and retirement savings 21 We are also concerned that any form of CGT on registered retirement schemes (including KiwiSaver, Superannuation Schemes or Workplace Savings Schemes) could significantly 3 Registered means those Superannuation Schemes, Workplace Savings Schemes and KiwiSaver Schemes as those schemes are defined in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 and that are included on the register of managed investment schemes. 4 https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics 5 Interim Report, page 6. 6 We note that current tax benefits, including member tax credits, extend to KiwiSaver and certain Complying Superannuation Funds (refer definition of Superannuation Savings Scheme in s.YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007). 4445380\_1 5 undermine the value of retirement savings in real terms, particularly as inflation already presents a risk to the real value of amounts held in retirement schemes. 22 In addition, the TWG will be aware that an introduction of a CGT to assets within the PIE regime (discussed below) will also be a form of tax on retirement schemes as most retirement schemes are PIEs. 23 If the TWG recommend a CGT, then assets in registered retirement schemes should be excluded. Portfolio Investment Entity regime 24 The PIE regime is an important part of New Zealand's investment and retirement savings framework. The majority of New Zealand investment vehicles are now PIEs and we expect the PIE regime will become increasingly important, particularly with the introduction of the Asia Region Funds Passport which will enable New Zealand asset managers to more freely market New Zealand funds to non-resident investors in those jurisdictions covered by the passport. A key feature of the PIE regime is the single level of taxation at the PIE level (and no tax for foreign investment zero-rate PIEs), with no further tax at the investor level. 25 We support the TWG's approach that it has not proposed any changes to the PIE regime and that the single level of taxation at the PIE level should be maintained. 26 As noted in the Interim Report, at present, gains on New Zealand and Australian shares are not taxed, and gains on the sale of other foreign shares are generally not taxed and instead tax is calculated on a deemed rate of return (Fair Dividend Rate or FDR) method. In practice, for most PIEs, income is allocated to investors on a daily basis and tax is applied accordingly. This current tax treatment enables PIE calculations to be done for those investors who enter and exit PIE funds on a daily basis. 27 Unfortunately, the TWG's Interim Report does not provide any real detail as to how CGT would apply to assets held in a PIE. The difficulty with capital gains is that (unlike income) it will not be known whether an asset will generate a gain or loss until it is ultimately realised. A CGT in a fund can give rise to inequitable results for investors, because it will not be known if a particular asset will ultimately give rise to a gain or a loss until it is realised, but tax will need to be calculated on a daily basis for investors entering or exiting the fund. 28 If the TWG recommend a CGT, it should also consider a CGT exemption for assets held within a PIE. 29 If assets within a PIE are subject to CGT, the required daily calculations may well be unworkable, or at the least give rise to significant administration and compliance costs. PIE funds (and fund managers) will need a reasonable period to change their systems and governing documents to give effect to any such tax changes. We expect that a period of at least two to three years from the final legislation would be necessary to allow for the required changes. 4445380\_1 6 30 If, however, the TWG recommends that CGT applies to assets within a PIE, we consider there should be an option to calculate that tax on a deemed risk free rate of capital return. 31 Any such method could approximate the long-term capital return on all relevant assets. While work would be need to be done to determine the appropriate rate, a long-term average inflation rate of return of say 1% to 2% would seem appropriate. We also note that the current 5% rate of FDR applying to determine income on equities would now, in the current environment, seem to be too high and should be reconsidered. 32 Finally, if CGT were to apply to assets in PIEs, it will be important that there is no further level of tax. We understand that the TWG are not proposing that sales of PIE interests will be subject to tax to the extent that they are currently exempt income and we agree with this approach. Threshold for immediately deductible legal fees 33 We support the suggestion to increase the $10,000 limit for the automatic deduction for legal fees 7 .

Jim Gordon Tax Limited 1 November 2018 The Chair Tax Working Group By email: secretariat@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Dear Sir Michael The following is my submission on the Tax Working Group’s (the Group’s) very well written Interim Report. The Report covers an impressively wide range of tax matters. In general, the Group’s recommendations are good and are to be applauded. However, a CGT is only worth having if the associated compliance costs are acceptable. As proposed this is not the case. The implementation costs, which arise from the proposed valuation day approach, are extremely high. At v-day: • All businesses will have to ascertain whether they have goodwill, and, if so, it has to be valued; • The vast majority (95% plus) of companies in New Zealand will have to have their shares valued; • Land and buildings will have to be valued (government or rateable values are meaningless in this context); and • Other fixed assets will have to be considered to ascertain if their market value is above cost, and if so they will have to be valued at v-day. \[1\] 2 This is, in my opinion, is an unacceptable imposition – not only of compliance costs, but also because of the uncertainty inherent in valuation. Third party market transactions are the only accurate determination of real value. My other major concern at this stage is that the Group’s good and coherent work to date has the potential to be undone by compromise. For example, a new decision to tax capital gains at a concessionary tax rate will significantly reduce the integrity of the CGT and will increase compliance costs. This attachment to this letter discusses my brief analysis of some of the proposals and outlines some issues: • Compliance costs generally; • Capital gains tax generally; • Collecting PAYE; • Contractors; and • Environmental tax issues. I would like the opportunity to discuss the major points I make with the Group. Yours sincerely, Jim Gordon Jim Gordon Tax Ltd 3 Attachment Compliance costs New Zealand’s tax compliance costs are low by international standards. In particular our GST is world leading because its “no compromises” approach makes it simple and certain. I am very pleased that the Group has seen fit to endorse without amendment New Zealand’s core income tax, imputation and GST settings. In particular I agree with the decision not to have a lower SME company tax rate – this would have been compliance cost intensive. This endorsement of the core settings will help to keep compliance costs low. I will comment more specifically on compliance costs under the various headings below. Capital gains tax If New Zealand is going to have a capital gains tax then the Group’s Interim Report discussion represents an excellent start, with a couple of exceptions. Any stepping back from these positive features has the potential to reduce the integrity of the CGT proposals and increase compliance costs. In particular I endorse: • The proposed integration with income tax – this is essential to prevent boundary issues and debates, and to reduce compliance costs. • Determining the assets involved by inclusion – this successfully deals with all the marginal issues such as collectibles and the question of when does my old car, which I still regularly use, stop being a cost center and starting being a collectable. • The proposed family roll-over reliefs. Spouse to spouse and matrimonial property should just be automatic and the relief should apply to all CGT assets (as it already does to income tax assets). The more interesting issue is when assets pass through generations. I accept the point that this could be more than one generation, but if you follow the pattern of the Tax Act which often regards associated persons as one economic entity an inter-generational roll-over relief is sensible. If there is real concern about this perhaps there should only be one inter-generational roll-over per substantial asset. Also, it could perhaps only apply to non-liquid assets such as land and shares in family companies (remembering that the underlying assets of such companies will also be subject to CGT). 4 • Roll-over relief for replacement assets. The Paper helpfully uses stepping stone farms as an example. Another example is highlighted by the single-asset (e.g. a cool store) company and replacement insurance. If the asset is munted (as actually happened in the Canterbury earthquake) it is, under current tax law, deemed to be sold at the value of the insurance proceeds received (which is in practice always higher than cost). Presently depreciation is recovered – meaning that unless new funds are injected the asset can’t be replaced like for like (a roll-over was given for depreciation recovered from assets munted by the Canterbury earthquakes). A CGT will exacerbate this as the whole difference between tax book value and replacement value will be taxable. At the least roll-over relief for both depreciation recovered and CGT for assets that are munted that are insured for replacement value seems appropriate. Preferable would be a generic CGT roll-over for assets that are replaced. However, I have real concerns about: • The proposed valuation day approach. This will be compliance cost intensive. The particular concerns I have in this area include: o Valuation:  The need to value all shares in non-listed companies – this will be onerous and subjective;  The need to value all land and buildings that is in the CGT base– while there are suggestions to reduce compliance costs and subjectivity I do not believe that these will be properly effective; and  The need to value all other business assets (including goodwill) except for those assets whose valuation is obvious (e.g. cash and listed securities), and those items of depreciable property whose market value is clearly below cost, will be onerous and subjective. These issues can be addressed by applying the CGT to assets acquired after the CGT introduction date – the advantages being an elimination of the valuation requirement with a consequent significant decrease in compliance costs and an elimination of the subjectivity that valuation causes – a 3 rd party transaction always provides hard evidence of valuation. 5 o The compliance costs associated with having to record the v-day value, perhaps for years, do not seem to have been fully considered. It the CGT asset belongs to a business and that business prepares financial statements those financial statements should be required to schedule v-day CGT assets and the v-day values. However, if there are depreciable assets whose market value is above cost an extra column in the depreciation schedule will be needed to record this valuation. On a whole-of-New Zealand basis this will be expensive as the programs for fixed asset schedules will need to be amended. In fact, this could get very complicated as there may be depreciation recovered on the sale of a CGT depreciable asset as well as a capital loss! Again, where financial statements are prepared, the adoption of “an assets acquired from” approach solves this as there will be one common cost base established by the 3 rd party transaction. However, I acknowledge that this does not resolve the issue of recording the values of CGT assets which not in the tax base or which are not included in financial statements (see below). Where there are CGT assets not in the tax base or which are not included in financial statements I accept that there will be issues with recording the CGT cost base. I agree that the requirement for this to be notified annually to Inland Revenue is by far the best way around this. An issue will be identifying the value of enhancements/improvements after acquisition (or the valuation date if that approach is not changed), especially to the extent this includes work contributed by the owner. This may deserve further thought. • Herd scheme livestock. The herd scheme clearly cannot continue in its present form as the Herd schemes’ policy presumption is not compatible with a CGT. This policy presumption is that the whole herd is the equivalent to one fixed asset and that asset value changes should be regarded as being on capital account and therefore tax-free. There are a variety of issues here that need to be considered potentially including both fiscal and compliance costs. Expert advice will be needed. • Farm improvements other than depreciable assets. This includes fencing and orchards, including their infra-structure and the vines or trees themselves. Currently, a new owner of these assets may amortise these improvements, presuming that they are listed in the appropriate Schedule of the Tax Act, based on the original owner’s original cost, and not, for subsequent owners, their acquisition values. A CGT will cause this to be reconsidered. At least in early years, the fiscal cost of amortisation based on a valuation or acquisition values is likely to exceed the tax made on any capital gains 6 assessed to the vendor. This fiscal cost might simply be part of the cost of introducing a capital gains tax. • Where companies own CGT assets there is a potential issue with double tax of the one gain (or double losses), especially where the company is land-rich. For listed land-rich companies such as Property for Industries it seems reasonable to presume that, over time, all shareholder gains or losses are reflected in the net assets of the company, which will be recorded at valuation. This may provide an opportunity to address this. For non-listed companies the issue is equally acute, although family companies may be able to structure around any double tax – however, at the least this will incur compliance costs and is yet another item that could trip over small business accountants. An inter-generational roll-over relief might help in this area. However, considerable thought is clearly needed. Collecting PAYE The Paper correctly identifies that there is a problem with collecting PAYE in some circumstances. I agree that PAYE and other compulsory deductions from wages should be regarded as being held in trust by the employer for employees and accordingly should not be regarded as being part of the working capital of the employer. The single best way of achieving this would be to require such deductions to be forwarded to Inland Revenue or other agency at the same time as employees are paid. In practice this would be when the payroll information is forwarded to Inland Revenue. However, this may not be achievable. I wonder if in the past Inland Revenue has not pursued outstanding PAYE etc. with sufficient vigor – if so this might be part of the problem and should be part of any solution. The Paper proposes a “directors’ liability” based on a notice to directors. While I can understand why such a suggestion is made, its scope is too wide. Non-executive directors should not be subject to such obligations. Often, they don’t have access to the detailed books and records of the company. Sometimes they have been brought in to assist in trying to resolve a company’s poor trading position. 7 However, I am totally comfortable that executive directors, and especially executive directors that are associated with the shareholders, should be personally liable for PAYE etc. short- falls. Perhaps this should be as if they have personally guaranteed that the payments will be made, i.e. without any notice regime applying. This should address the concern that the private sector has raised concerning this proposal while still allowing Inland Revenue to pursue the relevant offenders. Contractors I strongly endorse the Group’s work in this area. Contractors are a significant portion of the SME sector and it is in this sector that the vast majority of tax evasion occurs. Third party reporting of contractor’s income to Inland Revenue to Inland Revenue will increase compliance and decrease evasion in this area. 1 The corresponding increase in “employers’” compliance costs is a small price to pay for this. Environmental tax issues I endorse the Group’s work to date in coming up with a framework approach, however, I strongly believe that the framework should be a whole-of-government framework. This is to ensure that in respect of environmental matters Government and its agencies has one coordinated approach. For example, it is conceivable that one government agency might be considering a penalty on farmer’s excessive nitrogen outputs and another agency might be considering a nitrogen tax on fertiliser, both with the same objective of reducing the use of nitrogen. A whole-of-government approach to environmental issues seems to be essential. A tax approach to the environment in isolation is not appropriate. 1 See the August 2009 OECG paper “Withholding & Information Reporting Regimes for Small/Medium-sized Businesses & Self-employed Taxpayers” and various papers authored by Joel Slemrod, an internationally noted expert in tax administration.

The New Zealand Airports Association ("NZ Airports") welcomes the opportunity to make this submission on the Tax Working Group's ("TWG") "Future of Tax: Interim Report" ("Interim Report"). 2. The NZ Airports contact for this submission is: Kevin Ward Chief Executive PO Box 11 369 Manners Street Wellington 6011 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 3. NZ Airports believes that it is important for the TWG to recommend to the Government that deductions for depreciation for commercial and industrial buildings need to be reinstated. This is a significant issue for airports and the broader economy. 4. The growth of the tourism industry depends on airports providing world class facilities, with capacity to efficiently handle a growing number of aircraft and passengers over time. The Government has also made clear that it has a strategic objective to facilitate investment in airports to build greater connectivity with, and strengthen economic development in, the regions. 5. Currently, the taxation system runs counter to these interests. Not allowing taxpayers, and specifically airports, to deduct depreciation for buildings adds unjustified cost to infrastructure investment. In particular: (a) Commercial buildings do depreciate over time. All international evidence suggests that overseas buildings do depreciate – and there is no logical reason why New Zealand buildings would not follow this international trend. (b) This is especially true for airport passenger terminals. A 2010 report from Opus International Consultants Limited ("Opus Report") concluded that the estimated useful life of an international airport terminal in New Zealand is between 37 and 45 years (c) Economic regulation of airports treats land and buildings separately, and allows for depreciation of terminals as does International Financial Reporting Standards for statutory financial reporting. (d) There is a clear tax distortion where commercial building owners are overtaxed relative to other investors. The taxation system should promote productivity and \[1\] 2 growth – and not advantage one form of investment over another – particularly if the incentive is against investment in strategic public infrastructure that supports New Zealand economic and social productivity (noting that tourism is our number one export earner). (e) The current regime creates incentives that are contrary to the Government’s environmental and social responsibility goals. For example, there is a tax disincentive against investment in seismic resilient structures or thermally efficient cladding or glazing as those components are non-depreciable for tax purposes. Whereas heating systems and energy costs are deductible and therefore favoured by the tax regime. Also, buildings are only deductible in the event that they are destroyed by an event beyond the owner’s control, such as an earthquake. (f) The current power for the Commissioner to set provisional rates for classes of buildings with expected useful lives of under 50 years is not an adequate remedy. NZ Airports was unsuccessful with an application to obtain a provisional rate for airport terminal buildings and airports do not enjoy tax depreciation deductions for the majority of buildings assets regardless of their expected useful lives. 6. We were pleased that the Interim Report acknowledges there is a case for reinstating depreciation deductions for commercial and industrial buildings. 1 If however the TWG were to ultimately decide against a broad change for all commercial buildings, then it should at least allow for the reinstatement of depreciation deductions for a narrower class that includes 'airport terminal' buildings (as described in the recommendation section below). BACKGROUND TO THE ISSUE 7. As part of Budget 2010, the then Government decided that, from the 2011-12 income year, the depreciation rate on buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more would be 0% (effectively removing deductions). 8. NZ Airports conveyed its disapproval about this proposal to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue in early 2010, and was disappointed to find that the decision to remove tax depreciation was subsequently announced in the Budget. 9. We note the Commissioner's advice that the Generic Tax Policy Process was not followed, and consultation was limited. However senior tax practitioners, the Property Council of New Zealand, and the Housing New Zealand Corporation all expressed a strong view that buildings did depreciate. 10. On the basis that airport terminals have a useful life of less than 50 years, in December 2010 NZ Airports applied to the Commissioner for a provisional rate for airport terminals. This was unsuccessful. DEPRECIATION SHOULD BE ALLOWED Airport Terminals Depreciate 11. Despite the 2010 changes, as now recognised by the TWG, there is strong evidence that commercial and industrial buildings do depreciate over time. We agree with the recommendation expressed by the Commissioner in her Depreciation on Buildings: Further 1 Interim Report, at 107. 3 information on potential revenue reducing options document that depreciation deductions should be reinstated. 2 12. In particular, we agree with Inland Revenue's views that: 3 (a) International studies demonstrate that buildings do depreciate – with estimates ranging up to 9.9% per annum. (b) New Zealand is a clear outlier in the OECD in not allowing tax depreciation deductions for commercial or industrial buildings. This has produced a higher effective marginal tax rate than any other country in the OECD. (c) Despite the reliance on NZ data for the decision in 2010, there is no rationale for why buildings in New Zealand are less likely to depreciate than their international counterparts. 13. The fact that commercial buildings do depreciate is very evident for airports. Airport terminal buildings can and do lose value over time. In 2010, NZ Airports submitted extensively to the Commissioner on the reasons why airport terminal buildings decline in value, and these factors continue to remain the case today. The main factors are: (a) Long term growth in air traffic volumes. Airport terminal buildings must be adapted to accommodate increased passenger volumes and to prevent capacity bottlenecks. (b) Changes over time in aircraft size and peak period passenger flow demands. These changes require airports to undertake modifications to dimensions of spaces and corridors of terminal buildings, which has a consequential effect on building envelopes. Furthermore, different aircraft require different terminal configurations. As such, rapid changes in aircraft technology require airports to modify terminal configurations and corresponding safety requirements. (c) Changes over time in the scale of baggage handling equipment. Changes in capacity requirements for baggage handling mean that manual baggage handling systems become obsolete in light of more sophisticated automated baggage systems. This technology change has implications for room heights and dimensions of baggage handling spaces and a consequential effect on building envelopes. (d) Changes in regulation over time affecting the useful life of the building. Airport terminals operate in an environment where regulatory requirements can change rapidly and significantly. The following examples have had a significant effect on scale of building spaces and terminal configuration over time (and consequential effect on building envelopes): (i) Upgrades to security and the physical separation of passenger arrivals and departures due to international regulations. 2 Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue "Appendix C: Depreciation on Buildings – Further information on potential revenue reducing options" (July 2018) ("Appendix C"). 3 Appendix C, at 19. 4 (ii) Changes to the security screening of passengers and carry-on baggage that did not exist in previous eras for departing and transit passengers. (iii) Increased duration and complexity in screening procedure requiring more internal space to accommodate screening units and passenger queues. (iv) Requirements for x-ray screening of outbound international baggage. This has had a dramatic effect on building dimensions including inter-floor heights in baggage handling areas and has resulted in the need for additional control and inspection rooms. (v) Requirements for quarantine inspections and x-ray screening for arriving passengers. (vi) Changes to: (aa) building codes and regulations (for example, seismic and fire egress requirements); (bb) the acceptability of materials (for example, insulation and roofing standards); and (cc) expectations relating to the sustainability and environmental performance of buildings and building materials; which can result in some buildings becoming uneconomic to modify, compared with building new. (e) Changes in the operation of the airline industry. Airports must be able to respond to fluctuations in the number of carriers operating in the New Zealand aviation industry. Furthermore, differences in operating models between low-cost and 'full service' carriers require airport terminals to accommodate a range of airline preferences. Changes to these operating models can therefore have a significant impact on the ability of airport terminals to function effectively. (f) Changes in the way airports undertake business. Like the airline industry, the business characteristics of airports have undergone change. Airports have become diverse commercial and privatised businesses – a development that is reflected in the subjection of aeronautical revenues to increasing degrees of regulation. These developments impact on terminal configuration and scale. 14. In 2010 NZ Airports also engaged Opus to prepare an analysis report on the useful or effective life of airport terminal building structure elements. 4 The Opus Report calculated that the structural elements of the international terminal buildings at Auckland International Airport and Dunedin International Airport had a useful life between 39 and 44 years, and that 4 Opus International Consultants Limited "Report Final: New Zealand Airports Association: Depreciation Lives of Airport Terminal Buildings" (13 December 2010), at 20. 5 regional terminal buildings may also have a structure useful life below 50 years. 5 The Opus Report concluded: 6 it is clearly demonstrated that irrespective of size all airport terminal buildings are subject to frequent significant changes in the operating environment that often result in a need for development and reconfiguration work. There is no expectation that this rate of change will abate in the near future. 15. Queenstown Airport's recent development of its terminal building demonstrates this point. Since 2010, Queenstown's rapid tourism growth has resulted in an upgrade of its domestic gates, an expansion of its international facilities and now a major revamp of its domestic terminal. This includes changes to its check-in, baggage make up, security and domestic gate lounges driven by changes in capacity requirements and security regulation. 16. Accordingly, there is clear evidence that our airport members do suffer a legitimate non-cash expense after constructing terminal buildings. According to the purpose of the depreciation regime, they should be entitled to claim deductions that the taxation system currently denies. Buildings and land are separate 17. The original decision to remove depreciation may have been influenced by a failure to clearly differentiate between the value of buildings and the value of underlying land. Inland Revenue has recently noted the failure to properly separate out land and buildings in the QVNZ data which was used in Treasury's analysis in 2010: 7 Limitations of the Treasury’s analysis include (most of which were recognised in the 2010 Joint Report) ... Difficulties in separating building value from land — this difficulty may be particularly pronounced during a period of rapidly appreciating property prices. This is also a limitation of the used asset price and rental data approaches. 18. It is evident that building and land are separate assets and should be treated as such by the taxation system. It does not follow that because land appreciates in value, buildings will as well. 19. For example, for airports regulated under Part 4 of the Commerce Act 1986, the input methodologies set by the Commerce Commission specifically separate out the value of land and the value of buildings. While land is not depreciated under that regime, airports are allowed to depreciate buildings and other non-land assets. 20. Accordingly, the tax system should be capable of ensuring that the rules for depreciating buildings are not unduly influenced by the appreciation of the underlying land. Tax system should not undermine incentives to invest in critical infrastructure 21. The current depreciation deduction rules distort investment incentives. NZ Airports submits that it is particularly important that the tax rules do not deter investment in critical economic and social infrastructure such as airport passenger terminals. 5 Opus Report, at 20. 6 Opus Report, at 20. 7 Appendix C, at \[3.12\]. 6 22. The Minister for Regional Economic Development has also signalled that the Government's priority focus is on developing regional airport infrastructure: 8 “The Government recognises that many regional airports are looking to improve their resilience and contribute to their region’s economic development plans. This is why we are also considering the wider role that air connectivity can play and how we can measure its value to regions. 23. As such, we expect any obstacles to development of regional airport facilities will be of particular concern. 24. We note Inland Revenue's current view that: 9 (a) the current position for buildings is resulting in a tax distortion which means that investments that would be profitable in the absence of tax are not being made due to our tax settings; (b) this is reducing productivity, and likely reducing New Zealand's net welfare; and (c) horizontal equity is negatively impacted as building owners are overtaxed relative to other investors. 25. These concerns apply to airports. Despite incurring significant expenditure on assets that have clear national economic and social benefits, airports are being overtaxed relative to other investments because they are not entitled to recover depreciation deductions for tax purposes. Any limits on New Zealand airports' ability to attract equity investment to fund growth leads to a higher cost of capital and consequently higher prices to consumers. 26. The benefits delivered by airport investment include economic benefits for local, regional and national economies through the enabling of connections that allow and facilitate tourism and international trade. 27. The absence of tax depreciation deductions for buildings is also contrary to the Government’s environmental and social responsibility goals. There is a tax disincentive against investment in seismic resilient structures or thermally efficient cladding or glazing as those components are non-depreciable for tax purposes. Heating systems and energy costs are tax deductible, thereby favouring energy usage instead of more environmentally sustainable insulation. Stronger building structures to protect against earthquakes are non- deductible for tax purposes, whereas building losses following an earthquake are deductible, again creating unintended tax incentives. 28. A 2013 study by Market Economics for NZ Airports concluded that activities associated with all airport operations in New Zealand contributed $39.1 billion to the national economy, with this figure increasing to $48.7 billion when the wider airport environment are taken into account. For the three main regulated airports, this study demonstrated that in 2013 Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch Airports together: 10 (a) supported 21,198 jobs in airports and aviation; 8 Hon Shane Jones, Minister for Regional Economic Development "$5.5m for Gisborne airport redevelopment" (press release, 7 September 2018). 9 Appendix C, at \[1.6\]. 10 Market Economics "Limited Economic and Social Contribution of New Zealand's Airports" (17 December 2013). 7 (b) contributed $4.148 billion in economic output directly associated with airport operations and aviation activities; and (c) contributed $3.186 billion to the national economy by way of value added, with $1.983 billion of this directly associated with airport operations and aviation activities. 29. NZIER in its report to Depreciation and land tax in 2010 noted that the removal of depreciation deductions would harm New Zealand's overall competiveness: 11 In addition, depreciation of commercial buildings is common practice in the OECD. Removing depreciation in New Zealand would make us an outlier and reduce our international tax competitiveness. This could hamper already weak foreign direct investment into New Zealand, the health of the local capital market and erode export competitiveness. This is clearly counter to government policy objectives of making New Zealand a more internationally competitive economy and would place us at a further disadvantage to Australia. (emphasis added) 30. In this context, the Government should be concerned about tax policy that adds cost to the aviation sector, and risks reducing its international competitiveness. Black hole expenditure 31. NZ Airports is also concerned about the range of "black hole" expenditure that airports face. That is, business expenditure that is expected to result in an economic cost to an airport, but is neither immediately deductible for tax purposes, nor deductible over time. 32. As an example, the Commissioner denied Queenstown Airport depreciation deductions for its Runway End Safety Area. 12 This was despite: (a) the core project cost to Queenstown Airport being approximately $5.5 million; and (b) the fact that the project was required by the Civil Aviation Rules to make airports safer and was also necessary so that Queenstown Airport could continue to operate as an international airport, allowing increased tourism into the Queenstown region. 33. There is a clear ongoing risk that airports continue to be subject to black hole expenditure for airports for valuable social infrastructure. Changing the position on depreciation for airport terminal buildings would be a step in the right direction to mitigate these concerns. Provisional rate is insufficient 34. Currently the only ability for an airport to seek depreciation deductions is to apply to the Commissioner for a provisional depreciation rate for a class of building. 13 The Commissioner can issue a provisional depreciation rate if she is convinced that a "class of buildings" have a 11 NZIER "Depreciation and land tax – assessment of selected Tax Working Group recommendations" (5 February 2010), at 1. 12 Queenstown Airport Corporation Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZCA 20. 13 Section EE 35 of the Income Tax Act currently provides for the Commissioner to set a provisional depreciation rate is under section 91AAG to 91AAJ of the TAA 1994. 8 useful life of less than 50 years and she does not have an applicable economic rate in her table of depreciation rates. 14 35. NZ Airports submits that the current discretionary procedure is not producing satisfactory outcomes. This is because: (a) There is always (natural) uncertainty about what is the expected life of most assets. When the Commissioner receives an application for a provisional rate, she often receives her own expert assessment which disagrees with the taxpayer's expert assessment. This means any application for a provisional rate often spirals into an expensive and time consuming factual dispute even when a taxpayer can demonstrate robust evidence for an asset's expected useful life. For example, NZ Airports commissioned an expert to draft a report on the expected useful life of passenger terminal buildings which concluded that it was between 39 and 44 years for international terminal buildings. Despite this, the Commissioner still declined to set a provisional rate. (b) The current 50 year useful life standard is also arbitrary in nature – even if an asset does decline in value over a longer useful life than 50 years, the taxpayer still suffers an economic loss that should entitle them to a tax depreciation deduction. For instance, the Commissioner's own depreciation schedule also notes assets with an estimated useful life of up to 100 years (such as bridges, tunnels and dams) which are entitled to receive depreciation deductions. It is inconsistent therefore for buildings to only be depreciable if their useful lives have been proven to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to be less than 50 years. 36. Importantly, the Commissioner does not look at broader factors when exercising her discretion about whether to set a provisional rate. We consider that the social value of the class of assets should be an important tiebreaker when there is conflicting expert evidence as to the expected useful life of an asset. Put another way, the Commissioner should give the benefit of the doubt to the taxpayer when determining whether depreciation deductions should be awarded to class of assets that have a clear economic benefit to the broader public. 37. Overall, this shows that the discretion from the Commissioner is not sufficient to address the issue and legislative reform is required to allow depreciation deductions to reflect the economic reality that of buildings do indeed depreciate. RECOMMENDATION 38. NZ Airport's proposal is that the TWG should: (a) In the first instance, reinstate depreciation deductions for all commercial and industrial buildings. (b) If that is not accepted, allow depreciation deductions specifically for a new class of building that could be defined as 'airport terminal' buildings. 39. If TWG chooses to allow a depreciation deduction for 'airport terminal' buildings, a potential legislative definition could be: 14 Commissioner of Inland Revenue "Changes to building depreciation" (13 August 2010). 9 A building located at an airport whose primary function is to facilitate the passage of travellers (whether international or domestic) arriving at and departing from that airport. 40. Supporting material and guidance could provide that an airport terminal will include spaces to facilitate this primary function and also activities which are ancillary to it. These may include: (a) passenger check-in, bag drop and ticketing activities; (b) arrival and departure spaces (including airline and hospitality lounges); (c) retail and duty free shopping, bars, safes and restaurants; (d) transportation booking/collection (e.g. rental car, taxi or public transport); and (e) baggage processing and collection. 41. The cost of assets which constitute the building fit-out or plan would not form part of the airport terminal building as these are already separately depreciable.

Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “perio dic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low- investment, low-productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth. I submit that the Working Group recommend against im plementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. \[1\] 2 Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced- harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low- price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. I support the introduction of sugar taxes. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. I wish to make a verbal submission in support of this submission. Yours sincerely, Ashley Cunliffe \[1\]

The FSC represents New Zealand’s financial services industry having 35 members at 31 October 2018. Companies represented in the FSC include the major insurers in life, disability, income, and trauma insurance, and some fund managers and KiwiSaver providers plus law firms, audit firms, and other providers to the financial services sector. Our submission has been developed through consultation with FSC members, and represents the views of our members and our industry. We acknowledge the time and input of our members in contributing to this submission. The FSC‘s guiding vision is to be the voice of New Zealand’s financial services industry and we strongly support initiatives that are designed to deliver: 1.Strong and sustainable consumer outcomes; 2.Sustainability of the financial services sector; and 3.Increasing professionalism and trust of the industry. Financial Services Council of New Zealand Level 33, ANZ Centre, 23-29 Albert St, Auckland 1010 P: +64 9 985 5762 E: fsc@fsc.org.nz www.fsc.org.nz 2 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group Executive summary We welcome the opportunity to submit our views on the Future of Tax: Interim Report. Given the focus of the FSC on growing and protecting the wealth of New Zealanders, our submission is centred around the extension of the taxation of capital income as it relates to investments of KiwiSaver and other retirement schemes, Multi-Rate Portfolio Investment Entities (MRPIEs) and Life Insurance policyholders. We also submit on other matters including: • the recommendation on removing Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) for employees earning up to $48,000 per annum, and, • a five percentage point reduction for each of the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver also applying to non-KiwiSaver Retirement Schemes and MRPIEs. The FSC believes that the tax system should encourage investment and saving for retirement. The FSC therefore supports any recommendations of the Tax Working Group that both encourages greater savings and provides a “level playing field” between direct investment and investment via managed funds and retirement schemes. The FSC submits that: 1. Shares should be excluded from being a targeted asset category. 2. If key point 1 is not accepted, the current Australasian share exemption for MRPIEs should be retained. 3. The recommendation on removing ESCT for employees earning up to $48,000 pa should also apply to non-Kiwisaver Retirement Schemes; and a five percentage point reduction for each of the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver should also apply to both non-KiwiSaver Retirement Schemes and MRPIEs. I can be contacted on to discuss any element of our submission. Yours sincerely Richard Klipin Chief Executive Officer, Financial Services Council \[1\] \[1\] 3 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group Extension of Taxation of Capital Income to Shares in Companies 1. Exclusion of Shares from Targeted Asset Category The Future of Tax Interim Report includes an option to extend the taxation of capital income to shares as part of the targeted approach. The Report states shares are included as they are regarded as “relatively easy to tax”. The FSC submits that shares in companies should be excluded. It is FSC’s view that interests in land have created the asset class tax bias and therefore, interests in land should be the primary target of any extension of taxation of capital income, not shares. Taking into account that any taxation of gains arising from disposal of the family home are specifically excluded from the types of asset classes that may be considered by the Tax Working Group (TWG), the bias towards interests in land will still be present. Therefore, excluding shares from the taxation of capital income may partially offset this bias. Anti-avoidance rules around land rich companies could ensure that companies are not used to bypass a tax on property gains. The value of company shares is significantly determined by underlying cashflows that are generally taxable when derived by companies. In addition, Australasian companies generally have high yields which mean taxable dividends. Given these factors, it is not necessary to include shares in the targeted asset categories and accordingly they should be excluded. The FSC is also concerned that extending the regime to encompass Australasian shares may have a negative impact on New Zealand’s capital markets. For example, where the Fair Dividend Regime (FDR) is maintained, for some NZ companies, it may be desirable for them to relocate offshore if that would mean a better tax outcome for their New Zealand investors. 2. Taxing Australasian Share Gains of KiwiSaver, Other Retirement Schemes and MRPIEs As above, the FSC submits that shares be excluded from the targeted asset category if the TWG recommends an extension of the taxation of capital income. If this is not accepted and share gains and losses will be subject to tax, the primary issue for the FSC is how equity is maintained amongst investors in KiwiSaver, other Retirement Schemes and MRPIEs, and direct investment, in a way that is practically achievable and seeks to minimise risk and compliance. The Report outlined a number of options to do this. We comment on several of these below in order of preference: 2.1. Status quo with current exemption for Australasian shares This is our preferred option. We recognise the concern of the TWG around what this would mean for direct investment versus investing via managed funds, and that this may mean the Australasian share exemption is limited to long-term retirement savings. A practical consideration in doing this will be how to make it work given wholesale interfunding structures through which a majority of KiwiSaver and other Retirement Schemes, along with other MRPIEs, currently invest. 4 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group 2.2. A full accrual basis (including foreign shares), with possibly a discount for Australasian shares: • Overall, this would be practically workable and should enable funds to maintain equity between investors. • There should be no ringfencing of losses and it is important that the current regime of allowing managed funds to receive cash refunds continues. If losses are deferred to later periods (eg funds would be required to carry a deferred tax asset which does not work under the Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) regime), this will lead to equity issues between investors and significantly increase complexity and compliance costs. • To compensate managed funds for being taxed on an accruals basis, we understand the TWG is considering applying a discount to the accrual gains. The FSC submits that a discount at a flat rate be applied as opposed to each fund determining its own rate based on turnover of shares. The discount would also need to be at such a level to make this basis attractive and to “sell” the concept to investors. We do not believe that simply being able to cash up losses is sufficient to offset the impact of funds being taxable on an accrual basis. There needs to be a discount, particularly given the need for a level playing field between direct investment (if taxable on a realisation basis) and MRPIEs (if taxable on an accrual basis). • Our members have a range of views on whether to include rest of world shares. Some have a preference, though not unanimous, for accrual on Australasian shares while retaining FDR for foreign shares. One potential benefit would be that it would take away the current FDR hedging issues that currently exist (given only a minority of fund managers are using the current FDR hedging regime due to its complexity and associated compliance). We comment on this separately below also. However, extending the regime to the rest of world shares is likely to expose the Government to significant fiscal risks when there a significant market downturns leading to unrealised losses being cashed up. 2.3. A full FDR basis (including Australasian shares): The FSC believes that it would be a difficult sell for investors if shares held by managed funds were taxed on a full FDR basis, while direct holdings were only taxed on a realised basis. Therefore, we do not support extending the existing FDR regime to also include Australasian shares. However, the FSC submits the existing FDR rate should be regularly reviewed and reset if required. The FSC support the comments in the Report the 5% FDR rate is too high and should be reduced. 3. Application Date for Shares The FSC has submitted that Australasian shares be excluded from the targeted asset category. If that is not accepted, the FSC submits the implementation date of 1 April 2021 is unrealistic particularly given the uncertainty of current Government and future Government support. If the 1 April 2021 implementation is not deferred, the FSC further submits that there be phased application dates for taxing the targeted asset classes. 5 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group Not all of the targeted asset classes need to be taxable from the same date of 1 April 2021. Shares and portfolio shareholdings could be taxable from a later date, say 1 April 2022 at the earliest. This would provide managed fund and KiwiSaver providers sufficient time to make the required changes to their systems and processes to comply with the new rules (including updating any regulatory documents to inform new and existing investors of changes). 4. FDR Hedging rules The current FDR hedging rules apply to limited scenarios and the tests to meet the rules are complex. Should FDR continue to apply, the FSC submits that the application of FDR hedging rules should be widened to allow more entities to apply FDR to all hedges as long as the entity meets certain thresholds and where possible the rules are simplified. 5. Listed PIEs KiwiSaver and other Retirement Schemes and MRPIEs invest in listed PIEs. The FSC would be concerned if listed PIEs are taxable on the targeted asset gains within the listed PIE and the disposal of the listed PIE shares also being taxable, giving rise to double taxation. The FSC submits the current treatment of distributions by listed PIEs should remain. 6. Non-residents The Report proposes the treatment of capital gains and losses for non-residents will be different from the position for residents. The FSC submits that non-residents investing in a MRPIE should have the same treatment as a resident investor. The different treatment of capital gains and losses would only apply to notified foreign investors in a Foreign Investment PIE. The current tax settings in relation to Foreign Investment PIEs should be maintained. 7. Life Insurance The Report makes a brief reference to life insurance. It refers to policyholders not being taxed on unimputed distributions of income and we understand that this particular point is largely being made in relation to participating policies. The FSC submits that life insurance policies should not be within the targeted asset category. In particular, for participating policies, unimputed distributions should not be taxable as they represent a return of policyholder premiums paid. Participating policies operate on the basis of pooling funds, sharing investment returns and insurance risk. Investment income from pooled funds is currently taxed at 28% on behalf of policyholders, notwithstanding some policyholders may have lower marginal tax rates. Unimputed distributions of income on participating policies (which are generated when premiums payments are in excess of claims) represent a return of policyholder premiums paid and therefore should not be taxed. 6 FSC Submission – Tax Working Group 8. Non-KiwiSaver Retirement Schemes and PIE Rate Reductions for all MRPIEs The FSC submits the recommendation on removing ESCT for employees earning up to $48,000 per annum and a five percentage point reduction for each of the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver also apply to non-KiwiSaver Retirement Schemes which are equivalent to KiwiSaver Schemes. This will ensure a consistency and fairness of outcome for members regardless of whether they are saving for their retirement through KiwiSaver or a KiwiSaver equivalent type scheme. In this regard, the FSC is supportive of the submission being made by Workplace Savings. Further, the FSC submits the lower PIE tax rates for low income earners should also be available to all MRPIEs in the interests of encouraging saving as the FSC originally submitted.

This response is from Workplace Savings NZ Incorporated (WSNZ), a non-profit member organisation representing the interests of employers who offer workplace retirement savings schemes, their trustees and their members, other retirement scheme managers and supervisors, 18 KiwiSaver scheme providers, retirement savings industry service providers and professional advisers. More information about WSNZ is set out in the Appendix to this letter. The focus of our feedback is on the implications for retirement schemes collectively (KiwiSaver schemes, workplace savings schemes and superannuation schemes) of: • the options being considered for extending the taxation of capital income; • the Tax Working Group’s recommendations to the Government regarding KiwiSaver schemes only, being: o exempting from ESCT the employer’s matching contribution of 3% of salary for a member earning not more than $48,000 per year; and o reducing the two lower tiers of PIE tax rates by 5% each; and • the Group’s recommendation that the Government consider ways to simplify the determination of PIE tax rates (an initiative that would benefit the providers and members of all multi-rate PIEs). 2 Summary of our feedback The Group’s final report should: • give appropriate recognition to non-KiwiSaver retirement schemes (i.e. workplace savings and superannuation schemes) and their contributions to the retirement savings base; and • recommend treating those schemes equitably relative to KiwiSaver schemes. We do not support imposing any tax on retirement schemes’ capital income to the extent that it is not already imposed, as that would eat into members’ retirement savings and therefore run counter to the desired policy aim of growing the retirement savings pool for all New Zealanders to reduce their dependence on New Zealand Superannuation. The proposed targeted ESCT exemption must apply to a functionally KiwiSaver-equivalent locked-in account in a workplace savings scheme which is a complying superannuation fund. Additionally: • the applicable income limit should be tested in the same way as combined salary and employer superannuation contribution amounts are currently tested for ESCT purposes; and • if there is to be a maximum income limit, suitable evidence-based consideration should be given to what might in empirical terms be the appropriate maximum. We consider it fundamentally wrong for KiwiSaver to have a uniquely ‘approved’ status among retirement schemes for PIE tax rate purposes, giving it an investment income tax advantage over workplace savings and superannuation schemes – all retirement schemes should be treated consistently for PIE tax purposes. We strongly agree with taking this opportunity to simplify the rules for determining PIE tax rates, in the interests of fairness and coherence – and we also recommend that ‘prescribed investor rate’ be replaced with clearer terminology so as to convey the right concepts and reduce the risk of error. No exploration of how to make the tax treatment of retirement savings fairer would be complete without acknowledging (and optimally addressing) the inflexibly high tax impost placed on defined benefit schemes and the tax treatment of lifetime annuities. General comments While we do acknowledge that timing constraints have limited the scope of the Interim Report, we were somewhat struck by the absence of any reference to the non-KiwiSaver workplace savings 3 schemes and superannuation schemes which continue making a very significant contribution to the retirement savings pool and to New Zealanders’ well-being in retirement. To give some idea of the continuing size and significance of this sector, in overview terms and based on latest annual reports there were recently estimated to be: • 90 workplace savings schemes (22 of them open to new joiners) registered under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA) as having restricted status – those schemes had a little under $12 billion in assets and around 97,000 members; • 19 FMCA-registered legacy superannuation schemes, which had around $4 billion in assets and close to 90,000 members; • 6 FMCA-registered multi-employer workplace savings schemes, with over $6.5 billion in assets and almost 90,000 members; and • 10 FMCA-registered on-market retail superannuation schemes, with close to $1.2 billion in assets and a little under 10,000 members. Non-KiwiSaver retirement schemes therefore had (as at the latest balance dates for which annual reports are available) over $23.5 billion in assets and over 285,000 members. Those numbers, while smaller than the $48.6 billion in assets and 2.84 million members referred to in the Financial Markets Authority’s latest KiwiSaver Annual Report, make non-KiwiSaver retirement schemes still very important contributors to the national retirement savings pool. Part 7 of the Interim Report, headed Retirement Schemes, does not acknowledge this reality. Superannuation schemes are referred to only in passing and workplace savings schemes (which almost invariably involve greater employer subsidy rates than KiwiSaver and other features such as ancillary death and disablement insurance) are not mentioned in any way. Only KiwiSaver schemes are referred to as supporting private saving to maintain an adequate standard of living in retirement. We urge that: • the Group’s final report gives appropriate recognition to non-KiwiSaver registered retirement schemes (i.e. workplace savings schemes and superannuation schemes) and their contributions to the retirement savings base; and 4 • the Group’s final recommendations treat those schemes equitably relative to KiwiSaver schemes (and are particularly mindful of not further disincentivising employer sponsors from supporting their employees’ retirement savings through workplace savings schemes). Expanding taxation of capital income We note that the proposed new rules whereby capital income from Australasian shares are no longer specifically tax-exempt would not only increase the total tax impost for retirement schemes but would also necessitate significant systems changes. By resulting in: • more complexity and therefore increased administrative cost (inevitably passed on to members); and • an increased investment income tax burden; those changes would eat into the retirement savings of KiwiSaver, workplace savings and superannuation scheme members and would therefore run counter to the desired policy aim of growing the retirement savings pool for all New Zealanders to reduce their dependence on New Zealand Superannuation in retirement. The proposals would also impact not only members’ savings but additionally (in defined benefit schemes) employers’ balance of cost funding obligations, because by reducing after-tax investment earnings rate assumptions they would impact those schemes’ actuarially assessed funding ratios. WSNZ considers the current system of taxing retirement schemes’ investment income imperfect certainly; but also relatively simple, fair and widely understood. As the Interim Report acknowledges, New Zealand already in any case stands out internationally for the relative insignificance of its retirement savings incentives. We therefore do not support imposing any tax on capital income to the extent that it is not already imposed on retirement schemes. Consistency in treatment of retirement schemes The Interim Report notes that extending the taxation of capital income by taxing capital gains from holding shares in New Zealand and Australian companies would impose significant additional income tax on KiwiSaver and other savings vehicles. It then observes that the ESCT exemption and PIE tax rate reductions proposed for lower-earning KiwiSaver scheme members would considerably more than compensate that group for the increased tax on Australasian shares. 5 We acknowledge that the proposed targeted ESCT exemption would partially restore an earlier KiwiSaver-specific savings incentive. It would be essential though that: • as was the case with the previous ESCT exemption; and • as remains the case with member tax credit contributions from the Government; that incentive extends to the first 3% of an employer’s contributions to a functionally KiwiSaver- equivalent locked-in account in a workplace savings scheme which is a complying superannuation fund. We also urge that: • the applicable income limit is tested in the same way as combined salary and employer superannuation contribution amounts are tested for tiered ESCT rate purposes currently (i.e. on a backward-looking basis, thereby enabling certainty in year-in-question terms) – the current tests can themselves cause significant administrative difficulty in practice, but are clear in technical terms; and • if there is to be a maximum income limit, suitable evidence-based consideration is given to what might be in empirical terms the appropriate maximum, noting that the currently recommended figure of $48,000: o coincides with the income threshold for the imposition of a 30% PAYE rate; and o is a key income threshold for PIR determination purposes; and is in that sense consistent with other thresholds, but: • it is meaningfully below the national average wage (and in an environment where the median percentage of savings for households whose highest income earner is aged between 30 and 60 is nil for seven out of the ten income brackets); and • alignment with an existing ESCT rate threshold (such as the maximum level of salary/wage and employer superannuation contributions to which the 17.5% rate applies, which is $57,600) would be administratively simpler as well as perhaps more appropriate on enquiry. 6 For completeness, we note that as the targeted ESCT exemption would apply only to certain employed members contributing from pay - though it could be expected to increase the size of that complement - it would not benefit the self-employed, retirees and other non-employees who make up a considerable portion of KiwiSaver members. The net incentive effect (factoring in the offsetting adverse effects of the capital income tax proposals) would also reduce the lower an employed member’s income, and the greater his or her level of exposure to Australasian shares. Turning to the PIE tax rate recommendations, WSNZ is strongly of the view that, in keeping with the core tax principles of equity, fairness and coherence which are referenced in the Interim Report, the recommended 5% lower PIE tax rate reductions should extend to all retirement schemes which are multi-rate PIEs (and not merely to KiwiSaver schemes). Any retirement scheme which is registered as such under the FMCA must be established and operate for retirement savings purposes, and all retirement schemes must therefore impose (and must conform to) various lock-in requirements. The Interim Report refers in Section 7 to there being a case for introducing additional concessions for retirement savings, adding that: • additional saving will improve the living standards of individuals in retirement; and • there are also likely to be broader economic benefits if there is an increase in the rate of national saving. These are observations that in our view apply (if valid) co-extensively to all FMCA-registered retirement schemes – but the Interim Report then simply conflates retirement savings with KiwiSaver savings and makes ESCT and PIE tax rate recommendations solely with respect to KiwiSaver schemes. In seemingly the same vein, the Taxation of Retirement Schemes Background Paper: • distinguishes in several places between KiwiSaver schemes on the one hand and all “non- locked-in PIEs” on the other; • observes that “non-locked-in PIEs are a close substitute for other forms of saving so we would see little justification for providing a five percentage point discount for non-locked-in PIEs”; and 7 • concludes that for this reason such a change should only be considered for PIEs that are KiwiSaver schemes. This reasoning either overlooks non-KiwiSaver retirement schemes which are multi-rate PIEs, or ascribes to non-KiwiSaver retirement schemes a false equivalence with other managed investment schemes, despite them being required to be established and operate for retirement savings purposes. If the latter, then characterising non-KiwiSaver retirement schemes which are multi-rate PIEs as ‘non-locked-in’ PIEs which impliedly are not (in conceptual terms) for retirement savings is incorrect in principle. We consider it fundamentally wrong for KiwiSaver to have a uniquely ‘approved’ status among retirement schemes for PIE tax rate purposes, giving it an investment income tax advantage over workplace savings and superannuation schemes, in view of those other retirement schemes’ broadly KiwiSaver-consistent purposes and their major contribution to New Zealand’s retirement savings pool. In our view all retirement schemes should be treated consistently for PIE tax purposes, including in the context of any concessionary relief given to lower earners or any other demographic to encourage them to save more for retirement. Simplifying PIE rate determinations We firmly concur with taking this opportunity to simplify the rules for determining PIE tax rates in the Income Tax Act 2007. The current tests are described in the Interim Report (with commendable understatement) as “somewhat complex”, hence the recommendation that the Government consider ways to simplify the determination of the PIE tax rates. The complexity of the rules for determining the correct PIE tax rate to apply to an individual investor is such that investors in multi-rate PIEs frequently choose incorrect rates. This leads to similarly unfortunate outcomes - applying incorrectly low rates exposes investors to: • the compliance burden of having to file an income tax return when they would not otherwise need to; and • potential interest and penalties on tax shortfall payments; and the choice of incorrectly high rates cannot later be remedied by way of tax refunds. 8 Simplifying those rules would be a highly desirable exercise in furthering the core tax principles of fairness and coherence. It would also be even more important to the extent that concessionary PIE tax rates were available to lower earners saving through retirement schemes (who would consequentially have more to lose by choosing the wrong rates). We recommend that careful consideration be given to (in particular): • possible automation options, drawing on information that Inland Revenue already has available to it; and • a simpler ‘look-back’ test based on what is on record (at Inland Revenue perhaps) with respect to the most recent tax year for which the required income information is available. In an ideal world, a KiwiSaver scheme provider for example would send Inland Revenue a scheme participant’s Tax File Number (possibly at various points – when joining, when making a withdrawal and as at each 31 March) and Inland Revenue would, using the taxable and PIE income information they have, reply by advising his or her current PIE tax rate. A further issue with PIE tax rate determinations is the “prescribed investor rate” terminology itself. Providers report a concerning incidence of lower-earning subscribers appearing to choose the 28% rate inappropriately because they misapprehend that the term ‘prescribed investor rate’ denotes investment earning potential or another favourable metric, despite denoting an investment income tax rate. We recommend that ‘prescribed investor rate’ be replaced with a much clearer term such as “PIE tax rate” or “investment income tax rate” (or even just “prescribed tax rate”- the key is referencing tax) so as to convey the correct concepts and reduce the incidence of errors. We know that words have power in this context - such a change would be consistent with another pending KiwiSaver initiative whereby, effective 1 April 2019, a contributions holiday will be legislatively renamed a “savings suspension”. Pension schemes and annuities No exploration of how to make the tax treatment of retirement savings fairer would be complete without acknowledging (and optimally addressing) the inflexibly high tax impost placed on defined benefit workplace savings schemes, where there is no facility to apply anything other than the top 33% ESCT rate and (at best) the 28% widely held superannuation fund investment income tax rate even where most or indeed all members may have already retired and begun receiving a pension. 9 The taxation of lifetime annuities in New Zealand is similarly inflexible, contributing to their lack of popularity and consequent unavailability – the investment income relating to the funds underpinning any such annuity would be taxed at 28% and then the annuity itself may be subject to tax on distribution in some cases. Follow-up discussion We would be pleased to meet with members of the Tax Working Group to discuss any aspect of our feedback or any matters of detail. We would also be very happy to receive a phone call or email if any of the points raised in our response are in any way unclear or require any follow-up.

This is a reply submission of the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union to the Tax Working Group to the Tax Working Group’s Future of Tax: Interim Report (the “Report”) and is made further to our earlier submission of April 30 2018 available at www.taxpayers.org.nz/twg\_sub 2. The focus of this submission is on areas where the Working Group has not made a final recommendation. Nevertheless, it addresses the Group’s recommendations as to the purported complexity of inflation-indexing tax thresholds as we believe the Group has erred in its reasoning to rule out the measure. Request to meet for oral submissions 3. We understand members of the Working Group have met with a range of submitters, and in particular corporate taxpayers. Given the volume of submissions made in support of our April submission (we understand this to be more than 1,000 people) we ask to be afforded equal opportunity to meet with members of the Group.

We submit that the Working Group should recommend that the Government implement inflation indexation of tax thresholds. Failing to adjust these thresholds for inflation causes an effect called ‘fiscal drag’ where income earners’ tax burdens increase every year as they are pushed into higher tax brackets. 5. While the Working Group argues that “\[the\] impact of inflation on income tax is best dealt with through periodic reviews of the thresholds” personal income tax thresholds have not been adjusted since the 2010 Budget. 6. In our 2017 report, Five Options for Tax Relief, 1 we showed that the average income earner is worse off by nearly $500 per year since 2010 just as a result of failing to adjust the tax thresholds for inflation. 7. Through a combination of inflation and real wage growth, the average earner will be in the top tax bracket by 2022. 8. Fiscal drag is regressive. As middle and low income earners have their nominal incomes increase through inflation, they are pushed into higher brackets. However, those already earning above the top threshold cannot be pushed into any higher bracket. The tax system effectively 'flattens', with those on lower and middle incomes pushed into higher marginal tax brackets through time. 9. Indexing income tax thresholds to inflation would ensure households do not have their tax obligations increase year-on-year purely because of inflation. That would ensure that unless the Government chose to pass legislation to increase taxes, the average rate of income tax to households would be consistent over time. 10. While the Report argues that “\[annual\] changes to rates and thresholds impose compliance costs on individuals and businesses”, Canada’s system of inflation indexation is popular. Despite an effort by the Mulroney Government in the 1980s to eliminate inflation indexation in response to fiscal pressures, indexation was returned in 2000 after a sustained campaign by the left-leaning Caledon Institute, and still exists today 2 . 11. Given most businesses now use digitised payroll systems for PAYE calculations, the administrative and compliance costs of an annual change to thresholds is minimal. 12. Failing to adjust tax thresholds for inflation is equivalent to increasing the tax burden automatically every year, but without select committee hearings, coalition negotiations, public submissions, or any form of national dialogue about the merits or demerits of higher tax rates. 13. In that sense, a failure to index tax thresholds for inflation is not just an economic problem, but also represents a failure of public accountability and transparency. 14. In the Working Group’s Terms of Reference, the Government outlines its objectives for the tax system. This includes an expectation that the Working Group reports whether there are “changes which would 1 Appended to our earlier submission. 2 Lanigan (2015) Fighting for taxpayers; battles fought & battles ahead.

Allowing the tax burden to increase annually without accountability or debate is a failure of integrity for the tax system. 15. We submit that if Parliament would like to increase personal income taxes, it should pass a law to do so, rather than avoid a public discussion by building hidden tax increases into the system that are not subject to the usual legislative scrutiny. 16. The Working Group argues that the Maori Authority tax rate of 17.5 percent is a useful simplification given the tax status of most Maori Authority members. However, inflation will slowly pull Maori Authority members into higher tax brackets. Inflation-indexing our tax brackets can help to maintain the legitimacy of the Maori Authority rules. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 5 Section two: Capital income taxation Summary of proposed changes 18. The Tax Working Group has proposed two possible systems for changing the treatment of capital income for tax purposes. 19. The first system (“extending the net”) proposes that all realised capital gains be treated as income for tax purposes. 20. This is a change from the current model which treats some realised capital gains as income for tax purposes (in cases where realising a capital gain was the intent of purchasing an asset, or where the bright line test applies). 21. The second system is a tax on equity (or “wealth tax”) where a deemed percentage rate of return is applied to the value of an asset, which is then taxed at the individual’s marginal tax rate. Revenue neutrality 22. On 20 September 2018, Minister of Finance Grant Roberston wrote to Working Group Chair Sir Michael Cullen instructing the group to provide “measures that could result in a revenue-neutral package” in its final report. 3 23. The Working Group should not only provide information related to revenue-neutral packages but should recommend a revenue neutral package, regardless of the costs and benefits of changing any individual tax. 24. Increases to any income tax rate or the rate of GST have been ruled out of scope 4 . The bulk of any increase in revenue is therefore likely to be derived from capital income taxation changes, which is equivalent to a ceteris paribus increase in capital income taxation. 25. A ceteris paribus increase in capital income taxation would be undesirable. New Zealand already collects a disproportionate share of revenue from capital taxation in the form of company taxation, which is the highest in the OECD as a share of GDP 5 (Chart 1). 3 Letter available at https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-09/TWG%20letter%20final.pdf 4 Tax Working Group Terms of Reference are available at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/terms-reference- tax-working-group 5 OECD (2016) https://data.oecd.org/tax/tax-on-corporate-profits.htm Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 6 26. High capital taxation (in the form of high company taxation) may be contributing to New Zealand’s low rates of capital investment (compared to Australia in Chart 2) 6 , thin capital markets (compared to Australia and the OECD average in Chart 3) 7 , and poor productivity performance (Chart 4 illustrated a substantial decline in the three-year moving average of labour productivity growth over the last thirty years) 8 . 6 IMF World Economic Outlook Investment Data https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2018/01/weodata/index.aspx 7 World Bank Data https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/CM.MKT.LCAP.GD.ZS?view=chart 8 Available at https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/productivity-statistics-19782017 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5 SVNTUR LVA EST POL DEU FRA ITA HUN FIN USA ESP AUT SWE ISL IRL DNK GBR CHE PRT ISR CAN NLD NOR BEL KOR MEX CZE SVK JPN CHLLUX NZL % of GDP 1.

Capital investment is crucial to improving productivity, which in turn increases incomes. 28. To limit any increase in the burden of capital income tax on future incomes, we submit that the Working Group should ensure that its recommendation to the Government is revenue neutral, preferably by reducing taxes on savings, other forms of capital income taxation (like the headline company tax rate) personal income taxation, or by implementing full capital-expensing. 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 19851989199319972001200520092013 % of GDP 3.

The Working Group should acknowledge that capital gains taxes are a form of double-taxation. 30. Any capital – whether it comes from household savings or reinvested profits – has already been taxed when it was earned. Capital investment is paid for from after-tax income. 31. A capital gains tax then taxes this sum of money again as it appreciates in value through investment. A significant portion of this tax may not even represent any real increase in the value of the asset as the Working Group has chosen to not exclude inflation in its capital taxation proposals. “Extending the net” 32. The implied rate of the proposed capital gains tax (extending the definition of taxable income to include realised capital gains) is much higher than any previous proposal. 33. Realised gains will be taxed at the individual’s marginal tax rate, which for most New Zealanders with assets additional to their family home will be 33 percent. The capital gains tax rate that Labour campaigned on at the 2011 9 and 2014 10 elections was 15 percent. 34. The capital gains tax as proposed would significantly expand the definition of taxable income to include realised capital gains from a range of investments currently excluded from the bright-line rule, including shares, commercial property, private equity, and residential property held for longer than five years. 35. Residential property investment (other than the primary residence) is currently subject to a tax disadvantage (due to the bright-line test), compared to the aforementioned categories of investment. 36. The effect of extending the net of capital income taxation will be to eliminate that tax disadvantage. This will give residential property speculation its previously equal tax treatment compared to share investment and commercial property investment. 37. Investment in the primary residence (adding an extra level, renovating the kitchen and/or bathrooms, adding a double garage) will now enjoy an even greater tax advantage, as the only form of investment not subject to a capital gains tax. 38. The net effect will be that residential property investment receives a comparative improvement in its tax treatment, while commercial investment suffers. 39. This could lead to a ‘mansion effect’ where residential properties become larger and more opulent as a form of storing tax-free wealth, which given the Working Group’s mandate to consider housing affordability, could be viewed as undesirable. 9 https://www.interest.co.nz/property/54374/labour-run-capital-gains-tax-39-top-income-tax-rate-gst-fresh-fruit-and- vegetables 10 https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/253774/q-and-a-capital-gains-tax-explained Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 9 40. Artificially increasing the size and quality of housing will be accompanied by higher prices, making it more difficult for first-home buyers to enter the market, while also increasing the share of the economy’s capital stock which is tied up in owner-occupied housing. 41. Coleman has commented on this effect extensively 11 , as the Working Group will be aware. 42. On net, reduced share investment and commercial property investment should be expected. 43. Capital gains taxes reduce productive capital investment in two other key ways, that were discussed at length in our initial submission (refer to paragraphs 115 to 137). In summary: (a) ‘lock-in’ effects make portfolio re-allocation more expensive by imposing transaction costs on the sale of previously successful shareholdings; and (b) there are a range of companies that are capital-hungry in their early stages and are not expected to pay dividends for a long time (start-ups and tech companies, for example), but attract investors on the basis of prospective capital gains. Reducing the prospective returns from high-risk, innovation-heavy companies could be undesirable for future economic growth. Risk-free return method 44. The proposed risk-free return method (‘RFRM’) functions as a tax on an individual’s wealth (less any wealth held in their primary residence). 45. The exact nature of the RFRM has not been determined: obtaining verifiable, accurate prices for off- market assets could be extremely difficult and costly for the Government, particularly during recessions or periods of strong asset price growth. In light of those costs, the Government may choose to only re- value off-market assets rarely, but this could cause taxpayers to pay artificially low or high amounts of tax. 46. An RFRM is theoretically desirable because it does not punish risk-taking and has none of the associated lock-in effects that come with capital gains taxes. In fact, some taxpayers may receive an effective tax cut as a result of the policy; for example, a taxpayer currently earning a taxable return greater than the risk-free rate, will receive a tax cut under the policy, such as a shareholder receiving a dividend yield of 4 percent on stocks owned will pay less tax under the RFRM system than currently. 47. However, a shareholder that receives a taxable return less than risk-free rate, will face a tax increase. This will apply most significantly to families with holiday homes or shareholders of companies that do not regularly pay dividends, and instead return value to shareholders through retained earnings and growth. 48. We submit that the administration costs associated with an RFRM capital income tax are too high to justify implementing the policy. 11 Coleman (2017) Housing, the ‘Great Income Tax ‘Experiment’, and the intergenerational consequences of the lease https://www.otago.ac.nz/economics/otago642975.pdf Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 10 Full capital-expensing 49. If the Working Group chooses to intensify capital income taxation, it needs to take steps to reform other areas of the tax code in order to encourage capital investment. 50. In our earlier submission, we submitted that the Working Group should recommend a full capital- expensing regime in order to encourage firms to bring forward and intensify their expansion and investment plans (refer to paragraphs 69 to 75). 51. Full capital expensing was one of the major components of the recent United States tax reform legislation where many businesses can now fully expense some purchases of equipment and capital investment in the year of purchase. 52. The literature indicates that full expensing of capital investment encourages businesses to bring forward planned investment as a result of receiving a tax advantage with substantial evidence indicating that full expensing of capital spending encourages businesses to bring forward investment. (a) Ohrn 12 finds that adoption of 100 percent bonus depreciation increased investment activity by 17.5 percent, and over a five-year period, increased employment by 7.7 percent. “These results suggest that accelerated depreciation policies had and will continue to have substantial impacts on the U.S. manufacturing sector.” (b) Maffini 13 et al. find that firms eligible for first-year depreciation allowances have an 11 percent increased rate of investment. 12 Ohrn (2017) The Effect of Tax Incentives on U.S. Manufacturing: Evidence from State Accelerated Depreciation Policies 13 Maffini et al.

While savers should receive tax relief, we submit that the Working Group should broaden the scope of tax relief in its final report. The recommendations made by the working group may not have the effects that members might have envisaged. 54. The current recommendation are too narrow to induce material increases to net national savings. Approximately half of all earners have an annual income that exceeds $48,000. As of the end of June 2017, 55 percent of income earners had an annual income above $46,000 14 . 55. The Taxpayers’ Union agrees with the Working Group’s analysis on the benefits of a higher rate of net national savings. To achieve a higher rate of net national savings, the Working Group should recommend comprehensive reform that encourages higher rates of savings for all earners, rather than fewer than one in two. The Working Group’s recommendations 56. The Working Group has recommended: (a) a removal of ESCT on the employer’s matching contribution of three percent of salary for individuals earning up to $48,000 per year; (b) a reduction of the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds by five percentage points each; and (c) that the Government consider ways to simplify PIE rates. 57. The Working Group acknowledges the benefits of higher savings rates in the Report, but offers poor advice in paragraphs 44 through 46 of the Report. (a) The Group claims to have “calibrated its recommendations to ensure that any changes are in areas more likely to have a net positive impact on national savings”, but also acknowledges that “low- and middle- income earners face income constraints in their ability to take advantage of tax concessions for saving.” (b) If low- and middle- income earners face income constraints, the rational behaviour from these groups in the presence of favourable tax treatment for retirement savings could be to: (i) reduce their rate of savings such that their future total retirement savings is equivalent to their future total prior to the introduction of favourable tax treatment, which allows for additional consumption prior to retirement; or (ii) to maintain existing savings rates and take advantage of the additional future total retirement savings, while maintaining their rate of consumption under the old regime. 58. For example, suppose an individual begins working at age 25 and earns $47,999 per year, until they retire at age 65 (i.e. for 40 years) and suppose they currently contribute four percent of their gross income towards their KiwiSaver, their employer contributes three percent and they earn a 6.5 percent 14 Stats NZ Household Economic Survey Year ended June 2017 available at http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse\_for\_stats/people\_and\_communities/Households/HouseholdEconomicSurvey\_HOTPY eJun17.aspx Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 12 average annual return 15 , which is taxed at their PIR rate of 17.5 percent. The employer contribution is also subject to ESCT and is taxed at 17.5 percent. They also receive the annual tax credit of $521.43. (a) After forty years of savings, this individual will have accumulated $535,815 in retirement savings. (b) In a world where the rules change as recommended by the Working Group (eliminating the ESCT for people earning less than $48,000, and reducing the lower PIR by five percentage points each), this individual instead accumulates savings equal to $617,920 (c) However, the individual could also choose to reduce their contribution rate from four percent to three percent, with the effect of reducing their retirement savings to $540,680 – still higher than their total future retirement savings under the old rules, but with a lower savings rate. (d) It would not be surprising if a low income individual chose to keep an additional $479.99 per year in income if they could maintain their future level of retirement savings. An additional nearly $500 per year in income-in-the-hand could make a significant difference at Christmas, or to have available to spend on car repairs, or emergency medical costs, like a child’s urgent doctor visit. (e) Those are not bad outcomes, but they also do not meet the goals espoused by the Working Group. 59. We submit that the Working Group needs to consider more carefully whether changing the tax treatment of KiwiSaver accounts for low and middle households would achieve the higher savings rates they argue it would. 60. If, as the Working Group argues, the goal of retirement savings taxation policy is to encourage higher pools of retirement savings among low income earners and to lift the net national savings rate, this policy does not necessarily achieve either. 61. There is some evidence in the literature for these effects. (a) Corneo et al. (2011) find substantial evidence that savings subsidies in the form of “special allowances and tax exemptions” known as the ‘Riester scheme’ had almost no impact on savings rates in Germany. The authors note: (i) “Even though we apply a wide range of methods and specifications, we come to the unambiguous conclusion that in Germany household saving hardly responded to the introduction of that saving incentive program. Participation in the Riester scheme seems to largely substitute for other forms of saving.” (b) Coleman (2014) 16 argues more generally that Kiwisaver has not been effective in lifting retirement savings levels. This result is robust to age, gender, income, education, wealth, partner-status, and home ownership status. 62. More generally, if low savings rates (and small pools of savings) are linked to income levels, the tax system should be designed to encourage income growth, rather than making potentially ineffective transfer payments to low-income households in order to induce saving. 15 Compounded monthly. 16 Coleman (2014) KiwiSaver and the Accumulation of Net Wealth, New Zealand Treasury Working Paper 14/22 Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 13 63. In paragraph 52 of the Report, the Working Group expresses concern that significantly changing the tax and transfer treatment of KiwiSaver could simply encourage high-earners to transfer savings held in other schemes and accounts into KiwiSaver in order to reduce tax liabilities on their retirement savings. Our recommendation 64. We submit that the Working Group should recommend that the Government exempt the inflation component of interest income from income tax. 65. While the Working Group has largely argued that the low rate of inflation has only a small distortionary impact on tax effects, even when inflation is low it can have a significant distortionary effect on effective tax rates applied to interest income. 66. Real interest rates have trended downwards over the last 20 to 25 years (Chart 5), while inflation has (but for the last five years) stayed mostly between 1 and 4 percent (Chart 6). -2.00 0.00 2.00 4.00 6.00 8.00 10.00 Mar 1988Mar 1992Mar 1996Mar 2000Mar 2004Mar 2008Mar 2012Mar 2016 6 - Month TermDeposit Rate less CPI 5. Real Interest Rates (Source: RBNZ) Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 14 67. If real interest rates continue to stay low, even low levels of inflation will make up a significant share of nominal interest income on savings, so taxing the inflation component of interest income will still be significantly distortionary. 68. For example, while the real interest rate on a six-month term deposit before tax is 1.35 percent in the September 2018 quarter 17 , when you apply the statutory rate of 33 percent the after tax real interest rate is 0.3 percent: equivalent to a 77.8 percent marginal tax rate on interest income. 69. This functions as a punitive tax specifically for individuals who choose to put their savings in low-risk, low-return investments where inflation comprises a greater share of their nominal return, which is unfair: the tax system should be neutral with regards to the risk appetite of the investor. 70. Removing the inflation component from savings would ensure that savers only ever pay the statutory rate of tax on their real interest income. 71. Inflation-proofing the tax status of interest income would need to be matched by changing how borrowers can deduct interest payments from their taxable income. The obvious solution would be to only allow borrowers to deduct the real interest payment from their taxable income. 72. We submit that the Working Group should recommend that the Government remove income tax on the inflation component of interest income. 17 Data obtained from https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics -2.0 0.0 2.0 4.0 6.0 8.0 10.0 Mar 1988Mar 1992Mar 1996Mar 2000Mar 2004Mar 2008Mar 2012Mar 2016 6.

The Working Group is interested in using the tax system to achieve environmental goals. Specifically, increasing the waste disposal levy and ‘strengthening’ the emissions trading scheme is suggested. 74. We submit that the Working Group should not recommend an increase in the waste disposal levy and should recommend that policy makers develop an objective framework for assessing the trade-offs between economic growth and global emissions inherent to climate policy before strengthening existing regimes. Waste disposal levy 75. The Taxpayers’ Union is opposed to an increase in the waste disposal levy. Putting to one side the very poor quality of grant decision making relating to the Waste Minimisation Fund, evidence used to justify an increase in the waste levy is not sufficient. 76. The Eunomia report 18 which the Working Group references (and mentions that it has not assessed) should not be used to justify an increase in the waste disposal levy. The authors fail to take into account any opportunity costs associated with imposing a higher waste levy on households and then argue that the waste disposal levy creates employment by encouraging growth in the recycling industry. 77. This is equivalent to arguing that a carbon tax will create jobs in the economy by encouraging growth in low-carbon industries, without taking into account the effect of the tax on household budgets and other industries. 78. There might still be a possible justification for an increase in the waste disposal levy, but this will require an honest appraisal of the economic effects, rather than ignoring the costs to households. 79. In paragraph 81, the Working Group argues that even if the waste levy internalises any externalities that come from waste disposal, “higher rates might also be needed to achieve behaviour change.” This is a poor argument. The reason for suboptimal market behaviour is the presence of an externality, but if this is corrected for, there no longer exists a problem that needs to be solved. The purpose of tax is to solve for specific market failures, not to discourage certain market outcomes people subjectively dislike. 80. We submit that the Working Group should remove the hypothecated status of the waste disposal levy. Hypothecating revenue from the waste disposal levy for the waste minimisation fund (‘WMF’) means projects funded under the WMF do not have to meet as high a standard as projects funded through general taxation. Strengthening the emissions trading scheme 81. Climate policy requires a trade-off between economic growth and reductions in emissions, with the aim of reducing global emissions in order to prevent rapid climate change. 18 Eunomia (2017) The New Zealand Waste Disposal Levy Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 16 82. When determining climate policy, policy makers need to be tightly focussed on this trade off. NZIER’s cost estimate of adopting a net-zero policy for emissions ranges between 10 and 22 percent of GDP in 2050 19 . 83. NZIER notes in its report: “Our modelling suggests the households that are in the lowest 20 per cent bracket for income may be more than twice as affected, on a relative basis, than those households with an average income.” 84. Given the potentially devastating economic consequences to the most vulnerable New Zealanders of adopting stronger climate policy, any change in policy needs to be able to demonstrate genuine and significant reductions in global emissions. 85. This analysis needs to include estimates of ‘emissions leakage’ 20 in response to domestic policy changes in order to ensure that New Zealanders are not suffering from lower incomes and higher prices in exchange for only negligible improvements in climate outcomes. 86. We submit that policy makers should develop an objective framework to assess climate policies against, which includes the size of any costs to New Zealanders by failing to take a strong stance on climate change. New Zealand only contributes 0.17 percent of total global emissions so domestic action will probably be of no consequence for global outcomes. 19 NZIER (2018) Economic impact analysis of 2050 emissions targets https://nzier.org.nz/publication/key-results-from- economic-modelling-of-2050-emissions-targets 20 Emissions leakage refers to the phenomenon where, in response to additional taxes and production levies, industry relocates to jurisdictions with weaker climate policy regimes. This effect can significantly weaken any reduction in global emissions which waters down any effect of domestic policy on climate outcomes. Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 17 Section five: Behavioural taxes 87. As argued in our initial submission, the Working Group is correct to recommend no more increases in tobacco excise. Large hikes in tobacco excise have failed to achieve large reductions in smoking prevalence and have been accompanied by significant social and financial harm to vulnerable communities. 88. We have commented more extensively on this topic in our recent report – Up in Smoke: the social cost of tobacco excise – launched on 1 January 2018 to coincide with the annual increase in tobacco excise. 21 89. While the Working Group is correct to point out that the current alcohol excise regime is a mess, simplification should be treated as an opportunity to increase excise levels across the board. 90. The Working Group should not recommend a sugar tax. Sugar taxes are regressive and their behavioural effects have often been over-stated in the literature, compared to results in real world markets where they have been tried. Tobacco excise 91. The Working Group is correct to be concerned about increases in tobacco excise. Large increases to tobacco excise have been accompanied by increases in crime and financial damage to the budgets of low-income families. Tobacco excise increases are also becoming less effective in encouraging people to quit smoking. 92. The Working Group is also correct to note that the Government should look at other measures to help people quit smoking. 93. Consistent with the Government’s intent to adopt risk-proportionate regulation for all tobacco products, including smokeless tobacco and vaping products 22 , we submit that the Working Group should recommend that the Government adopt a consistent risk-proportionate approach to tobacco excise, where low risk non-combustible tobacco products receive a lower rate of tax than cigarettes. 94. In response to the global drive to reduce smoking rates, there has been significant innovation to develop alternative products that deliver nicotine to users without combustion, where most if not all of the harm of smoking could be avoided. 23 95. Vaping products, for example, have been shown by Public Health England to cause 95 percent less harm than smoked tobacco 24 , with 0.5 percent of the cancer risk associated with cigarettes. Similarly, heated tobacco or ‘heat-not-burn’ products have been estimated to be around 90 percent less harmful than cigarettes 25 and contributed to significant declines in smoking rates on other jurisdictions. Snus (which is a form of packaged salted tobacco stored under the lip to release nicotine) has been shown to be 21 Up in Smoke is available online at https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/up\_in\_smoke 22 Refer to Ministry of Health, Vaping and smokeless tobacco (updated 12 September 2018), https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/preventative-health-wellness/tobacco-control/vaping-smokeless-including-heated- tobacco 23 UK Royal College of Physicians, Nicotine without smoke, 1 April 2016, https://www.rcplondon.ac.uk/file/3563/download?token=Mu0K\_ZR0 24 https://www.gov.uk/government/news/e-cigarettes-around-95-less-harmful-than-tobacco-estimates-landmark-review 25 UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, E-Cigarettes, Seventh Report of Session 2017–19 \[para 90\] https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmsctech/505/505.pdf Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 18 effective in reducing smoking rates among men in Sweden 26 . Evidence indicates snus has reduced health risks compared to tobacco. 96. The purpose of excise is to improve health outcomes by reducing smoking rates. The Government should improve health outcomes by changing the tax treatment of reduced harm products. 97. Lower rates of excise on low risk products will encourage smokers to transfer to less harmful nicotine delivery systems, encourage producers to innovate less harmful alternatives to cigarettes, reduce smoking rates and support public health objectives. 98. In summary, we support a modernised tobacco excise tax regime — based on the principle that excise tax is set at rates commiserate to the relative harm of the various alternate nicotine delivery technologies — to incentivise Kiwi smokers to shift to less harmful products as it is both fair and the most effective way for New Zealand to achieve its Smoke Free 2025 objective. Alcohol excise 99. The current alcohol excise regime is a mess. Excise regimes should be linked to the harm of the product, which for alcohol, is the quantity of alcohol in beverage. Applying different rates of excise for both the percentage alcohol and type of the beverage unfairly favours some products over others. 26 Foulds et al (2003) Effect of smokeless tobacco (snus) on smoking and public health in Sweden Lower taxes, Less Waste, More Transparency www.taxpayers.org.nz Level 4, 117 Lambton Quay, PO Box 10518, Wellington 6143 19 100. Wine, for example, faces a lower effective rate of excise than beer when the percentage alcohol of the wine exceeds 10 percent and the percentage alcohol of the beer is less than 14 percent. 101. Given that the vast majority of wine is stronger than 10 percent alcohol, and the vast majority of beer is weaker than 14 percent alcohol, this gives wine producers an unfair tax advantage. 102. Perhaps perversely, this tax advantage grows as wine gets close to, but does not exceed, 14 percent alcohol. 103. The Working Group should recommend a unified excise regime that applies to beer, wine, and spirits identically. 104. However this should not be treated as an opportunity to simply increase alcohol excise across the board. 105. The well-publicised 27 BERL paper which attempted to estimate the social cost of tobacco has been regularly criticised 2829 for over-estimating the costs of drinking. 106. While the Working Group suggests alcohol excise could be regressive (high-income households spend more on alcohol than low-income households) this misses that because alcohol excise is volumetric, excise makes up a greater share of low-price alcohol, and therefore a greater share of a low-income household’s budget. Sugar taxation 107. The Working Group correctly highlights that a major risk with sugar taxes is the propensity for consumers to switch to cheaper or untaxed products. 108. The literature often fails to account for intra-product-category quality substitution 3031 (consumers shifting to lower quality equivalents in the presence of a tax) which leads to substantially over-estimated price elasticities (and health benefits). 109. Wang (2016) 32 also shows that the presence of storability can lead to an over-estimation of price elasticities for sugar taxes. 110. An across the board sugar tax (as opposed to just a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages) will suffer from exactly the same concerns, even if there might be a reduced rate of inter-product group substitution. 111. Failure to achieve improved health benefits is likely to be accompanied by regressive financial effects on low-income families. 33 27 https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/106343048/alcohol-harm-more-than-triple-the-cost-of-all-treaty-claims-so- far--economist 28 https://nzinitiative.org.nz/reports-and-media/opinion/the-alcohol-cost-zombie-has-returned/ 29 https://lancewiggs.com/2009/07/03/fix-the-berl-report-on-alcohol-and-drugs/ 30 Gibson and Romeo (2017) Fiscal Food Policies are Likely Misinformed by Biased Price Elasticities from Household Surveys: Evidence from Melanesia 31 Gibson and Kim (2017) The Price Elasticity of Quantity, and of Quality, for Tobacco Products 32 Wang et al.

To engage further, please contact Colin McKinnon, Executive Director on or email \[1\] \[1\] Page | 3 INTRODUCTION The New Zealand Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (“NZVCA”) welcomes the Working Group’s review of the NZ tax system and acknowledges the release on 20 September 2018 of the interim report on the Future of Tax. Following the recommendation by the Tax Working Group (“TWG”) in the interim report to extend the taxation of capital income, the NZVCA wishes to reiterate submissions originally made to the TWG in relation to developing a system which is internationally competitive. However, it is first useful to provide the context and principle behind which this submission is made. At its simplest level, the NZVCA is here to support: the availability of capital, both monetary and human, to New Zealand’s growing businesses, to encourage confidence and increase investment. KEY SUBMISSION The NZVCA makes the following submission: Recommendation: If New Zealand is to adopt a tax on capital income it must be competitive internationally The NZVCA believes that one of the key considerations when reviewing our tax system is to ensure that our tax system is competitive internationally. NZ struggles to attract capital investment particularly in the venture capital area and while venture capital investment in NZ has been growing it is still below the OECD median. For NZ ensuring that our tax system is competitive with Australia in particular is important given how easy it is to transfer capital from NZ to Australia. We consider any system which taxes capital income should be designed with international capital gains tax (“CGT”) systems in mind to ensure NZ is competitive, particularly with Australia where a number of specific investment regimes and vehicles encourage investment. Minimising the impact of any leakage of available cash to the already constrained growth capital environment through the taxing of capital income should be paramount to any policy. We note the recommendation of the TWG to tax income from realisation of any of the following assets: • interests in land (other than the family home). This includes all other residential property, commercial, agricultural, industrial and leasehold interests not currently taxed; • intangible property, including goodwill; • all other assets held by a business or for income producing purposes that are not already taxed on sale (such as plant and equipment); • shares in companies and other equity interests. Page | 4 Looking internationally we believe one of the key features that a competitive tax on capital income should have is roll-over relief. Most CGT systems around the world have some form of roll-over relief. A study by EY has confirmed that of 16 major countries with a capital gains tax regime, all have a form of relief. The effect of a roll- over relief is essentially to defer or disregard the arising capital gain where the capital is used to purchase a replacement asset (which would ultimately still be subject to a capital gains tax). This means that the capital gain is not taxed until the point the gain is actually realised by the asset holder. These provisions encourage capital to be reinvested into business instead of paid out to shareholders which is beneficial to growth and business development. In Australia the roll-over provisions also provide relief in scenarios where a capital asset is legally transferred but no real change in economic ownership occurs – for example where assets owned by an individual are transferred to their wholly owned company or where shares are swapped as part of a business restructure but the shareholders underlying interest remains the same. These types of provisions are extremely important as they allow flexibility for business restructures as businesses grow and develop.

NEW ZEALAND’S TAXATION IN AN EVOLVING BUSINESS WORLD A submission to Michael Cullen, KNZM, Chair, Tax Working Group From Louise Aitken, Chief Executive of the Ākina Foundation 1 November 2018 Introduction The Ākina Foundation is the principal intermediary supporting social enterprise in New Zealand. Social enterprise is a way of operating a business which prioritises both social and/or environmental outcomes and profit, with the goal being that impact driven by a sustainable business model enables that impact to be delivered more sustainably and at the desired scale. In recognition of the potential social enterprise has for New Zealand, the Government has recently partnered with Ākina to deliver the Social Enterprise Sector Development Programme: a programme specifically aiming to enable a flourishing social enterprise sector in New Zealand. The Government’s commitment to this Programme is a strong signal to the growing potential, in both size and impact, that this sector has. As part of this Programme, Ākina is exploring barriers that exist within current legal structures in New Zealand for enterprises that are working towards creating social or environmental impact. The Department of Internal Affairs, Charities Services, Inland Revenue Department and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment are all involved in this work, and it is being progressed in communication with the Charities Act review. While our exploration of legal structures is outside of the scope of this Tax Working Group (the Group), there is a relationship between legal structures and taxation for social enterprises, so we highlight this work for context. We are pleased to have the opportunity to participate in a discussion around the tax system in New Zealand, and thank the Group for the opportunity. We are also pleased to see the holistic approach the Group has taken, acknowledging the numerous purposes of tax within society, and the fundamental role it has in underpinning and influencing many aspects of New Zealand’s wellbeing. Reflections on the Group’s Interim Report We largely agree with the Group’s comments around both the ‘Taxation of business’ and ‘Charities’. This submission highlights a few areas and opportunities for further conversation: conversations which may lead to our tax system even better enabling the wellbeing of New Zealanders. Social enterprise is a way of doing business that can, and is, having significant positive impact on New Zealand. Social enterprises achieve positive environmental and ecological outcomes, they support employment outcomes, contribute to housing affordability and help to reduce the inequality which permeates so much of the Interim Report. Whilst the primary sections of the Group’s Interim Report that relate to social enterprise are the business and charity sections, it is important to keep in mind the overarching value social enterprises deliver. Which leads to the question: how can New Zealand’s tax system best enable social enterprise? Impact focus At the heart of social enterprise is impact. A heart that is also shared by charitable structures in New Zealand. We support the tax exemptions which charities receive in New Zealand, which is granted to charities because of the societal impact they intend to have. Organisations operating as a social enterprises also intend to deliver societal impact. An important distinction between charities and social enterprises is that social enterprises are able to distribute profits to shareholders and charities are not. Currently, that ability to distribute profits is the key reason social enterprises are excluded from receiving tax benefits. Keeping profits in an organisation is an indicator only, it is not proof that the organisation is achieving positive outcomes. It demonstrates that the organisation is using all of its money pursuing its charitable purpose, not that it is in fact effective in achieving that purpose. We believe the impact generated by organisations should be considered more effectively in New Zealand, and a conversation had around how to incentivise that work, and the effects any impact generation should have on the taxation benefits an organisation can receive. ‘The tax system underpins the living standards of New Zealanders’, so it must use effective measures to assess what influence organisations are having on New Zealanders, and therefore what it should be incentivising. We submit that a more relevant factor to consider when determining an entity’s entitlement to tax benefits, is evidence of their achievement of social or environmental outcomes or at least that they are on track to achieving those outcomes, as the Living Standards Framework is exploring. We acknowledge the challenges associated with requiring evidence of achievement of social or environmental outcomes, but consider it is a standard worth aspiring to. We are pleased to see Charities Services recently implementing performance reporting on Charities alongside financial reporting, while noting the capability development which needs to happen within organisations to be able to effectively deliver these reports. We encourage the Group to consider how these performance reports could be used as a basis for assessing suitability for a tax exemption, rather than the blunt instrument of not-for-profit versus for-profit. As the number and impact of social enterprises grows, we encourage the Group to consider how organisations other than ‘not-for-profits’ can have their impact similarly valued, and tax incentives applied accordingly to reflect the societal benefits they are providing New Zealand. Impact investment tax relief Beyond the above comments, we do not think that the taxation of organisations operating as a social enterprise needs to be substantively different to profit oriented business in New Zealand. This is not to say social enterprise shouldn’t be incentivised however. It is a transformative way of doing business, and is improving our world, and so we implore the Group to consider appropriate ways taxation can be used to encourage this form of business. One method we have identified is to incentivise investment into these organisations - i.e. an impact investment - which, by its nature, intends to increase an organisation’s scale and impact. The United Kingdom has the ‘Social Investment Tax Relief’ (SITR) scheme which provides a strong example for how this may be achieved. Individuals making an eligible investment can deduct 30% of the cost of their investment from their income tax liability, with eligible investments being legal entities with a defined and regulated social purpose. Ākina would be happy to provide more specific information on this scheme to the Group, We encourage the Group to consider how a New Zealand equivalent of the SITR could be implemented (we note that a new legal structure would be the logical eligible entity for such a scheme however this discussion is ongoing and any impact investment tax relief scheme should be considered within existing entities). Early stage incentives Like any organisation, social enterprises also particularly struggle at the early stage of their life cycle. Accordingly, any incentives that can be offered during this stage are often catalytic to the future of the organisation. We note the Government’s commitment to raising New Zealand’s research and development (R&D) expenditure to 2% of GDP over the next 10 years. The R&D Tax Incentive is a strong existing incentive for unlocking innovation within early stage organisations. We also note that Callaghan Innovation recently moved to include social innovation within their innovation mandate. Accordingly, we recommend that the current R&D review process considers how the definition of R&D can be altered to more intentionally encompass and enable social and environmental innovation alongside its existing technology focus. Not only would doing so assist the Government in reaching their 2% target, it would also unlock more innovation specifically focused on societal impact, and the consequential impact and economic outcomes from this for New Zealand. Recommendations In summary, while our tax system already provides a strong foundation for New Zealand, we believe it can be strengthened to better enable organisations who are delivering social and/or environmental impact. We encourage the Group to consider how this can be achieved, and in particular recommend exploring: 1. How the tax system can more effectively incentivise social and environmental impact by focusing on social and environmental outcomes rather than distribution of profits; 2. The introduction of an incentive for impact investing, like the United Kingdom’s SITR; and 3. Broadening the definition of R&D to better incentivise early stage impact focused innovation. Thanks again for the opportunity to be involved in this process, and please feel free to contact us to discuss any of the above.

Indexation of income tax brackets Many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets every year, meaning a higher tax burden despite not being financially better off. If the Government wants to increase taxes it should pass a law and consult with the public, not just watch as inflation punishes taxpayers years after year. While the Working Group says that inflation is best handled by “periodic reviews of the thresholds” but New Zealanders haven’t had a tax cut since Budget 2010. In that time average income earners have been made worse off by $500 per year from failing to adjust tax thresholds. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. Capital taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low- productivity economy. The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. Instead, the Working Group has put forward two proposals for an even higher tax burden on capital and investment. New Zealand will never become prosperous if we use an opportunity to review our tax system to simply punish entrepreneurship and investment. If the Working Group does choose to recommend a form a capital taxation, it should recommend that any additional revenue is used to fund tax cuts in other areas. Full capital expensing would be a good use of any revenue. This would encourage businesses to accelerate plans for investment and expansion – putting a rocket under economic growth. I submit that the Working Group recommend against implementing new capital taxation, but if they do, that any revenue is used exclusively to cut taxes in other areas in order to ensure a growing economy and rising incomes. Taxes on savings With interest rates so low, inflation eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group w ants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax. 2 Savers were paying an effective tax-rate of 77.8% on income in a six-month term deposit in September this year, which is far too high to encourage anyone to save. I submit that the Working Group recommend that the inflation component of interest income be exempted from income tax, in order to ensure savers pay their actual income tax, not a rate often more than twice what they should be paying. Environmental taxes There needs to be more evidence on the costs and benefits of increasing the waste disposal levy before the Working Group recommends an increase. The main report used by the Working Group to justify the tax fails to take into account the cost of an increase in the levy to households. Any change in the emissions trading scheme needs to be tightly focussed on the costs to households – especially low income households who are estimated to be more than twice as affected as households with an average income. Until there is an objective framework developed to assess the trade-off between economic growth and any environmental benefits from strengthening the ETS, the Working Group should not recommend a change. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend changes to the waste disposal levy or the emissions trading scheme until there is more concrete evidence on the economic costs from increasing these taxes and an objective framework developed that weighs up the economic costs against the environmental benefits. Behavioural taxes With alternative nicotine products becoming more available on the market, reduced-harm products will be an important part of reaching the Smokefree 2025 target. Instead of hiking tobacco excise even higher, the Working Group should recommend that the Government adjust excise on reduced harm products according to their risk. Alcohol excise should be simplified, but the Working Group should not treat simplification as an opportunity to increase alcohol excise across the board. While the Working Group suggests excise is progressive, excise is actually higher as a proportion of low-price alcohol, making alcohol excise regressive. Sugar taxes should be avoided. Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. In CONCLUSION I submit it is unreasonable in the extreme to propose further taxes of any sort. The so called "fairness"argument is a political smokescreen and a crude way to con the public. The Government is flush with tax dollars and spending is poor. To take more of our hard earned cash is economic theft. After all any investments we have in whatever form are from tax paid income. 3 You are proposing to tax further those tax paid earnings. New Zealanders will revolt by ceasing to invest,getting out of the country,or finding other ways to escape such villany. Yours sincerely,

Taxes on sugar hurt low-income households the most and the evidence shows they are not effective in reducing consumption or combatting obesity. The implementation of any tax an a commodity that is an ingredient in other products is a complex proposition placing an additional overhead on both businesses and the government regarding its collection, that is likely to negate any revenue benefit from the imposition of the tax, meaning that there is likely to be little nett benefit to the physical health of New Zealanders or nett gain to governement coffers. I submit that the Working Group should not recommend increases in tobacco excise or alcohol excise and should recommend that the Government avoid implementing a sugar tax unless it can be objectively shown as being effective in combatting obesity. I remind the Working Group that whatever name they choose to call it, excise is tax and to say that an increase in an existing exise tax is not a new tax is disingenous. In light of the actions of the current government regarding its recent increases in petrol tax increases, so too is any stated intention not to implement the proposed increases during the term of the current coalition government. In summary and beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union in reply to the Working Group’s Interim Report. Overall I condemn the recommendations made by the Working Group for the harm they would be likely to inflict on the New Zealand economy and the freedom of New Zealanders to make the best choices for themselves and their families. 3 Yours sincerely, Rosemary Lynn

Furthermore I submit that the Working Group recommend against any tax on a proportion of the value of owner-occupied or alternative-owner-occupied (e.g. bach) residential property as 'imputed income'. The introduction of the 'fair dividend rate' taxation option for overseas investments can be said to have benefitted NZ holders of such investments by avoiding the gyrations in 'profit' and 'loss' caused by currency fluctuations. This consideration simply does not apply to a secondary residential property. Taxes on savings Inflation inevitably eats away at savings by making the tax rate on interest income artificially high. If the Working Group wants to encourage households to save more for their retirement they should exempt the inflation component of interest income from tax.

The Institute’s flagship project, Project 2058, focuses on New Zealand’s long-term future. As a result of our observation that foresight drives strategy, strategy requires reporting, and reporting shapes foresight, we developed three interlinking policy projects: ForesightNZ, StrategyNZ and ReportingNZ. Each of these tools must align if we want New Zealand to develop durable, robust and forward-looking public policy. The policy projects frame and feed into our research projects, which address a range of significant issues facing New Zealand. In preparing this submission, the Institute has drawn largely on our policy projects ReportingNZ. About the author: Wendy McGuinness Wendy McGuinness wrote the report Implementation of Accrual Accounting in Government Departments for the New Zealand Treasury in 1988. She founded McGuinness & Associates, a consultancy firm providing services to the public sector during the transition from cash to accrual accounting from 1988 to 1990. Between 1990 and 2003, she continued consulting part-time while raising children. Over that time she undertook risk management work for the public good. In 2002 she was a member of the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) Taskforce, which published the Report of the Taskforce on Sustainable Development Reporting. From 2003–2004 she was Chair of the NZICA Sustainable Development Reporting Committee. In 2004 Wendy established the McGuinness Institute in order to contribute to a more integrated discussion on New Zealand’s long-term future. In 2009 she became a Fellow Chartered Accountant (FCA).

In this submission we build on our earlier submission, focusing on the natural capital section. Wendy McGuinness, CEO of the McGuinness Institute, attended the Tax Working Group interim report discussion at Treasury on Section 8: Environmental and ecological outcomes of the interim report. This submission is informed by both the content of Future of Tax: Interim Report and conversations at that discussion. In this submission, we: 1. Agree with the thinking underlying the following statements on pp.4–5 and p. 5 respectively: The Group is currently working with stakeholders to develop a framework to support the future evolution of the tax system that reflects principles from Te Ao Māori, alongside the four capitals of the Living Standards Framework and the principles of tax policy design. This includes exploring concepts of waiora (wellbeing), manaakitanga (care and respect), kaitiakitanga (stewardship), whanaungatanga (relationships and connectedness), and ōhanga (prosperity). The treatment of natural capital. New Zealand makes relatively little use of environmental taxation. There are clear opportunities to increase environmental taxation, both to broaden the revenue base, and to help address the significant environmental challenges we face as a nation. These statements align with the concept of the four capitals that form part of the wellbeing conversation and the 2019 Wellbeing Budget. 2. Agree strongly with paragraph 45 on p. 27: Given the non-substitutable nature of natural capital, the declining state of New Zealand’s environment, and the increasing fiscal costs of mitigation and adaptation, the Group sees a case to broaden the base of the tax system and make greater use of environmental taxation. 3. Agree with the three main ways listed in ‘which the tax system supports the wellbeing of New Zealanders’ (see them excerpted below) on p. 11. However, we also consider the second point needs to be extended to include inter-, as well as intra-generational equity: • A fair and efficient source of revenue. Taxes provide revenue for the Government to fund the public goods and services that underpin our living standards. The tax system thus represents a way in which citizens come together to channel resources for the collective good of society. • A means of redistribution. Taxes fund the redistribution that allows all New Zealanders, regardless of their market income, to participate fully in society. While much of this redistribution occurs through the transfer system, the progressive nature of the income tax means that the tax system also plays a role in reducing inequality. 4 | P a g e • A policy instrument to influence behaviours. Taxes can also be used as an instrument to achieve specific policy goals by influencing behaviour. Taxes influence behaviour by changing the price of goods, services, or activities; taxes can discourage certain activities, and favour others. In this way, taxes can complement – or even replace – traditional policy tools such as regulation and spending, depending on which approach reflects the most effective way to achieve society’s goals. This may be particularly important in the environmental sphere. 4. Were therefore disappointed this language and method of analysis and systems thinking was not evidenced in the discussion in section 8. We suggest, for example, the title of Section 8: Environmental and ecological outcomes should read Section 8: Natural capital taxes and credits (or similar). 5. Would be keen for Section 8 of the report to answer the following question: Why should natural capital be taxed? This question is explored below. Clearly we support this concept, but if the answer to this question cannot be linked to the more general purpose of the tax system (in paragraph 2 above), an opportunity to design a durable, fair and cost-effective tax system may be missed. 6. Suggest the following question be answered in the final report: Why should natural capital be taxed? In our view, there are at least three reasons why: a. To collect revenue (for the Crown purse). This implied in the first bullet point of paragraph 3 above. b. To minimise use or contamination of our natural capital today. This implied in the second bullet point of paragraph 3 above. Note 1: The two concepts ‘to use’ and ‘to pollute’ could become two separate purposes, as the policy solutions might prove to be very different. For example to use water is arguably not as detrimental as to pollute water. Note 2: If New Zealand does choose to use or contaminate its natural capital, this must be done in an informed and considered manner. For example are we trading off the loss of natural capital with a gain in social, human and/or financial capital (e.g. coal mining on the West Coast) or are we trading a loss of natural capital to create a gain in natural capital (e.g. using money from fish and game licences to improve the environment)? c. To protect the environment for current and future generations. This is implied in the second bullet point of paragraph 3 above, but is not clearly stated – hence our recommendation that inter-generational equity should also be considered. 7. Suggest that in the final report, Section 8 should be more strongly worded, linking the purpose of taxing natural capital with the overarching purpose of New Zealand’s tax system. 8. Agree that the five draft design principles for taxing negative environmental externalities (listed on p. 63 in the Interim Report) is useful, but we question whether they are principles and whether they are complete. The principles are as follows: • Māori rights and interests; • Distributional impacts; • The price of the tax should reflect the full cost of externalities; • The price should vary locally where there is local variation in impacts; and 5 | P a g e • International linkages should be considered. 9. Note that, in our view, ‘purpose’ describes a sense of resolve or determination to achieve something, this could be in the form of an overarching goal or statement of intent. ‘Principles’, in contrast, describe the guiding thoughts or beliefs that will shape decisions and ultimately the behaviour of players while on the journey towards achieving the purpose. 10. Note that the principles (reproduced in paragraph 8 above) are not what we would call principles. 11. Suggest that, in contrast to those listed in paragraph 8 above, the guiding principles could include: • Consideration of the Treaty and the Treaty principles; • Fairness (e.g. in terms of geography/location, ethnicity and inter and intra-generational fairness); • A polluters pays principle (i.e. if you pollute, you pay e.g. phosphate leakage from agriculture); • Users pay (i.e. you use a public resource, you pay e.g. a water tax ); • The precautionary principle (i.e. when uncertainty exists, an action is assumed to be damaging); • Durability (i.e. lasts the test of time and is responsive to changes in needs, e.g. climate change); • Cost effectiveness. For example scale is important. Designing a cost effective tax system would include an understanding of the cost of collecting taxes, that some taxes may not be worth collecting and that if taxes are put in place, they are regulated, penalties are charged and penalties are collected; • Transparency (i.e. open and transparent); and • Accountability (i.e. both in terms of penalties and regulation) 12. Suggest that, given the principles in paragraph 10, New Zealand should tax individuals or entities that pollute or consume natural capital and consider ways to reward those that ‘add to’ or ‘clean up’ our natural capital. This approach means New Zealand would design a tax system not just for the poorly behaved or disobedient but also for those that provide value by protecting or enhancing the country’s natural capital. 13. Agree broadly with paragraph 17 on p. 61: Taxation is not necessarily the best tool to change behaviour. Sometimes, it may be more effective or efficient for the Government to consider regulation or spending; in other cases, taxation may be complementary. As has been stressed by public submitters, tax should not be considered in isolation when dealing with the environment; instead, the merits of tax as a policy instrument should be assessed together with the merits of other tools and approaches. 14. Suggest tax collected from natural capital could be ring-fenced so that the revenue received from this tax is funnelled back into efforts to protect and regulate natural capital. In this sense, the purpose of the tax is fulfilled, in that the revenue collected is used to protect the capital that generated it. 15. Suggest a pro rata penalty system be developed in New Zealand where points are given a dollar value, and the penalty is paid based on the points allocated for the penalty. This would stop penalties being out of alignment with each other. 6 | P a g e 16. Agree with the reference to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) on p. 61 of the Interim Report as a metric by which New Zealand’s progress can be assessed: In the environmental sphere, the goals set targets for clean water (SDG6), climate action (SDG13), life below water (SDG14), and life on land (SDG15). The Sustainable Development Goals provide one blueprint for defining and measuring a just transition over time. However, it is important to note that any steward of the tax system should be able to measure how these goals are progressing. Our concerns with the SDG are that there are too many goals and Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth has a pre-existing tension and is really two goals. 17. Agree with statement on p. 62 (below), but consider the report should go further. The tax system should be designed to collect revenue to manage the additional risks of climate change (which will largely fall on government) but also to change behaviour and deliver a mix of taxes and tax credits, that together, can propel New Zealand towards a zero-carbon economy by 2050: Greenhouse gases could be a significant source of revenue over the medium term. 18. We wonder if there are tools that can be used to measure the following: ‘This means abatement of emissions is likely to be achieved at a lower cost by using taxation than by mandating particular actions through regulation. There is also evidence that putting a price on greenhouse gas externalities drives innovation in abatement (Dechezlepretre, Martin & Bassi 2016). 19. Note, the Institute has a particular interest in climate change reporting in the public and private sectors. To this end we have produced reports on climate change with a view to collecting key information, which could in turn help develop a tax and credit system to enable New Zealand to transition to a zero-carbon economy by 2050. Key documents include: Think Piece 30 – Package of Climate Change Reporting Recommendations (October 2018) Working Paper 2018/03 – Analysis of Climate Change Reporting in the Public and Private Sectors (July 2018) 20. Note we do not underestimate the challenges of developing a tax framework for natural capital. We agree on the ‘why’, but moving from ‘why’ to ‘how’ will be challenging. Table 1 overleaf illustrates how the TWG might explain the type of change they want to bring about. 21. Note that we consider more work needs to be undertaken in order to explore the best purpose, principles and processes for taxing natural capital. Above we have made a few suggestions, but we think the biggest value is in making the final report very clear in terms of what you see as driving the existing system and how that might change if New Zealand moves to a different purpose and set of principles. Table 1 below is a very initial attempt at illustrating what we envisage might be useful when preparing your final report. 22.

Anything but ‘Risk Free’ this proposal might at worst collapse the economy if the Government in fact saw  fit to introduce it and at best seriously lower our standard of living and GDP.    Businesses would be bankrupted as they would not be able to stump up with the ready cash annually and  many property investors would be forced to sell.     It actually encourages people to take on more debt so they have less equity. This seems to run contrary to  what the government, economists and financial services advisors have been telling us for years, that we  are over indebted in the private sector, over indebted as a nation and as individuals.    For example, those property investors who have been busy chipping away at paying off the principal on  their mortgage gradually but steadily over the years to build up equity so they have a nest egg in their  retirement (and will not have to be a burden on the State) are the ones who will be penalised! The harder  they have worked to pay off their one or two investment properties the more they will be penalised and  the more unaffordable this tax would be. They would have to remortgage their property to pay the RFRR!  If they sell their property this would put more of a squeeze on the rental market and rents would rise as a  result.    An unintended consequence might be for those who could afford it, perhaps in well paid jobs, to buy more  rentals and take on more debt to the maximum amount they could borrow. They could buy up the mum  and dad investor’s properties that the mum and dad investors could no longer afford to keep!    This is a cruel and unfair tax, especially for those many mum and dad investors who own 1 or 2 investment  properties and have spent a lifetime paying off the mortgage on them (or plan to do so). It is penalising  those who have been prudent in building up equity and going without rather than frittering away their  savings.    \[1\] \[1\] 2   Capital Gains Tax    We already have a Capital Gains Tax in New Zealand in all but name and it is called the Brightline Test but  this fact seems to go unnoticed by many, possibly because it is not widely disseminated by the media.  I also believe that the IRD has been given greater resources to investigate and police this.    By the Tax Working Group’s own implicit admission, the current housing situation in NZ is not primarily as  a result of the lack of a CGT with regard to investment properties or indeed investment in housing in NZ. I  don’t think the TWG has really thought through the ramifications if such a tax were it introduced and  especially with relation to NZ’s own unique tax laws as they stand.     I always recall the words of our lawyer after my husband died at 39years and I was widowed in my 30s. We  owned a block of flats and had lived in one of them. I asked the lawyer, do you think they will ever  introduce a CGTax in NZ? He replied, if they did we would all go to live in Australia.   Well, we could all join family over there (many of us have family and friends living over there) or else just  stay here and invest in Australian property and/or shares, which would not do much for our economy.    I do not support a CGTax and in all fairness it should be including the family home were it ever introduced.  The family home is for many their greatest asset or most high value investment and when property prices  rise so does our spending. We view our homes as investments and that’s what they are! But of course that  would be political suicide to introduce a CG Tax on the family home.    It seems to me that Michael Cullen’s support of a CG Tax smacks of another time, another place, an  opportunity to enable a long held dream to be made a reality. But times have changed, we live in a  complicated world, a new perspective is required. NZ is a unique situation and to change that we would  have to introduce major tax reform. This would take years but really it is not necessary, we are doing fine.  It’s simple and works relatively well in general terms. Why try to fix something if it is not broken unless you  are trying to fulfil some long held dogma without looking objectively at what you are trying to achieve. Or,  is quite simply also seen as an opportunity to extract more tax. No doubt, although touted as tax neutral  now, it would be ratcheted up in the future, like for example gst was.    Although the Australian situation is different we can see the ‘mansion effect’ that has resulted in Sydney. I  have first hand information of this as my brother has lived there for 20+ years. Rentals are not sold so  often and family homes become newer, larger or upgraded.    If the family bach were exempt say, this would drive investors to buy one rather than a rental property,  thus driving up prices and locking up capital.    As mentioned, our NZ tax situation is not geared up for such a tax, we would have to rewrite all our tax  laws really. It is a complicated tax, unfair and in reality takes many years for governments to make money  from it. It is complicated to administer and costly and open to interpretation.   It penalises those who are forced to sell, most likely those with one or two properties who need to cash up  to help fund their retirement. Those with many properties can likely live off the rent and just pass them on  to their children. Unfair.  It penalises those like me with no children, or who do not own my own home but live with a relative and  have my money invested in rental units that I will have to sell one day.  There will be those who will always find ways around the tax and most likely this will not be the small time  mum and dad investors who make up most of the property investment market.    3 For all these reasons I do not support a CGTax but were one ever introduced it should only apply to  investment properties bought after the CGTax passed in to law.    SUMMARY    In short, the RFRT would have disastrous consequences if it were introduced, either fully or in some  watered down form. It is also grossly unfair to those who have gone without to build up equity.    A Capital Gains Tax is cumbersome, costly to administer, not suited to our unique tax situation, is unfair,  will be open to interpretation, will create the ‘mansion effect’ and is unnecessarily complicated. Rents will  rise.    No doubt many accountants and tax lawyers will be enthusiastic about the idea and play down the  negative ramifications (many which are often only obvious after new laws come into effect) as they will be  swamped with new clients. NZ is its own unique situation and its tax simplicity is one of its desirable  characteristics.     Finally, property investors are facing many challengers at present. The Healthy Homes Bill, the reform of  the RTAct, abolishment of letting fees, political uncertainties and vehement tenant action groups. In short,  it is becoming increasingly undesirable to be a landlord or property investor, particularly a mum and dad  investor. Apart from all these costs and uncertainties at present levelled at Landlords, the role of a  Landlord itself is time consuming and intensive. It is far from a passive investment.  I have been a Landlord for 20+ years and am finding that the market now calls for upgrades to renovate  and modernise kitchens and bathrooms to a higher standard than the property I live in myself. That is a  whole different story but I forsee rental shortages and rent rises on the horizon because if I am thinking  that selling might not be such a bad thing I know many others will be thinking the same way.    Also, I am very pleased that the Tax Working Group has agreed that property is fairly taxed. As mentioned,  many property investors are content to chip away at their mortgages and pay tax on their rental income.
