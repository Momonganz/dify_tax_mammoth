The paper also illustrates how the proposed principles can be applied to various situations. It does not suggest wording for the final report because of the complexity of the issues involved. Final text will be drafted after key issues have been discussed and resolved. The recommendations in this paper are ‘in principle’ recommendations, as they have been made without considering the fiscal impacts of the design features. The Secretariat is currently modelling fiscal impacts of design choices to the extent practicable, and will report back to the Group at a later date. The Group may revisit any design choices in light of those fiscals. Key points for discussion This paper: a. Discusses how rollover treatment would have significant impacts on the fairness, integrity, revenue, and efficiency benefits of an ETCI, and the administrative complexity, compliance and efficiency costs. b. Discusses the link between rollover treatment and loss ring-fencing. c. Discusses rollover treatment for transfers where there is no change in ownership in substance of the assets. d. Discusses rollover treatment for involuntary events. e. Discusses rollover treatment for voluntary sales and reinvestment. f. Discusses rollover treatment for death and gifting events. g. Discusses rollover treatment for relationship property divisions. h. Discusses how rollover treatment would affect transfers of Māori assets. 2 Recommended actions We recommend, in principle, that you: General a. note that rollover treatment reduces the revenue raised from the tax, as it allows the tax to be deferred until there is a realisation event that does not qualify for rollover. This could be in many years’ time or potentially many lifetimes, if rollover treatment applies to death and gifts. b. note that some forms of rollover treatment may negate the fairness benefits that ETCI is intended to provide. c. note that where rollover treatment reduces “lock-in” for an initial realisation event, it will lead to greater “lock-in” issues in the long term and may bias decisions on how firms reinvest. d. note there are three main reasons for taxing the capital gain at the time an asset is actually sold (on realisation, as opposed to when the gains accrue): i. there is an ability to pay the tax from the sale proceeds. ii. there is accurate measurement of the gain based on the sale price. iii. the decision to sell is within the taxpayer’s control. e. agree that the same reasons should be considered when evaluating which situations should qualify for rollover treatment. No change in ownership in substance f. agree in principle that, provided integrity risks are addressed, rollover treatment should apply to transfers of business assets that do not change the ownership in substance, including: i. incorporation by a sole trader or partnership where the vendor does not receive any consideration for the transfer, other than an ownership interest in the transferee; ii. transfers within a wholly-owned group; and iii. de-mergers. Certain involuntary events g. agree that rollover treatment should apply to compulsory acquisition of land by the Crown. 3 h. agree that rollover treatment should apply to insurance proceeds or other compensation for assets destroyed by natural disaster or similar events. i. agree that rollover treatment for the involuntary events (in g. and h. above) should only apply if the asset owner uses the proceeds to acquire a similar replacement asset. Voluntary sales and reinvestment j. note that if rollover was provided for voluntary events it is likely to require some level of loss ring-fencing to protect the integrity of the tax system. k. agree that rollover should not be provided to voluntary disposals and reacquisitions involving: i. business premises; ii. capital assets that are replaced by a “similar” asset that is used within the same business; or iii. any capital business asset (including where the new asset is a different type of asset or business). Death and gifting events l. note that providing rollover on death and gifting is likely to reduce the vertical equity (progressivity) of the tax. m. note that there is a stronger case for rollover of transfers on death than for gifts during a person’s life. n. note that if rollover is allowed for transfers on death but not for gifts, there would be an incentive for taxpayers to hold assets until they die (which could be inefficient). o. note that if rollover is allowed for gifts during a person’s life, it would need to override the associated persons rules and potentially create avoidance opportunities. p. note there is a stronger case for providing rollover treatment for certain “illiquid” assets which are difficult to value and harder to sell or borrow against than other assets. q. agree that the “illiquid assets” that qualify for rollover treatment could be: i. shares, land (including farmland) and other assets in active unlisted companies and unincorporated businesses; and ii. land whose legal nature means it is very difficult to sell or use as security for a loan (e.g. interests in Māori freehold land). 4 r. agree that rollover should be provided for all transfers of qualifying illiquid assets on death (regardless of the deceased person’s relationship with the recipient). s. agree that rollover should only be provided for transfers of other assets (i.e. assets that are not qualifying illiquid assets) to a surviving spouse, civil union or de facto partner on death. t. agree that rollover should not be provided for gifts of illiquid assets. u. agree that rollover should not be provided for gifts of other non-qualifying assets. v. agree that, where the terms of the trust are such that rollover would necessarily apply if a taxable asset had instead moved directly from the settlor to the trust beneficiaries, rollover should also apply to both the settlement into and distribution out of the trust. w. agree that rules should ensure that trusts cannot be used to avoid what would otherwise be realisations. x. agree that the tax treatment of transfers on death and gifts should apply equally to revenue account property and taxable capital assets. y. agree that if rollover is provided for gifts this should be limited to cases where the gift is made and received by a natural person, and possibly family trusts or certain Māori entities, in order to reduce avoidance risks. z. agree that rollover should not be allowed for gifts or transfers on death to non-residents in those cases where New Zealand would lose the right to tax the gain because the asset is held by a non-resident. Relationship property divisions aa. agree that rollover treatment should apply to transfers of property when a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship is dissolved on separation. Māori collectively-owned assets bb. note that recommended rollover for transfers of business assets that do not change the ownership in substance will provide rollover for some, but not all, reorganisations of iwi settlement assets, so further rollover may need to be considered. cc. note that rollover treatment could be developed to ensure the tax does not create undue obstacles to iwi regaining control of ancestral land. We will report with recommendations on this following consultation. dd. note that Māori freehold land would be a qualifying illiquid asset for the purposes of any proposed rollover provided for qualifying illiquid assets. 5 ee. note that issues surrounding Māori collectively held assets will be further explored on consultation and reported back. Other ff. consider next steps and, in particular, whether decisions made on rollover treatment mean that any other elements of the ETCI reform should be revisited. gg. note that the Group may have to reconsider some of its recommendations after it has received models of the fiscal impacts of the design features. 6 Rollover treatment and Loss ring-fencing Decision Paper for Session 20 of the Tax Working Group October 2018 Prepared by Inland Revenue and the Treasury 7 TABLE OF CONTENTS 1.

Introduction 1.1 Purpose 1. The purpose of this paper is to provide the Group with further information and analysis to assist with the Group’s decisions regarding situations where rollover treatment should apply and, in particular, the implications for loss ring-fencing. 1.2 What is rollover treatment? 2. Rollover treatment provides an exception to applying tax to capital gains when a realisation event such as a sale or transfer of the asset (including a bequest or gift) has occurred. 3. It does not mean the gain or loss is never taxed. It means taxation of the gain or loss is deferred until there is a later realisation event which is not eligible for rollover treatment. Example 1– Rollover treatment A buys a holiday home for $500,000. When A dies, she leaves the holiday home, worth $700,000, to her children. The children sell it 5 years later for $950,000. If the transfer of the holiday home to A’s children is treated as a realisation event which is not eligible for rollover treatment: • A will have $200,000 of taxable income at the time of her death, which will be returned by her executor/administrator. • A’s children will have taxable income of $250,000 when they sell the holiday home 5 years later. If the transfer is eligible for rollover treatment: • A will be treated as having no taxable income from the holiday home on her death. • A’s children will have taxable income of $450,000 when they sell the holiday home 5 years later. 4. In other countries, rollover treatment may apply to some events that are within the control of the taxpayer (e.g. where business premises are sold and the proceeds are reinvested into a new business premises). In these cases, taxpayers can “cherry-pick” to take advantage of the differing tax treatment of capital gains and losses. They can use the rollover treatment to shelter tax on gains when assets have appreciated, while generating tax losses by not applying the treatment when the assets have depreciated. This asymmetry creates revenue integrity and efficiency concerns. 5. Therefore, the more extensive the rollover treatment, the more likely it is that extensive loss ring-fencing rules will be required to mitigate the fiscal risks created by this ability to “cherry-pick” by deferring tax on gains while realising tax losses. 10 1.3 What is loss ring-fencing? 6. Loss ring-fencing is a special tax rule whereby a particular type of loss can only be offset against a particular type of income (usually of a similar character). 7. This means there is a trade-off between the extent of rollover treatment provided (in situations which are within the taxpayer’s control), and the economic and compliance costs as a result of the extent of loss ring-fencing required. Example 2 – Rollover treatment and loss ring-fencing A company has business profits of $2m in the current year. It also owns two commercial buildings, one which has appreciated in value by $1m and the other which has depreciated by $2m (assume no tax depreciation has been allowed). The company sells both buildings. The tax treatment under three different tax settings would be as follows. No rollover treatment and no loss ring-fencing: The company would be taxed on $2m of business profits and the $1m gain from the appreciated building. The company would derive a $2m tax loss on the other building, so they it would have $1m of net income and pay $280,000 of tax. This income tax treatment outcome is closest to taxing economic income. Rollover treatment, no ring-fencing: If the company is able to claim rollover treatment for the appreciated building (e.g. because they buy a similar replacement building), it will not be taxed on the gain on the appreciated building until a later point. It can also use the $2m tax loss from the depreciated building to fully offset the tax on their $2m business profits, so will pay no tax. This income tax treatment exposes the Government to fiscal risk from taxpayers accelerating deductible capital losses and using rollover treatment to defer taxation of capital gains. Rollover treatment with ring-fencing: If capital losses on buildings were ring-fenced, the company would have $2m of net income in the current year (being $2m business profits only), on which they pay tax of $560,000. The $1m gain on the appreciated building can be offset against $1m of the $2m loss from the depreciated building. The remaining $1m loss will be carried forward and may be used against future capital gains from buildings. Using loss ring-fencing rules to mitigate the tax integrity concern created by some taxpayers taking advantage of rollover treatment to minimise their tax will give rise to an unfair and inefficient outcome for other taxpayers. In this example, the company is overtaxed relative to its economic income, because the ring-fencing lowers the value of its loss. 11 2. How do rollover treatment and loss ring-fencing affect delivery of the overall objectives of the tax? 2.1 Objectives of extending taxation to capital income 8. The Group noted it needs to consider if the fairness, integrity, revenue, and efficiency benefits from reform outweigh the administrative complexity, compliance costs, and efficiency costs that arise from the proposed additional capital income taxation. 9. ETCI improves fairness through: • Horizontal equity. It taxes income whether it is earned through capital gains or otherwise. This is a big issue as capital gains can be an important source of income for many. For example, we have seen previously that untaxed realised gains are 20% of accounting profits for SMEs. Untaxed realised gains are approximately 17% of net taxable income for “significant enterprises” (companies with revenue of over $80m per annum). • Vertical equity (progressivity). Higher wealth individuals and households tend to derive a greater proportion of their income from increases in values of capital assets than lower wealth individuals and households. The Group has received estimates from the Treasury that, in New Zealand, 82% of assets potentially affected by an extension of the taxation of capital income are held by the top 20% of households by wealth. We have also seen that more than one-third of the wealth of most high-wealth individuals has been built up in ways that have not been taxed and the lack of a tax on realised gains is likely a major contributor to this. Example 3 – Horizontal equity There are three individuals: Anna, Barry, and Carl. • Anna is retired and has $400,000 in a term deposit, earning 5% interest. Her income is $20,000 and it is all taxed. • Barry owns a rental property worth $400,000. The taxable rental income is 3% and he derives a 2% capital gain. His total income is $20,000, but only $12,000 is taxed. • Carl works 20 hours a week for $20 an hour. His yearly income is $20,000 and it is all taxed. In all three of these situations the economic income of Anna, Barry, and Carl is $20,000, but because some of Barry’s income is a capital gain it is untaxed. This violates horizontal equity. 10. Taxing capital gains is aimed at reducing this horizontal inequity. It also promotes vertical equity because capital gains are a major part of the income of the well-off. 11. It also improves integrity by reducing the scope for differences between the company rate and the top personal rate to shelter income from higher rates of personal tax. 12. It increases revenue and in so doing, creates a means of financing tax cuts or spending measures which can address other government priorities. 12 13. It improves efficiency through reducing tax-driven incentives to make investments in assets that produce capital gains rather than other income. 14. Whether these benefits outweigh the administrative complexity, compliance costs and efficiency costs that arise from the tax depends on the design of the tax, including key features such as whether to tax on realisation and the circumstances in which rollover treatment and loss ring-fencing apply. 15. In designing rollover treatment, the Secretariat suggests that the Group try to maximise the benefits of the tax while minimising the costs. To that end, it suggests rollover treatment that helps support the fairness, integrity, revenue, and efficiency benefits, and minimises the administrative complexity, compliance and efficiency costs. 2.2 Disadvantages from applying tax on realisation 16. In the Interim Report the Group proposed that the tax should be imposed on realisation rather than on accrual in most cases. This means the tax would not typically apply as gains accumulate (e.g. when an asset owner simply holds an appreciating asset) but will instead apply when the gains are realised (the most obvious case being where the asset owner sells their asset to a third party). 17. There are three key disadvantages that arise from applying tax on realisation (rather than as gains accrue): a. Potential for long-term deferral of tax. This undermines fairness (both horizontal and vertical equity) and neutrality with other income which is usually taxed much more frequently and consistently due to being earned as a regular income stream. b. “Lock-in” incentives. Owners of assets are encouraged to retain them rather than sell them, because selling triggers a tax liability, even though in the absence of tax, selling the asset would be more economically efficient than retaining it. c. Some realisation events may be outside owner’s control. This may be seen as unfair from a horizontal equity perspective as other asset owners will only pay tax if they choose to sell. 18. Rollover treatment aims to mitigate the “lock-in” and horizontal equity issues noted in points (b) and (c). However, it does so by further prolonging tax deferral which exacerbates the fairness and neutrality problems described in point (a). Extending tax deferral also increases “lock-in” incentives by increasing the amount of tax that must be paid if a taxpayer triggers a realisation event. Rollover treatment can also bias decisions on how reinvestment takes place. 19. The general impacts of providing rollover treatment on the fairness, efficiency, simplicity and revenue integrity of the tax are further discussed below. 13 20. It is important to emphasise that the views in this Chapter are general views and the actual impacts will depend on the design of each type of rollover treatment provided (and the design of any associated loss-ring fencing rules). 2.3 General impacts from providing rollover treatment Fairness 21. As rollover treatment reduces the circumstances in which an extension of taxation on capital income applies, it also reduces the vertical equity and horizontal equity benefits. Horizontal equity 22. Horizontal equity suggests that people in similar situations should face similar tax outcomes. 23. There are two dimensions to horizontal equity in the case of rollover treatment. From the perspective of income generally, rollover treatment is inconsistent with horizontal equity as it further defers the taxation of income, while for those who earn income in ways other than capital gains, there is no such benefit. The deferral impact is illustrated in Example 4 below which considers the after-tax position for taxpayers Bill and Claire. Example 4 – deferral impact of rollover Bill and Claire are both taxed at a rate of 33%. Bill deposits $1,000 in an interest-bearing account earning a compounding 5% per annum of interest for 10 years. Claire instead invests $1,000 in a block of land which appreciates at 5% per annum and is sold after 10 years. The Table below shows that at present with no tax on capital gains Bill would accumulate $1,390 whereas Claire would accumulate $1,629 after 10 years. Thus Claire ends up being 17.2% better off after 10 years. This violates horizontal equity. Bringing in a tax on realised gains would mean that Claire would end up with $1,421 after 10 years. This still makes her somewhat better off than Bill because interest is taxed each year as it accumulates whereas capital gains are taxed only on realisation. But now Claire is only be 2.2% better off than Bill so this gain is slight. Thus, if income is accumulating for short periods, taxing realised gains substantially addresses horizontal inequities. Years income accumulates Bill's accumulated interest Claire's land (no tax on capital gains) Claire's gain relative to Bill Claire's land (tax on realised capital gains) Claire's gain relative to Bill 10 1,390 1,629 17.2% 1,421 2.2% 20 1,933 2,108 37.2% 2,108 9.1% 40 3,736 5,047 88.4% 5,047 35.1% The timing benefits of gains being taxed only when they are realised increases the longer that assets are held. For example, if assets were held for 40 years and capital gains were taxed on realisation, Claire would be 35.1% better off than Bill. Rollover treatment defers the time when gains are realised for the purposes of an ETCI. To that extent it reduces the benefits of a capital gains tax in reducing horizontal inequities. 14 24. There is, however, a second horizontal equity perspective. This is that, for two taxpayers who own capital assets, there can be important horizontal equity concerns that justify rollover treatment. Perhaps the clearest case is for realisation events that are outside the taxpayer’s control, as this ensures equal treatment with other asset owners who only have to pay the tax if they make a decision to sell. These events could include a compulsory acquisition by the Crown, destruction or loss of an asset giving rise to insurance proceeds or divorces. 25. Horizontal equity considerations also mean that if rollover treatment applies to a wide range of situations, or in the absence of clear principles, it may be hard to justify not extending rollover to other cases (e.g. due to lobbying from groups facing comparable situations that are not entitled to rollover treatment). This is particularly true if there are not obvious principles for why the rollover treatment was provided. Vertical equity 26. A key objective of the tax is to increase the fairness and progressivity of the tax system by taxing gains that are currently untaxed on appreciating assets such as land or shares. These assets are more likely to be owned by wealthy people and the gains on those assets often represent a significant share of a wealthy person’s economic income. 27. Rollover treatment can undermine this objective as it enables asset owners to defer paying the tax for a longer time period. The ability to defer payment of tax does not exist for most other forms of income (e.g. salary and wages, interest). 28. Furthermore, depending on the design of the rollover treatment, wealthier people may be better able to utilise rollover. This is because they may be more able to reinvest into replacement assets (as opposed to needing the funds to meet other expenses) or more likely to inherit or gift assets. They may also have better access to tax advice on how to best use the rollover provisions so as to minimise their tax liabilities. 29. In contrast, less wealthy people are more likely to need to sell their assets in a way that does not qualify for rollover treatment. They are therefore more likely to be required to pay the tax. Example 5 – Vertical equity Donna has saved $35,000 for her retirement, which is kept in a term deposit with a bank in case she needs it to supplement her NZ Superannuation. Over the years, the accumulated after-tax interest on the term deposit is $25,000. She is taxed on the interest as it is paid to her account. Eugene has saved $300,000 for his retirement, which he has invested in New Zealand listed shares. Over the years, the shares have accumulated capital gains of $500,000 which have not been taxed. Donna and Eugene both die and pass their savings on to their children. The accumulated $25,000 of interest that Donna derived and passes on has been fully taxed, so it does not matter to her or her heirs if rollover treatment applies on death. 15 In contrast, the $500,000 of capital gains that Eugene derived has not been taxed. If rollover treatment applies on death, these gains will not be taxed unless Eugene’s heirs sell the shares. If there is rollover treatment on death, Eugene will be able to pass the New Zealand listed shares to his children with no capital gains having been taxed. If Donna is able to pass any of her $60,000 on to her children, the entire income will have been taxed. Efficiency 30. Rollover treatment will minimise some biases on investment decisions to ensure businesses and investors do not base their decisions on tax inconsistencies, but make the same decision in a world with tax as they would make in a world without tax. 31. As noted above, a key disadvantage created by taxing on realisation is “lock-in” effects. Rollover treatment can reduce “lock-in” and other investment biases for the initial realisation event (which increases efficiency) but leads to greater “lock-in” issues in the long term. This is because it increases the potential tax liability that would apply if the asset owner eventually decides to sell (which reduces efficiency). Example 6 – Short-term and long-term lock-in It is 2032 and Ariana is a farmer with farmland that was purchased for $4m in 2022. Short-term lock-in The land is currently worth $6m. Ariana wants to increase the size of her farm but surrounding land is not for sale. Ariana finds a larger farm for sale nearby for $7m. If Ariana sells her current land and receives rollover treatment, she will have to borrow an additional $1m from the bank. If she does not receive rollover treatment she will have to borrow $1.56m (the $560,000 representing company tax on the capital gain of $2m). Selling her initial farm now rather than in the future brings forward the time when her gain is taxed and increases the present value of the taxes that she pays. Without rollover treatment Ariana faces a “lock-in” incentive to keep her smaller farm. Long-term lock-in Assume Ariana sold her land in 2032 for $6m and bought the $7m farm. It is now 2042 and Ariana is thinking about moving out of farming and buying a commercial property in town. Her farmland is now worth $9m. If rollover treatment was provided on the farmland sold in 2032, tax on her gain will be $1.4m (28% of $5m gain) and net proceeds will be $7.6m. If rollover treatment was not provided in 2032, the tax in 2042 will be $560,000 (28% of $2m gain). She will have to find an investment that matches her farm income (where the farm is valued at $9m) with $8.44m of proceeds, instead of $7.6m if there had been rollover. In this case the lock-in incentive is less than had rollover treatment been provided in 2032. 32. While rollover treatment can alleviate short-term lock-in, it exacerbates long-term lock-in. It is not clear which is more economically harmful and the Secretariat is of the view that it should be considered an open question whether economic efficiency supports rollover treatment. 33. Rollover treatment for voluntary sale proceeds that are reinvested into replacement assets can also create “lock-in” into an asset class if rollover is limited to reinvestment in “similar assets”. 16 Example 7 – Similar asset lock-in Productivity Co. has created an income earning asset (Asset A) by spending $100. The asset is expected to earn $10 per year in perpetuity, and because the prevailing interest rate is 5% it is valued at $200. The result is that Productivity Co. has an unrealised $100 capital gain. Assume a 28% tax rate. Productivity Co. sees a $200 asset that it knows can earn it $11 per year in perpetuity when it is supported by its sales team. It is a similar asset to Asset A. Without rollover treatment Productivity Co. will not make the productivity enhancing sale of Asset A and purchase of Asset B. The present value of the additional income stream would be $20 but the tax cost would be $28. This example might support rollover treatment for similar “replacement assets”. But now imagine that there is Asset C (also for $200) that is not similar to assets A and B and it that will earn $12 per year. This is the most productive asset for Productivity Co. to own of all. If there is “replacement asset” rollover treatment for similar assets, Productivity Co. will see Asset B as a worthwhile purchase but not Asset C. The irony is that without “replacement asset” rollover treatment, Productivity Co. would sell Asset A and purchase Asset C, but rollover treatment has incentivised a less productive purchase. The table below sets out the different outcomes under either regime. The most profitable investment is highlighted and in bold. Net proceeds if sold Interest on borrowings from bank to fund new asset Revenue from (new) investment Profit Similar “replacement asset” rollover Asset A -$0 $10$10 Asset B $200$0$11$11 Asset C $172$1.40$12$10.60 No rolloverAsset A -$0 $10$10 Asset B $172$1.40$11$9.40 Asset C $172$1.40$12$10.60 34. The example above suggests that the efficiency effects of rollover treatment are uncertain. On the one hand it may promote efficiency by reducing a barrier in the way of a taxpayer trading up to a more productive asset than is currently being used. At the same time, rollover treatment can reduce efficiency by creating longer term lock-in and also by encouraging taxpayers to reinvest in similar assets when changing assets might be more productive. Simplicity 35. Targeting rollover treatment at particular assets or circumstances increases complexity and compliance costs by making it less certain what qualifies for rollover. 17 Revenue impact and integrity 36. Rollover treatment defers and potentially reduces the revenue raised from the tax, as it allows the tax to be deferred until there is a realisation event that does not qualify for rollover. This could be in many years’ time or potentially many lifetimes, if rollover treatment applies to death and gifts. 37. The fiscal cost of rollover treatment is hard to estimate, but there is some data from the United States. The data for individuals is the most detailed and provides the best information available. The table below compares the value of rollover treatment provided for individuals who utilise the United States “like-kind” exchange rollover rules reinvested in similar replacements assets in 2011 against total net capital gains from these assets. These are similar to the rollover rules for replacement assets outlined in Chapter 6 of this paper, but differ in the detail of the rules.

Rollover treatment, if not accompanied by extensive loss ring-fencing, will create opportunities to shelter gains from tax by enabling some taxpayers to “cherry-pick” by deferring gains and realising losses. 2.4 Flow-on impacts from loss ring-fencing rules 39. To mitigate “cherry-picking” and other integrity concerns from rollover treatment, additional loss ring-fencing rules are likely to be required. Loss ring-fencing rules have negative impacts on fairness, efficiency and simplicity. Fairness 40. Loss ring-fencing rules reduce fairness because they apply to investors who have genuine losses. They therefore apply more broadly than the target group which is taking advantage of the tax rules by artificially accelerating their tax losses and deferring tax on their capital gains. These taxpayers are worse off compared to 18 taxpayers who have losses that they can offset against other income. In particular, wealthier taxpayers (including those who may be taking advantage of rollover treatment and other deferral mechanisms) are likely to have a bigger portfolio of assets on which they can utilise their losses to offset income (even if the losses are ring-fenced to a particular asset) so will be less impacted by loss ring-fencing than poorer taxpayers with fewer assets. Efficiency 41. Loss ring-fencing creates a bias against risky investments that may generate capital gains or losses. This will create a tax bias which will discourage investment in some activities that would have been attractive with more neutral tax settings. It will discourage investment in some assets with high expected returns. This will tend to, at the margin, reduce the productivity of investments in New Zealand. Example 8 – bias against risky investments An investor has the choice of investing $100 in two different ways: Option A: Fixed return of $5 in a year’s time Option B: 50% chance of a $30 gain and a 50% chance of $10 loss in a year’s time Option B is more risky but has a higher expected value or average return of $10 (being 0.5\*30 – 0.5\*10). In the absence of tax, the investor might choose Option B if they judged the extra return worth the risk. However if losses are ring-fenced, the tax system may make Option A more attractive if the taxpayer is unable to use the losses to offset tax on their other income (the losses become harder to use and therefore less valuable). Simplicity 42. Loss ring-fencing rules increase the complexity and compliance costs associated with the tax. 43. If extensive loss ring-fencing were required such that capital losses could only be offset against capital gains, the capital–revenue boundary will need to be maintained. This effectively removes one of the key simplicity and economic neutrality benefits from designing a tax that applies to capital gains and other forms of income in broadly the same way (e.g. at the same rates). 2.5 Concluding comments 44. Decisions on rollover treatment and loss ring-fencing will affect the economic effects of an ETCI reform. All countries that have taxes on capital gains have some forms of rollover treatment which address concerns about situations where taxes on capital gains may be particularly problematic. At the same time a sufficiently broad set of rollover treatments could significantly reduce an ETCI’s capacity to deliver its key objectives. 19 45. In subsequent chapters we suggest a number of criteria to help make decisions on rollover treatment. In so doing we are considering a number of possible decisions one at a time. At the end of the decision making process it will, however, be critically important to stand back and consider whether the set of decisions made end up supporting or hindering the government in delivering on the key objectives of ETCI. 46. It may also be worthwhile exploring whether there are implications here for other decisions that have been made. For example, the TWG has decided to tax gains and losses at full marginal rates. A major benefit of doing so is that this removes any need to distinguish capital gains from revenue gains. This has important fairness and simplicity benefits. The simplicity benefits would, however, be negated if there were to be widespread loss ring-fencing provisions as this would require ongoing distinctions between capital and revenue gains. 20 3. Principles for applying rollover treatment 47. As explained above, rollover treatment can undermine some of the objectives of extending the taxation of capital income. This chapter attempts to define some key principles to identify situations where rollover treatment is most justified and is likely to maximise the benefits and minimise the costs. As the Group noted in the Interim Report: Without such principles, ad hoc roll-overs will be adopted, reflecting political responses to lobbying, rather than sensible tax policy. 48. As an initial point, the Secretariat suggests that, as with GST, starting from a system with limited concessions is more likely to create a dynamic where there is a high hurdle that needs to be met before more concessions proliferate. If there is extensive rollover treatment, it becomes more difficult to find strong principles to protect the fairness, integrity, and revenue potential of the tax. Widespread rollover treatment may also negate many of the fairness benefits that ETCI is intended to provide. 49. The Group’s Interim Report set out two principles for when rollover treatment would seem to be justified (paragraph 40 of Appendix B): • When there has been no change in ownership in substance; and • When there has been a legal change in ownership (and a change in substance) but the nature of the transaction is such that it has not given rise to a gain that can be said to have “come home” to the vendor. ... This can be contrasted with a market value sale to an unrelated party, crystallising certain gains available to the vendor to use at their discretion (including on consumption); a clear gain has “come home”. 50. The rationale underpinning these two principles is further discussed below. 3.1 No change in ownership in substance 51. Rollover may be justified in cases where there has been no change in ownership in substance for the following reasons: • There is less ability to pay a tax as often no consideration will be paid. • Measurement of any gain/loss may be inaccurate as the price may be a non- market price. • Imposing tax could create “lock-in” issues whereby the tax discourages the asset owners from carrying out otherwise efficient business restructuring. • If there is no rollover treatment in these situations, the tax system is likely to have undesirable traps for the unwary and encourage business owners to be adopting tax structures now to minimise possible taxing events in the future. • Related party sales could be used to crystallise tax losses on depreciated assets. Note that to address this problem, rollover treatment would have to be mandatory in these circumstances. 21 Example 9 – Rollover treatment for no change in ownership in substance A sole trader mechanic purchased their business premises for $200,000, which has now increased in value to $500,000. The sole trader wants to incorporate and transfer the business premises to the new company. Assume there is no tax depreciation. If there is no rollover treatment, the mechanic will trigger a tax liability on the $300,000 gain when premises are transferred to the company. If rollover applied, the transfer would not trigger any tax liability and the company would assume the mechanic’s cost base in the premises of $200,000. So if the company subsequently sells the premises to a third party for, say, $800,000, the company would be taxed on a $600,000 taxable gain. Similarly, the mechanic would have a cost base in their shares of $200,000, and a sale of those shares to a third party for $800,000 would also give rise to a taxable gain. 3.2 The relevant gain has not “come home” 52. This principle can be interpreted narrowly or broadly. 53. Under a narrow interpretation it would only apply when the realisation event is outside the asset owner’s control and the asset owner uses the proceeds from the realisation to put themselves in broadly the same position they were in before. For example, this could include compulsory acquisition by the Crown or destruction or loss of an asset giving rise to insurance proceeds that are then used to replace the compulsorily acquired or destroyed asset. Applying tax in these cases could be considered unfair in terms of horizontal equity as other asset owners will only pay tax if they choose to sell. Example 10 – Realisation outside asset owner’s control A taxpayer owns a hotel building which is torn down following earthquake damage. The building is insured for replacement cost. The insurance company pays the building owner insurance proceeds of $3m which is greater than the taxpayer’s initial $1m cost of the building. The taxpayer uses the proceeds to acquire a similar replacement building for $3m. If there is no rollover, the taxpayer would be taxed on a $2m gain. If rollover treatment applied, the taxpayer would not be taxed on receipt of the insurance proceeds. However, the replacement building would assume the original building’s cost base of $1m, so if the taxpayer subsequently sold the replacement building for $5m they would be taxed a gain of $4m. 54. Under a broad interpretation, the “come home” principle could also apply when a taxpayer has sold an asset and reinvested the proceeds into a similar replacement asset. In this case the gain arguably has not “come home” to the taxpayer because the taxpayer has reinvested the sale proceeds and has not consumed their gain. Rollover treatment in this situation is intended to reduce, in the short term, the “lock-in” biases that may otherwise discourage taxpayers from selling assets that have appreciated in value and reinvesting the proceeds in new assets which may allow them to run their business more efficiently. 22 55. The counter argument to this broad interpretation is that when a person decides to sell an asset for full consideration, that person clearly has a choice as to whether and how they reinvest the proceeds. At that point it is difficult to say that the gain has not “come home”. 56. The fact that the “come home” principle can be interpreted either narrowly or broadly shows it is quite subjective. 57. The Secretariat considers it would be useful if the Group further clarified this principle by referring back to the reasons why it was decided that gains should be taxed on realisation instead of on accrual. The Group’s Interim Report noted the following disadvantages of taxing gains on accrual: • Valuation challenges. An accrual-based tax requires a valuation at the end of each period to identify the gain or loss. Valuations are readily available for widely-traded assets, but it is difficult to impartially value some types of assets (such as closely-held businesses). These valuation challenges will impose much higher compliance costs on the owners of certain types of assets. ... • Cash flow pressures. An accrual-based tax can create cash flow pressures for the owners of assets that do not produce regular streams of cash income. Some owners may even have to dispose of their assets to meet the tax liabilities. The risk of forced disposal could discourage investment in assets with upfront expenses but longer-term returns. • Perceptions of unfairness. An accrual-based tax taxes unrealised gains, which do not necessarily correspond with every person’s understanding of income. 58. Appendix B to the Group’s Interim Report stated the key reasons for applying tax on realisation: At its core, realisation involves the sale of an asset for market value. The purpose of imposing tax on realisation rather than accrual is that it ensures the tax is imposed at a time when the person subject to the tax has the funds to pay it, and when the amount of the gain has been finally determined. However, it is well established that there is a realisation even when the consideration for a sale is in kind rather than cash, and when payment of the consideration is deferred, for a shorter or longer period. This can perhaps be explained on the basis that the seller has a choice as to whether to sell, and if it is concerned about its ability to pay the tax, can either require some immediate cash component or not sell at all. 59. Within this statement there are three reasons for taxing the capital gain at the time an asset is actually sold: • There is an ability to pay the tax from the sale proceeds. • There is accurate measurement of the gain based on the sale price. • The decision to sell is within the taxpayer’s control. 60. The same reasons should be considered when evaluating which situations should qualify for rollover treatment. 23 61. The reasons for not favouring a tax on gains as they accrue are the reverse of the reasons why it is considered acceptable to tax gains that have been actually realised from selling the asset. These reasons are summarised in the table below: Reasons for not taxing on accrual Reasons for taxing as gains are realised Cash flow pressures for assets that do not produce regular streams of cash income creates ability to pay issues and may force sales There is an ability to pay the tax from the sale proceeds Valuation challenges for assets that are not easily valued (e.g. intangibles). There is accurate measurement of the gain based on the sale price Perceptions of unfairness as the decision which triggers the tax is not within the taxpayer’s control The decision to sell is within the taxpayer’s control 62. Another way of presenting these differences is shown in the table below: Rationale for taxing gain Taxing a gain that has accrued Taxing a gain that has been realised on sale Ability to pay tax without a forced sale (cash flow / divisibility of asset)? No Yes Accurate measurement of gain? No Yes Taxing event is within taxpayer’s control? No Yes 63. These cases effectively represent the two ends of a spectrum. The cases where rollover treatment is contemplated are somewhere in the middle of this spectrum — i.e. some, but not all, of the reasons for taxing the gain are present. It may therefore be helpful to consider if the situation more closely resembles a case where the asset- owner has decided to sell the asset to a third party or a case where the asset-owner has decided to hold onto an asset in considering whether a particular situation justifies rollover treatment. It will also be important to consider the implications of any choice on how this helps or hinders the government in delivering on key objectives behind the ETCI reform. 64. The table in the Appendix shows which reasons for preferring taxation on realisation (ability to pay, accurate valuation, within taxpayer’s control) are made out for each situation in which rollover is being contemplated. 65. We note for the avoidance of doubt that in some areas, the current income tax does tax on an accrual basis. For a zero-coupon bond (a bond that pays no interest but increases in capital value over time), gains are taxed on accrual because if they were 24 not, the tax treatment of a zero-coupon bond would incentivise the use of that financial instrument over other, closely-substitutable assets (e.g. a compound interest loan). While there is no cash to pay the tax that is due, the gain could have reasonably been foreseen when entering into the financial arrangement. 3.3 Other “public policy” reasons for rollover treatment 66. There is a risk that allowing rollover for “public policy” reasons would open the door to lobbying for more and more rollover situations. This could lead to “ad hoc rollovers” that do not reflect sensible tax policy, which was one of the Group’s concerns in the Interim Report. The Secretariat therefore recommends that a high hurdle needs to be met before rollover is allowed. 67. The Secretariat considers there are two situations where rollover may be justified on public policy grounds: • Relationship property divisions (discussed in Chapter 8); and • Māori collectively-owned assets (discussed in Chapter 9). 25 4. No change in ownership in substance 68. This Chapter discusses why rollover treatment may be justified for business transactions that result in a realisation of assets but no change in ownership in substance of the underlying assets. 4.1 Business transactions with no change in ownership in substance 69. Such transactions may include: • Incorporation by a sole trader. For example, a sole trader decides to incorporate a company and put their business assets into the company. • Transfers within a wholly-owned group. • De-mergers. These are equivalent to intra-group transfers within a wholly- owned group. 70. The key reason for rollover in these situations is economic efficiency. The “lock- in” effect may otherwise prevent an economically efficient restructuring (e.g. where a sole trader decides to incorporate a company). Lock-in may be more significant in the case of restructuring, since many restructurings involve legal realisations of many or all of a taxpayer’s assets. If rollover is not allowed in these sorts of situations, there may be significant taxes on firms that have not initially structured themselves in the most sensible ways. This creates unnecessary and undesirable traps for the unwary. 71. Integrity risks will, however, need to be considered in designing any rollover treatment to ensure that it does not create any avoidance opportunities. In particular, business restructurings that qualify for rollover treatment should not include what are, in substance, dividend substitution arrangements. Alternatively changes could be made to the dividend rules to catch the arrangements that are not caught by the tax avoidance provisions. 4.2 Secretariat recommendation 72. The Secretariat recommends that rollover treatment should apply to business reorganisations where the ownership of the assets being realised has not changed in substance, provided integrity concerns are addressed. As shown below, only one of the reasons for taxing on realisation rather than on accrual applies. REASON FOR TAXING ON REALISATION No change in ownership in substance and no consideration – business transactions Ability to pay tax No – suggests a case for rollover Accurate valuation No – suggests a case for rollover Taxing event within taxpayer’s control Yes Secretariat recommendation Rollover 26 5. Certain involuntary events 73. This Chapter considers whether there should be rollover treatment in certain circumstances where a taxpayer involuntarily realises an asset and reinvests the proceeds in a similar replacement asset. 5.1 Qualifying involuntary events 74. Examples of involuntary events that could qualify for rollover treatment include: • Land taken under the Public Works Act 1981. • Assets destroyed by a natural disaster or similar event. In this case there will be a gain if any insurance proceeds or other compensation exceed the asset’s cost base. 75. It should be noted, that there are many other circumstances where taxpayers might claim an asset sale was involuntary in some sense. Selling assets may be involuntary for those who face a cash flow crisis. Market events may also trigger an involuntary realisation of an asset. 76. For example, shares may be compulsorily acquired by a controlling shareholder who has reached a threshold shareholding. This sort of event is a normal commercial risk that can be expected when a person acquires shares, and the argument that rollover treatment is necessary to prevent horizontal inequities with other shareholders is not as strong. Generally, compulsory acquisition occurs in a context where everyone in the company either sold, or has to sell at the same time. Accordingly, there is no comparison to a taxpayer who has not sold their shares. 77. Moreover, the Secretariat proposes that one of the conditions for rollover (discussed below) is to require the taxpayer to invest their sale or insurance proceeds in the same type of asset. It would be practically impossible to enforce that in the context of a share. A share in an agricultural company could hardly be said to be similar to a share in a technology company. Even where shares are in companies in the same industry, the taxpayer would acquire a very different “parcel” of ownership rights and liabilities in each case. 78. The Secretariat therefore does not recommend that rollover be extended to a sale during a cash flow crisis or a compulsory share sale in a takeover. This is consistent with the general desire to set a high hurdle before considering rollover treatment. 5.2 Reasons for rollover treatment 79. Rollover treatment for involuntary events may be justified for the following reasons: • Fairness. As noted above, where events are generally outside the taxpayer’s control, it may be seen as unfair from a horizontal equity perspective to tax the taxpayer as other asset owners only pay tax if they choose to sell. Many of 27 these involuntary events also involve some form of misfortune or loss for the taxpayer so it could be perceived as “unfair” for the Government to be profiting from the person’s misfortune. • Integrity. As events are involuntary, taxpayers generally are not able to “cherry-pick” by deferring tax on gains while realising tax losses. Rollover in these situations is unlikely to create a significant integrity risk, which mitigates the need for loss ring-fencing. 80. Arguments against rollover in these circumstances include: • Complexity. Any rollover treatment necessarily requires a degree of complexity. • Efficiency. As events are involuntary, the rollover does not solve any short- term lock-in problems but contributes to longer-term lock-in. 81. The Secretariat recommends that rollover treatment be provided for these involuntary events on the basis of the horizontal equity concerns (a taxpayer with similar assets to another taxpayer being treated more harshly after suffering a natural disaster or compulsory acquisition). 5.3 Reinvestment in similar replacement asset 82. The rationale for allowing rollover treatment for involuntary events is much stronger in cases where the taxpayer reinvests the proceeds from the asset in a similar replacement asset. Allowing rollover treatment in these cases allows the affected taxpayer to choose to remain in the same tax position as if the involuntary event had not occurred. 83. However, if the taxpayer chooses to purchase a different type of asset, they would have effectively made a decision to “exchange” their original asset for a different asset. This is similar to a realisation by sale, so arguably the taxpayer should be treated the same as taxpayers who actually sold an asset. All of this is consistent with setting a high hurdle for allowing rollover treatment. 84. There are two main disadvantages to limiting rollover treatment to the same asset type: • “Lock-in” biases (efficiency). The limitation would create a “lock-in” bias by creating a tax incentive to invest in the same asset, even if another investment makes more commercial sense. • Complexity and compliance costs. Rules and guidance on what assets qualify as a “similar” asset would be required, which adds complexity and compliance costs. 85. It should also be noted that taxpayers affected by the Canterbury and Kaikoura earthquakes were allowed rollover treatment for depreciation recovery income, if 28 they received insurance proceeds exceeding the tax book value of destroyed depreciable assets and acquired a similar replacement item. 86. Overall, the Secretariat recommends requiring the reinvestment to be in the same type of asset as this achieves the objective of putting the asset owner in a similar position to if the involuntary event had not occurred. This is consistent with the rollover treatment for depreciation recovery following the Canterbury and Kaikoura earthquakes. 5.4 Secretariat recommendation 87. The Secretariat recommends rollover treatment where a taxpayer involuntarily realises an asset and reinvests the proceeds in a replacement asset as a result of: • land taken under the Public Works Act 1981; or • assets destroyed by a natural disaster or similar event. 88. The table below illustrates that while there is an ability to pay the tax and an accurate measurement of the gain, the event that gave rise to the tax was completely outside the taxpayer’s control. REASON FOR TAXING ON REALISATION Involuntary disposal, similar replacement asset Involuntary disposal, any replacement asset Ability to pay tax Yes Yes Accurate valuation Yes Yes Taxing event within taxpayer’s control No – suggests a case for rollover Mixed – initial event not in taxpayer’s control but control over divestment Secretariat recommendation Rollover No rollover 29 6. Voluntary sales and reinvestment 89. The previous Chapter discussed involuntary events. This Chapter considers whether rollover treatment should be allowed in cases where the decision to sell the original asset was within the taxpayer’s control and the proceeds of sale are reinvested in a replacement asset. 6.1 Reasons for rollover treatment 90. The main argument for rollover treatment when proceeds from an asset sale are invested into other assets is that it reduces, in the short-term, the “lock-in” biases described in Chapter 2. The lock-in problem only arises when assets have appreciated in value, such as land. Many business assets depreciate. Currently, there can be a lock-in incentive for assets which have depreciated at a slower rate than tax depreciation, because the depreciation deductions are “clawed back”. We do not provide rollover treatment in these cases when assets are sold voluntarily, and in the Secretariat’s view maintaining this position for appreciating assets is the better position given the problems outlined below. 91. A secondary argument for rollover treatment in this situation is that the gain arguably has not “come home” to the taxpayer because the taxpayer has reinvested the sale proceeds and has not enjoyed the benefit of (or “consumed”) their gain. A counterargument is that the rest of the income tax does not rely on the income being consumed, and if capital income taxation is to be extended, the general principles of income taxation should be adhered to where possible. 6.2 Reasons against rollover treatment 92. Many of the negative impacts of rollover treatment generally (outlined in Parts 2.3 and 2.4 of Chapter 2) also apply to rollover treatment for replacement assets: • Efficiency (different “lock-in” biases). While rollover treatment limits short- term lock-in, it exacerbates long-term lock-in. Also, where rollover treatment is limited to “similar assets”, there can be incentives to switch to assets that are less productive than other assets, but come within the restrictions of the rollover treatment (i.e. they are “similar” to the assets disposed of). This can reduce efficiency as discussed in Chapter 2. If rollover treatment is not restricted to “similar assets” then the tax itself would be heavily undermined and might only rarely apply. • Fairness. Horizontal equity will be reduced as taxpayers with the same level of income can have very different tax liabilities, depending on how they choose to invest their asset sale proceeds. The horizontal equity concerns that push in the other direction for involuntary disposals are not relevant where the taxpayer has a choice to defer taxation by not selling. This is also likely to reduce progressivity and vertical equity because wealthier people are more likely to be in a position to reinvest into replacement assets (as opposed to needing the funds to meet other expenses). 30 • Complexity and compliance costs. Identifying situations where rollover treatment is required would increase complexity and compliance costs. • Reduced revenue. The amount of tax revenue raised is likely to be significantly reduced as the tax liability may be deferred until the gain is consumed. US data for individuals from 2011 suggests that providing rollover treatment for “like-kind” exchanges of assets meant that between 5% to 32% (depending the type of asset) of the relevant gains were rolled over as opposed to being taxed in that year (see the earlier table in paragraph 37 of Chapter 2 for more detail). • Integrity risks. Unless additional loss ring-fencing rules are introduced, taxpayers may be able to “cherry-pick” and defer tax on gains while realising tax losses that are used to shelter tax on other income. If there were additional loss ring-fencing rules, this would have negative impacts on the fairness, efficiency and simplicity of the rules. 93. Overall, the Secretariat considers that the arguments for not providing rollover treatment are more convincing. We recommend no rollover treatment for voluntary asset sales which are reinvested in replacement assets as providing rollover in these cases could significantly undermine many of the objectives of the ETCI. 6.3 Qualifying assets 94. If rollover treatment were provided it would be necessary to consider what types of assets could qualify. These options include: • Business premises only. Requiring the original and replacement assets to both be business premises; • Similar replacement asset. Allowing rollover on like-for-like assets where the replacement asset is “similar” to the original asset and both assets are used to conduct the same business activity; or • Any business capital asset. Allowing the relevant business owner to replace any asset with any other business asset including switching into a different type of business activity. Business premises and similar replacement assets 95. As explained above in Chapter 2, while rollover treatment for business premises or similar replacement assets may promote efficiency by reducing a taxpayer’s disincentive to upgrade to a more productive asset, it can also create “lock-in” into an asset class. The “lock-in” into a particular asset class will reduce efficiency if investment in another asset class would have been more productive. 96. The efficiency effects of rollover treatment for business premises or similar replacement assets are therefore uncertain. If rollover is provided, the question arises of why it should not also extend to any other capital business asset. But going 31 in this direction would mean that ETCI could lead to very long or indefinite deferrals of tax which would compromise the success of the tax in addressing fairness concerns. Any capital business asset 97. If rollover treatment is allowed for any capital business asset, the fairness and efficiency benefits from extending the taxation of capital income would largely be removed. However, the complexities, and inefficiency disadvantages of the tax would remain. 98. This option would create an incentive to reinvest proceeds from a capital asset in another capital asset, whereas in some cases it may make more commercial sense to apply the proceeds to business expenses (e.g. wages, research and development, trading stock) or to repay debt, rather than to another capital asset. 6.4 Cost base allocation of replacement asset 99. One complexity is how to allocate the cost base of the prior asset when several new assets are purchased. A possible formula is: Capital gain attributable to replacement asset = disregarded capital gain x receipts expended on replacement asset receipts expended on all replacement assets Example 11 – Rollover for any capital business assets Capital Co. has developed a valuable patent with a cost basis of $1m. It sells the patent for $6m. The capital gain on the patent is $5m. Assume there is rollover treatment for any capital business assets bought with the proceeds. Capital Co. purchases new premises for $1m, and spends $2m on a minority stake in a small competitor it may want to eventually acquire. It purchases a bond that pays interest for $3m. As the bond pays interest and is not expected to make a capital gain, it does not qualify for rollover treatment. $3m of gain is crystallised and taxed. $2m is rolled over into the new assets. In other words, it is not taxed, and the premises and shares have a basis of $1m in aggregate. If the capital gain from the patent were allocated to the new assets in accordance with the above formula, $0.667m will be brought to account if and when the new premises are sold, and $1.33m will be brought to account if and when the shares are sold. 6.5 Other conditions for rollover 100. If rollover is provided for voluntary sales, the Secretariat recommends: • taxpayers should be required to acquire “replacement” assets within specified time periods (e.g. 1 to 2 years); and 32 • rollover should not be provided to taxpayers who trade or deal in the taxable assets. A distinction will need to be drawn between “traders” and other owners of assets. Such a distinction could be based on some or all of existing sections CB 1 to CB 5 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and relevant case law. This would reduce (or eliminate) any simplification benefits of an ETCI. 6.6 Secretariat recommendation 101. The Secretariat considers that extending rollover treatment to voluntary sales and reinvestment of business assets would substantially negate the benefits of ETCI. We recommend no rollover treatment for voluntary asset sales which are reinvested in replacement assets. As shown in the table below, most of the reasons for taxing on realisation rather than on accrual apply to these options. REASON FOR TAXING ON REALISATION Voluntary sale, business premises Voluntary sale, similar replacement asset Voluntary sale, any capital business asset Ability to pay tax Yes Yes Yes Accurate valuation Yes Yes Yes Taxing event within taxpayer’s control Yes Yes Yes Secretariat recommendation No rollover No rollover No rollover 33 7. Death and gifting events 102. A gift is a transfer for no consideration. Gifts may take place during a taxpayer’s life or on their death (for simplicity, when this paper uses the term “gifts” it is referring to gifts made while a person is alive). This Chapter sets out separately the Secretariat recommendations for: • Transfers of qualifying illiquid assets on death; • Transfers of other assets on death; • Gifts of qualifying illiquid assets; and • Gifts of other assets. 7.1 Consistent tax treatment for gifts and transfers on death? 103. In the Interim Report the Group suggested that the tax treatment for transfers on death should be consistent with the treatment of gifts during a taxpayer’s lifetime. Any distinction between the two could lead to unnecessarily complex tax planning and economic inefficiencies. 104. However, a key difference between gifts and transfers on death is that death is not typically an event the taxpayer can control, whereas gifting is. If rollover treatment was allowed for gifts to close relatives, the rollover rules would effectively need to override any other associated persons rule which would otherwise treat the transfer as occurring at market value for tax purposes. 105. There are good reasons for such associated persons rules. Non-market value transfers can be used to exploit asymmetrical tax positions of the transferor and transferee. For example, if rollover treatment applied to gifts of shares, a taxpayer may be able to gift appreciated shares to an associate on a lower tax rate (e.g. a spouse, child or company) before the share is sold, so that the gain is realised by the person on the lower tax rate. Gifts to non-natural persons 106. Avoidance opportunities could be increased if rollover treatment applied to gifts to non-natural persons. For example, taxpayers could gift appreciated assets to an associated company before realising the asset to take advantage of a lower tax rate, or to a company with accumulated tax losses that could not otherwise be used. Example 12 – Gift to associated company on lower tax rate Stan owns 90% of the shares in Dormant Co, and his wife owns the remaining 10%. Stan’s marginal tax rate is 33%. Stan wishes to realise his share portfolio, which has a current market value of $1m (cost base $200,000). If Stan sells his portfolio, he will derive a taxable gain of $800,000 and pay tax of $264,000. 34 If rollover were allowed for gifts to any person, Stan could gift his portfolio to Dormant Co and Dormant Co could sell the portfolio. Dormant Co’s gain is taxed at the lower corporate rate of 28%, so it only pays tax of $224,000. The difference of $40,000 (from the 5% differential in the company and top marginal tax rate) will not be taxed until the sales proceeds are distributed to Stan. Example 13 – Gift to company with accumulated losses Jasmine owns 100% of the shares in her failed start-up Loss Co. Loss Co has accumulated tax losses of $100,000 and no prospect of recouping its losses. Jasmine’s friend, Mary, owns a rental property with a market value of $300,000 (cost base $200,000). Her tax rate is 33%. If Mary sells her property, she will derive a taxable gain of $100,000 and pay tax of $33,000. Her after tax sales proceeds will be $267,000. If rollover were allowed for gifts to any person, Mary could gift her property to Loss Co and Loss Co could sell the property. Loss Co derives a gain of $100,000 but offsets this against its accumulated losses so it does not pay any tax. Loss Co keeps $20,000 and returns the balance of the sale proceeds ($280,000) to Mary. Although the transfer of sale proceeds back from Loss Co should mean the initial transfer from Mary to Loss Co is not a gift, the transfer of sale proceeds may not be disclosed, or the transaction could be structured so that there is no clear link between the two transactions. 107. Although anti-avoidance rules could counter some forms of abuse, rollover treatment would put pressure on these rules to protect the tax base. It may also be difficult to design anti-avoidance rules for circumstances which may be complex and unforeseen. Secretariat recommendation 108. Avoidance opportunities could be mitigated if rollover treatment were limited to transfers on death. This would create an incentive to hold strongly appreciated assets until death, rather than transferring them at a more convenient time in their life, which is a trade-off the Group will have to consider. 109. If rollover for gifts is allowed, the Secretariat recommends that it be confined to gifts between a natural person and another natural person and gifts between natural persons and some specified non-natural persons that are less likely to pose an avoidance risk (e.g. Māori entities and possibly some family trusts). 7.2 Transfers of assets on death — qualifying illiquid assets 110. Rollover treatment may be justified for bequests of certain illiquid assets on complexity and compliance cost and efficiency grounds: • Complexity and compliance costs. As some illiquid assets are not easily valued, it could be costly and difficult to identify the market value at which the transfer is deemed to take place. • Efficiency. If tax applied to transfers of illiquid assets on death, the deceased’s estate may not have the funds to pay the tax. Cash flow difficulties could result 35 in very inefficient outcomes. For example, an operating family business may need to be wound up because tax needed to be paid after an owner has died. 111. The complexity and efficiency disadvantages in taxing illiquid assets are mostly caused by difficulties with accurate valuations and ability to pay. These are two of the reasons why taxing on realisation was preferred over taxing on accrual. 112. To mitigate these concerns, the Secretariat suggests that rollover treatment should apply to transfers of certain illiquid assets on death. Qualifying illiquid assets 113. The complexity and efficiency disadvantages outlined above do not apply to all assets. When assets are liquid and readily divisible (e.g. shares), the estate may sell off some of the assets to fund the tax. If assets are not divisible (e.g. land), the estate may be able to borrow against the assets on a secured basis to pay the tax, and assets could be passed on to beneficiaries subject to the debt. 114. To ensure rollover treatment is not extended to unintended cases, there should be a defined list of qualifying illiquid assets. This list should include assets where imposing tax could cause ability to pay or valuation issues, and may include: • shares, land and other assets in active unlisted companies and unincorporated businesses; 1 and • land whose legal nature means it is very difficult to sell or use as security for a loan (e.g. interests in Māori freehold land). 115. The list of qualifying illiquid assets should not include assets that can be readily valued and may be divisible or borrowed against to fund the tax, such as: • shares in listed companies; • rental properties; • holiday homes; or • any other land or commercial property which was rented or held outside the context of a business whose assets qualify for rollover treatment. 116. Some rules would be required to ensure that taxpayers could not convert liquid assets into “qualifying illiquid assets” by, for example, holding a share or rental portfolio in a private company. 117. The reason non-business land should not be treated as a qualifying illiquid asset is because land valuations are common and relatively reliable. The market for most 1 This paper does not deal with the question of whether there should be a de minimis for small business tax gains. That will be considered elsewhere. 36 land is more liquid than for most businesses, and it is more easily able to be borrowed against. This is all part of making ETCI as broad as possible. 118. Farms and farmland could fall on either side of this list. In many cases, the land will be easier to value and sell than other businesses (the value of farms is more likely to be attributable to the land than any goodwill generated by the particular owner at any given time). From another perspective, farms are small businesses and it may be seen as unfair to single them out as being more ‘liquid’ than other businesses and so taxed on death. Overall, the Secretariat considers there is a better argument to treat farmland as an illiquid asset (so long as it is owned by an active business that is unlisted or unincorporated). 119. The proposed distinction between qualifying illiquid assets and other assets may create other distortions, including a disincentive to list a private company publically. However, in the context such a decision, other factors are likely to be of much greater importance than the tax treatment of gains when shareholders die. 120. It should be noted that some countries including Canada and South Africa provide very limited rollover on death, 2 and allowing rollover for ‘qualifying illiquid assets’ could reduce vertical equity. Gains accruing to some of the wealthiest New Zealanders may be as gains in the value of unlisted companies, which may not end up being taxed on death. There may also be other ways of addressing valuation and cash flow concerns, such as using accounting values or allowing any tax payments to be deferred. Secretariat recommendation 121. The Secretariat considers that on balance, rollover treatment should apply to transfers of qualifying illiquid assets on death. 122. The Secretariat considers that whether to allow rollover treatment for certain illiquid assets is a borderline decision. While the Secretariat is conscious of the impact such a rule may have on vertical equity, we recognise that valuation problems and ability to pay are significant concerns. To mitigate these concerns, the Secretariat suggests on balance that rollover treatment should apply to transfers of qualifying illiquid assets on death. 2 In Canada there is only rollover on death for: Transfers to spouses or common-law partners; and Transfers of farm, forests or fishing assets made to the deceased’s child (or step-child or grandchild). South Africa provides rollover for a very small lifetime de minimis of R1.8m ($192k NZD) of capital gains from active assets of small businesses that have less than R10m ($1.07m NZD) of total assets. This de minimis applies upon death or retirement (aged over 55 or sick) of the small business owner / operator. South Africa also provides rollover for any assets transferred to a surviving spouse. 37 123. The Secretariat does not consider that rollover treatment in these situations should depend on the relationship of the recipient to the transferor, as the complexity and efficiency concerns above apply regardless of the relationship. 7.3 Transfers of other assets on death 124. As the list of qualifying illiquid assets should include assets where imposing tax could cause ability to pay or valuation issues, the reasons for rollover treatment on death do not apply to transfers of other assets where these issues do not arise. There may, however, be other reasons for rollover of other assets depending on the recipient’s relationship with the deceased. 125. Possible recipients may include: • The spouse, civil union or de facto partner of the deceased; • Other natural persons for whom the deceased has natural love and affection (e.g. children, grandchildren, parents); or • Any other person (e.g. a related company, a friend, unrelated charity or organisation). 126. The fairness, efficiency and revenue impact considerations point against rollover treatment for transfers of other assets on death generally: • Fairness and vertical equity (progressivity). Rollover treatment for transfers of other assets on death is likely to make the tax system less progressive. Wealthier taxpayers are much more likely to bequeath and inherit assets so any ability to defer tax on these events will be of most benefit to them. Furthermore, people who are less wealthy are more likely to sell assets soon after receipt to pay for expenses (see Example 14 below). In contrast, wealthy people tend to have more diversified portfolios so wealthy families may be able to pass down assets for many generations without the assets being taxed. • Efficiency. Allowing rollover treatment for transfers on death is economically inefficient, as it increases “lock-in” biases. Taxing gains accrued up to the date of death ensures that capital gains cannot be deferred for longer than a taxpayer’s lifetime. By re-setting the cost base of the assets, taxing on death reduces lock-in biases for future transactions (by making it less unattractive for the new owner to sell the asset) and reduces the economic inefficiency of a realisation-based tax. Because death cannot be avoided, there is no “lock-in” issue for a death-based realisation. • Revenue impact. Rollover treatment for gifts and transfers on death is likely to reduce the amount of revenue raised by the tax significantly. 38 Example 14 – Rollover treatment on death and impact on vertical equity Craig inherits several rental properties, a holiday home and shares from his father. These assets are worth $5m of which $2m unrealised gains. As Craig has a well-paying job and is financially secure he does not need to sell any of these inherited assets. Providing rollover treatment on death means that up to $660,000 of tax ($2m taxed at 33%) is deferred until the assets are sold. The deferred tax also creates “lock-in” by discouraging Craig from selling any of the inherited assets, such as the holiday home, in order to invest in other assets such as shares which have higher pre-tax returns. Craig continues to hold the assets until he dies in 20 years’ time. His daughter Rosie inherits the assets which she holds for another 10 years before she sells all of the assets. At that time tax is finally paid on the unrealised gains. Tax has been deferred for 30 years due to the rollover treatment. In contrast, Mary inherits a share portfolio worth $80,000 from her mother of which $50,000 is unrealised capital gains. Mary needs to sell all of these shares immediately to meet expenses and pay off debts. If Mary has no other income she will pay tax of $8,020 on the $50,000 of capital income she realises from selling the shares. Because the rollover treatment provided 30 years of deferral in the first case involving Craig and none in the second case involving Mary, providing rollover on death is likely to provide bigger benefits to those who are able to continue to own the assets for a considerable period of time. These examples illustrate how the benefit (and corresponding fiscal cost) of providing rollover treatment on death will be predominantly enjoyed by wealthier individuals who inherit more assets and are less likely to need to sell those assets. Less wealthy individuals may not receive much or any benefit from the rollover. 127. The negative impacts of allowing rollover treatment for transfers on death are lessened if it is confined to transfers on death to spouses, civil union and de facto partners. There is less potential for such rollover to defer the taxing point for a very long period, compared to rollover for transfers to a taxpayer’s children. As such, it is less likely to increase “lock-in” biases and would be less inefficient. If rollover is limited to transfers to spouses and partners, it is also less likely to significantly reduce vertical equity or tax revenue. 128. Another reason for allowing rollover for transfers to surviving spouses or partners is because rollover should also apply to relationship property settlements (see Chapter 8). A relationship property settlement under the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 can occur on the break-up of a relationship, and also on the death of a spouse or partner. For consistency of treatment and simplicity, it is proposed that rollover should apply to all transfers on death to surviving spouses or partners. Secretariat recommendation 129. The Secretariat recommends rollover treatment should apply to transfers of any asset on death to a taxpayer’s spouse, civil union or de facto partner. 130. The Secretariat does not recommend rollover treatment for transfers on death to other persons (other than for qualifying illiquid assets, as noted above). 39 7.4 Gifts of qualifying illiquid assets 131. If rollover is allowed for transfers of qualifying illiquid assets on death, rollover on gifts of those assets could also be considered. Rollover on gifts of qualifying illiquid assets would enable a taxpayer to pass on these to the intended recipients during their lifetime. This would reduce “lock-in” of waiting until death, by allowing the relevant assets to be transferred at more economically efficient or personally desirable points in time. 132. However, allowing rollover on gifts of qualifying illiquid assets could create avoidance opportunities. For example, a taxpayer wanting to sell 5% of the shares in their closely-held start-up to a third party could gift those shares to their spouse on a lower marginal tax rate and have the spouse sell them. These risks are explained further at Part 7.1 above. This is a trade-off that the Group will have to consider. 133. On balance, the Secretariat recommends there should be no rollover for gifts of qualifying illiquid assets. 7.5 Gifts of other assets 134. The Secretariat does not recommend rollover for transfers on death of other assets, so there does not appear to be any reason to allow rollover for gifts of those assets. In addition, rollover treatment on gifts creates avoidance opportunities (see Part 7.1 above). The Secretariat recommends there should be no rollover for gifts of other assets. 7.6 Trusts 135. As settlements on trusts are a type of gift, rollover can also apply to settlements on trusts. However, the rollover rules would need to ensure that trusts cannot be used to avoid what would otherwise be a realisation without rollover. 136. The Secretariat recommends that where the terms of the trust are such that the treatment would necessarily apply if the gifted property had instead moved directly from the settlor to the trust beneficiaries, rollover should apply to both the settlement into and distribution out of the trust. This general principle should be subject to anti-avoidance rules to ensure trusts are not used to avoid realisations. 7.7 No rollover for transfers to non-residents 137. When the recipient of the asset is a non-resident, the effect of the transfer is generally that, unless the asset is New Zealand land or business assets of a New Zealand permanent establishment, New Zealand loses the right to tax any gain on the asset. Accordingly, rollover treatment should not be provided on transfers of assets to non-residents if New Zealand would otherwise be unable to apply the tax the gains that accrued while the asset was held by a New Zealand resident. 40 138. This would be consistent with treating migration as a realisation event and applying the tax when an asset-owner becomes non-resident. This issue will be further considered in the upcoming session on international tax and migration scheduled for 8-9 November. 7.8 Consistent treatment of revenue account property and taxable capital assets 139. The Secretariat considers the tax treatment of transfers on death and gifts should apply equally to revenue account property and taxable capital assets for reasons of fairness, efficiency and simplicity. 7.9 Secretariat recommendations 140. The Secretariat’s recommendations are summarised in the table below. The table shows there is a stronger case for applying rollover treatment on transfer on death and gifts of qualifying illiquid assets. 141. The Secretariat considers that fairness, integrity and revenue impact considerations point against rollover treatment for gifts made while a taxpayer is alive. Integrity concerns are particularly pronounced for gifts to non-natural persons (e.g. companies) and are less strong for transfers on death. RATIONALE FOR TAXING ON REALISATION Death, qualifying illiquid asset Gift, qualifying illiquid asset Death, other asset, to spouse/ partner Death, other asset, to other person Gift, other asset Ability to pay tax No – suggests a case for rollover No – suggests a case for rollover Yes Yes Yes Accurate valuation No – suggests a case for rollover No – suggests a case for rollover Yes Yes Yes Taxing event within taxpayer’s control No – suggests a case for rollover Yes No – suggests a case for rollover No – suggests a case for rollover Yes Secretariat recommendation Rollover No rollover Rollover No rollover No rollover 41 8. Relationship property divisions 8.1 Reasons for rollover 142. Rollover treatment may be justified for relationship property divisions and settlements under the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 (“PRA”), on the grounds that it is undesirable for a tax to disincentivise people leaving unhappy relationships. 143. In addition, a division of relationship property can sometimes be similar to cases where legal ownership of assets has changed, but not the ownership in substance. Such a division does not increase the taxpayer’s ability to pay the tax, nor does it provide an accurate valuation of the asset. In that sense, taxing divisions of relationship property faces many of the same drawbacks as taxing on accrual. 144. Moreover, from a horizontal equity perspective, the taxpayer may not have chosen to leave their relationship and, even if they did, they cannot be said to have “realised” their assets in the way that asset owners normally choose to realise their assets (i.e. by sale). Providing rollover in these situations is also unlikely to have a significant impact on revenue or integrity. 145. The Secretariat recommends that rollover treatment apply to transfers made in a relationship property settlement. This is consistent with subpart FB of the Income Tax Act 2007 which currently applies to “property transferred on a settlement of relationship property” (which includes court orders). Example 15 – Relationship property settlement Cersei and Robert are married and own the following assets as “relationship property”: • $250,000 rental property in Robert’s name (cost base of $200,000); • $300,000 excluded home, held jointly. Cersei also has a cash inheritance of $100,000 which she holds as separate property. Cersei and Robert break up, and Cersei receives sole ownership of the excluded home while Robert retains the rental property in his name. To make up the $50,000 difference between the two properties, Cersei also gives Robert $25,000 in cash. Rollover should apply to all the transfers, so there is no taxable gain or loss to Cersei or Robert. 8.2 Limits on rollover to spouses and partners 146. The tax system normally operates on an individual basis and treats the spouses or partners in a couple as two separate taxpayers. Income splitting between spouses and partners is not permitted. 147. If rollover applied to transfers between spouses or partners more generally (i.e. outside the context of a relationship property settlement), couples could effectively split income from capital sales by ensuring that sales are realised by the spouse or partner with the lower tax rate. 42 Example 16 – No rollover outside of a relationship property settlement Tyrion and Shae are in a de facto relationship. Tyrion wishes to sell some of his shares in Listed Co, market value of $50,000 and cost base of $30,000. Shae is in a lower tax bracket than Tyrion, so Tyrion decides to gift his shares to Shae so that the gain on sale is taxed at a lower rate. If there is no rollover, Tyrion will be deemed to have sold his shares to Shae for $50,000 as Shae is associated person. Tyrion will be taxed on a gain of $20,000. If rollover applies, Tyrion will not be taxed on the share transfer and Shae’s cost base in the shares will be $30,000. If Shae sells the shares some of the gain will be taxed at a rate lower than Tyrion’s. 148. Accordingly, when a transfer is made outside the context of a relationship property settlement, rollover should not apply unless the transfer falls within a separate exception, such as those discussed in Chapter 7. 8.3 Secretariat recommendation 149. The Secretariat recommends that rollover applies to transfers between spouses, civil union or de facto partners (or former partners) in connection with a relationship property settlement. REASON FOR TAXING ON REALISATION Relationship property settlements Ability to pay tax Mixed (depends on liquidity of asset) Accurate valuation Mixed (depends on liquidity of asset) Taxing event within taxpayer’s control Mixed Secretariat recommendation Rollover 43 9. Māori collectively-owned assets 150. As previously set out in the Secretariat’s paper Extending the taxation of capital income: implications for Māori collectively-owned assets, the Crown has a specific obligation under the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi to understand the impact of proposed policy changes for Māori, to consider how any negative or unintended effects might be mitigated, and to balance consideration of any impacts for Māori with broader public policy objectives. 151. This Chapter explores how Māori collectively-owned assets might be treated under the rollover treatment principles discussed in this position paper. This commentary is preliminary and is only intended to raise the relevant issues. Further analysis on this subject, including insights from Te Ao Māori perspectives, will be provided following the planned engagement hui as part of the future Secretariat paper on the Māori asset base. Officials are also consulting the Office of Treaty Settlements (Ministry of Justice) as part of this work. 9.1 Reorganisation and asset transfers 152. Chapter 4 recommended that rollover treatment should be provided to business reorganisations that would cause a realisation of an asset but which do not result in a change in the asset’s ownership in substance. This would help to ensure that taxation is not an obstacle to the implementation of an efficient restructure of business assets. 153. We understand that some Māori organisations are structured using a combination of companies, charitable entities, and limited partnerships within one wholly-owned group. An organisation that is structured in this way (e.g. the Post-Settlement Governance Entity example below) will be able to access business reorganisation rollover treatment for a reorganisation of its assets to achieve its strategic objectives. 44 154. However, the Secretariat is also aware that this rollover treatment principle may not apply depending on the characteristics of the Māori organisation in question. For instance, there are groups that operate collaboratively according to whakapapa relationships (iwi and hapū) rather than relationships formalised through legal status. Asset transfers within such groups would result in a change of ownership in substance, and no rollover treatment would be available under the business reorganisation principle. Officials are engaging with Māori collectives to further understand Māori organisational structures and transactions. 155. The Secretariat is also aware of the asset reorganisation that can occur following Treaty settlement. Under a settlement, assets are transferred from the Crown to the PSGE, due to the Crown’s policy of negotiating with large natural groups (which is sometimes contrary to Māori preference). Following this settlement, assets will often be transferred to different holding entities according to the needs of the various assets and the particular nature of the group. To the extent that such a transfer results in an actual change in an asset’s ownership in substance (for example, a transfer from iwi to hapū), there may be taxation implications. 156. Where business reorganisation rollover treatment does not apply, there may still be merit in rollover treatment which recognises the nature of the Treaty settlement process and the reorganisation of settlement assets into related groups (hapū) following settlement. This could take the form of a specific post-settlement rollover approach that is time-limited. 9.2 Voluntary sales and reinvestment 157. Chapter 6 recommends that no specific rollover treatment should be provided for voluntary sales where the proceeds are reinvested in replacement assets. 158. The consideration of rollover treatment and the sale and reinvestment of Māori collectively-owned assets will depend on the Group’s decisions in this area. If the Group wishes to provide wider rollover treatment than is recommended by the Secretariat, then this will naturally extend to at least some of the transactions that Māori groups will undertake. 159. For instance, an iwi that is gifted land by the Crown under a Treaty settlement may wish to sell that land in order to purchase a different parcel of land of special cultural value that was not part of the iwi’s settlement package (e.g. because it was not in Crown ownership at the time of settlement). Wide rollover treatment for voluntary sale and reinvestment would likely mean that extending the taxation of capital income does not place an additional tax hurdle on an iwi group carrying out such a transaction. 160. In consultation, Officials intend to find out more about the types of transactions that Māori groups undertake which would not be included by such a broad rollover treatment principle. 161. A narrower rollover approach that does not provide any tax relief for voluntary sales and subsequent reinvestment would have an impact on Māori groups that are 45 intending to carry out transactions to restore their historic base. In the simple example of iwi land sale and reinvestment described above, extending the taxation of capital income would constrain the iwi’s ability to regain control over ancestral land that was lost through Crown action. From one perspective, this is little different from the constraint that arises through taxing other income from capital (e.g. income tax on rental income, dividends, and interest) that Māori groups own. However, another perspective is that the lock-in incentives created by a realisation- based tax in effect create a tax system that disincentivises switching to otherwise- preferred assets, including ancestral land. 162. A potential justification for rollover is the arbitrary nature of asset receipt through Treaty settlement; the Crown can only provide redress to iwi using the assets that it owns. In order to recover assets of special importance not included in a settlement, Māori groups may enter into transactions which would not be undertaken had those assets been available to the Crown at the time of Treaty settlement. While these transactions are voluntary, they are carried out from a position that is uncontrolled and unintended. 163. Accordingly, in the design of extending the taxation of capital income, there may be a case for a special rollover approach for voluntary sales of Māori collectively- owned assets. It is important that any such approach is consistent with the overall policy intent of extending the taxation of capital income. 164. The nature of reinvestment assets that could be included in such an approach is an important issue that Officials wish to consider further following engagement hui. The following situations are of relevance to this issue: • Reinvesting in an asset under a Treaty settlement right of first refusal; • Reinvesting in assets that are mana whenua assets identified in the Treaty settlement process; and • Reinvesting in other assets of cultural significance within the relevant rohe. 9.3 Māori freehold land 165. In considering extending the taxation of capital income, Māori freehold land is prima facie within the bounds of assets that would be subject to additional taxation upon sale. In reality, and as previously advised, Māori freehold land is rarely sold. The Secretariat paper The excluded home raised the issue of whether the excluded home and Māori freehold land are analogous. The Secretariat will report back to the Group on this issue following the engagement hui. 166. However, extending the taxation of capital income would apply to realisation events other than sale, such as gifting and death. In relation to these realisation events, this paper distinguishes between certain illiquid assets and other assets in considering the merit of rollover treatment. Māori freehold land should be a qualifying illiquid asset due to the legislative restrictions on sale and various practical issues including ownership registers which are often incomplete. Further, 46 the Secretariat considers that shares in Māori freehold land are similarly illiquid because they can generally only be transferred to a preferred class of alienees (based on whakapapa connection). 167. The Secretariat therefore considers that any rollover approach for gifting and death based on the illiquid character of assets should naturally extend to Māori freehold land. Such an approach would be consistent with kaitiakitanga as it would recognise the special nature of Māori freehold land; it is managed collectively for the long-term and not for any one generation of Māori. 47 10. Loss ring-fencing 168. The Group has made the following interim decisions regarding capital losses: • Loss ring-fencing would apply to: o portfolio listed shares and derivatives not already subject to the financial arrangement rules, with losses only able to be offset against capital gains and dividends from these assets; o losses from the sale of interests in attributing CFCs; and o losses arising from non-market transactions. • Losses on land held for private purposes would be denied entirely. 3 169. If the Group decides to recommend more expansive rollover treatment, we recommend additional loss ring-fencing rules. 10.1 Ring-fencing to address integrity risks of extensive rollover 170. Even if rollover treatment is made mandatory, a taxpayer may be able to choose not to apply rollover by ensuring they do not meet the requirements for rollover. For example, if rollover applies to business transactions with no change in ownership in substance and no consideration, a taxpayer could prevent rollover by including a token amount of consideration or creating a small change in ownership percentages. 171. Where a decision on whether to apply rollover is within a taxpayer’s control, it creates an integrity risk that should be addressed by loss ring-fencing rules. There is greater integrity risk if the realisation event itself is also in the taxpayer’s control (e.g. in gifts or voluntary sales). In these cases, rollover treatment can create a revenue integrity risk by allowing some taxpayers to defer tax while realising losses. Loss ring-fencing reduces this risk. 172. The relevant loss-ring fencing suggestions for each of the situations in which the Secretariat has recommended rollover are illustrated in the following table: Type of rollover treatment Suggested loss ring-fencing rule Business transactions with no change in ownership in substance and no consideration Required Involuntary events, similar replacement asset Required – a taxpayer may choose not to apply rollover by ensuring their replacement asset is not “similar” enough or that it is not purchased in the prescribed time period 3 The Group has asked for information on how other countries treat losses on land held for private purposes and other private assets. We will report separately on that. 48 Death, qualifying illiquid asset Not required Death, other asset Not required Relationship property divisions and settlements Not required 173. The Secretariat has not provided suggested loss ring-fencing rules for situations where it has not recommended rollover. However, our preliminary view is that if rollover is allowed in those situations, some integrity measures are likely to be required. These may take the form of loss ring-fencing rules, loss denial rules, or other specific anti-avoidance rules. 174. As explained in Chapter 2, providing more expansive rollover treatment, particularly in those cases where it becomes necessary to impose additional loss ring-fencing rules or other integrity measures, will have negative impacts on fairness, efficiency and simplicity objectives of the tax. 10.2 Other reasons for loss ring-fencing apart from rollover 175. There are more general integrity and fiscal reasons for loss ring-fencing, regardless of what decisions are made on rollover. General integrity reasons for loss ring-fencing 176. The Group explained these general integrity reasons in the Interim Report in Appendix B (at paragraphs 101 to 105): Taxing capital gains on a realisation basis raises a particular problem in this respect. Because taxpayers can decide whether or not to sell an asset in a particular year, they can choose to sell depreciated assets in order to accelerate the tax benefit of the loss and retain appreciated assets in order to defer the tax cost. This kind of cherry-picking is particularly problematic: • in the case of fungible assets, where the sale of a depreciated asset to realise a tax loss can be followed immediately by the acquisition of an identical asset. Effectively, the taxpayer can return losses on an accrual basis and gains on a realisation basis; • in the case of traded assets where there is also a traded hedge. Taxpayers can generate a tax loss with very little economic cost or risk by acquiring offsetting assets (for example, a call and a put over the same shares) and selling the asset with a loss just before the end of the year, then selling the asset with a gain just after. This is often referred to as a straddle transaction. The ability to use straddle transactions to generate tax benefits may be diminished in New Zealand to the extent that the assets which would be used in such transactions are financial arrangements and so already subject to comprehensive taxation on some form of accrual basis. In many countries, these issues mean that capital losses are ring-fenced, so that they can only be used against capital gains. For assets that are not fungible, there is of course a real consequence of selling a lossmaking asset, as well as a tax consequence. The seller has given up its exposure to the 49 asset, and thus the chance to recoup its loss. Similarly, a person who retains an appreciated asset is taking the risk that the asset will decline in value. At this stage, the Group proposes that ringfencing of losses apply to: • Portfolio listed shares and derivatives that are not already treated as financial arrangements. Losses should be able to be offset only against capital gains and dividends from such assets. • Land held for private purposes. Such losses should be non-deductible altogether, on the basis that they represent private consumption. • Losses arising from non-market transactions. Fiscal reasons for loss ring-fencing 177. There may be the question of whether capital loss ring-fencing is required more widely to protect government tax revenue in a downturn. There are two main considerations: the potential impact of greater cyclicality of revenues and whether the fiscal risk is manageable in the context of the overall revenue base. 178. The countercyclical nature of the tax (that revenues move in the opposite direction of the business cycle) is generally a benefit in terms of supporting economic stability (enhancing the automatic stabilizers). However, this does require disciplined fiscal management to ensure that the automatic stabilisers are able to fully operate (e.g. government spending does not rise unsustainably when there is an asset price boom that increases revenues temporarily). 179. The effect of ETCI on revenue volatility will depend on the nature of asset price developments, which are inherently uncertain. Further advice on fiscal risk will be provided in the Overview paper in session 21. 5 0 Appendix: Table of potential rollover situations The table below shows the situations in which rollover treatmen t is being considered. It shows whether each reason for preferr ing taxation on realisation (ability to pay, accurate valuation, within taxp ayer’s control) is made out for each situation. When fewer reas ons for taxing on realisation apply to a situation, the case for rollover for that situation is more compelling. However, the factors in the table are only guides as there are other reasons such as fairness, efficiency, and integrity that support rollover even when some of the reas ons for taxing on realisation are made out (e.g. transfers to spouses on death ), and vice versa (e.g. gifts of qualifying illiquid assets). i The tax liability will effectively be borne by the beneficiar ies to the deceased’s estate, who should be able to pay the tax by selling off part of, or borrowing against, any asset they receive from the estate. ii If assets are divisible, the donor could be expected to sell off part of their assets to meet the tax liability. Alternativ ely, if the liquid asset is not readily divisible (e.g. rental property), it could be expected that a donee of a gift substantial enough to raise ‘ability to pay’ issues could help meet the donor’s ta x liability by borrowing against the asset if required iii If rollover treatment is given for involuntary events where the taxpayer acquires a replacement asset, the taxing event in t his case will be in the taxpayer’s control as it will be triggered by the taxpayer’s decision not to acquire a similar r eplacement asset.

Coversheet: SME Compliance Cost Savings Position Paper for Session 21 of the Tax Working Group 26 October, 2018 Purpose of discussion This paper expands on the compliance cost saving initiatives for SMEs that were recommended by the Group in the interim report and discusses some additional items that could be recommended to the Government in the final report. Key points for discussion • Does the Group want to add any further compliance cost reduction recommendations to the list it has already included in the interim report ? • Does the Group want to consider recommending a concession to assist SMEs into using digital technology (such as accounting software) to help them reduce compliance costs ? Recommended actions We recommend that you: a agree to include the three compliance cost reduction suggestions in the interim report in the final report: • increase the threshold for paying provisional tax from $2,500 to $5-$10,000; • increase the threshold for undertaking a closing stocktake from $10,000 to $20- $30,000; and • increase the automatic deduction for legal fees from $10,000 to a higher value and expand the provision to other forms of professional fees, such as accounting fees. b decide whether to include the following further compliance cost reduction suggestions to Government in the final report (as the fiscal position permits): • review the fringe benefit tax regime (FBT) with a view to simplifying the application to motor vehicles and other benefits; • review the entertainment expenditure deduction with a view to either removing or simplifying it; • review the thresholds that currently apply to unexpired expenditure with a view to easing compliance costs for small businesses; • the removal of resident withholding tax on close company dividends and interest with a view to reducing overall compliance costs of these related party transactions. c decide whether to also review the FBT and entertainment tax rules in context of micro and small businesses tax obligations more generally (customer focus approach rather than a tax type focus). d decide whether to recommend to Government that they consider an incentive for taxpayers to adopt digital technology such as cloud based accounting software and assist in the education of small businesses to use that technology.

Conclusion and recommendations 23 6.1 Concluding thoughts 23 Appendix A - suggested text for final report 24 Treasury:3896277v1 5 Executive Summary In its interim report, the Group recommended the Government consider measures to reduce business compliance costs, including increasing the thresholds for: • provisional tax from $2,500 to $5-10,000; • for requiring a year end stocktake from $10,000 to $20-30,000; • the automatic deduction for legal fees from $10,000 and the expansion of that to other types of professional fees. The Government has indicated to the Group that it is interested in what proposals the Group would recommend to reduce compliance costs and has asked them to expand on these in the final report. This paper expands on the proposals in the interim report. It also outlines a number of other items which may reduce compliance costs that the Group may want to include in the final report which have been generated from consultation undertaken by officials. This has included consultation with Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ), the Corporate Taxpayer Group, Accountants Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand (ATAINZ), EY, PwC and focus groups of taxpayers arranged through BusinessNZ. A significant number of changes have recently been made which had the aim of reducing taxpayer compliance costs and, as these have been made in the last two years, they will need time for the benefits to be realised by taxpayers particularly in the area of provisional tax. The Business Transformation programme is also expected to reduce compliance costs of taxpayers significantly and officials have already seen a greater reduction in costs than was originally estimated. Compliance cost reduction is also a focus across government in general and there are a number of key initiatives being run by the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE) including e-invoicing and the New Zealand Business Number (NZBN). The Government has also recently formed a Small Business Council which has been tasked with developing a small business strategy including tax policy which will have a focus on reducing compliance costs overall. Further items that the Group could consider recommending to Government to reduce compliance costs for business include: • reviewing the application of Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) in particular on motor vehicles and other benefits; • entertainment – consider whether this adjustment is still appropriate or could be modified; • review the thresholds on unexpired expenditure in line with the other threshold reviews already recommended; Treasury:3896277v1 6 • investigate the removal of resident withholding tax on related party debt by close companies; • suggest the Government incentivise SMEs to better use technology such as accounting packages and ensure that they are educated to use them. These items will need to be subject to consultation with the private sector and the fiscal costs of these measures determined once the final design of the proposals is completed after consultation. Where possible we have given an indication of the fiscal impact of these below, however, a number of the measures’ fiscal impacts will depend on the design or taxpayer behaviour which make it difficult to estimate. Treasury:3896277v1 7 1. Introduction 1.1 Purpose 1. The purpose of this paper is to expand on the SME compliance cost savings proposals recommended by the Group in the interim report. This paper covers those items recommended by the Group and some additional items that could be recommended to the Government in the final report. 1.2 Context 2. The cost of compliance with tax falls disproportionally on smaller taxpayers, who are more likely to lack the systems and knowledge to easily comply with tax obligations. 3. One of the keys to the design of a good tax system is to make it as simple as possible for taxpayers to comply. However, it is inevitable that no matter how easy the system is designed, smaller businesses will always have higher compliance costs compared to those larger businesses where scale makes compliance significantly easier. 4. As part of its recommendations in the interim report, the Group recommended that the Government: • not reduce the company tax rate; • not introduce a progressive company tax; • not introduce an alternative basis of tax for smaller businesses such as a turnover or cashflow tax; • not change the thresholds around depreciation and write off of fixed assets; and • consider other measures to reduce compliance costs for small businesses, dependent on the fiscal position of the government, including increasing the threshold for paying provisional tax, increasing the year-end closing stock adjustment and increase the automatic deduction for legal expenses and expand that to other professional fees. 5. The Ministers of Finance and Revenue have commented on the Group’s interim report, and stated that they are interested in the Group’s finding that reducing compliance costs through the tax system would provide a better approach than a progressive company tax rate. They indicated that they would welcome the Group expanding in the Final Report on what compliance cost reduction options would be beneficial 1 . 1 https://www.beehive.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018- 09/TWG%20letter%20final.pdf Treasury:3896277v1 8 6. Also, as requested by the advisor to the Group, we have included a discussion of a compliance cost saving measure suggested by Federated Farmers in their submissions to the Group relating to resident withholding tax and associated party debt. 1.3 Work to date 7. Recent legislative changes that have reduced compliance costs for smaller businesses include: • removal of use of money interest for most provisional taxpayers who use the standard uplift until the final instalment of provisional tax; • increase of the safe harbour from use of money interest from $50,000 residual income tax 2 to $60,000 and expansion of that safe harbour to companies and trusts; • introduction of a further method to calculate provisional tax using accounting software to pay tax as you earn income called the accounting income method (AIM); • allowing small businesses who provide motor vehicles to shareholder employees to make a private use adjustment instead of paying fringe benefit tax; • increasing the ability of taxpayers to correct errors in their tax returns in the next period; • simplification of the calculation of deductions for dual use vehicles and premises; • removing the requirement to annually renew resident withholding tax exemption certificates; • increasing the threshold for annual FBT returns from $500,000 to $1 million of PAYE/ESCT; • a new short process rulings regime contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill; and • the modification of the 63 day rule for monetary remuneration to reduce compliance costs of calculating that adjustment. 8. However, there are a number of other areas that have been consistenly raised as compliance cost intensive by smaller businesses and the Group has addressed some of these in its recommendations. 1.4 Consultation process 9. In developing those recent changes, officials had undertaken an extensive consultation exercise with interested parties and focus groups which included small business owners. Subsequent to the enactment of those changes, officials again went out looking for a second round of potential compliance cost reducing changes. 2 Residual income tax is the remaining tax liability after tax credits such as PAYE have been taken into account. Treasury:3896277v1 9 10. In this second round of consultation officials obtained “wishlists” from a number of interested parties including Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ), the Corporate Taxpayer Group, Accountants Tax Agents Institute of New Zealand (ATAINZ), EY and PwC. We also undertook a large number of meetings with small businesses that were facilitated by BusinessNZ with the workshops run in conjunction with Iron Duke and Phil O’Reilly. 11. In our appendix F to the paper Potential revenue-reducing options: Position paper for session 14 of the Tax Working Group we summarised the compliance cost reduction possibilities that resulted from those wishlists and workshops. 12. We have also recently held a further workshop with CAANZ to discuss the areas where they see that compliance costs could be reduced for businesses and in particular small businesses. This workshop was held after the due date for this paper and an update on the outcomes from that workshop will be discussed at the next TWG meeting. 1.5 Continuity 13. The changes that have been recently made to provisional tax have been operating for just over a year. This is the first major change to the standard uplift method for a large number of years and officials believe it is important for those changes to bed themselves in as we are aware that taxpayers are still coming to terms with those changes. Those changes to the standard uplift method have been generally welcomed by taxpayers and, although provisional tax is a constant area of criticism by taxpayers those changes should have reduced the pain points associated with provisional tax. 14. It will be interesting to canvass businesses in a year or two to see if provisional tax remains one of the main issues they raise as a compliance issue but it is important to let the changes settle in as taxpayers will, generally, take some time to fully understand them. 1.6 Business Transformation 15. A main goal of Business Transformation is to make it easier for taxpayers to interact with Inland Revenue through more direct communication between taxpayers software and Inland Revenue systems. This has a direct impact on taxpayer compliance costs. 16. Business Transformation is a multiyear programme that is expected to be completed in 2023. Currently GST and FBT are the main tax types which have been transitioned to the new system, and despite some initial transitional issues, taxpayers seem to be interacting with the new technology platform well. 17. Part of the costs incurred by SME taxpayers is having to complete and file forms with Inland Revenue as well as other interactions usually by phone or paper based correspondence. Treasury:3896277v1 10 18. The Business Transformation programme was expected to reduce the time that SME customers 3 spent meeting their tax-related obligations from between 18 and 26 hours per annum. The economic value of that saving was estimated to be $1.3 – $2.3 billion. This represents an overall reduction of effort of 30-42%. 19. These benefits are expected to be fully realised in 2023 once the Business Transformation programme is completed. To date, SMEs have reported reduced compliance efforts from the implementation of new services delivered as part of the programme. The 2016 SME compliance cost survey 4 results indicated that, since 2013, customer effort to meet their GST obligations 5 had reduced by 10 hours which was ahead of the 9 hour estimate for Release One of Business Transformation. 20. It is expected that the entire Business Transformation programme will deliver substantial savings in compliance costs for SMEs by 2023 without creating any distortions or incentives within the tax system, but rather simply making it easier to interact with Inland Revenue. 1.7 All of government response 21. While we continue to look to reduce the impact of tax compliance through simplifying policy settings, Inland Revenue also works closely with other agencies under the “Better for Business” umbrella to improve the overall experience businesses, particularly small businesses, have with government. This includes how we can collectively reduce the effort of meeting regulatory requirements. The Better for Business Customer Experience Index research, shows that the biggest pain points businesses experience when dealing with government are lack of service consistency and co-ordination across agencies. Addressing these is key to freeing up business time and effort, improving the experience and increasing productivity. 22. Key initiatives led by MBIE on behalf of government agencies include: • Business.govt.nz - provides information spanning multiple government agencies to businesses. This allows businesses to easily get information they need without looking across individual agency websites. • New Zealand Business Number (NZBN) - all businesses can register for a unique business identifier, and record key business details against that number. Over time this will mean easier and cheaper transacting with other businesses and with government through easy identification and reuse of information. Examples of how this is 3 For these estimates the SME population is considered to be a business taxpayer with five or fewer employees. 4 The full report Better for customers: SMEs’ compliance costs in 2016 is published on IR’s website www.ird.govt.nz/aboutir/reports/research/#07 5 No surveys have been completed since the roll out of Release Two of Business Transformation so these results only reflect the savings from Release One which transitioned GST to the new system. Treasury:3896277v1 11 occurring can be found at https://www.nzbn.govt.nz/about- nzbn/success-stories. • E-Invoicing – using the NZBN, this facilitates easy, accurate and standardised electronic invoicing between software systems. This is likely to lead to significant productivity gains, and reduction in fraud, across the NZ digital transaction space. • Business Connect – addresses the lack of service consistency and co- ordination across government service providers through use of low risk pathways to designing customer-centred digital services, particularly in the repetitive compliance space (e.g., the need for a business to obtain licences, permits, registrations etc.). It provides a consistent user experience spanning local and other government services. Business Connect enables the customer to use and re-use data government holds (e.g., NZBN, LINZ 6 ), previous data they have submitted, and simplifies the process through use of business rules. Prototyping has shown efficiency benefits to the customer ranging from 30 - 90%. • Better Rules / Legislation as code – this recognises the opportunity to develop policy and rules digitally and differently. It explores developing ‘rules as code’ - the rules (legislation, regulations, operational policies) can be understood by computer programs, which improves policy and legislative/regulatory development processes, and therefore service delivery, government transparency and public participation. Examples include use of Tai, an AI digital assistant that supports exporters to navigate across multiple regulative domains (Ministry of Primary Industries and New Zealand Customs), and a review of the Holidays Act using structured business rules. 1.8 Small Business Council 23. Since our previous paper on reducing compliance costs to the Group the Government has also assembled a Small Business Council (SBC) which has been tasked with, among other things, developing a small business strategy which includes tax policy. That process will look to more of a customer-centric viewpoint rather than a tax type focus and so rather than looking at FBT across all businesses look at how compliance costs affects, say, a micro business across all taxes. The SBC’s view is that approach is a preferable way of identifying the cost of compliance. 24. Inland Revenue’s Policy and Strategy has a representative as an advisor to that Council. 6 Land Information New Zealand Treasury:3896277v1 12 2. Increasing the threshold for provisional tax 2.1 Context 25. The provisional tax regime is designed around the premise that people should pay tax as they earn their income along with our PAYE 7 and RWT 8 regimes. Provisional tax is the option for those people who earn income where tax is not deducted at source, such as business income. 26. In general, provisional tax is payable in three equal instalments based on 105% of the prior year’s tax liability (or 110% of the year previous to the prior year where the taxpayer has not filed their tax return for the prior year). The vast majority of provisional taxpayers who are subject to provisional tax use this standard method of calculation. 27. There are a couple of features of the provisional tax system that, in some cases, are perceived to be unfair. The first is that provisional tax assumes that taxpayers earn their income evenly over the year. This is often not the case and many taxpayers have seasonal or volatile income. Secondly, historically the system has applied use of money interest (UOMI) when the instalments paid by taxpayers differed from what they should have paid given their actual liability for the year. 28. Over the past two years a number of adjustments have been made to address these concerns. Firstly, the accounting income method (AIM) was introduced for, generally, businesses that have a turnover of less than $5 million. To a large extent this addresses the seasonality and volatility issues that arise with the current provisional tax methods. 29. Secondly, for most taxpayers who use the standard uplift method, UOMI has been removed from the first two instalments. With a taxpayer’s final instalment of provisional tax being some five weeks after their balance date, at that point, they should have a good understanding of their tax liability for the year and can make a top-up payment, if necessary, which will mean that they are not charged UOMI. 30. In addition, for those earning lower amounts of income, the safe harbour from UOMI was increased from $50,000 of residual income tax to $60,000, and extended to non-individuals, taking some 19,000 taxpayers out of the UOMI rules until their terminal tax date although still requiring them to pay provisional tax during the year. 31. Provisional tax has, historically, constantly ranked as a pain point for smaller businesses. In large part that pain is in actually the paying of provisional tax during the year rather than specific issues with the regime. 32. However, the recent changes have reduced the pain of provisional tax and the application of UOMI to situations that are beyond the control of the taxpayer. It is 7 Pay As You Earn – source deduction payments for salary and wage earners. 8 Resident Withholding Tax – resident withholding tax is deducted from payments of interest and dividends. Treasury:3896277v1 13 important that these changes are given time to bed down to determine if there are any other issues with the regime that could be addressed. 2.2 Policy problem or opportunity 33. Notwithstanding these improvements to the provisional tax regime, one issue with provisional tax that is raised by taxpayers is the level at which provisional tax applies. Currently a taxpayer who has residual income tax of $2,500 or more is a provisional taxpayer. That represents $8,929 of net income for a company and $7,576 for an individual on the top marginal rate. Although these taxpayers are not subject to UOMI because of the application of the safe harbour, they are still required to pay provisional tax. 34. Historically, changes to the provisional tax regime have focused on removing the application of UOMI to taxpayers rather than reducing the number subject to provisional tax. This was on the basis that salary and wage earners have to pay tax during the year, and it was considered that those with income that was not subject to source deduction payments should do the same. 35. The issue is that since the level of residual income tax was reduced from $3,000 to $2,500 in 1991 the threshold has not been revisited and now it applies to what is, in today’s terms, very low levels of income. The compliance costs of calculating, paying and being exposed to UOMI at these levels is disproportionate to the benefit of receiving the tax during the year. For the salary and wage earner at the same level of income there is no compliance cost as their tax obligations are dealt with by their employer. 2.3 Proposal 36. The Group was in favour of increasing the threshold at which taxpayers would be subject to provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000 or $10,000 dependent on the fiscal position of the Government. 37. This would mean that for a company, the amount of non-source deducted income that could be earned before the company became subject to provisional tax would be $17,857 or $35,714 respectively, and for an individual on the top marginal rate $15,152 or $30,303 respectively. 38. Assuming standard balance dates the approximate cost of changing the threshold would be: Threshold Cash Cost Revenue Cost Number of taxpayers First Year Subsequent years First Year Subsequent years 5,000 $355m $3m$3m$3m 97,000 10,000 $1,008m $8m$8m$8m 198,000 Treasury:3896277v1 14 39. This could remove 97,000 or 198,000 taxpayers who earn modest levels of non- source deducted income from paying provisional tax. Such a change is likely to be well received by these smaller taxpayers. 40. However, not receiving funds during a tax year could result in smaller businesses having larger end-of-year payments, and if they have not sufficiently budgeted for this it may result in larger amounts of debt arising which should not be underestimated. This could increase the tension for taxpayers in cashflow management, which may be a particular issue for smaller taxpayers. For example, businesses who have a tax liability of $9,000 will have one payment of $9,000 under a $10,000 threshold rather than three payments of $3,000 spread across the year. 41. There is also a significant cash cost to either of these options which will result in a timing disadvantage to the Government which would need to be considered carefully when the Government makes a decision on any increase in the threshold. Treasury:3896277v1 15 3. Increase the closing stock adjustment threshold 3.1 Context 42. The Income Tax Act 2007 requires taxpayers to value their closing stock at the end of the tax year, as this amount is included in taxable income 9 . However, those taxpayers who have turnover of less than $1.3 million and reasonably estimate the value of their closing stock to be less than $10,000, can use the value of their opening stock as their closing stock for the year 10 . 43. Essentially, this adjustment allows the taxpayer to deduct the cost of their purchases for the year. The $10,000 threshold was last increased from $5,000 with effect from the 2009-10 income year. 3.2 Policy problem or opportunity 44. The current threshold may no longer be appropriate as it means that taxpayers who have relatively low levels of stock continue to have to undertake a stocktake at the end of the year. It may be appropriate to increase that amount to reduce the compliance costs of those businesses that have low levels of stock on hand, but may have high volumes of low value stock. The compliance costs of undertaking a stocktake may be disproportionate to the benefit of having an accurate amount. 45. This concession is not currently compulsory and those businesses who wish to may still undertake a stocktake. Practically, those businesses whose closing stock is less than their opening stock will be adversely affected by using the opening stock value. 3.3 Proposal 46. The Group recommends, subject to the fiscal cost, increasing this stock threshold from $10,000 to $20-$30,000 while leaving the turnover threshold at $1.3 million. This would remove approximately 13–20,000 taxpayers from having to undertake a stocktake at year end although only 5-7,600 would receive a benefit in terms of lower tax paid. At a maximum this could potentially have a maximum fiscal cost of between $28m-64m on the assumption that those taxpayers have stock values at the threshold limit. 47. It is difficult to approximate the level of compliance cost that could be removed from extending the threshold. It is likely, not surprisingly, that those taxpayers with a small number of higher valued stock will incur few costs, whereas a taxpayer who has a large number of small valued stock will be more significant. 9 See section EB 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 10 See section EB 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Treasury:3896277v1 16 4. Increase and expand the automatic deduction for legal fees 4.1 Context 48. A compliance cost measure is contained in the Income Tax Act 2007 11 that allows taxpayers who have low levels of expenditure on legal fees to automatically be given a tax deduction for those fees whether the fees are incurred on capital projects or otherwise. 49. A taxpayer who has up to $10,000 of total expenditure on legal fees (defined as fees for legal services as defined in the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006) provided by a person who holds a practicing certificate issued by the New Zealand Law Society or an Australian equivalent may automatically deduct these fees. This threshold was set in the 2009-10 income year, the year the provision was introduced. 4.2 Policy problem or opportunity 50. There are two issues with this provision, firstly, the threshold may no longer be appropriate for the current economy and, secondly, the breath of the provision is extremely narrow and could be expanded to include other types of expenses such as other professional fees. 51. Officials have considered whether the provision could be expanded to other types of expenditure such as repairs and maintenance, however, we consider that type of expansion will have the same downsides as extending the under $500 fixed asset threshold in that it will have significant fiscal implications and also provide more of a tax incentive rather than a compliance cost saving. 4.3 Proposal 52. The Group recommends, subject to fiscal constraints, increasing the threshold for the automatic deduction of legal fees from $10,000 to a higher amount such as $20- $30,000 and the extension of that concession to other professional fees such as accounting fees. 53. This change will mean that businesses that have relatively low levels of expenditure on professional fees that may not be deductible because they relate to capital projects will not need to analyse that expenditure, and can claim a full deduction for that expenditure. 54. It is difficult to quantify the fiscal impact of such a change, as the level of such expenditure is not easy to isolate from information held by officials. It will also be dependent on how wide the automatic deduction is extended. 11 See section DB 62 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Treasury:3896277v1 17 5. Other compliance costs reduction measures 5.1 Context 55. There are a number of other compliance cost reduction measures that officials have had raised by small businesses as part of our previous consultation and the Group may want to consider whether it wishes to include some of these more wholesale reform items in its final report. 56. These suggested measures will need to be consulted on and, most importantly, the fiscal impact of these changes needs to be understood. For a number of these proposals the fiscal impact will depend on the final design of the proposals for others the impact is difficult to predict as this will depend on taxpayer behaviour. 5.2 Fringe Benefit Tax 57. In officials-facilitated workshops held around the country with medium business owners, the most common issue raised as compliance cost intensive was fringe benefit tax (FBT), particularly FBT on motor vehicles. 58. Comments from the workshops suggested that FBT was hard to comply with, expensive and there were high levels of non-compliance. One of the usual comments was that people understand that costs should not be deductible when they relate to private use but they fail to understand FBT and the concept of “available” for private use. 59. FBT provides a buttress to the PAYE system in ensuring that employers cannot pay employees in benefits rather than cash and avoid taxation. It accounts for approximately $500 million of government revenues but its support of the PAYE system has more value. If FBT did not exist it is likely the revenue from PAYE would diminish significantly. 60. Generally, the costs of complying with FBT are incurred in reducing the amount of FBT payable, particularly around the supply of vehicles to employees. The various exemptions when vehicles are work-related vehicles or are unavailable for private use incur compliance costs in reducing the overall amount of FBT payable to an amount that better reflects the true availability for private use. 61. Another source of compliance costs, in particular for larger businesses, is identifying any benefits that are provided to staff as other benefits, such as gift cards etc. There are significant compliance costs incurred in identifying these transactions through thousands of other transactions. 62. If the Group were to consider the simplification of FBT officials would suggest that two areas which could be further investigated are: Treasury:3896277v1 18 • simplification of FBT on motor vehicles by simplifying the classification of vehicles to more focus on the level of availability for private use 12 to better reflect the private use of the vehicle, removing the exemptions that apply to vehicles 13 and consequently reducing the rates to reflect that the charge would be calculated on a “close enough is good enough” basis which may have over and underpayments compared to actual use; and • simplifying the calculation of FBT on other benefits with a view to reducing the compliance costs of identifying every last benefit provided which may have a private element at the margin, for example increasing the de-minimis threshold may be appropriate. 63. The other two major categories of fringe benefit are subsidised transport and low interest loans. Officials consider there may be a few small things that could be adjusted but it is likely that there are a small number of employers who provide these benefits who would tend to be larger businesses. These employers will have established systems to deal with the calculation of these benefits and this may be less of a priority than motor vehicles and other benefits. 64. The fiscal cost of this measure will depend on the final design but combining a broadening of the number of vehicles and offsetting this by lowering the rates could result in a minimal fiscal impact. 5.3 Simplify the deduction for entertainment 65. The second most raised compliance cost issue is compliance with the restriction on the deduction for entertainment expenditure. 66. Entertainment expenditure is generally only 50% deductible 14 . Entertainment expenditure includes expenditure on: • corporate boxes; • holiday accommodation; • pleasure craft; and • entertainment off the business premises (excluding light refreshments). 67. A number of exclusions apply to those categories. The main exclusions are expenditure on business travel and conferences. 68. In many larger businesses, a “close enough” approach is taken to calculating the entertainment tax adjustment and that is just to take 50% of any expenditure coded to entertainment accounts in their financial statements. Although this might overpay in 12 For example vehicles could be classed into high, medium, low or no availability for private use and be assessed FBT on that basis. 13 Such as work related vehicles, emergency call out vehicles and unavailable for private use days. 14 See section DD1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Treasury:3896277v1 19 connection with some items it will make up for any entertainment expenditure coded to non-entertainment expense accounts. 69. Accurately calculating the deduction, however, can incur substantial compliance costs for larger businesses and also for smaller businesses. 70. Prior to the introduction of the entertainment regime, such expenditure was treated the same as any other type of expenditure in that the normal rules for deductibility and non-deductibility would apply, particularly the prohibition on private expenditure. 71. It may be possible to simplify the entertainment regime or even move it back to normal deductibility principles. The entertainment regime was introduced in the 1990’s when corporate entertainment was a large feature of business. Times may have changed to the extent that businesses are more focused on costs and keep entertainment to a minimum. 72. However, even if the rationale for the regime remains officials consider there may be some redesign of the regime that could result in a reduction in compliance costs and again look to apply more of a “close enough is good enough” approach. 73. Since the entertainment classification in the IR10 was removed in 2012 we do not have current data on the amount of entertainment deduction that is being denied. However, as a rough guide based on IR10 data from 2012 uplifted by GDP, the fiscal cost of removing the income tax and GST adjustment on entertainment at a minimum would be around $100-110 million per year. This is an underestimate as it does not include information from taxpayers who do not file an IR10 which is the majority of the larger corporate taxpayers who are likely to have material amounts of entertainment. 5.4 Review the thresholds for unexpired expenditure 74. In a similar vein to the thresholds for provisional tax, closing stock and legal expenditure, officials consider it may reduce compliance costs for smaller taxpayers to review the thresholds for unexpired expenditure. 75. These thresholds mean that taxpayers can deduct prepayments made up to certain levels without having to apportion those across income years. The main cost which results in apportionment for smaller businesses is likely to be insurance costs which are generally prepaid for a year. 76. Raising some of these thresholds may result in taxpayers not having to undertake apportionment for prepayments which should result in compliance cost savings to them. 77. Again the fiscal cost of this measure is difficult to measure as it will depend on the final design but we do note this will be a timing difference only. Treasury:3896277v1 20 5.5 Resident withholding tax on related party debt 78. The advisor to the Group requested that we also include some discussion of the submission made by Federated Farmers relating to resident withholding tax (RWT) on intra-family transactions. In their submission, Federated Farmers noted that: “There would be reasonable compliance costs savings for SMEs if RWT on SME intra- family entity interest and dividends was abolished. It would be replaced by provisional and terminal tax. We do not think that there would be a fiscal risk in this area.” 79. Officials last looked at the issue of RWT on close company interest and dividends in September of 2015 in an officials’ issues paper on closely held company taxation issues 15 . This review was not specific to farmers but reviewed the issue for all closely held companies. 80. The RWT rate on dividends is a flat 33%. The actual RWT deducted will depend on the level of imputation credits attached to the dividend. The lowering of the company tax rate to 28% means that even fully imputed dividends must have RWT deducted. This creates a compliance burden on companies, and, in particular, closely held companies that pay fully imputed dividends. It also creates over-taxation for corporate shareholders who suffer RWT deductions from fully imputed dividends and for individual shareholders who are not on the top personal tax rate. Any excess RWT then needs to be claimed as a refund when the tax return for the relevant income year is filed, which not only means refund delays but also a compliance burden on those individuals who may not otherwise have had to file a return, or otherwise engage with Inland Revenue. 81. The interest RWT rate varies according to the shareholder’s marginal tax rate. It is common for close companies to pay interest to associated persons. Again, if RWT on this interest did not need to be accounted for there would seemingly be compliance savings for the payer. 82. There would be both compliance cost savings for the paying company and very likely administration cost savings for Inland Revenue with this approach, especially when returns are manually prepared. However, some compliance costs may just be switched from the payer to the recipient although it is likely that compliance costs will reduce overall. Some recipients of the dividends or interest may face increased compliance costs through having to file a tax return or engage with Inland Revenue when they would not otherwise have to do so and/or through having to pay provisional tax when they are currently under the provisional tax threshold. 83. Historically the issue of removing RWT on related party transactions has had significant fiscal costs from the deferral of tax which officials considered outweighed the savings in compliance costs. Some of this deferral is transitional, involving the deferral of tax that would have been paid in the first year of the change as RWT to its 15 Closely held company taxation issues – an officials’ issues paper – Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue and the Treasury – September 2015 Treasury:3896277v1 21 being paid as a combination of terminal tax and higher provisional tax payments in the following year. 84. In the time available, we have not been able to forecast the fiscal impact of such a change to be included in this paper, however, some changes to the way in which tax is accrued for accounting purposes may have reduced these since the last time these were considered. In general, officials consider this may be a worthwhile compliance reduction suggestion subject to the fiscal and cash cost of proceeding. 5.6 Recording expenditure 85. When Inland Revenue conducts surveys of SMEs, the largest effort in compliance by far is the effort required to record information. This is not specific information for tax purposes, as financial information is required for good business management, however, SMEs see this as largely a tax compliance exercise. 86. There are a number of ways in which SMEs can reduce the time it takes to record information with perhaps the most helpful way to reduce costs in this area is using a software accounting package, and using it well. 87. The use of a software accounting package can assist the SME by making the recording of information and categorising of expenses easier than keeping paper records or a manual spreadsheet. The development of artificial intelligence within those products will also assist people who have limited knowledge of accounting to classify expenses. 88. Software products also have the benefit of being able to automatically link to the SME’s accountant or bookkeeper to allow them to keep a watching brief on the business of their client as well as interfacing with Inland Revenue’s systems to allow the digital upload of information directly. 89. A major contribution to compliance cost reduction for SMEs could be easing the transition onto accounting software and ensuring those who do transition know how to use the technology effectively. 90. The Group could recommend that the Government consider how it could incentivise SMEs to move to cloud based accounting software and how they could assist to educate SMEs in the use of that software. This will help businesses to get it right from the start in terms of not only tax compliance but having the tools to assist them to run and grow their business. 91. If the Government were to consider subsidising the accounting software itself for those new to accounting software, based on current growth rates the cost of such a subsidy could be in the ballpark of $3 million to $29.5 million for a 10-50% subsidy (dependent on the level of product subsidised - e.g., basic or most popular). However, a targeted subsidy may be difficult to apply in practice. A more general subsidy to all users could range from $16-160 million for a 10-50% subsidy depending on the level of product. Treasury:3896277v1 22 92. In addition, the most benefit from some measure in this area would be in educating users in how to maximise the use of the product whether that be done through accountants, MBIE or Inland Revenue education programmes. The cost of that is difficult to estimate as it will depend on the level of support provided. 93. This is potentially a concept that could be considered by the Small Business Council as part of its more general work on small business. Treasury:3896277v1 23 6. Conclusion and recommendations 6.1 Concluding thoughts 94. The Government has recently made substantial changes with a view to reducing compliance costs for businesses and in particular small businesses. 95. Notwithstanding this the Group considers there are more changes that could be made to reduce compliance costs. 96. The Group has made a number of recommendations in the interim report and is looking to expand on these for the final report. 97. The recommendations the group will make to the Government will be included in the final report. Treasury:3896277v1 24 Appendix A - suggested text for final report Introduction 1. In the interim report, the Group considered whether a progressive company tax rate should be introduced and decided against that option as the cost of such a system was likely to outweigh any benefits in terms of faster small business growth. Similarly changing the basis of taxation for smaller businesses to a cashflow or turnover tax was not supported due to administrative and threshold issues. It was considered that a better approach for supporting small businesses would be to focus on reducing compliance costs. 2. The Group identified three areas where the Government could take immediate action to reduce compliance costs. These were: • Increasing the $2,500 threshold for paying provisional tax to $5,000- $10,000; • Increasing the $10,000 year-end closing stock adjustment to $20,000- $30,000; and • Increasing the $10,000 limit for the automatic deduction for legal fees, and potentially expanding the automatic deduction to other types of expenditure. 3. The Group did not consider that altering thresholds around fixed assets (such as the low value write off threshold) should be progressed as they can have large fiscal costs relative to the practical compliance cost saving. 4. For this report the Group explored further options to simplify and reduce compliance costs, and that work is presented below. Work to date 5. A significant number of changes have been made in the last two years which had the aim of reducing taxpayer compliance costs. These included changes to provisional tax and in thresholds for annual filing of fringe benefit tax returns. 6. The Group recognises that there is also a strong push from an all-of-government perspective to lower compliance costs for small businesses which includes work on the New Zealand Business Number, e-invoicing and Business Connect which increases co-ordination across government services. The Group supports all of these measures to reduce compliance costs for small businesses. 7. Since the interim report, the Government has also set up a Small Business Council (SBC) which has the task of developing a small business strategy which includes tax policy as part of its brief. This should also ensure that there is a clear strategy for small business, and the Group has been engaging with the SBC to identify any common ground with its terms of reference. 8. Inland Revenue is also part way through its business transformation programme which has the objective of reducing the time it takes to comply with tax Treasury:3896277v1 25 requirements by 18 to 26 hours, which equates to $1.3-$2.3 billion in economic value. To date, the time savings due to the business transformation changes are tracking ahead of those estimates. 9. These latter items are important to consider in an overall discussion of compliance costs as these are changes which are being made that have no preferences or concessions attached to them. They simply make life easier for taxpayers and the Group commends these programmes. 10. However, the Group does consider there are some areas where compliance costs across the board for taxpayers could be reduced because although compliance costs disproportionately fall on smaller businesses they are likely to gain a greater saving than larger taxpayers who have better systems and scale to deal with costs of compliance. Fiscal position 11. Whilst the Group has considered a number of ways to further reduce compliance costs for businesses it is very mindful of the fiscal position of the Government. Reducing compliance costs may come with a cost to Government, whether this be in fiscal or cash terms, and it is paramount that in assessing the merit of these recommendations, the Government carefully considers the fiscal and cash cost of these and only proceed with them where there is a positive return for New Zealand overall. Recommendations in the interim report 12. In the interim report the Group recommended three measures that the Government could consider to reduce compliance costs. The Group has continued to consider those and expand on them. Those recommendations are: Increasing the $2,500 threshold for paying provisional tax to $5,000-$10,000 13. The provisional tax regime is designed around the premise that people should pay tax as they earn their income. Our pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) and resident withholding tax (RWT) regimes are also designed around that premise. Provisional tax is the option for those people who earn income where tax is not deducted at source, such as business income. 14. Over the last few years a number of positive changes have been made to the provisional tax regime to reduce taxpayer compliance costs and this includes: • the removal of use of money interest for most taxpayers for the first two instalments of provisional tax; • the introduction of the accounting income method for paying provisional tax which allows businesses with volatile or seasonal income to better match their cashflows; and Treasury:3896277v1 26 • the increase and expansion of the safe harbour from use of money interest from $50,000 to $60,000 of residual income tax 16 and to non-individuals. 15. Together these changes removed around 19,000 taxpayers from exposure to use of money interest which reduces the compliance costs and takes a lot of the guesswork out of provisional tax. 16. Despite this, the Group considers that the threshold for paying provisional tax is set too low. At $2,500 this represents around $9,000 of income for a company or $7,500 for an individual on the top marginal rate. This adds a compliance cost to those who have relatively small amounts of income. 17. However, balancing this is that for those taxpayers on lower incomes making three small payments during the year may have much lower compliance costs than making one large payment sometime after the end of their income year. 18. There is a fine balance between ensuring that compliance costs are reduced whilst ensuring that it does not throw too many into a debt situation which could have been managed with more frequent payments. 19. In addition, while the increase in the threshold has limited fiscal cost it does have a significant cash cost to the government. An increase in the threshold to $5,000 is estimated to have a cash cost of $355 million whilst an increase to $10,000 would be closer to $1 billon. 20. Overall the Group continues to prefer an increase in the threshold for provisional tax from $2,500, but considering the fiscal cost and the debt issue, we consider that an increase to \[$5,000 of residual income tax is more appropriate and that is our recommendation to Government\] TO BE DECIDED. Increasing the $10,000 year-end closing stock adjustment to $20,000-$30,000 21. The Income Tax Act requires taxpayers to value their closing stock at the end of the year as that amount is included in taxable income. However, taxpayers who have a turnover of less than $1.3m and reasonably estimate the value of their closing stock to be less than $10,000 can use their opening stock as their closing stock for the year. This essentially gives the taxpayer a deduction for their purchases. 22. The $10,000 part of the threshold was last adjusted with effect from the 2009-10 income year. The Group considers that this threshold may no longer be appropriate and has recommended that it be increased to $20,000-$30,000. 23. Whilst the Group recognises that this will only affect around 13-20,000 taxpayers from having to undertake a stocktake for the year it is likely only those who gain a benefit from that (ignoring the compliance costs of undertaking the stocktake) will 16 Residual income tax is the tax liability left after deduction of any tax credits such as PAYE. Treasury:3896277v1 27 use this option which may mean than only 5-7,600 would be affected by the change as it is optional. 24. However, the Group considers the cost of undertaking a stocktake should not be underestimated, especially for those taxpayers who have high volumes of low cost stock and we continue to recommend this change to Government. Increasing the $10,000 limit for the automatic deduction for legal fees and potentially expanding this to other types of expenditure 25. A compliance cost measure currently exists that allows taxpayers an automatic deduction for legal fees where their total legal fees are less than $10,000. This means that those taxpayers do not need to assess whether those fees are incurred in connection with a capital project and may be non-deductible. 26. The Group considers that the threshold for this expenditure should be adjusted to a higher level and that the breadth of the provision be expanded to other types of expenditure such as accounting fees. 27. The Group has not decided on where the threshold should be set and what types of expenditure should be included due to the timeframes of reporting, however, we consider that it should be limited to professional fees and should not be expanded to other potentially capital expenditure such as repairs and maintenance. Further Recommendations 28. In the interim report the group undertook to explore further options for simplification and reducing compliance costs for small businesses. The Ministers of Finance and Revenue also asked us to provide them with some guidance on what other measures we saw could be progressed and detailed below are some further recommendations for the Government to reduce compliance costs for businesses. 29. Given the timeframes we have not been able to fully form the detail of some of these measures, however, officials could progress the detail of these. It has also not been possible to provide costs for these as the ultimate cost will depend on the design features. The Government could also consider how the work of the Small Business Council could include assisting to progress the detail of these recommendations. \[ITEMS BELOW TO BE DELETED IF NOT APPLICABLE\] Fringe benefit tax 30. The Group understands from officials that at workshops they have held with taxpayers that fringe benefit tax (FBT) is one of the most common compliance cost intensive taxes mentioned by taxpayers. 31. FBT plays an important role in our tax system, not only does it raise around $500m in revenue for the Government it has a more important role as a buttress to the Treasury:3896277v1 28 PAYE system so that employees are not paid in benefits rather than cash. If FBT did not exist it is likely the revenue from PAYE would diminish significantly. 32. Generally, however, the largest costs of complying with FBT are incurred in not paying FBT but applying the various exemptions to lower the FBT liability. Another source of compliance costs, especially for larger taxpayers, is the category of other benefits such as provision of gift cards to staff. There can be significant costs incurred in identifying these low value items. 33. The Group recommends that the Government consider simplification of FBT by investigating: • simplification of FBT on motor vehicles by simplifying the classification of vehicles to better reflect the private use of the vehicle, removing the exemptions that apply to vehicles and consequently reducing the rates to reflect that the charge would be calculated on a “close enough is good enough” basis which may have over and underpayments compared to actual use; • simplify the calculation of FBT on other benefits with a view to reducing the compliance costs of identifying every last benefit provided which may have a private element at the margin. Entertainment adjustment 34. The entertainment adjustment generally only permits the deduction of 50% of costs incurred on “entertainment”. Entertainment expenditure includes expenditure on corporate boxes, holiday accommodation, pleasure craft and entertainment off the business premises (excluding light refreshments). A number of exclusions apply to those categories. The main exclusions are expenditure on business travel and conferences. 35. To accurately calculate the adjustment can incur significant compliance costs and many businesses simply take a broad-brush approach and adjust for half of all entertainment expenditure. 36. It may be possible to simplify the entertainment regime or even move it back to normal deductibility principles which existed prior to its introduction. The entertainment regime was introduced in the 1990’s when corporate entertainment was a large feature of business. Times may have changed to the extent that businesses are more focused on costs and keep entertainment to a minimum. 37. However, even if the rationale for the regime remains the Group considers there may be some redesign of the regime that could result in a reduction in compliance costs and again look to apply more of a “close enough is good enough” approach. Treasury:3896277v1 29 Review the thresholds for unexpired expenditure 38. In a similar vein to the thresholds for provisional tax, closing stock and legal expenditure, the Group considers it may reduce compliance costs for smaller taxpayers to review the thresholds for unexpired expenditure. 39. These thresholds mean that taxpayers can deduct prepayments made up to certain levels without having to apportion those across income years. The main cost which results in apportionment for smaller businesses is likely to be insurance costs which are generally prepaid for a year. 40. Raising some of these thresholds may result in taxpayers not having to undertake apportionment for prepayments which should result in compliance cost savings to them. Resident withholding tax on related party debt 41. One submitter asked the Group to consider the issue of RWT on close company related party interest and dividends. This was last looked at by the Government in September of 2015 in an officials’ issues paper on closely held company taxation issues 17 . 42. RWT is applicable to related party interest payments and also dividend payments. Within a close company environment when the tax compliance is usually completed by a single person this creates a large compliance cost for what can be little benefit. 43. Withholding taxes are designed to both ensure that income is returned and also to assist in removing taxpayers from being liable to pay provisional tax. In the case of a close company situation with related party debt these issues are not as prevalent as the scope to under-declare is limited and the recipient of the interest or dividend is likely to be subject to provisional tax in any case. 44. There would be both compliance cost savings for the paying company and very likely administration cost savings for Inland Revenue with this approach, especially when returns are manually prepared. 45. Historically, the issue of removing RWT on related party transactions has had significant fiscal costs from the deferral of tax which officials considered outweighed the savings in compliance costs. Some of this deferral is transitional, involving the deferral of tax that would have been paid in the first year of the change as RWT to its being paid as a combination of terminal tax and higher provisional tax payments in the following year. 46. In the time available, we have not been able to forecast the fiscal impact of such a change to be included in this paper, however, some changes to the way in which tax 17 Closely held company taxation issues – an officials’ issues paper – Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue and the Treasury – September 2015 Treasury:3896277v1 30 is accrued for accounting purposes may have reduced these since the last time these were considered. In general, the Group recommend this may be a worthwhile compliance reduction subject to fiscal costs. Recording expenditure 47. When Inland Revenue conducts surveys of SMEs, the largest compliance effort by far is the effort required to record information. This is not specific information for tax purposes, as financial information is required for good business management, however, SMEs see this as largely a tax compliance exercise. 48. There are a number of ways in which SMEs can reduce the time it takes to record information with perhaps the most helpful way to reduce costs in this area is using a software accounting package, and using it well. 49. The use of a software accounting package can assist the SME by making the recording of information and categorising of expenses easier than keeping paper records or a manual spreadsheet. The development of artificial intelligence within those products will also assist people who have limited knowledge of accounting to classify expenses. 50. Software products also have the benefit of being able to automatically link to the SME’s accountant or bookkeeper to allow them to keep a watching brief on the business of their client as well as interfacing with Inland Revenue’s systems to allow the digital upload of information directly. 51. A major contribution to compliance cost reduction for SMEs could be easing the transition onto accounting software and ensuring those who do transition know how to use the technology effectively. 52. The Group considers this is a worthwhile measure that could significantly reduce compliance costs to smaller businesses and recommend to the Government that they consider how they could incentivise SMEs to move to cloud based accounting software and how they could assist to educate SMEs in the use of that software. This will help businesses to get it right from the start in terms of not only tax compliance but having the tools to assist them to run and grow their business. 53. This is potentially a concept that could be considered by the Small Business Council as part of its more general work on small business. Recommendations 54. The Group recommends that the Government investigate the following measures to reduce compliance costs of businesses, in particular, smaller businesses: \[Delete as applicable\] • increase the threshold for paying provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000 of residual income tax; • increase the $10,000 closing stock adjustment to $20,000-$30,000; Treasury:3896277v1 31 • increase the $10,000 automatic deduction for legal fees and potentially expanding the automatic deduction to other types of professional fees but not to other potentially capital expenditure such as repairs and maintenance; • investigate the simplification of fringe benefit tax with a focus on the motor vehicle and “other” benefits categories; • investigate the simplification or removal of the entertainment adjustment; • review the thresholds for unexpired expenditure; • investigate the removal of resident withholding tax on close company related party interest and dividend payments; • investigate incentives to get smaller businesses using cloud based accounting software and educating business owners to use it well. 55. The Group is particularly interested in the last measure as we consider that will have spin-off benefits to businesses in general and not just tax compliance. This is something that the Government’s new Small Business Council could look at progressing. 56. The Group consider that these measures address the main compliance cost issues that small businesses raise with advisors and Inland Revenue and believe that the recommended measures could reduce these costs significantly.

Coversheet: Potential revenue-neutral packages Position Paper for Session 21 of the Tax Working Group 26 October 2018 Purpose of discussion Decide at a high level what measures to recommend in the Final Report as part of a revenue- neutral package. Key points for discussion 1. The revenue from taxing more capital gains builds up slowly. 2. As a result of this, there are trade-offs in what measures can be recommended for a revenue-neutral package over the short-medium term. 3. Measures can be traded off by either not implementing some measures, or by deferring the application date of some measures (so they apply when there is greater revenue from taxing more capital gains). The Group can also recommend multiple packages that the Government could choose from depending on their priorities. 4. Any tax package should be cohesive. Many of the measures the Group are considering are complementary with taxing more capital gains and can mitigate some of the potential negative impacts. Recommended actions We recommend that you: a Note that the Secretariat’s preliminary revenue forecast from taxing more capital gains provides $10.5 billion of revenue over 5 years. b Note that this revenue forecast is preliminary. The Secretariat intends to do further quality assurance of the model and will update it following further design decisions from the Group. c Note that because of the slow build up of revenue there are trade-offs in what measures can be included in a revenue neutral package. d Note that these trade-offs can be managed by not recommending some measures or deferring the application date of some measures. The Group could also recommend multiple packages that the Government could choose from depending on their priorities. e Agree at a high level which of the following measures to include in a revenue negative package: i. Remove ESCT on employer’s matching contribution of 3% of the salary to KiwiSaver for members earning up to $48,000 per year (already agreed to by Group) ii. Reduce lower PIE rates by five percentage points for KiwiSaver (already agreed to by Group) iii. Restore depreciation on commercial, industrial and multi-unit residential buildings iv. Expand “black hole” expense deductibility v. Remove rental loss ring-fencing restrictions vi. Reduce restrictions on loss carry-forwards when a company is sold vii. Income tax reductions f Note that the Group is also considering options regarding seismic strengthening and compliance cost savings that are revenue negative. g Note that the revenue forecast is uncertain and that actual revenue from taxing capital gains is likely to be volatile. h Agree that the final report comment on the uncertainty and volatility of revenue from taxing more capital gains and recommends that the Government take appropriate fiscal management and be flexible regarding revenue negative measures in case revenue is less than forecast.

The Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue requested the Group recommend measures that could result in a revenue neutral package. We have written this paper on the basis that revenue from taxing more capital gains is used to fund a complementary package of revenue negative measures. We are interpreting revenue neutral to mean that revenue gains match revenue costs when added up over a five-year period. There are alternative ways of interpreting revenue neutral that the Group may want to consider. The Group may wish to consider how their proposals would affect New Zealand over a longer period consistent with the Terms of Reference. Based on updated Secretariat modelling the forecast revenue from taxing more capital gains builds up slowly and brings an estimated $10.5b of revenue over the first five years following introduction. In contrast, many of the measures the Group are considering have immediate fiscal costs. As a result, the Group will need to prioritise their objectives. These trade-offs could be managed by: • Prioritising some objectives over others. The Group could prioritise a package focusing on o social capital, fairness and distributional objectives; or o financial and physical capital through business tax measures, housing affordability, savings, or some combination of these; or o a combination of these. • The Group could prioritise objectives through either implementing some measures but not others, or through deferring the application date of some measures or phasing them in. • The Group also has the option to recommend different packages that the Government could choose from depending on the Government’s objectives. Any package of measures should be cohesive when considered alongside taxing more capital gains. Different measures can mitigate some of the negative effects of taxing more capital gains or strengthen some of its advantages. In particular, taxing more capital gains by itself could have negative implications for New Zealand’s overall efficiency and long-term productivity. This is because while taxing more capital gains would likely improve the allocation of investments it would also increase the total tax cost of investment, create compliance costs and lock-in effects. As a result, the total effect on efficiency and the long-term productivity for New Zealand of taxing more capital gains is unclear. 7 The Secretariat consider it important that an overall package of measures mitigate the negative impacts of taxing more capital gains. We have prepared three illustrative packages for discussion purposes. Natural capital is not the focus of the packages presented here, and we have scoped the packages in this paper as revenue neutral excluding environmental tax measures. This is because the Group has already agreed to recommend a package of measures to support natural capital through expanding the use of environmental taxes and recycling revenue from these to support natural capital initiatives and provide for just transitions. The Group has also agreed to new tax concessions to support natural capital. The environmental tax package may or may not be revenue neutral, depending on how environmental tax revenue is recycled. Social capital Human capital Financial/physical capital Progressivity and reducing inequality Work incentives and incentives to build human capital Efficiency and productivity Housing affordability Effect on private savings Package 1 – implement all measures at 1 April 2021, income tax reductions of $1.3 billion per annum Taxing more capital gains is likely to increase vertical equity. This may make it better achieve the Government’s vertical equity goals over the status quo. Moderate income tax reductions targeted at lower income households will also be progressive. Income tax reductions can increase incentives to enter job market. Positive efficiency impacts of business tax measures could provide a significant offset to potential negative economic effects of taxing more capital gains (which depend on design of taxing more capital gains) Depreciation deductions and removal of loss ring- fencing likely to mitigate effects of taxing more capital gains. Income tax reductions can moderate any impact on renters. Taxing more capital gains will increase taxes on savings for higher income earners. For lower income earners the effect of savings concessions outweighs the effect of taxing more capital gains. Package 2 – implement savings measures and income tax reductions of $1.85 billion per annum at 1 April 2021 This is likely to be the most progressive package. Income tax reductions can increase incentives to enter job market. The personal tax cuts are likely to have a smaller efficiency benefit than business tax measures. With no other offsetting efficiency-enhancing tax changes, this package does less to mitigate the negative economic effects. Taxing more capital gains could potentially increase rent and decrease house prices. This package does not have positive housing supply tax changes, but it has greater scope for tax cuts to support those on lower incomes. Taxing more capital gains will increase taxes on savings for higher income earners. Both savings concessions and income tax reductions will reduce the tax rate on savings for low-income households. Package 3 – Implement all measures with income tax reductions of $1.5 billion per annum. Income tax reductions and savings measures implemented at 1 April 2021, business tax measures implemented at 1 April 2023 Taxing more capital gains is likely to increase vertical equity. This may make it better achieve the Government’s vertical equity goals over the status quo. Moderate income tax reductions targeted at lower income households will also be progressive. Income tax reductions can increase incentives to enter job market. This package has an intermediate amount of offsetting efficiency enhancing measures to offset potential negative economic effects of taxing more capital gains (which depend on design of taxing more capital gains) Intermediate effects between Package 1 and 2. Taxing more capital gains will increase taxes on savings for higher income earners. For lower income earners the effect of savings concessions outweighs the effect of taxing more capital gains 8 1. Introduction Purpose 1. This paper seeks high-level decisions from the Group on what package of measures to recommend in the Final Report. 2. We have written this paper on the basis that revenue from taxing more capital gains is used to fund a complementary package of revenue negative measures. 3. The Group has another session on 22 November to make final decisions on the detail of any package. The Secretariat will provide updated revenue estimates of taxing more capital gains for this meeting that refine the estimates and take into account further decisions from the Group. 4. This paper provides additional information on the effects of taxing more capital gains alongside other potential measures that could form a revenue-neutral package. This is to help support the Group in making an overall cohesive package and to comment on the uncertainty and expected volatility of revenue from taxing more capital gains. Content and scope 5. Part 2 of this paper provides updated modelling of the anticipated revenue from taxing more capital gains. 6. Part 3 provides additional information on the overall distributional, efficiency, and housing market impacts of taxing more capital gains alongside other revenue negative measures. 7. Part 4 provides a summary of a range of illustrative revenue-neutral packages using the forecast revenue from taxing more capital gains. 8. Part 5 provides further information on the fiscal effect of taxing more capital gains. 9. Some of the information provided in these papers, in particular the fiscal impacts, are still undergoing quality assurance. As a result, the results should be considered indicative and for the purposes of discussion. 9 2. Forecast revenue Forecast revenue from taxing more capital gains 10. An updated forecast of the revenue from taxing more capital gains is below. The modelling for this forecast updates that previously provided to improve the methodology and correct an error identified with the previous estimate 1 . 11. We have also updated the modelling to include assumed behavioural change from taxing more capital gains through a lock-in effect. We have modelled this through assuming that the turnover rate decreases by 20% for all assets because of taxing more capital gains 2 . We are working to source further information to refine this assumption. 12. We have incorporated rollover relief for inheritances, relationship property settlements and insurance proceeds in the forecast revenue. We have done this by assuming that approximately 8% of land transactions and 5% of share transactions on average are subject to these rollover relief provisions 3 . The forecast below does not incorporate design decisions such as a small business de minimis or alternative tax treatments of managed funds as these are still to be decided.

The remainder of this paper uses this forecast revenue to analyse potential revenue neutral packages. However, the actual revenue from taxing capital gains is uncertain and dependent on design features. The Secretariat intends to provide updated estimates to: • incorporate further design decisions by the Group 4 ; • update asset values to the latest available figures; 1 The turnover rate for shares has also been decreased to reflect better data sourced by the Secretariat. 2 The 20% figure is a rough assumption made until better information is available to the Secretariat. 3 Based on an estimate by the Secretariat of the value of inheritances, relationship property settlements and insurance. 4 The forecast revenue provided for shares include estimated revenue from taxing shares held by PIEs on realisation. The Secretariat will update the revenue estimate following decisions by the Group regarding taxing managed funds. The estimate does not include the impact of a de minimis or small business concession. 10 • obtain further information to inform assumptions such as the effect of rollover relief and lock-in; and • incorporate any further changes arising from further independent quality assurance being sought by the Secretariat. Forecast revenue from applying fair rate of return method 14. Information on the fiscal impact of the application of the fair rate of return (FRR) method to residential property was provided in the previous Secretariat paper (Risk- free return method of taxation), including the assumptions and caveats for the modelling. The Group requested forecast revenue that excluded baches. This is below. An FRR with a 3.5% rate provides more revenue over the first 5 years than taxing more capital gains. However, taxing more capital gains provides more revenue in subsequent years. Fiscal year ($m) 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 2024/25 2025/26 2026/27 2027/28 2028/29 2029/30 2030/31 3.5% risk- free rate 877 884 1,017 1,100 1,191 1,292 1,392 1,502 1,611 1,739 1.7% risk- free rate 77 44 127 160 192 224 264 313 352 400 15. For ease of analysis, the remainder of this paper focuses on packages utilising revenue from taxing more capital gains. 11 3. Potential effects of packages 16. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a summary on the potential distributional, efficiency, and housing market impacts of taxing more capital gains and the impact of potential revenue negative measures alongside them. 17. The Secretariat has previously provided advice on the broad economic and fiscal effects of taxing more capital gains (Potential high-level effects of proposals to extend the taxation of capital income) and the potential distributional impacts of taxing more capital gains (Distributional analysis and incidence). This advice indicated that taxing more capital gains could broadly be expected to have the following impacts: • Progressivity and inequality: Taxing more capital gains is likely to be progressive and reduce inequality. However, as with any tax change some of the economic incidence may fall on those who are not legally liable to pay the tax. Some elements may be passed on to other people, for example it could result in higher rents • Efficiency and investment: Taxing more capital gains would likely improve the allocation of investments, but it would also increase the total tax cost of investment, create compliance costs, and lock-in effects. As a result, the total effect on efficiency and productivity is unclear. • Housing markets: The Secretariat’s view is that taxing more capital gains may decrease the price-rent ratio. However, we expect the impact of this to be modest. In the Secretariat’s view the evidence strongly suggests that tax changes are unlikely to substantially affect the housing market and that other factors in the housing market can outweigh the impact of tax changes. 18. Taxing more capital gains has other important longer-term benefits that we do not discuss in this chapter. One is that taxing gains on shares would shore up the tax system so that companies cannot be used easily to shelter income from higher rates of personal tax. 19. Officials have in the past consistently opposed reductions in the company tax rate or increases in higher personal tax rates in part because of the additional integrity pressures these tax changes would generate in the absence of any tax on capital gains. This position may be increasingly difficult to sustain if other countries continue to cut their company tax rate or future governments wish to raise higher rates of personal tax. Taxing more capital gains can help with the longer-term sustainability of the tax system and give future governments greater scope to vary these tax rates. 20. The overall effect of packages will depend on the economic effects of taxing more capital gains alongside the impact of revenue negative measures. This chapter provides further information on these with detail provided in appendices. 12 Progressivity and inequality (Social capital) 21. Higher income and net worth deciles would pay most of the cost of taxing more capital gains. As a result, taxing more capital gains would likely be highly progressive and reduce inequality in New Zealand. 22. There is the possibility that taxing more capital gains could put some modest upward pressure on rents. However, the Secretariat has found no strong evidence of taxes on capital gains resulting in significant increases in rents and so we do not believe that this risk is significant. Any potential increase in rents would disproportionately affect low-income households. How package measures could affect this 23. Income tax reductions targeted at lower income households and the savings measures recommended by the Group would be progressive and result in a greater inequality- reducing package of measures. Income tax reductions may encourage people to re- enter the workforce. However, the extent of this depends on the design of income tax reductions. 24. Any upward pressure on rents could also be mitigated through changes to encourage more investment in housing such as allowing depreciation on multi-unit residential properties and removing rental loss ring-fencing. Savings (Financial and physical capital, social capital) 25. Taxing more capital gains is likely to make the tax treatment of different forms of financial and physical capital more neutral. However, taxing more capital gains will also increase the amount of tax on savings. How package measures could affect this 26. The Group has recommended changes to reduce the tax on savings targeted at lower income households. Overall, the combined effect of taxing more capital gains alongside these savings changes will reduce the overall tax on savings for low-income households. Taxing more capital gains would impose tax of approximately $15 million per annum across KiwiSaver members with annual income of less than $48,000 while these measures would reduce tax by about $215 million per annum for KiwiSaver members earning less than $48,000 per year. 27. In addition, any income tax reductions on lower income earners will reduce the tax rate on their savings. This would further reduce any combined impact on the tax rate on savings for low-income households. Efficiency and productivity (Financial and physical capital) 28. The impacts of taxing more capital gains on efficiency are complex and difficult to measure. However, broadly taxing more capital gains, by itself, would likely: 13 • decrease the total level of investment as it increases the effective tax rate on investment; • improve the allocation of investments, as a tax preference for certain investments is removed; and • create inefficiencies through lock-in. 29. It is difficult to know what the overall impacts of this will be. These impacts will depend on design decisions regarding taxing more capital gains. How package measures could affect this 30. The overall effect on efficiency and productivity of taxing more capital gains depends on the design of taxing more capital gains and what the revenue generated from taxing these capital gains is used for. The Secretariat considers that if the business tax measures being considered by the Group were implemented alongside taxing more capital gains, this is likely to provide a significant offset to the negative impact of taxing more capital gains. The overall impact of the package will depend sensitively on the final design details of taxing more capital gains, which have not yet been made. 31. Several measures that the Group are considering for a package are complementary with taxing more capital gains because they allow deductions for capital losses when capital gains are taxed, or because the risks associated with the measure are reduced when more capital gains are taxed. These include: • Black-hole expenditure: Allowing deductions for black-hole expenditure allows deductions for capital losses when capital gains are taxed. • Residential loss ring-fencing: The rationale for ring-fencing losses for residential property is reduced when all of the gains from residential property are taxed (although on a realisation basis so there is a timing advantage). • Depreciation on buildings: Taxing more capital gains means any depreciation on buildings would be deductible on sale. Allowing depreciation on these buildings allows taxpayers to deduct the costs as they accrue. 32. The accompanying paper Expenditure considers these issues more fully. Appendix A of this report also contains further information on tax neutrality. The appendix shows that there is a substantial body of literature suggesting the importance of tax neutrality in promoting economic efficiency and productivity. Housing market impacts (Financial and physical capital) 33. The Secretariat previously provided information on housing market impacts of taxing more capital gains. This advice showed that the standard theoretical expectation from simple economic models that ignore risk and uncertainty is that taxing more capital gains would reduce house prices, increase rents, and increase home ownership. However, there are a number of reasons to be cautious with this theoretical expectation: • there are a range of different results arising from different economic models; • taxing more capital gains (and allowing losses) may not have a large impacts on rents as it reduces investors’ risk; and 14 • the empirical evidence available (although limited) does not suggest that taxing capital gains is associated with markedly different house price or rent developments. 34. The Secretariat has not been able to find international evidence that taxing capital gains leads to large impacts on rents or house prices. We have reported to the Group on this earlier. Since then, the Secretariat has undertaken further analysis using econometric modelling of the housing market impact of capital gains taxes implemented overseas. Again, we have been unable to find evidence of strong rent or house price impacts of taxing more capital gains internationally through this econometric modelling. Appendix A contains further information on this modelling. 35. The Secretariat accepts that taxing more capital gains may put upward pressure on rents and downward pressure on house prices. However, we expect these effects to be modest. How package measures could affect this 36. Other package measures could help mitigate any effects on rents. 37. Restoring depreciation for multi-unit residential accommodation as well as removing residential loss ring fencing could reduce any potentially negative housing market impacts through increasing housing supply. Income tax reductions may mitigate any effect that rent increases could have on low-income households. Transfers could also play a role in helping these households such as increasing the Accommodation Supplement. 38. In addition, the total impact of taxing more capital gains will depend on what other measures the Government undertake alongside taxing more capital gains. The Government has a number of policy initiatives with the goal of increasing housing supply. These initiatives could outweigh the impact of any tax changes on housing affordability. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 15 4. Potential revenue-neutral tax packages 39. The Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue requested the Group recommend measures that could result in a revenue-neutral package. 40. For this paper, we have interpreted revenue neutral to mean that over a five-year period the total revenue from taxing more capital gains must equal the revenue loss from other measures. Based on the fiscal estimate provided in chapter 2 there is approximately $10.5 billion of revenue over five years from taxing more capital gains to finance revenue negative measures. 41. Beyond this five-year period, the revenue from taxing more capital gains continues to build up and a package using this definition will be strongly revenue positive from the sixth year onwards. This build-up of revenue means that the full fiscal benefits of the tax will not be evident if we constrain ourselves to looking at a 5-year window. 42. In addition, the Group in its terms of reference was asked to consider how best to improve the tax system over the long-term considering the economic environment over the next 5-10 years. As a result, even when considering a revenue neutral package over a shorter period, the Group may want to consider the impact of their recommendations over a longer period. 43. In principle, revenue neutrality might best be defined taking account of the full present value of expected future taxes. An intermediate alternative definition of revenue neutral would be that annual revenue costs need to match annual revenue gains in the fifth year. Based on the fiscal estimate provided in the previous chapter this would enable revenue negative measures with an approximate annual cost of $3.5 billion a year (or $17.5 billion over five years). 44. Natural capital is not the focus of the packages presented here, and we have scoped the packages in this paper as revenue neutral excluding environmental tax measures. This is because the Group has already agreed to recommend a package of measures to support natural capital through expanding the use of environmental taxes and recycling revenue from these to support natural capital initiatives and provide for just transitions. The Group has also agreed to new tax concessions to support natural capital. The environmental tax package may or may not be revenue neutral, depending on how environmental tax revenue is recycled. 45. The interim report outlined that the Group is considering the following revenue negative measures that could form part of a revenue-neutral tax package. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 16 Item Key benefit Approximate annual fiscal cost (first year) Approximate cost over 5 years 5 Remove ESCT on employer’s matching contribution of 3% of the salary to KiwiSaver for members earning up to $48,000 per year Provide support to low-income savers $180 million $955 million Reduce lower PIE rates by five percentage points for KiwiSaver funds Provide support to low-income savers $35 million $185 million Restore building depreciation on commercial, industrial and multi-unit residential buildings Fiscal costs in this table are with a 1% diminishing value depreciation rate. Increase neutrality of investment by reducing tax cost of investing in buildings and building-owning businesses. Would promote supply of multi-unit rental accommodation Commercial $180 million Industrial $85 million Multi-unit residential $30 million Commercial $765 million Industrial $355 million Multi-unit residential $150 million Expand “black hole” expenses deductibility Fiscal costs in this table are with a five year spreading of expenses. Increase neutrality of investment by improving incentives for innovation and risk-taking $10 million $120 million Removing rental loss ring-fencing restrictions Reduce upward pressure on rents, and encourage more investment in rental housing $200 million 6 $1 billion Reduce restrictions on loss carry-forwards when a company is sold Improve incentives for innovation and risk- taking $45 million 7 $240 million Total fiscal cost excluding income tax reductions $750 million $3.8 billion Income tax reductions (in particular targeted at lower incomes) Support those on lower incomes. Depending on design can result in modest improvements in incentives to work and save Depends on level of income tax reduction 46. The Secretariat has also provided a paper outlining options for allowing deductions for seismic strengthening (Expenditure). The options for this have fiscal costs ranging from $63 million to $650 million over five years. The Group is also considering compliance cost savings measures that have fiscal costs. The packages considered in this paper do not include all these options because the Group has not yet considered them. 47. When looking at revenue-neutral package over 10 years the projected revenue from taxing more capital gains would provide funds all of these measures in addition to approximately $3 billion of income tax reductions (per annum). However, in early years after introduction, the amount of revenue provided by taxing more capital gains 5 We have costed many of the measures on the assumption that the cost of the measure increases by 3% per annum. 6 We have calculated the fiscal cost for removing rental loss ring-fencing on basis that it is forecast to raise $200m a year, and removing it would likely cost $200 million. However, we plan to review this and so this fiscal cost should be considered preliminary. 7 The $45 million fiscal cost is based on using a same or similar business test. The Group previously considered that a more tightly defined test should be used for this which would have a lower fiscal cost. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 17 is more limited. As a result, the Group will need to prioritise their objectives and the measures to support these objectives. 48. These trade-offs could be managed by: • Prioritising some options over others. The Group could prioritise a package focusing on distributional objectives, business tax and productivity, housing affordability, savings, or some combination of these. • The Group could prioritise objectives through either implementing some measures but not others, or through deferring the application date of some measures or phasing them in • The Group also has the option to recommend different packages that the Government could choose from depending on the Government’s objectives. Potential packages 49. The tables below outline three potential packages for discussion purposes. The key difference between the illustrative packages is how much revenue is allocated towards income tax reductions and how much is allocated towards business tax measures. The packages therefore reflect different potential prioritisations from the Group between progressivity and efficiency focused measures. Illustrative package 1 –financial/physical capital, business tax focus 8 50. Under this package, all of the measures are implemented in full at 1 April 2021 with income tax reductions having a fiscal cost of approximately $1.3 billion per annum 9 . Measure Total cost over 5 years Removing ESCT on employer's matching contribution to KiwiSaver for those earning less than $48k $955 million Reduce the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds by five percentage points $185 million Reinstating depreciation on industrial buildings (1% rate) $355 million Reinstating depreciation on commercial buildings (1% rate) $765 million Reinstating depreciation on multi-unit residential buildings (1% rate) $150 million Enabling deductions for black-hole expenditure $120 million Loss continuity $240 million Removing rental loss ring-fencing $1 billion Income tax reductions $6.5 billion 8 Some of the fiscal estimates are on the assumption that the cost of the measure increases by 3% per annum. The fiscal cost of depreciation declines over time as capital losses are already built into the fiscal estimate of taxing more capital gains. 9 The annual fiscal costs for income tax reductions are indicative. They have been calculated by taking the five year cost and dividing by five. The actual cost of any single tax reduction is likely to increase over time as the population and incomes increase. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 18 Total $10.3 billion 51. Over a ten year period, a similar revenue neutral package would enable income tax reductions totalling $3 billion per annum rather than $1.3 billion per annum. Illustrative package 2 – social capital /human capital, distributional and savings focus 52. This option implements solely the savings tax measures and income tax reductions. The implementation date for both measures is 1 April 2021. Income tax reductions total approximately $1.85 billion per annum. Measure Total cost over 5 years Removing ESCT on employer's matching contribution to KiwiSaver for those earning less than $48k $955 million Reduce the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds by five percentage points $185 million Income tax reductions $9.25 billion Total $10.4 billion 53. Over a ten year period, a similar revenue neutral package would enable income tax reductions totalling $3.5 billion per annum rather than $1.85 billion per annum. Illustrative package 3 – social capital, human capital, financial and physical capital balance 54. This option implements all of the measures. However, all of the business tax measures are deferred so they apply from 1 April 2023. Income tax reductions total approximately $1.5 billion per annum (from 1 April 2021). Measure Total cost over 5 years Removing ESCT on employer's matching contribution to KiwiSaver for those earning less than $48k Applying from 2021 $955 million Reduce the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds by five percentage points Applying from 2021 $185 million Reinstating depreciation on industrial buildings (1% rate) Applying from 2023 $260 million Reinstating depreciation on commercial buildings (1% rate) Applying from 2023 $545 million Reinstating depreciation on multi-unit residential buildings (1% rate) Applying from 2023 $105 million Enabling deductions for black-hole expenditure Applying from 2023 $50 million Loss continuity Applying from 2023 $150 million Removing rental loss ring-fencing $625 million IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 19 Applying from 2023 Income tax reductions Applying from 2021 $7.5 billion Total $10.4 billion 55. Over a ten year period, a similar revenue neutral package would enable income tax reductions totalling $3 billion per annum rather than $1.3 billion per annum. Effects of different packages 56. Any package of measures should be cohesive and revenue negative measures should be complementary alongside taxing more capital gains. Some of the measures the Group are considering can further support the benefits or mitigate the potential downsides of taxing more capital gains. 57. The table below provides a brief comparison of the different impacts of packages when considered alongside taxing more capital gains. We have used simplified analysis of impacts in the table for comparison purposes. Social capital Human capital Financial/physical capital Progressivity and reducing inequality Work incentives and incentives to build human capital Efficiency and productivity Housing affordability Effect on private savings Package 1 – implement all measures at 1 April 2021, income tax reductions of $1.3 billion per annum Taxing more capital gains is likely to increase vertical equity. This may make it better achieve the Government’s vertical equity goals over the status quo. Moderate income tax reductions targeted at lower income households will also be progressive. Income tax reductions can increase incentives to enter job market. Positive efficiency impacts of business tax measures could provide a significant offset to potential negative economic effects of taxing more capital gains (which depend on design of taxing more capital gains) Depreciation deductions and removal of loss ring- fencing likely to mitigate effects of taxing more capital gains. Income tax reductions can moderate any impact on renters. Taxing more capital gains will increase taxes on savings for higher income earners. For lower income earners the effect of savings concessions outweighs the effect of taxing more capital gains. Package 2 – implement savings measures and income tax reductions of $1.85 billion per annum at 1 April 2021 This is likely to be the most progressive package. Income tax reductions can increase incentives to enter job market. The personal tax cuts are likely to have a smaller efficiency benefit than business tax measures. With no other offsetting efficiency-enhancing tax changes, this package does less to mitigate the negative economic effects. Taxing more capital gains could potentially increase rent and decrease house prices. This package does not have positive housing supply tax changes, but it has greater scope for tax cuts to support those on lower incomes. Taxing more capital gains will increase taxes on savings for higher income earners. Both savings concessions and income tax reductions will reduce the tax rate on savings for low-income households. Package 3 – Implement all measures with income tax reductions of $1.5 billion per annum. Income tax reductions and savings measures implemented at 1 April 2021, business tax measures implemented at 1 April 2023 Taxing more capital gains is likely to increase vertical equity. This may make it better achieve the Government’s vertical equity goals over the status quo. Moderate income tax reductions targeted at lower income households will also be progressive. Income tax reductions can increase incentives to enter job market. This package has an intermediate amount of offsetting efficiency enhancing measures to offset potential negative economic effects of taxing more capital gains (which depend on design of taxing more capital gains) Intermediate effects between Package 1 and 2. Taxing more capital gains will increase taxes on savings for higher income earners. For lower income earners the effect of savings concessions outweighs the effect of taxing more capital gains IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 20 Secretariat recommendations 58. Taxing more capital gains, by itself, is likely to be highly progressive. However, taxing more capital gains has risks for the efficiency and productivity of the New Zealand economy. These risks mean that it is unclear whether taxing more capital gains by itself would overall improve the efficiency and long-term productivity of the New Zealand economy. 59. The Secretariat considers it important that some of the potential negative impact of taxing more capital gains are offset by some efficiency enhancing measures. This can be done through the business tax options outlined in packages 1 and 3. Both packages would mitigate potential negative impacts of taxing more capital gains, while being progressive and provide revenue to enable income tax reductions. However, final conclusions on the overall effect on productivity and efficiency of a package would depend on the final design of taxing more capital gains. What business tax measures are highest priority? 60. Within the business tax measures, we consider the measure likely to have the greatest benefit relative to fiscal cost to be reintroducing building depreciation. This is because building depreciation has the most potential to result in greater tax neutrality. Greater tax neutrality is likely to be the most efficiency enhancing measure available for New Zealand’s tax system and most consistent with horizontal equity. In addition, enabling building depreciation would also help address issues with seismic strengthening and would likely help with improving housing supply. 61. Following building depreciation, the Secretariat considers removing residential loss ring-fencing is likely to be the next measure with the highest value for fiscal cost. This is because this measure also helps improve tax neutrality, the justification for the loss ring-fencing is reduced when the gains on residential housing are taxed, and the measure could have potential benefits for improving housing supply. Beyond these, we consider that black hole and loss continuity are likely to be the next most important measures. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 21 5. Revenue volatility and uncertainty Further information on revenue uncertainty 62. The forecast revenue from taxing more capital gains outlined in Part 2 of this paper is based on a number of assumptions (outlined in Appendix B). The actual revenue from taxing more capital gains is likely to be uncertain. 63. In the final report, the Secretariat would recommend that the Group suggest that the Government consider this uncertainty when implementing any revenue-neutral package. The Government may need to change a package to accommodate any reduction in revenue if actual conditions are different to those assumed in the forecasts. Further information on revenue volatility 64. The revenue from taxing more capital gains is also likely to be volatile. For example, revenue from the capital gains tax on long-term capital gains in the United States has historically been highly volatile. U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Tax Analysis IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 22 65. Revenue from Australia’s capital gains tax has also been volatile. Australia CGT receipts as a proportion of GDP Sources: PBO based on data from the ABS and Treasury Note: CGT became applicable to superannuation funds with the introduction of the 15 per cent tax on earnings implemented from 1 July 1988. 66. In New Zealand, asset prices are similarly volatile and we would expect similarly volatile revenue from taxing more capital gains. The chart below shows an estimate of the historical potential tax revenue from taxing more capital gains on an accruals basis in New Zealand 10 . 10 This estimate is imprecise and for illustrative purposes only. It uses a 25% tax rate and assumes no behavioural change. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 23 67. In addition, if the Group agrees not to include extensive loss ring-fencing this will likely make revenue more volatile than in many other countries with capital gains taxes. The chart below compares net capital gains in Australia with loss ring-fencing (current policy) and the Secretariat’s calculation of what net capital gains would be without loss ring-fencing 11 . 11 The calculation of net capital gains without loss ring fencing does not include any potential behavioural changes. The calculation is for individuals, companies and superannuation funds. The calculation does not include trusts due to data not being available for the some of the years.

This volatile revenue has two main impacts: • it makes the tax counter-cyclical and acts as a fiscal stabiliser; and • it makes Government revenue more volatile. 69. Overall, there are some benefits to New Zealand having more automatic stabilisers, in particular if there continues to be less scope for monetary policy to act as a stabiliser. However, as the revenue from taxing more capital gains is likely to be relatively small relative to the size of the economy, the impact of taxing more capital gains as a stabiliser effect is also likely to be modest. 70. The degree of impact of volatility on forecast revenue from taxing more capital gains is difficult to forecast as it relies on projections regarding future asset prices and realisation rates. However, generally it means that taxing more capital gains requires fiscal management by the Government. The Government will need to ensure it saves sufficient revenue during times of high revenue in order to utilise during times of low revenue. It also means that the Government should be conservative when embarking on revenue negative measures financed from future taxes on capital gains. The Secretariat will provide further analysis of the stabilisation effect of taxes in a future paper. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 25 Appendix A: Further information on efficiency and housing market impacts Efficiency impact of taxing more capital gains Efficiency gains from taxing more capital gains – investment allocation 71. New Zealand is better off when New Zealanders choose to invest in the most productive investments from a social perspective. In the absence of externalities or other market failures this will usually be those that provide the highest pre-tax return. 72. However, if effective tax rates on different investments vary, then investors may choose investments that earn a high post-tax return, but a low pre-tax return. In the absence of externalities or other market failures then this creates a loss of potential income to New Zealand. Taxing income more neutrally is likely to promote more efficient investment allocation and capital productivity. 73. The available evidence suggests that inconsistent taxation of capital income is creating wide variation in effective tax rates across firms and industries (see Secretariat paper Effective Company Tax Rates). Taxing more capital gains means that investment in industries that do not earn capital gains would likely increase relative to the amount of investment in industries which earn capital gains. 74. The impact of this is potentially significant. There is increasing international empirical evidence, using firm-level data, that suggests that inconsistent effective tax rates across firms and asset types is associated with resource misallocation, and lower productivity (IMF, 2017). 75. (IMF, 2017) also emphasises the importance of taxing business income as neutrally as possible. IMF says regarding the design of tax: “Upgrading the design of their tax system can help countries chip away at resource misallocation by ensuring that firms’ decisions are made for business and not tax reasons. Governments can eliminate distortions that they themselves have created. The chapter (in IMF 2017) provides evidence that significant total factor productivity gains can be achieved if countries address tax treatments that discriminate by asset type, source of financing, or firm characteristics such as informality and size” 76. Taxing more capital gains would help reduce these types of tax distortions. In addition other revenue negative measures can also help reduce these types of distortions such as restoring building depreciation, allowing deductions for black-hole expenditure and the treatment of losses. In addition, the Group has recommended improvements to Inland Revenue’s enforcement in the hidden economy that can also help reduce these distortions. 77. IMF also acknowledges the importance of potential externalities. IMF states: IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 26 “It is important to acknowledge differences in treatment across firms may not be feasible or desirable in all cases. Tax policy might want to influence resource allocation when firms do not take into account their externalities – the full economy-wide benefits and costs of their activities”. 78. Differential tax treatment across firms can occur because of firm characteristics, not just tax design, to the detriment of productivity (Bartolini, 2018). Bartolini also reinforces the point made by the IMF regarding the importance of tax neutrality. The paper provides a cross-country study finding that lower effective tax rates are generally associated with firms being more productive and producing closer to the productivity frontier. Reducing inter-asset biases as broadly as possible can be particularly important given New Zealand’s relatively high company tax rate, as biases will increase with the tax rate on investment. 79. Firm-level productivity analysis for New Zealand finds that there is a wide dispersion of firm productivity levels and that the allocation of resources across firms detracts from aggregate productivity, especially in some service industries (Conway, 2016). 80. As a result, the potential gains from reducing resource misallocation are uncertain, but large. The IMF (2017) found, using a cross-country firm-level dataset, the potential productivity gains from lifting firms’ efficiency to the level of a “top performer” is 16 per cent for the average advanced economy. 81. However, tax is likely a small factor in the overall issue in New Zealand regarding misallocation of resource and its implications for productivity. A more neutral tax system will help address these issues but will not fix them. 82. While the Group has decided against any cut in the company tax rate, it is a key reason for considering reductions in business taxes that improve the neutrality of the base as part of any package of changes. If a future Government were to wish to cut taxes on businesses, in the absence of identifying other non-neutralities that could be reduced by allowing more deductions, the appropriate response would be to lower the company tax rate. Efficiency costs of taxing more capital gains 83. There are potential downsides for efficiency and productivity from taxing more capital gains. In particular, taxing more capital gains would increase the overall tax rate on capital income and reduce incentives to save and invest. In addition, there are efficiency costs from taxing more capital gains in the lock-in effect it can create and through the additional compliance and administration costs created. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 27 Housing market impacts of taxing more capital gains What economic models say about housing market impacts of taxing more capital gains 84. The Group previously reviewed preliminary modelling by Andrew Coleman (the Coleman model) and modelling published by Westpac (the Westpac model). 85. Key conclusions of the Coleman model are that: • the key effects of taxing more capital gains are highly uncertain; • taxing more capital gains will decrease the price-rent ratio on housing; • taxing more capital gains will increase rents and homeownership rates in the long run; and • the price of housing increases slightly. 86. The Westpac model predicts that taxing more capital gains would increase rents and decrease house prices. Other models (including Coleman and Scobie (2009) and Hargreaves (2008)) also find that reducing tax advantages for landlords will result in reducing house prices and increasing rents. 87. These models help show how taxing more capital gains can change people’s decisions and impact the housing market and show the degree of uncertainty in working out the impacts of taxing more capital gains. The models however cannot provide precise indications of what the effect of taxing more capital gains would be and should be taken with a high level of caution. The models are inherent simplifications of reality, which rely on the assumptions and parameters built into the model and there are a number of other factors that affect housing markets that they cannot incorporate. 88. These models all tend to suggest that even small tax changes that increase taxes on rental housing can lead to large decreases in the ratio of prices to rents. However, the Secretariat has been unable to find any example internationally where this has actually happened. 89. In addition, the results do not appear consistent with what has happened in New Zealand when it cut personal tax rates and eliminated building depreciation in 2011. It is also inconsistent with what occurred in other countries’ housing markets when they have introduced capital gains taxes (CGT). The effect that the introduction of a CGT had in other countries is discussed further below. The international experience 90. The section below provides analysis on the impact that the introduction of a CGT in Canada, Australia and South Africa had on house prices, rents, and price-rent ratios. This information replicates information previously provided to the Group in Potential high-level effects of proposals to extend the taxation of capital income. 91. All three of these countries introduced a CGT that applied to residential property, but contained an exemption for owner-occupied houses. In all of these countries, IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 28 economic theory would have suggested that there should be a significant decrease in the price to rent ratio, and a significant increase in rents and decrease in house prices. Summary table Was what happened consistent with the theory? What economic theory would suggest happens Canada Australia South Africa Impact on price- rent ratio Decrease in price-rent ratio  Increase in price-rent ratio (although remained roughly flat in first three quarters) / After 2 years the price-rent ratio decreased 8% After five years, the price-rent ratio had increased 10% (from introduction).  Starting from 2002 (one year after the tax) the price-rent ratio rose.

Australia’s CGT only applied to assets acquired after 20 September 1985 13 . 92. There is no clear trend visible from this analysis of other countries’ housing markets after the implementation of a CGT. The key outcome from economic models suggest that the price-rent ratio should decrease following an introduction of a CGT. However, these countries do not provide consistent evidence of this. Canada 93. Canada introduced a CGT that applied to non-owner occupied houses from 1 January 1972. The chart below displays the trend in both house prices and rents in Canada following the introduction of the CGT. In the period after Canada’s CGT came into effect, the price-rent ratio increased (although it remained flat for the first three quarters after introduction). 12 However theory would predict that even if rents cannot rise, the price-rent ratio should still fall and there should be a bigger fall in house prices. 13 This likely decreased impact on housing market in the short run. In the long run however, impacts still were opposite to that expected. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 29 94. Other policies occurring at the same time can explain some of this downward trend in rents, but not the absence of any fall in the price-rent ratio. Some Canadian provinces had rent controls at the time of the implementation of the CGT, and all Canadian provinces had rent controls in place in the mid-1970s, at the request of the federal government. While these were later rolled back in the 1980s, these rent controls would have put downward pressure on average rents at the time. Australia 95. Australia introduced a CGT that applied from 1985. The chart below displays the trend in house prices and rent following its introductions. There was no noticeable change in the price-rent ratio for the two years following its introduction. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 30 96. Australia had a grandfathering provision for its CGT, which meant that the tax did not apply to assets acquired prior to 20 September 1985. This would likely have mitigated the short-term impact that the tax had on the housing market. South Africa 97. South Africa introduced a CGT in 2001. Data on rents is only available from 2002 for South Africa. The chart below shows that from 2002, the price-rent ratio increased as rents fell and house prices increased. South Africa – Capital Gains Tax effective from 2001 Source: OECD and subsequent Secretariat analysis 98. Ultimately, nothing conclusive about the effect of a CGT on the housing market can be drawn from this simple analysis. One potential danger in looking simply at the data is that it may miss other things that were happening at the same time including changes in interest rates. In order to further test this finding, we have developed an econometric model in an attempt to better understand the correlation between the introduction of a CGT and the housing market. Econometric modelling 99. The Secretariat has undertaken simple econometric analysis of this international data to better ascertain the effect that the introduction of a CGT has on the housing markets in Canada, Australia, and South Africa. This econometric analysis allows us to control for other factors that might be influencing the housing market, such as interest rates, GDP, and previous year trends in the housing market variables. 100. The results of this econometric analysis provides similar conclusions to those made by the observations outlined above. The econometric analysis found no statistically significant impact on real house prices, real rents, and the rent-to-price ratio as a result of introducing a CGT in these countries. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 31 101. The only factors that did appear to generally have an impact on real house prices, real rents, and the rent-to price ratio were: • what real house prices, real rents, and the rent to price ratio were in the previous year (e.g. house growth in the previous quarter was positively correlated with house price in the current quarter); and • real interest rates (higher real interest rates led to higher house prices and rents). 102. This lack of statistically significant results indicates that the economic models may be overestimating the effect that taxing more capital gains would have on the housing market. 103. The design of this econometric analysis does suffer from some deficiencies that may weaken its usefulness. These include announcement lag and the possibility that the analysis does not include other important variables affecting the housing market. In addition, the econometric analysis looks at whether there are immediate changes in the rent to price ratio, and may ignore the long-run effects of change. 104. The announcement lag effect arises because there is often a significant gap between when a CGT becomes a possibility, when a CGT is announced, and when it comes into effect. For example, a Canadian Commission recommended a CGT in 1966; Canada passed the CGT into law in 1971 and the CGT came into effect in 1972. In this case, we would expect that the CGT would affect the housing market before 1972. We would expect investors to start changing their investment behaviour in expectation of the introduction of a CGT. Our econometric analysis will not capture these effects. 105. In addition, other factors that could explain housing market changes may not have been included in our econometric analysis. This would reduce the accuracy of our estimates and the usefulness of our findings. In an attempt to combat the possible weaknesses in our analysis, we have also looked at international evidence around the effect of changing the rate at which capital gains are taxed, rather than just introducing a CGT. Further international evidence 106. There is limited international research on the effect of introducing a CGT on housing markets. This is primarily because not many countries have recently introduced a CGT, and when they have, the focus of subsequent research has not been on the effect that the introduction had on the housing market. However, there has been some research on the effect on the housing market of other housing-related tax policies. US tax reform 107. The United States (US) had two significant tax reforms in the 1980s that would have had an effect on the US housing market. In 1981, the Economic Recovery Tax Act was passed, while just 5 years later, the Tax Reform Act was also passed, making IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 32 a number of other changes to the US tax system, including reversing some of the changes in the 1981 reforms. 108. The reforms were wide ranging, and touched on a number of aspects of the US tax system. The tax reforms that affected the housing market, and their expected effect according to the relevant literature, were: Tax change Expected impact on housing market What actually happened 1981 reform Decrease marginal tax rates Reduce house prices 14 Real house prices reduced by 3% between 1980 and 1983 Modest change in direction that would be expected Accelerated depreciation for rental properties Reduce house prices Decrease CGT rate Decrease in rents Rents increased by around 8% from 1982- 1986 Significant change in opposition direction that would be expected 1986 reform Increase in standard deduction 15 Reduce house prices Real house prices reduced by around 5% from 1986-1988 Moderate change in the direction that would be expected Removing accelerated depreciation for rental properties Reduce house prices Increase CGT rate Increase rent Rents are relatively stable from 1986-1990 Not consistent with expected direction Residential loss ring- fencing Increase rent 109. Under standard economic theory, some these changes should have a greater housing market impact than introducing (or removing) a CGT. This is because, unlike a CGT, these changes would not have the mitigating impact of decreasing risk. Despite this greater theoretical case, the changes do not appear to have resulted in the 14 This was expected to reduce house prices as it reduces the tax benefit of the mortgage interest deduction. 15 The standard deduction is a fixed tax deduction that a person or persons can take to reduce their income tax liability in the United States. If the filer take the standard deduction they are not able to take other deductions. As the US allows deductions for mortgage expenses, an increase in the standard deduction means less people will take mortgage deductions. This will decrease the tax subsidy for mortgage interest, which was expected to reduce demand for housing. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 33 expected impacts on the house prices and rent. As a result, they provide no evidence of major and concerning impacts on rents or prices from housing tax changes. 110. There were other factors influencing the US housing market that were more likely to be the driver of these results. Commentary at the time noted that the increase in rents from 1982-1986 was primarily due to low vacancy rates of rental accommodation in the early 1980s. The relatively stable rents from 1986-1990 are likely to be primarily due to relatively higher vacancy rates over this period. In addition, other factors such as large decreases in inflation, and increases in the real after tax interest rate are likely to have been influencing the housing market. Secretariat conclusion on housing market impacts 111. The Secretariat’s overall conclusion is that there may be some small pressures in the directions that have been predicted by the various theoretical models 112. However, the evidence strongly suggests that tax changes are unlikely to have substantial effect on the housing market and that other factors in the housing market can outweigh the effect of tax changes. We have been unable to find any instances where there has been a large change in rents or house prices in the direction that theory may predict. 113. To the extent that taxing more capital gains has housing market impacts, this is likely to lead to small welfare decreases for renters, and small welfare increases for those looking to purchase homes with little of their own equity. The reasons for this are explained further below. However, this impact is expected to be minimal Housing market incidence The current tax rules create biases for those investing in housing. The biggest bias is for owner-occupiers with equity in their house. This is because we do not tax imputed rents, while other investments made by owner-occupiers are taxed. This provides an incentive for people to invest in their own home. In a simple theoretical model we would expect:  owner-occupiers who are able to finance housing with their own equity to be willing to pay the most to acquire a property.  the Group next most willing to pay the most for a house are landlords with substantial equity. This is because the interest rate on lending is less than the interest rate on borrowing.  the Group next most willing to pay the most for a house are landlords that need to borrow to invest in housing  finally the least advantaged group are likely to be first home buyers or others buying a house to live in who have little of their own capital. This is because even though these purchasers are not taxed on their imputed rental income, they also cannot deduct interest. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 34 Taxing capital gains on non-owner occupied properties is likely to improve the position of this fourth group of potential owner-occupiers with little of their own capital. As a result, this is the group likely to benefit from any potential housing market impacts of taxing more capital gains. However, as explained above, we expect this impact to be small IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 35 Appendix B: Assumptions in forecast revenue for taxing more capital gains Assumption: Growth rate 114. Residential investment property is assumed to grow at a 3% nominal annual rate (2% inflation plus 1% real growth rate) similar to what is projected in the 2018 Budget Economic and Fiscal Update. 16 That rate is also used for other categories of real property. 115. New Zealand shares are assumed to appreciate at 3% per year. 17 Assumption: Size of base 116. The table below shows how initial values (from 1 April 2021) were derived from the most recently available data. From the most recent data available, prices are assumed to increase at a rate of 3% per year until 1 April 2021. In addition, the base for residential investment property and commercial and industrial are presumed to increase by an additional 2.8% to reflect additional building investment. Base Data Source Observation Date Value at Observation Date ($Billion) Grossed-Up Value at 1 April 2021 ($Billion) Residential rental property Reserve Bank Household Balance Sheet December 2017 269 324 Commercial, industrial and other property Corelogic October 2017 217 261 Rural Corelogic October 2017 181 199 Domestic shares Reserve Bank Household Balance Sheet and Managed Fund Assets March 2018 131 143 Assumption: Turnover rate 117. The costing incorporates a realisation basis. For real property categories, average holding periods are taken from Core Logic data as of the first quarter 2018. These are: 16 BEFU 2018 projects house prices to increase by 3.4% in 2021 and 3.7% in 2022. 17 NZX capital index information shows New Zealand shares appreciated by 3.7% per year on average from 1990 – 2017. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 36 • Residential investment property – 6.40 years; • Commercial and industrial property – 7.12 years; • Agricultural property – 6.90 years. 118. New Zealand shares are assumed to have an average turnover rate of 33% (based on data from World Federation of Exchanges). Assumption: lock-in effect 119. The costings assume that taxing more capital gains will cause behavioural changes through a “lock-in effect”. The costings assume that the turnover rate will reduce by 20% as a result of this lock-in effect. The Secretariat are working to source better data to refine this assumption. Assumption: rollover relief 120. The Group has agreed to provide rollover relief for inheritances, relationship property settlements and involuntary disposals. The costings assume that 8% of land transactions and 5% of share transactions are subject to these rollovers. This is based on analysis by the Secretariat on the estimated values of these in New Zealand. Risks: Risks that the forecast revenue could be understated 121. Unknown parts of the base – The forecast base uses elements of the base that are known through published statistics – values of real property and New Zealand shares. Some elements of the base are not known and so are not costed. These include – residential property that is not owner-occupied housing or residential investment property (eg, second homes), shares in Australian listed companies, and shares in private companies and intangible property such as goodwill, brands, trademarks and intellectual property. Risks: Risks that the forecast revenue could be overstated 122. Overlap with current revenue account property – Some property is already subject to tax on gain when sold (revenue account property). The most significant of these are real property sold by developers and dealers. This is not adjusted for due to lack of information. This also includes property subject to the brightline rule and taxable under the intention test. Risks that could either overstate or understate the forecast 123. Variation from assumptions – actual conditions may vary from what is assumed. In particular, the actual appreciation rate is likely to vary over time and be both above and below the assumed growth rate at times. Other factors, such as size of the base and turnover rates, could also vary from the assumptions. IN-CONFIDENCE IN-CONFIDENCE 37 References Bartolini, D.

Small value disputes The Group is considering whether or not there should be some form of truncated or reduced set of rules for either disputes of low value or those involving small businesses. The concern is that the complexity of the rules involve disproportionate expense to small taxpayers with the effect that they pay the tax rather than dispute it. (burn off) 1 Inland Revenue has noted that there is similar burnoff at their end with small value disputes. In my view the best option is to get the Tax Advocate service up and running and then seek advice from them as to potential improvements. Officials agree that this approach merits consideration. However if the Group does wish to go further I have some possible suggestions which mostly involve minor tweaks to the existing processes and law. I do, however, return to the Group’s advice in the interim report of the importance of deep and significant technical capab ility across ... investigation staff. I have focused on the situations where taxpayer burnoff is suboptimal. That is either where the Department’s application of the law is actually wrong or it situations where the law is unclear. 2 Inland Revenue is wrong The cases where Inland Revenue is incorrect in pursuing disputes tend to involve one or all of the following factors: Complex law; •Inexperienced, junior or poorly supported investigators; •Inadequate or incomplete responses from taxpayers to initial inquiries. 3 Co mplex law It is no longer difficult for some of the more complex pieces of legislation such as the financial arrangements, land sales, associated person, foreign investment fund and double tax agreements to apply to relatively low level economic activity. 4 1 From reading the 2008 NZICA/NZLS paper I note that these are the same concerns of the 1994 Richardson Committee which lead to the introduction of the current rules. 2 I have not considered situations where the taxpayer is legally wrong, doesn’t like the outcome but would pursue it if they had more resources. 3 These factors can often be addressed at the conference stage when a senior technical person within the department reviews the case and acts as a facilitator potentially with a view to settling the case. However at that stage both the Department and the taxpayer have expended significant resource. 4 That is owing a foreign holiday house, small scale property development or receiving a foreign pension. With a few exceptions, broadly these rules apply to all transactions large and small, often with quite significant tax effects as to whether the rules apply or not. The reason for relatively uniform application is to not create boundaries between large and small transactions or taxpayers. In my view this will be the key aspect where Inland Revenue incorrectly takes cases. However it will be exacerbated by the next two factors. Inexperienced, junior or poorly supported investigators In such cases an investigator won’t understand that what might intuitively seem like the wrong result is in fact technically correct. Examples could include: • If the FIF rules applied; a foreign pension shouldn’t be returned or • Interest income was netted off within a financial arrangement calculation. Although all of this can equally work the other way and cases are not taken where they should be. The Group has already addressed this in its interim report with its recommendation that: Inland Revenue must continue to invest in deep and significant technical capability across its investigation staff. Perhaps the Group could stress this again in the final report as a mechanism of ensuring cases are not taken incorrectly as well as ensuring that all correct cases are taken. Inadequate or incomplete responses from taxpayers to initial inquiries In such cases taxpayers or their agents, potentially out of fear of the Department, may choose to bluster rather than directly address an investigator’s queries. Such behaviour in turn can make an investigator think the taxpayer or agent is hiding something and then look to escalate the dispute. To the extent that the taxpayer, or agent, is right that the tax paid is correct but they are not confident of the technical arguments, the Group’s recommendation for a Tax Advocate to assist small taxpayers resolve disputes will be helpful here. Also the suggestions discussed below could also be useful in this situation. Grey areas There are also situations which are highly fact based such as capital/revenue, permanent place of abode, or anything involving intention where none of the above apply; it is just simply that the Department and the taxpayer have different views on how the law applies to the facts. 5 In those cases, particularly if they involve precedent Inland Revenue will be better resourced than the taxpayer to conduct the dispute. Having the taxpayer concede due to lack of resources may not give the right outcome from a public policy perspective. Possible tweaks to the existing processes While the Tax Advocate service will better level the respective resources there are also other options that could be considered: 1) Expansion of the threshold 6 for a Commissioner issued Notice of Proposed Adjustment. 7 Currently it is $5,000 of tax at stake. This could be raised to $10,000. A simpler document from the Commissioner could help taxpayers better understand what the issue was and provide an additional incentive for the Department to be succinct. 2) Extension of the response period by the taxpayer once the NOPA has been received. Currently it is two months. While it would seem counterintuitive to allow small disputes longer to respond than large disputes; to the extent these are taxpayers (and agents) who are not experienced with the process extra time would give them a better chance of producing their facts and discussion of the law in a compelling way. This could be in conjunction with using the Tax Advocate service. 3) Extending the threshold for allowing taxpayers to truncate the dispute and go to Court. One of cases for Commissioner agreement is that the tax at stake is $75,000 8 . This could be increased further to say $100,00 or $150,000 without any loss of credibility in the process. However, in my view, these options are second order compared to the Tax Advocate and well trained investigation staff. My recommendation is that the Group focus on those two aspects in its final report for the timely resolution of small value disputes. Andrea Black 19 October 2018 5 Where the Department’s position is considered to be contrary to the underlying policy; representations can be made to Policy officials and the Revenue Minister for a law change. This occurred with the debt capitalisation issue in 2014. 6 Paragraph 79 https://www.ird.govt.nz/resources/4/4/4490832d-e2fe-4ad3-a4b5-0ad965fe97b7/sps-16-05- disputes-resolution-commenced-commissioner.pdf This is an administrative threshold only. That is it is not in the law but something the Department has agreed to do. 7 A notice of proposed adjustment is the first document of the formal dispute process. There can, however, be extensive communication and discussions before this document is issued. 8 Paragraph 167 https://www.ird.govt.nz/resources/4/4/4490832d-e2fe-4ad3-a4b5-0ad965fe97b7/sps-16-05- disputes-resolution-commenced-commissioner.pdf

Introduction 1.1 Purpose 1. In its Interim Report, the Group noted that it would provide recommendations regarding potential changes to personal tax rates and thresholds of income tax in its Final Report in February 2019. The Interim Report made some comments regarding considerations for changing rates and thresholds. 2. The main conclusions from previous officials’ advice (released alongside the Interim Report) suggest the following: • If the goal of the reform is to improve disposable incomes of the poorest households, transfers (e.g., welfare benefits or tax credits) are generally more targeted than income tax reductions. • Some people who have low taxable incomes will not necessarily have persistently low household incomes. In particular, many of those with low taxable incomes are those with temporarily low incomes (e.g., 15-24 year olds and students), those who get support through the welfare system (i.e., superannuitants and social welfare recipients), or those with low incomes who are in higher income households. • Income tax reductions would generally be a more expensive way of assisting the poorest households compared to changes in the transfer system as reductions in the lowest tax thresholds will also increase the disposable income of higher income households. This is because anyone earning income above the threshold(s) where tax rates are reduced receives the full benefit of the rate reduction. • If the goal of reform is to provide benefits that target low and middle income earners (for example a full time worker on the minimum wage), then the transfer system will be a more effective tool than the tax system if the goal is solely to provide income support. Income tax reductions would generally be a more expensive way of assisting these households. 3. This paper provides advice to the Group to help inform its further consideration of these issues. The following table provides some guidance on the options available to achieve particular goals, taking into account the terms of reference restrictions on increasing any tax rates. Treasury:4024866v1 6 Table 1: Goals and measures Goal Measure Points to note Improve disposable incomes of the poorest households Increase welfare benefits This option is outside the Group’s mandate but is an important possibility to keep in mind. Increase progressivity of the tax system on an individual basis Tax-free zone or reduce the 10.5% rate. Some of the cost of this will arise from cutting taxes on those such as students/children, many of whom only have temporary low incomes. Higher income households also receive the maximum benefit in dollar terms from this change. Improve disposable incomes of full-time working lower income earners Reduce 17.5% rate or increase first ($14,000) tax threshold. Limits benefits to students/children who may only have temporarily low income Improve disposable incomes of full-time working lower income earners and limit benefits to higher income earners Reduce 17.5% rate and increase 30% rate or do something similar through threshold changes. Introduce abating low- income tax credit Provides benefits to lower income earners without benefits also passing to higher income earners. This will increase effective marginal tax rates for anyone facing the rate above current 17.5% rate, or anyone whose low-income tax credit is abating. Increasing the 30% tax rate is also outside the Group’s mandate but this is another option to consider 4. This paper should be considered in conjunction with the paper Potential revenue- neutral packages. This paper illustrates some options that may be available to the Group as part of a wider revenue neutral package. 1.2 Content and scope 5. Initial advice from the Secretariat, released alongside the Group’s Interim Report, included a brief discussion on changes to tax rates and thresholds. The options Treasury:4024866v1 7 pre sented were a mix of decreasing rates, increasing thresholds, offering a tax free threshold, inflation indexing income tax brackets, and decreasing the GST rate. 6. This paper explores potential changes to personal income tax rates and thresholds and how these could be used to meet the objective of enhancing the living standards of New Zealanders, particularly for those on low incomes. 7. This paper does not provide further analysis on reducing the GST rate. The Group concluded in its Interim Report that this rate should not be changed. This paper also does not consider increasing the top tier income rate because that is outside the Group’s terms of reference. In addition, this paper does not provide any further advice on inflation-indexing or one-off adjustments to income tax thresholds to mitigate fiscal drag. The Group has also ruled out these options. 8. The table in Appendix B illustrates that, under current policy, a change in tax rate will not flow through to benefits for most recipients of social welfare payments (the main exception to this is New Zealand Superannuation). This occurs as many benefits are set as an after-tax amount. In its interim report, the Group noted that they believe that income tax reductions should benefit all low income households, including households in receipt of social assistance payments. 9. Given that the scope of this paper is options available within the tax system, it does not provide analysis of how the objectives could be met by changes to the transfers system (ie, benefits or tax credits). However, it is noted where the transfers system might be better placed to meet objectives. It is also noted that both the tax and the transfer system have impacts on marginal tax rates (the transfer system through benefit abatements) and affect incentives to work, save and invest. 10. The Secretariat also notes that the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG) is reviewing the welfare system. The WEAG may recommend changes to tax credits and other transfers to support income adequacy and poverty reduction, or otherwise improve the transfer system. The Secretariat will recommend to Ministers that any changes to tax rates and thresholds should be considered alongside any recommendations made by the WEAG. 11. This paper presents analysis based on tax cuts which would cost approximately $2 billion per annum. This builds on options that were examined as part of officials’ advice prior to the Interim Report. This is the estimated cost of the tax cuts but does not include any costing for adjustments to provide benefit recipients with an equivalent increase in income. Extending the analysis to allow benefit recipients an equivalent increase in income will be carried out more fully as part of advice for session 23. However, indicative examples, of likely effects are provided in Appendix C to this report to give a preliminary impression of what the costs of doing this are likely to be. Further analysis of the Group’s preferred option(s) could also consider how various options could be scaled for a diff ere nt level of costing. 12. This paper provides some distributional analysis on how different groups of taxpayers with different income levels would be impacted by changes to tax rates or thresholds. More detailed analysis can be provided once the Group provides an indication of its preferred directions of reform, including how tax changes interact Treasury:4024866v1 8 with a batement of welfare and social assistance to provide effective marginal tax rate analysis. Treasury:4024866v1 9 2. Problem definition and objectives 2.1 Context 13. One of the key tasks for the Group has been to assess the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system. The Group noted in its Interim Report that while the tax system has many strengths, it is not particularly progressive. 14. The Group noted that their objective in considering change to personal income taxation was to enhance the living standards of New Zealanders, particularly for those on low incomes. Further, that their deliberations over the coming months would be informed by several key metrics: • The distributional impact of options for change – including judgements on how options for change affect the progressivity of the tax system, and whether taxes or transfers are the best option for improving the living standards of lower income households. • Impacts on incentives to save, work, and invest. • The extent to which options increase or reduce the integrity of the tax system. • The revenue impacts of options for change. 15. The Interim Report also stated that reductions to the lower tax rates and/or thresholds would be the most progressive means of assisting low and middle income earners through the tax system. If the Government wishes to improve incomes for very low income households, on the other hand, the best means of doing so will be through welfare transfers. Ultimately the progressivity of the tax system will also be impacted by any other changes, for example extending the taxation of capital gains which will also increase the progressivity of the tax system. 16. Further, the Group noted that they believe that income tax reductions should benefit all low income households, including households on benefits. To that end, the Group stated that any tax reductions will need to be paired with equivalent increases in benefit levels to ensure a fair treatment of all income earners. So far we have only been able to provide very rough indicative costings for equivalent increases in benefits for the options presented in this paper (see Appendix C). 1 Ultimately, Ministers will need to consider any changes to tax rates and thresholds alongside any recommendations made by the WEAG. 17. The income tax system works on an individual basis. Accordingly, delivering any of these outcomes through changes to the income tax system would impact taxpayers on an individual basis. Measures which depend on family circumstances, such as Working for Families tax credits are not being considered in this paper. 18. In considering the best option for altering personal tax rates or thresholds, it is necessary to clearly identify the objectives the Group wants to achieve. The Secretariat has identified some potential objectives, as follows: 1 These estimates make use of various simplified assumptions, and should be interpreted with caution. Treasury:4024866v1 10 • To reduce income inequ ality generally. • To improve disposable incomes of the poorest households. • To provide benefits that target low to middle income earners (for example a full time worker on the minimum wage). • To improve incomes for low to middle income earners and at the same time also have additional benefits to labour supply, savings and productivity. 2.2 Current tax profile 19. Current tax rates and thresholds are as follows: Table 2: Current tax rates Income Tax rate (%) 0 - $14,000 10.5 $14,001 - $48,000 17.5 $48,001 – $70,000 30 $70,001 + 33 20. The application of these thresholds is illustrated in the following examples: Table 3: Examples Income Current tax Average tax rate % Josh $38,000 $5,670 ($5,150 if IETC claimed) 14.92% (13.55% if IETC claimed) Greg $60,000 $11,020 18.37% Alex $120,000 $30,520 25.43% 21.

The spikes indicate taxable transfers, where multiple individuals have the same level of taxable income.

The data is based on aggregate taxable income and income tax for people in each income band. The income and tax information is derived from IR3 tax returns, personal tax summaries, and employer PAYE informa tion. For people who are non- filers, taxable income is assumed to be their total PAYE gross earnings in the year ended 31 March. PAYE gross earnings can in clude income from employment, and also taxable welfare benefits, New Zealand Super, earnings-rela ted ACC, student allowances, and paid parental leave. 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,000 0 50,000 100,000150,000200,000250,000 0 4,000 8,000 12,000 16,000 20,000 24,000 28,000 32,000 36,000 40,000 44,000 48,000 52,000 56,000 60,000 64,000 68,000 72,000 76,000 80,000 84,000 88,000 92,000 96,000 100,000 104,000 108,000 112,000 116,000 120,000 124,000 128,000 132,000 136,000 140,000 144,000 148,000 Taxable income and tax assessed ($M) Number of people Distribution of Taxable Income Number of People Taxable Income ($M) Tax Assessed ($M) Treasury:4024866v1 12 22. The table below shows the number of people earning within the current tax thresholds: Table 4: Current tax thresholds Income ($) Number of people (2017) Percentage % 0-14,000 786,190 3 20.8% 14,001-48,000 1,719,910 45.6% 48,001-70,000 611,870 16.2% Over 70,000 654,950 17.4% 23. Roughly two-thirds of taxpayers have incomes below $48,000 and are on the bottom two marginal tax rates. From those with income between $0 and $14,000, 350,000 people had income between $7,000 and $14,000. Some of these will, however, be individuals who may not be in long-term hardship (for example children and students). 3 This includes 98,000 people on nil income, People with negative income because of losses are recorded as having nil taxable income in the tables. Treasury:4024866v1 13 3. Evaluation criteria 3.1 Criteria for analysis 24. Some key considerations for evaluating the potential options are: efficiency, equity, revenue costs, administrative and compliance impacts and overall effect on the integrity of the tax system. • Efficiency – evaluating efficiency involves consideration of how taxation distorts incentives to work and to accumulate physical and human capital. These distortions depend of the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) faced by the individual. Normally, a higher EMTR leads to a disproportionate increase in the distortion in activity. This EMTR does not solely depend on the tax system, but also the way the individual interacts with the transfer system. High EMTRs create a disincentive to work and will have flow on impacts through to work/saving/investment decisions. Lowering the tax rate for the lower tax thresholds will lower the EMTR for earners on lower incomes and thereby increase incentives for additional work for these individuals. • Equity -understanding the distributional impacts of a proposal allows us to analyse how well the option will meet equity based objectives such as reducing income inequality and benefiting earners on the lower income end of the scale. As noted in previous advice to the Group, New Zealand’s tax and transfer system reduces inequality less than the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average, and there is higher income inequality in New Zealand compared with the OECD average. However the bulk of redistribution in New Zealand occurs through transfers rather than tax. This is consistent with most other countries. • Revenue cost – the options presented in this paper have been costed at approximately $2 billion. • Compliance and administrative costs – consideration of how easy it would be to comply with and to administer the proposed option. • Integrity of the tax system – this considers whether the change fits into the tax system as a whole and if it impacts coherency of the tax system. 25. Any changes to the tax system will generally require trade-offs between the above criteria and the best-fit option will depend on value judgements about what should be achieved. 26. Where possible, we have also commented on the impact on the four capitals as described in the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework. Treasury:4024866v1 14 3.2 Income inequality measures 27. In addition to the considerations above, previous advice from the Treasury (2008) 4 on tax changes to address income inequality noted that the following judgements are required: • whether to focus on absolute or proportional reductions. For example, ensuring that a very large proportion of taxpayers receive the same dollar value reduction in their taxes could be achieved by establishing a tax free zone, whereas ensuring that all taxpayers receive the same percentage reduction in tax paid could be achieved by reducing all tax rates, with lower tax rates reducing by less than higher rates. • whether to focus on all taxpayers or only those who cannot be reached directly by targeting. Policies such as Working for Families, benefits, and superannuation can boost the incomes of particular groups, so a package could be focused on the remaining taxpayers rather than all taxpayers. • whether to focus on tax in isolation or in relation to other government policies. A tax package can be situated as part of a portfolio of initiatives and inequality assessed across the portfolio, rather than on its own. • whether to focus on the individual or the household. Tax lends itself most immediately to comparisons at the individual level, yet analysis at the household level is arguably more economically relevant. 3.3 Characteristics of low income taxpayers 28. In considering the best options, it is also important to understand more about the characteristics of low income taxpayers. A decomposition by individual and household characteristics shows that different groups of low-income taxpayers can be affected differently by various aspects of the tax-and-transfer system. As shown in Box 1 below, reforms involving tax-free zones may not be well targeted to help those most in need (Creedy et al., 2010). Box 1: Characteristics of low income tax payers The allocation of low income individuals to groups is sometimes used to identify if these groups are sensitive to tax policy changes. The table below gives a breakdown of individuals and groups of individuals that earn less than $18,000 per annum. 5 4 The Treasury – illustrative options for personal tax reductions – T2008/456, 20 March 2008. 5 Based on Household Economic Survey (HES) 2006/07. Treasury:4024866v1 15 Based on the analysis a tax-free zone may be a poorly targeted redistributive instrument for 89 per cent (sum A1 – A3) of individuals in this income category. 6 The following excerpt explains A1, A2 and A3 characteristics. “A1 – disposable income is insensitive to tax changes at low income levels (for example, post-tax income is determined by a legislative formula). A2 – Low-income individuals benefit from the income of others or individual taxable income is quite different from a welfare metric such as income per adult-equivalent person (for example, when individuals are members of a higher-income household) A3 – Low taxable income is short-term only (for example, students).” (Creedy et al., 2010, p. 47). This is mainly because these individuals can be characterised as: i. Individuals receiving social welfare payments that are less affected by tax design at low-income levels (e.g. A1 superannuants and beneficiaries). 7 ii. Individuals relying on other economic or disposable income (e.g. A2: self-employed, recipients of FTCs, secondary earners and 15–17 year-olds). iii. Those likely to have temporarily low taxable income (e.g. A3: 24 year-olds and students). In addition, tax changes which reduce tax paid on benefit income are compensated by an equivalent change in gross benefit payments to leave after-tax benefit payments unchanged. As a result, income tax changes are therefore viewed as a poor instrument to target core benefit recipients. Lastly when examining the data at a household level, most households affected are in higher income ranges (i.e. $30,000 - $70,000). 29. The Treasury undertook analysis on tax rate and threshold change design options in preparation for Budget 2008. The work suggested that the personal tax system has limitations in that it can only moderately influence income inequality. The work also found low taxable income can often be a poor proxy for those on persistently low 6 The analysis also found that only around 11 per cent of low-income individuals might benefit from a tax cut on low incomes, such as a tax-free zone, compared to other policy options. 7 Tax changes affecting those at low incomes only affect New Zealand Superannuation recipients in the short term due to the NZ Super formula-based adjustment. However some of the core benefit rates are set in legislation net-of-tax. Treasury:4024866v1 16 household incomes. In addition it was also suggested that a focus on households rather than individuals gives a better sense of impacts on most taxpayers’ wellbeing. Treasury:4024866v1 17 4. Options 30. This chapter considers three options within the scope of the personal income tax system that could be used to achieve the various objectives stated above. Those options are: • changes to tax rates; • changes to tax thresholds (including a tax-free threshold); and • the use of tax credits. 31. Changes to tax rate and tax thresholds have similar impacts on equity and efficiency outcomes. The effects of these options are discussed together and then comparisons provided for the numbers of people affected by each option and any differences in expected distributional outcomes. 4.1 Changes to tax rates or tax thresholds 32. The following tables illustrate the options for changing tax rates and tax thresholds, alongside illustrative examples for how these changes would flow through to individuals (see Appendix A for indicative examples at the household level). 33. The options presented for each category have been initially costed at approximately $2 billion per annum (this costing does not include costs involved if the net benefit is also provided to recipients of social welfare payments). Table 5: Options for tax rate (1) Income tax scale Option 1A Option 1B Option 1C 0 - $14,000 5.25 10.5 10.5 $14,001 - $48,000 17.5 14.75 17.5 $48,001 – $70,000 30 30 22.5 $70,001 + 33 33 33 Table 6: Changes to tax rates - examples Income Current tax Option 1A Option 1B Option 1C Josh $38,000 $5,670 $4935 ($735 less tax) $5,010 ($660 less tax) $5670 ($- same tax) Greg $60,000 $11,020 $10,285 ($735 less tax) $10,085 ($935 less tax) $10,120 ($900 less tax) Alex $120,000 $30,520 $29,785 ($735 less tax) $29,585 ($935 less tax) $28,870 ($1,650 less tax) 34. A second approach is to change tax thresholds rather than tax rates, for example, providing a tax free threshold of $7,000 or shifting the first income bracket up to $26,000. Treasury:4024866v1 18 Table 7: Options for tax thresholds (2) Income tax rate Option 2A Option 2B Option 2C 10.5% 0-$26,000 0-$14,000 $7,000 - $14,000 (0 -$7,000 tax free) 17.5% $26,001 - $48,000 $14,001 - $59,000 $14,001 - $48,000 30% $48,001 - $70,000 $59,001 - $70,000 $48,001 - $70,000 33% $70,001 $70,001 $70,001 Table 8: Changes to thresholds - examples Income Current tax Option 2A Option 2B Option 2C Josh $38,000 $5,670 $4,830 (840 less tax) $5,670 (- same tax) $4,935 (735 less tax) Greg $60,000 $11,020 $10,180 (840 less tax) $9645 (1375 less tax) $10,285 (735 less tax) Alex $120,000 $30,520 $29,680 (840 less tax) $29,145 (1375 less tax) $28,035 (735 less tax) Distributional analysis and equity considerations 35. If society is concerned about inequality, a more progressive tax system is generally considered to be positive for the accumulation of social capital, as it helps to reduce income inequality and enhance social connections and increase social capital. 36. Any cuts to tax rates will benefit all individuals being taxed at that marginal rate as well as those with higher incomes. The maximum benefit will go to those earning at the ceiling of the relevant threshold or above. Similarly, any increase in a threshold will benefit those earning between the new and old threshold as well as those earning more with the full benefit going to those earning at the level of the new threshold or above. 37. Option 1A, reducing the first rate, would affect all income earners. Option 1B, a reduction to the second rate, would impact most earners. However 800,000 people earn below $14,000, and they would not be affected by this option. Option 1C would reduce the third rate only and therefore would not provide a tax cut to 2.5 million people (about two-thirds of taxpayers). 38. An individual earning the minimum wage for 35 hours a week equates to $30,030 yearly. They would pay $735 less tax under Option 1A, and $440 less tax under Option 1B. They would not benefit under Option 1C. 39. Option 2A, increasing the first thresholds, would affect all people earning upwards of $14,000 per annum. Approximately 800,000 8 of the lowest earners would not benefit from this change. Although, as was pointed out earlier, not all in this group are necessarily in hardship. Option 2B would decrease tax paid for all individuals earning upwards of $48,000 (like option 1C it would not provide a tax cut for 2.5 million people). A tax-free threshold would benefit all earners. 8 This includes 98,000 people on nil income. Treasury:4024866v1 19 40. An i ndividual earning minimum wage would pay $735 less tax under Option 2C, and $840 less tax under Option 2A. They would not benefit under Option 2B. 41. Figure 2 illustrates the average gain by disposable household income decile (equivalised) as a result of changes to tax rates. Understanding the impact of the proposed changes by decile allows for analysis of the impact on households depending on their socio-economic circumstances. These deciles have been ranked by equivalised disposable household income e.g., households in decile 1 are in the lowest ten percent of income–earning households in New Zealand, decile 2 the next lowest ten percent. Figure 2: Average annual benefit of rate reduction by household (2015/16), excluding changes to benefits 9 42. The graph reinforces the importance of focusing on the first two income rates/thresholds to provide benefits to lower income households, as they provide larger impacts to household income for all deciles up to and including decile 7. 9 Source: The Treasury. Estimated using Treasury’s micro-simulation model of the tax and welfare system. Treasury:4024866v1 20 43. Fi gure 3 illustrates that similar results are found for distributional outcomes for a tax cut in the first income tax rate and a tax free threshold. Figure 3: Comparison of decrease in first rate and tax free threshold, 2015/16 10 44. Of the various options discussed above, an increase in the $48,000 threshold and a decrease in the third marginal tax rate (30%) would not provide any benefit to roughly two-thirds of taxpayers. For this reason we focus on the other four options below. 45. The following comparisons can be made between the options in regards to the number of people affected and how the benefits from tax changes affect different income levels. 46. In general, options for changes to the bottom two tax thresholds affect the highest number of individuals. Table 9 estimates the number of individuals who would receive some or all of the benefit for each change. Table 9: Estimated numbers of taxpayers who gain by option 11 Option Max gain per person Est. number who gain Est. number who gain full amount Income where full gain achieved Tax free threshold $735 3.7 million 3.3 million $7,000 Decrease 10.5% rate $735 3.7 million 3.0 million $14,000 Increase threshold to 26,000 $840 3.0 million 2.1 million $26,000 Decrease 17.5% rate $935 3.0 million 1.3 million $48,000 47. Figure 4 further illustrates how the different options 12 would affect levels of income. This illustrates the points where an individual would see an increase in net income. 10 Source: The Treasury. Estimated using Treasury’s micro-simulation model of the tax and welfare system 11 Estimated numbers are based on 2017 data, and rounded to the nearest 100,000. 12 This is based on hypothetical tax scale applied to arbitrary income levels, and no interaction with the benefit or tax system is included. Treasury:4024866v1 21 Figure 4: Effect of tax rate and threshold changes Efficiency 48. The efficiency consequences of a tax rate cut can be considered in terms of the change in labour supply incentives, and the change in incentives to accumulate physical, financial, and human capital. 49. The efficiency benefit in terms of labour supply effects depends on the EMTR faced by individuals. Efficiency costs increase disproportionally with EMTRs 13 . 50. A reduction in the lowest tax rate will decrease the EMTR for earners within that band, and also reduce the average tax rate (ATR) for all the bands above it. The lower EMTR will improve efficiency by reducing the tax wedge (the distortion in decisions brought about by tax), while the lower ATR for all groups (including high income earners) above that band creates a fiscal cost. As a result the lower the income band where rates are cut the more expensive the gains from efficiency (through lower EMTRs) are. 51. A reduction in the lowest tax rate will lower the EMTR for earners in this band. This may encourage them to work longer hours. Perhaps more importantly, tax cuts at the bottom can lower average tax rates on those considering whether or not to join the labour force. By making work more attractive, this can increase participation in the labour force. At the same, time the benefit will also extend to those on higher incomes and this can in some cases result in those on higher tax rates working fewer hours. Thus, the overall impact on hours worked is uncertain. 13 EMTRs are also affected by the abatement rules for social assistance payments such as Working for Families or MSD administered payments such as Jobseeker support. For example, abatement for Working for Families entitlements currently begins at $42,700.). $0 $100 $200 $300 $400 $500 $600 $700 $800 $900 $1,000 Incrase in disposable income (ex interactions) Gross annual income Tax free threshold Cut in lowest tax rate Cut in second tax rate Increasing the bottom threshold Treasury:4024866v1 22 52. In addition, changes to the tax rate can affect the incentives to accumulate financial and physical and human capital. The weight of evidence suggests that income taxes affect behaviour in ways that reduce investment in skills, risk taking, and the accumulation of capital. These influences reduce productivity and growth. Evidence points to small but non-trivial reductions in productivity from higher average tax rates 14 . 53. Higher income earners will also benefit from reductions in the first and second tax rate. This is seen by way of individual example, by looking at the distribution graphs for households, and through the graph illustrating the effect of tax rate and threshold changes on income (figure 4). 54. Reducing the lower tax rate will decrease average tax rates across the board, increasing the return for building up human capital. However, it may influence decisions regarding accumulation of human capital by increasing the opportunity cost of investing in higher skillsets (through an increase to the net income from working at lower wage rates). 55. The changes to tax thresholds influence efficiency results in the same way changes in tax rates do. They reduce the marginal tax rate for a group of individuals. As a result, it is the change in EMTRs across the income distribution, and the number of individuals whose choices will be influenced by these changes, which is relevant for evaluating the incentive effects. 56. A tax-free threshold would lower EMTRs by 10.5 percentage points for the 11.6% of taxpayers earning between $0 and $7,000. Dropping the bottom marginal tax rate would reduce EMTRs by 5.25 percentage points for the 20.8% of taxpayers earning less than $14,000. Increasing the first threshold would reduce EMTRs by 7 percentage points for the 24.3% of taxpayers earning between $14,000 and $26,000. Dropping the second marginal tax rate would drop EMTRs by 2.75 percentage points for the 45.6% of taxpayers earning between $14,000 and $46,000. 57. Based on the analysis above, therefore, an important question is what further information does the Group want from officials to help it decide between the various options. 58. This paper focuses on the changes to tax thresholds which have been costed at approximately $2 billion. Further consideration could be given designing tax threshold changes which also provide benefits to making the tax system simpler for people in otherwise more complex situations. This could be designed in a way to help mitigate the crossing of tax thresholds for certain individuals with two sources of income, for example individuals earning Jobseeker Support and working part time. The way to do this would be to set the thresholds at key cut-off points taking into account the benefit system. If designed this way, this could mitigate the need for individuals to seek special tax codes 15 and smooth out tax withheld from secondary income sources. 14 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/about/cpf/publications?a=177146 15 Legislation currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee includes changes to the administration of individuals income tax, including moving from special tax codes to tailored tax codes. Treasury:4024866v1 23 4.1 Tax cred its with abatements 59. Another option that could be considered is the use of a tax credit. Examples of tax credits currently used are Working for Families Tax Credits, and the Independent Earners Tax Credit (IETC). Consideration of the Working for Families Tax Credit is outside of the terms of reference. However, consideration could be given to expanding, or altering the current IETC, or introducing a new low income credit. 60. The IETC currently provides $10 per week ($520 per year) to individuals earning between $24,000 and $44,000 who do not receive Working for Families or other social welfare entitlements. The IETC abates at a rate of 13 cents for every dollar of income over $44,000, meaning it is fully abated at $48,000. 61. The IETC currently provides $10 per week ($520 per year) to individuals earning between $24,000 and $44,000 who do not receive Working for Families or other social welfare entitlements. The IETC abates at a rate of 13 cents for every dollar of income over $44,000, meaning it is fully abated at $48,000. In the examples provided above at paragraphs 33 and 34 only Josh would benefit from a tax credit which abates at $48,000. If the tax credit had the same characteristics as the IETC but was increased in value to be $1,020 per year, he would pay this amount less in tax for the year (equating to a $20 saving per week). 62. If the Group wants to provide a tax cut to those on low incomes, without that tax cut benefiting high income earners, this option could be considered. This option would achieve the same result as lowering one of the lower marginal rates, and increasing one of the higher marginal rates to ensure that the benefit that is received by those on lower incomes is effectively “clawed back” by the higher tax rate for those on higher incomes. Doing this directly through tax rate changes would increase marginal tax rates for some but would not increase the total amount of tax that anyone pays. 63. For example, say the Group wants to increase the lowest threshold (from its current $14,000) so that those who are earning in the lower end of the second bracket ($14,000 to $48,000) receive a tax cut of a maximum of $1,000, but that by the time the third threshold comes in ($48,000), the tax cut no longer applies. This sort of system would limit the benefit to those earning a bit below the median wage, and those earning the median wage would get no benefit (median wage is approximately $51,000). 64. The following tax structure achieves that result: Table 10: Example tax structure Thresholds Tax rate $0 - $28 285 10.5% $28 286 - $48 000 22.6% $48 001 - $70 000 30% $70 001 - 33% Treasury:4024866v1 24 65. Th e same effect can be achieved by keeping the existing rate structure and introducing an abating tax credit. The existing structure is: Table 11: Existing tax structure Thresholds Tax rate $0 - $14 000 10.5% $14 001 - $48 000 17.5% $48 001 - $70 000 30% $70 001 - 33% 66. The tax credit would be $1,000 for anyone earning over $14,000, abating at 5.1% from the first dollar. 67. Figure 5 below illustrates the average tax rates by income that are created with the low income tax credit. Figure 5: Average tax rates – low income tax credit 68. This approach is likely to be more progressive than changes to the tax rates or thresholds, as it limits the benefits of the tax reduction to those in the identified target zone. At the same time, it would be pushing up EMTRs in the range where the credit is abating. 69. If the Group wants further analysis of this type of option, the Secretariat could report back in a later meeting, but would need guidance on: • What sort of groups the Group want to provide a tax cut for? • What sort of income level the Group do not want the tax cut to apply to? Treasury:4024866v1 25 • The amount of tax cut (on a per person basis). 4.2 Interaction with social assistance payments 70. While the average benefits from decreasing the lower tax rates and thresholds for lower income tax brackets make a difference in the incomes for these targeted groups, changes to income tax rates and thresholds have impacts on the level of entitlements for some welfare recipients. Assuming current welfare policies are unchanged, then the following impacts should be noted: • Some social welfare payments (e.g. jobseeker support, sole parent and supported living) are set at a level that ensures the benefit recipients receive a given amount after tax. While the gross benefit amount will reduce with a change in tax, the net amount the person will receive should not change. To provide the same benefits from a decrease in effective tax rates to those individuals receiving social welfare payments, an additional increase to the net amount of a benefit would need to be made. • NZ Superannuation and veterans pension rates are set on a gross basis, and therefore recipients will benefit directly from a reduction in tax rates and thresholds. Table 12: Recipients of main social assistance (as at 31 March 2018) Type Number Jobseeker support 118,755 Sole parent support 58,830 Supported living payment 92,473 71. The amount of support received depends on the individual’s circumstances. 72. The following example illustrates the difference between an individual who receives Jobseeker Support and a second individual who earns the same amount from employment income. A single person, aged over 25 years would receive Jobseeker Support of $215.34 per week after tax ($240.60 gross). 16 Table 13: Jobseeker support example 17 Individual Current Net Income Option 1A (10.5% cut to 5.25%) Wage earner $11,197.68 $11,854.17 Recipient of Jobseeker support $11,197.68 $11,197.68 16 Rates for Jobseeker Support depend on circumstances, https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/products/benefit-rates/benefit-rates-april-2018.html 17 This example relates to a single person, aged over 25 years and receiving only Jobseeker Support. The examples do not include non-tax deductions. It also doesn’t take any other social assistance payments the individual may be eligible for, e.g., accommodation support payments. Treasury:4024866v1 26 73. Provided an individual is earning income from other sources (in addition to or instead of receiving certain assistance payment) lowest income individuals will have increased after-tax income from a reduction in the lowest tax rates applied to this income. 74. In this example, the recipient of Jobseeker Support would require an increase in their support payment of $656.49 per annum ($12.60 per week) in order to receive the same increase in after-tax income as someone who currently earns the same gross amount as the Jobseeker support payment. 75. A sole parent receiving the Sole Parent Support payment may also be contrasted with a wage earner with a yearly income of $19,867, or $382.07 per week before tax. As shown in table 14 below, the wage earner would receive benefits from a tax cut to the lowest rate which result in an after tax income of $18,105, which is $735 additional net income per annum ($14 per week). Option 1C is not included in the below table, as it would not change the tax outcome for either individual. Table 14: Sole parent support example Individual Current Net Income Option 1A (10.5% cut to 5.25%) Option 1B (17.5% cut to 14.75%) Wage earner $17,370 $18,105 $17,532 Recipient of Sole parent support $17,370 $17,370 $17,370 4.3 Constraints in analysis 76. The quantitative analysis in this paper is preliminary work which has not fully integrated the impacts on beneficiaries, and does not yet incorporate EMTR analysis. Further direction from the Group on options that it is interested in will assist in narrowing down options for further analysis. Treasury:4024866v1 27 5. Conclusion 5.1 Concluding thoughts and discussion 77. To provide benefits to individuals on lower incomes, either the first or the second tax rate (or threshold) needs to be targeted. The key advantage to lowering the second tax rate is that this also affects a zone where families are receiving assistance such as Working for Families tax credits, causing households to face high EMTRs. 78. If the concern is low incomes received by individuals, a tax-free threshold or a reduction to the lowest tax rate might appear to be the preferred options as approximately a fifth of taxpayers don’t exceed the $14,000 threshold. However, within this range are some including students and children who might not be a key target of concern. 79. Such a change could reduce tax rates for some who are on very high EMTRs, which would reduce poverty traps and increase productivity. However the impact of this may be limited relative to the significant impact of welfare abatements on high EMTRs. Some welfare abatements would also increase to match any income tax reduction, for example where they guarantee a specific minimum income. 80. Reductions to lower rates are unlikely to be the most cost-effective way of targeting low-income households, given that such a policy would also be paying to deliver higher net incomes to high income earners. An alternative is an abating credit, but this has the disadvantaging of increasing EMTR over the range that the credit is abating. 81. In order to provide the same increases in income to households receiving social assistance, so that the tax reduction benefits “flow through” to benefits, the payment rates for these benefits would need to be increased. Analysis on the additional cost of increasing these benefits, and its effect on households, has not been concluded, but would be considered as part of further work, if directed. Indicative preliminary costings are provided in Appendix C. 82. The efficiency impacts illustrate that any changes to the tax system should not be viewed in isolation from the transfers system. Rates of social welfare payment and their abatement have significant impacts on EMTRs for low income individuals and families due to their eligibility for transfer payments. 83. If changes to the tax rates or tax thresholds are made, consideration should be given to the impact on other tax rates such as prescribed income rates (PIRs), fringe benefit tax (FBT), employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and their relationship to the personal income tax scale. 84. This paper should be considered in conjunction with the Potential revenue-neutral packages paper. Treasury:4024866v1 28 5.2 Further analysis 85. Further analysis on the Groups preferred option(s) would identify: • Detailed distributional effects. • Impacts of EMTRs. • Costings of equivalent increases if tax reductions are also provided to recipients of social welfare payments. • How it could be scaled for a given level of revenue. Treasury:4024866v1 29 Appendix A: Examples Further examples on a household basis 1. The following examples give an indication of the impact of certain tax rate and threshold changes on a variety of household types. The examples in the body of the paper refer to impacts on individuals.

Yes – the payment is taxable income and therefore a reduction in the bottom tax rate would increase the after tax amount received by recipients. Notes: • “Net income” is a term used in the Income Tax Act 2007 and refers to the annual gross income of a person minus their annual deductions. • “Family scheme income” is net income, as defined, adjusted to reflect a family’s ability to meet day-to-day living expenses. • “Net basis” refers to an amount after tax i.e. the amount in the hands of the recipient after all deductions including tax. This is distinguishable from “gross basis” which is an amount before tax. Treasury:4024866v1 32 Appendix C: Fiscal cost of extending the tax benefit to benefit recipients The following table gives indicative fiscal costs related to the extension of benefits due to tax cuts and/or threshold change to main benefit recipients (income tested benefits). These estimates make use of various simplified assumptions, and should be interpreted with caution. Further, more detailed fiscal costings can be provided to the Group at a later stage. Table 18: preliminary costings for benefits Income tested benefit (Main benefit) Tax free threshold of $7,000 Reduction in the bottom tax rate from 10.5% to 5.25% Increase first threshold to $26,000 Reduce second rate to 14.75% Jobseeker support (¹) $87 million $52 million $0 million $0 million Sole parent Support (²) $43 million $43 million $24 million $6 million Supported living payment (³) $68 million $61 million $0 million $0 million Young parent payment & youth payment ( 4 ) $2 million 2 million $0 million $0 million Total $200 million $158 million $24 million $6 million (¹) Income equivalent to single job seeker, aged between 18 and 19 years, stays at home, with net weekly benefit of $143.55. (²) Income equivalent to sole parent with net weekly benefit of $334.05. (³) Income equivalent to single aged between 16 and 17, with net weekly benefit of $217.80. ( 4 )Income equivalent to young parent, aged between 16 and 17, living with parents, with net weekly benefit of $169.17. Notes: • Each income tested benefit (apart from sole parent support) consists of various categories with varying net benefits, and some abating at different rates. For the purpose of this analysis, income earned is equivalent to the entry (lowest) category for each benefit. • All estimates are based on a set net income / benefit, with zero abatement. • All benefit rates are based on the latest available rates by the Ministry for Social Development (MSD). 18 • Total cost is derived by multiplying the total amount of benefit recipients per benefit 19 by the cost associates with each chosen category / tax change. 18 https://www.workandincome.govt.nz/online-services/mymsd/index.html 19 As at 01/07/2018. Treasury:4024866v1 33 • Ch anging the net benefit rates has flow on effects in terms of Accommodation Supplement (AS) payments. The entry and abatement thresholds for the AS payments are tied to benefit rates, so in general low income earners receiving AS will get less (as the entry threshold is pushed up) while higher income earners receiving AS will get more (as the abatement threshold is pushed out). On aggregate the change in spending on AS is likely to be negative (i.e., total spending on AS will decrease). Treasury:4024866v1 34 References Creedy, J., Enright, J., Gemmell, N. & McNabb, N.

It also proposes draft text for inclusion in the Final Report (Appendix A). Key points for discussion This paper discusses: a. whether deemed disposals when a taxpayer ceases to be tax resident in New Zealand should: i. apply to all taxable assets held by the taxpayer; ii. be made optional; or iii. be subject to a de minimis threshold; b. if the deemed disposal is not made optional, whether taxpayers should be able to defer payment of tax resulting from a deemed disposal on emigration, and if so, in what circumstances; c. if the deemed disposal is not made optional, whether taxpayers should be able to unwind tax on a deemed disposal on emigration, if they subsequently become tax resident again holding the asset in the same capacity; d. whether the cost base of an asset that enters the tax base on immigration should be the market value of the asset at the time the asset owner becomes tax resident in New Zealand; e. the taxation of foreign investment funds (FIFs), namely: i. whether the fair dividend rate (FDR) should be lowered; ii. whether FDR should apply on a net basis (instead of gross); and iii. whether the comparative value (CV) option for natural persons and family trusts should be removed; f. reasons for and against exempting foreign homes and rental properties owned by New Zealand tax residents.

The first half of the paper discusses, at a high level, the tax treatment that should apply when an individual taxpayer ceases to be tax resident in New Zealand (‘emigration’), and when an individual taxpayer brings taxable assets into the New Zealand tax base by becoming tax resident in New Zealand (‘immigration’). The Group’s interim decision in the Interim Report was that an emigrating taxpayer should be deemed to have disposed of their taxable assets for market value on the day they cease to be tax resident in New Zealand. If there was no deemed disposal, New Zealand could lose taxing rights over the assets. The reasons for deemed disposal on emigration do not apply to New Zealand land and assets attributable to a New Zealand permanent establishment (PE), which remain in the New Zealand tax base even if they are owned by a non-resident. The Secretariat therefore recommends that the deemed disposal on emigration should not apply to New Zealand land or PE assets. As a deemed disposal would create a tax liability at a point where taxpayers may not have the cash flow to pay the tax, the Secretariat recommends that taxpayers should be able to defer payment of tax in certain circumstances, with conditions. We also suggest a de minimis threshold of around $15,000 of capital gains, under which deemed disposals would be ignored. The Group may also wish to consider whether temporary emigrants should be given an ability to unwind a deemed disposal, if they subsequently return to New Zealand holding the same asset in the same capacity. Similarly, a taxpayer should be deemed to have disposed of their taxable assets for market value immediately before they become New Zealand resident (‘market value option’). Other options considered for establishing a cost base on immigration were original cost, median rule, and straight-line apportionment. The Secretariat considers the market value option is most consistent with all of New Zealand’s double tax agreements (DTAs). It is also required by several DTAs, notably the ones with Australia and Canada. The second half of the paper discusses the taxation of foreign investment funds (FIFs) and foreign homes and rental properties owned by New Zealand tax residents. The paper outlines reasons for and against lowering the foreign dividend rate (FDR), which is currently 5%, and including Australian listed shares in the FIF regime. The paper also discusses reasons for and against exempting capital gains from the sales of foreign homes and rental properties from the tax base. All of these issues involve difficult competing considerations and do not seem to be central to the Group’s decision on whether or not to recommend that capital gains be taxed more comprehensively. The Secretariat therefore recommends that these issues be considered further under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). Treasury:4032404v1 7 1. Introduction 1.1 Purpose 1. The purpose of this paper is to provide the Group with further information and analysis to assist with the Group’s decisions on the tax consequences of: a. Emigration. Where a taxpayer ceases to be tax resident in New Zealand while holding taxable assets (including situations where a taxpayer becomes non-resident under a treaty). b. Immigration. Where a taxpayer realises assets they acquired before they became tax resident in New Zealand. c. Foreign investment funds (FIFs). A number of issues need to be considered, including the fair dividend rate (FDR) option, and whether the comparative value (CV) option for natural persons and family trusts should be retained in its current form. d. Foreign homes and rental properties held by New Zealand tax residents. Whether these should be excluded from the base. 1.2 Content and scope 2. The Group has already made several decisions on the international aspects of taxing more capital gains and these are briefly summarised in Appendix B. Therefore, this paper is focussed on the issues highlighted in the Interim Report as requiring further consideration by the Group. 3. The Secretariat recommendations in this paper are similarly intended to establish high-level principles, but there are also some areas where we consider that the general principles may need to be supplemented or deviated from (e.g. employee share schemes, disposal of ships and aircraft). 4. The migration chapters are focused on the migration of individuals, and do not discuss the migration of companies (for which there are existing migration rules), trusts, or other non-natural persons. If capital gains are taxed more comprehensively, these rules may need to be reviewed under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) to ensure they are broadly consistent with the rules that apply to migration of individuals. 5. References in this paper to ‘resident’ and ‘non-resident’ are intended to refer to a person’s tax residence rather than their immigration status. Notwithstanding, the tax residence rules may need to be adjusted to ensure that they are workable in this context. Treasury:4032404v1 8 2. Emigration 6. In Appendix B of the Interim Report, the Group explained that if no tax is imposed when a person terminates their New Zealand tax residence, emigration would be a way to avoid a realisation-based tax on capital gains other than in relation to New Zealand land. It proposed an option to prevent this by deeming assets to be disposed of for market value upon the asset owner’s emigration. 7. This Chapter addresses two questions raised by the Group about emigration: a. whether a deemed disposal should be limited to those assets that cease to be subject to tax on sale when a person becomes non-resident; and b. whether a deemed disposal should be made optional, as in Australia. 8. The Secretariat notes that any design of rules intended to deem assets to have been disposed of on emigration will also need to take into account assets held on trust. For instance, if a person settles foreign assets on a trust while New Zealand resident and then emigrates, trustee income arising from sales of those assets will generally not be taxable. Accordingly, it may be necessary to deem these assets also to be disposed of on emigration. This Chapter is more concerned with the fundamental principles and so does not consider issues raised by trusts. 2.1 Whether deemed disposal should be limited to assets that cease to be subject to tax when a person becomes non-resident 9. In Appendix B of the Interim Report, the Group considered if: Deemed disposal could be limited to those assets that cease to be subject to tax on sale when a person becomes non-resident. So, for instance, it might not apply to ownership of land in New Zealand but would apply to ownership of land outside New Zealand. 10. As recognised by the Group, the reason for the general ‘deemed disposal’ rule is because, without such a rule, a realisation-based tax may be avoided for the following reasons: a. Loss of taxing rights. For some assets (e.g. shares in a New Zealand company), New Zealand loses taxing rights if the taxpayer migrates to a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA). For other assets (e.g. shares in a foreign company), New Zealand may lose taxing rights even if the taxpayer migrates to a country without a DTA if income from the sale of the asset would not have a New Zealand source. The Secretariat notes that, if capital gains are taxed more comprehensively, the domestic source rules 1 should be reviewed to ensure that they adequately cover capital gains in New Zealand. 1 In section YD 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Treasury:4032404v1 9 b. Practical ability to enforce compliance. When a taxpayer leaves New Zealand, Inland Revenue’s practical ability to audit them and enforce compliance is reduced. However, New Zealand is increasingly entering into Assistance in the Collection of Taxes (AinC) provisions in our DTAs whereby New Zealand may request the treaty partner country to collect outstanding New Zealand tax debt. 2 It should be noted though that relying on AinC provisions is a backstop rather than an effective collection mechanism. 11. These two reasons are less likely to apply to New Zealand real property (land) and assets forming part of the business property of a New Zealand permanent establishment (PE). 3 As is standard in DTAs, New Zealand retains taxing rights over its real property and PE assets in all of its DTAs. 12. Other countries that have a deemed disposal rule on emigration, including Australia, Canada and South Africa, exclude their real property and PE assets from the deemed disposal rule. 13. In any event, it would be important to ensure that, under a more comprehensive tax on capital gains, the existing resident land withholding tax (RLWT) rules will be expanded to include all New Zealand real property sold by a non-resident. This would give New Zealand the practical ability to enforce compliance for gains on real property. Secretariat recommendation 14. Provided the RLWT rules are extended to include all New Zealand real property sold by a non-resident, the Secretariat recommends that the deemed disposal on emigration should not apply to New Zealand real property. 15. The Secretariat also recommends that the deemed disposal on emigration should not apply to assets forming part of the business property of a New Zealand PE. 16. We also note for completeness that any assets taxed on accrual but not on realisation, such as FIFs and possibly KiwiSaver and listed PIEs holding shares, should also be excluded from the deemed disposal rule. 2.2 Whether a deemed disposal should be made optional 17. In Appendix B of the Interim Report, the Group considered if there were some cases where the general ‘deemed disposal’ rule should not apply: 2 Such provisions were introduced into the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital (the blueprint for all DTAs) in 2003. So far, they have been included in New Zealand’s DTAs with Australia, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, Turkey and the United Kingdom. It will appear in more DTAs as negotiations for new and replacement DTAs continue. Significantly, the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (the MAC), that NZ signed in 2012, also establishes AinC (unless a party reserves against it). To date, the MAC has been signed by 125 jurisdictions, and is currently in force for 109 of these (though around half of these jurisdictions have reserved against AinC). 3 Including in some cases, shares in a company whose value is mostly attributable to New Zealand land. Treasury:4032404v1 10 We are considering whether a deemed disposal could also be made optional, as we understand is the case in Australia, so that a natural person migrant could elect to remain taxable with respect to the asset. For that person the asset would remain an included asset and the person would be taxable in New Zealand on it for the full gain on sale. This protects temporary migrants from being taxed on assets when they leave and then return still holding the asset. It also better provides for the avoidance of double tax on the same income by use of double tax agreements. 18. A deemed disposal could be undesirable in cases involving: a. Temporary emigration. Where a taxpayer becomes a non-resident for a short period but becomes resident again holding their same assets in the same capacity, the assets ultimately remain in New Zealand’s tax base. A deemed disposal on emigration would therefore be an unnecessary compliance burden for the taxpayer. b. Certain illiquid assets. Where a taxpayer emigrates holding certain illiquid assets (e.g. an operating business), a deemed disposal could cause cash flow and valuation issues. However, in some cases when a taxpayer emigrates holding the assets of an operating business, the business may be a New Zealand PE (and so there may not need to be a deemed disposal). c. De minimis amounts of tax. Where a deemed disposal would only result in small amounts of tax, the compliance costs of a deemed disposal to the taxpayer and to the Commissioner may outweigh the amount of tax revenue that could be collected. 19. However, any rules addressing concerns over temporary emigration or illiquid assets should take care not to undermine the general rule. As noted above, the reason for the general rule is to protect New Zealand’s tax base. Australian approach 20. The Group has suggested making a deemed disposal optional, as is the case in Australia. 21. Australia’s approach is set out in more detail in Appendix C. In summary, at the time a resident taxpayer becomes non-resident, they are essentially treated as having sold for market value any taxable assets that they hold, other than taxable Australian property (TAP). TAP broadly consists of Australian real property and assets attributable to an Australian PE. 22. Individuals have the option of deferring a deemed taxable gain/loss on their non- TAP assets by electing for all their non-TAP assets to be treated as TAP. Such assets are referred to as ‘deemed-TAP’ assets. If the person becomes resident in Treasury:4032404v1 11 Australia again before they have realised a deemed-TAP asset, the deemed disposal is effectively unwound. 4 23. However, if a person makes this election and realises a deemed-TAP asset while they are a non-resident, they are required to file a tax return with their taxable gain/loss with the Australian Tax Office (ATO). 5 If the taxpayer does not file a return, the ATO has very little way of detecting or enforcing this. In the course of reviewing the individual tax residence rules, the Australian Board of Taxation noted: 6 Since it is acknowledged that a negative cash-flow impact is associated with any ‘deemed’ disposal, a taxpayer may make the choice to defer any deemed gain or loss until ultimate disposal. Mechanically, this is achieved by deeming a non-TAP asset to constitute TAP and relying on the (now foreign resident) taxpayer to subsequently furnish their income tax return in Australia disclosing the disposal. The likelihood of this occurring was questioned during consultation, with the general view being that a revenue leakage is more likely than not to arise. 24. Moreover, if the taxpayer becomes resident in a country with which Australia has a DTA, the DTA may prevent Australia from taxing capital gains on disposal of deemed-TAP assets despite the taxpayer’s election. This is the case with Australia’s treaties with both the United Kingdom and United States. The Board of Taxation has suggested that these rules may need to be reformed. 25. The Secretariat does not recommend following the Australian approach, as it seems to have undermined the reasons for, and compliance with, their general deemed disposal rule. The Secretariat suggests two alternatives for dealing with temporary emigration and illiquid assets, based on the Canadian approach. Canada’s approach is set out in Appendix C. Alternative approach for temporary emigration – unwind on return 26. An alternative to making a deemed disposal optional is to allow taxpayers to ‘unwind’ a deemed disposal from emigration if they subsequently become tax resident in New Zealand again. This is the approach adopted in Canada. 27. The ‘unwind’ should apply to liability for the core tax and any resulting interest or penalties, so that the taxpayer is put in the same tax position they were in as if they had never emigrated. The ‘unwind’ should only be allowed if the taxpayer still holds the relevant asset in the same capacity when they become New Zealand resident again. 4 The person is effectively treated as having acquired the asset on its original acquisition date for its original cost. This overrides the ordinary rule that deems an immigrating taxpayer to have acquired their property for market value on the day they become tax resident. 5 Note that gains after 8 May 2012 will not be eligible for the 50% CGT discount, as the discount is no longer available to foreign residents. 6 Australian Board of Taxation Review of the Income Tax Residency Rules for Individuals (August 2017) at \[1.288\]. Treasury:4032404v1 12 28. Even if the taxpayer has an ability to ‘unwind’ a tax liability on return, payment of the tax on emigration should still be required by the ordinary due date, unless the taxpayer is permitted to defer payment (discussed in the next section). If a taxpayer has paid a tax liability that is later unwound, the tax paid could be credited to a later income year or refunded if the taxpayer has no outstanding tax liabilities. 29. Inland Revenue generally only keeps tax collection records for 10 years, unless there are special circumstances (for example, an ongoing investigation). The Secretariat therefore suggests that any unwind should be subject to a time limit of no more than 10 years. Alternative approach for addressing cash flow issues – crystallise liability, defer payment with conditions 30. Where a taxpayer emigrates, it may be appropriate to allow payment of any resulting tax liability to be deferred until the earlier of when the property is sold, or a defined period. The Secretariat recommends that deferral be restricted to illiquid assets only on the basis that cash flow issues only arise with illiquid assets such as unlisted shares. 31. Conditions of deferral may be required to ensure that New Zealand’s tax base is adequately protected. Some conditions could include: a. Requiring the taxpayer to file a return/disclosure statement and provide Inland Revenue with a list of all illiquid assets on which tax has been deferred, including each asset’s base and estimated market value on the date tax residence ceases. A similar return is required in Canada. This could be refreshed annually. b. Requiring the taxpayer to provide security to Inland Revenue if the amount of tax being deferred exceeds a specified amount. Again, this is required in Canada. c. Limiting the period of deferral to a fixed number of years. d. Charging interest on the deferral. 32. The Secretariat recommends that any conditions of deferral be determined following consultation to ensure that they are workable for taxpayers (but still protect New Zealand’s tax base). De minimis for small amounts of tax 33. The Group may wish to consider a de minimis threshold, under which a deemed disposal on emigration would be ignored. Treasury:4032404v1 13 34. The Secretariat recommends a de minimis based on the size of gain that would otherwise arise on the deemed disposal. 35. As people can become non-resident and resident again multiple times in their lives, the de minimis should be sufficiently low that taxpayers would not bother using it to avoid tax on capital gains. If the deemed disposal on emigration results in capital gains for the taxpayer that, in total, exceed the de minimis threshold, all of the gains should be taxable. A suggested threshold is capital gains of around $15,000. 36. For reference, Canada requires emigrating taxpayers to attach a list of all their property to their tax return (excluding personal-use property valued at less than $10,000), if the fair market value of all their property is over $25,000. (As personal-use property would not be taxed in New Zealand, there would be no need to list that property.) Secretariat recommendation 37. The Secretariat does not recommend generally making a deemed disposal optional. 38. The Secretariat notes that, if the Group is concerned about temporary emigration, it could consider giving taxpayers an ability to “unwind” the original deemed disposal if they later become tax resident in New Zealand again while holding the same assets in the same capacity. If there is an ability to “unwind” the tax, the Secretariat recommends that it be subject to a time limit of no more than 10 years. 39. The Secretariat recommends that taxpayers who emigrate while holding certain illiquid assets should be allowed to defer payment of their resulting tax liability for a defined period, if certain conditions are met. 40. The Secretariat recommends a de minimis threshold for capital gains of less than $15,000. Treasury:4032404v1 14 3. Immigration 41. In Appendix B of the Interim Report, the Group noted that when a person becomes a New Zealand tax resident, taxable assets that they hold will enter the tax base. The Group proposed that, consistent with existing law, such assets should enter the tax base at their market value on the first day the asset owner becomes New Zealand tax resident (or, in the case of a transitional resident, becomes a resident who is not a transitional resident). 7 42. The Group observed that: Because of the subjectivity inherent in valuations, where a valuation figure would produce a loss (i.e. is higher than actual sales), it may be desirable to either ring-fence that loss, or use the median rule, as we propose for transitional valuations .... The extent to which losses are ring-fenced can be considered after the Group has made decisions on rollover. 43. Assets that may enter the tax base on immigration include New Zealand shares, shares in a CFC or goodwill and other intellectual property in an unincorporated business (if it does not form part of the business property of a foreign PE). This discussion does not apply to assets that do not enter the tax base on immigration (e.g. New Zealand real property and assets of a New Zealand PE), whose cost base will be determined under ordinary rules (typically original cost). We note that foreign superannuation schemes, financial arrangements, and FIF interests are subject to existing rules on immigration, and we do not propose to alter those. 44. The Secretariat has considered the following four options for establishing a cost base for assets that enter the tax base through immigration: a. Original cost; b. Market value on date the person becomes tax resident in New Zealand; c. Median rule; and d. Straight-line apportionment. 45. The Secretariat considers the market value option is the option that is the most principled and generally consistent with New Zealand’s treaties. Under the market value option, the cost base of a taxable asset will be its market value on the date that the holder of the asset becomes tax resident in New Zealand. 46. While some of the other options (such as original cost and straight-line apportionment) have the advantage of potentially reducing compliance costs, they are not consistent with international norms and may cause treaty issues. The Secretariat does not recommend these as a primary option, but it is possible they 7 For simplicity, this Chapter just describes people becoming tax resident in New Zealand, without referring to the transitional resident rules each time. Treasury:4032404v1 15 could be used as a supplementary option in some cases. The other three options are discussed more fully in Appendix E. 3.1 Advantages of a market value option 47. The market value option is principled in the sense that it only taxes gains that accrued during the time the asset owner was tax resident in New Zealand. It is the approach adopted by Australia and Canada (both of which tax deemed disposals on emigration) and is required by both the NZ–Australia and NZ–Canada DTAs. It is the only option that is not inconsistent with any of New Zealand’s DTAs (i.e. even where a DTA does not require a ‘step-up’, the market value option will not be inconsistent with it). 48. It is also consistent with the current FIF rules for foreign listed shares that a taxpayer holds on immigration, 8 for financial arrangements, and for foreign superannuation. 9 Example 1 – Migration from Australia, market value In Year 1, Tom, an Australian tax resident, buys some Australian shares for $100. In Year 3, Tom migrates to New Zealand. Tom ceases to be resident in Australia on the same day he becomes resident in New Zealand (‘Migration Day’). The value of his shares is $150. In Year 10, Tom sells the shares for their market value of $210. His actual capital gain is therefore $110. The tax consequences for Tom will be: • In Year 3, Tom is treated for Australian tax purposes as having a capital gain of $50 (being $150 - $100). • In Year 10, Tom will be treated for New Zealand tax purposes as having derived a capital gain of $60 (being $210 - $150). This is consistent with the NZ–Australia DTA. Overall, Tom has been taxed on his actual capital gain of $110 ($50 of which was taxed in Australia and $60 of which was taxed in New Zealand). 3.2 Possible disadvantages of market value option 49. The market value option may increase compliance costs as immigrants may have to obtain a valuation. However, the taxable assets that immigrants are most likely to bring into the New Zealand tax base which would require a valuation appear to be controlled foreign companies (CFCs) or unincorporated businesses (to the extent that those assets do not form part of the business property of a PE in another country). This would limit the number of people who may need a valuation. 8 Under section EX 67 of the Income Tax Act 2007, when a person has a non-attributing interest in a FIF that and it becomes an attributing interest in a FIF there is a deemed sale and reacquisition at market value. 9 Lump sums are not taxed if they are received within 4 years of the taxpayer becoming a New Zealand resident, otherwise tax is based on a schedule or formula designed to approximate the same tax position as if they had transferred their superannuation to New Zealand when they first arrived and paid tax on investment gains as they accrued. Treasury:4032404v1 16 50. Another possible drawback of the market value option is that some gains may go untaxed altogether (i.e. double non-taxation) if the other country does not tax on emigration. However, this arguably is not a drawback if one considers that, in principle, New Zealand should only tax increases in value that accrued while a taxpayer was New Zealand tax resident. Example 2 – Migration from the UK, market value Assume the same facts as in Example 1. The tax consequences for Tom will be: • There are no UK tax consequences as the UK does not generally tax assets on emigration. • In Year 10, Tom will be treated as having derived a taxable capital gain in New Zealand of $60. Overall, Tom has made an actual capital gain of $110, but only $60 has been taxed. 51. We also note that, although there may be some scope for taxpayers to inflate market values and therefore their cost base, such a risk exists under all four options, as taxpayers might also inflate their “original” cost. A market value is, at least in principle, an objective measure. 3.3 Secretariat recommendation 52. The Secretariat recommends that assets entering the New Zealand tax base on immigration should be deemed to enter at their market value at the time the asset owner becomes New Zealand tax resident. Treasury:4032404v1 17 4. Taxation of FIFs 4.1 Current rules 53. To simplify a great deal, foreign portfolio shares (other than Australian) owned by residents are taxed under the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) regime. In general, the rule is that a 5% deemed return is applied to the total opening market value of portfolio shares. This is called the “Fair Dividend Rate” (FDR). Tax is then paid on that deemed return. 54. That general description ignores some complexity. There are special rules for shares bought and sold within a year, and for individuals, there is both a $50,000 cost basis de minimis (below which a taxpayer can return the dividends paid as income instead of the FDR system), and a method whereby if the shares return less than 5% over the year, the individual taxpayer can return the total actual change, with a minimum floor of $0 (the CV option for natural persons and family trusts). 55. The FDR system and the rate (5%) reflects a compromise and amalgam of a few different justifications. To examine those, this Chapter first looks at the underlying economic theory for why and how residents should be taxed on their foreign income on portfolio investments. The Chapter then briefly addresses the tax treatment of Australian listed shares. 4.2 Economic theory of taxing residents on foreign-sourced income 56. Foreign taxes are not directly relevant to the living standards of New Zealanders, while New Zealand taxes are, as they fund public goods and services, and transfers. 57. From this flows the general principle that New Zealand as a whole will be best off when New Zealand investors compare foreign investments after foreign taxes, with New Zealand investments before New Zealand taxes. Or in other words, when a New Zealand investor pays an equivalent domestic tax rate irrespective of where the income is sourced. 58. As a simple example, assume that the tax rate is 25% in each country. If an investment in a US company earns 10% before foreign taxes, but 7.5% after foreign taxes, and an investment in New Zealand earns 8% before New Zealand taxes, but 6% after New Zealand taxes, the investor will face the following situation: Before any taxes Foreign taxes Domestic taxes After all taxes Foreign investment 10% 2.5% 7.5% Domestic investment 8% 2% 6% Treasury:4032404v1 18 59. Without New Zealand taxes on the foreign investment, the investor will prefer the foreign investment even though it only returns 7.5% for New Zealand overall, while the domestic investment returns 8%. If the assumed 25% New Zealand tax also applies to the foreign investment, then the situation that the resident faces will be: Before any taxes Foreign taxes Domestic taxes After all taxes Foreign investment 10% 2.5% 1.875% 5.625% Domestic investment 8% 2% 6% 60. As domestic tax is applied on both foreign and domestic investment, irrespective of the investment choice the individual will pay taxes to fund New Zealand public goods and services. 61. Once New Zealand tax applies, the domestic investment is better for the investor after tax. Domestic taxes then increase not just because foreign investment income is taxed, but also because of a substitution towards domestic investment. This is an appropriate base for levying taxation, taking into account that New Zealand taxes pay for New Zealand public goods and services. 62. However, it is also true that this approach prevents capital being employed where it is most productive on a pre-tax basis. Allowing a credit for foreign taxes would achieve that outcome. The FDR rate 63. The original problem identified was that because New Zealand had no capital gains tax, New Zealand residents owning foreign shares were only taxed on dividends. Because foreign shares usually had lower dividend yields than New Zealand shares (and correspondingly higher expected capital gains), the result was that less tax was paid on foreign shares than New Zealand shares, encouraging people to invest overseas, particularly in shares with low dividend rates. 64. The solution was a compromise that acknowledged the primary problem causing the different treatment was the lack of dividends paid on shares. The approach was to tax foreign shares at a deemed rate that was similar to the dividend pay-out rate of New Zealand shares, which was about 4.5% at the time. A rate of 5% was chosen for the FDR rate. There is also a theoretical equivalence between a comprehensive income tax that taxed accruing capital gains and the risk-free return method of taxation. (RFRM). If the FDR had been set at the nominal risk-free rate, then the RFRM tax would have solved the problem by taxing income on foreign shares in an equivalent manner to a comprehensive income tax on accruing gains. 10 In reality, for most of the history of the FDR since its inception in 2007 the rate 10 See section 2 of the Risk-free return method of taxation paper from session 20 for an explanation of the equivalence. Treasury:4032404v1 19 has been above a nominal risk-free rate. The chart below shows the yield on 5 year government bonds (the shortest period for which there is full data from 2006): The theory of RFRM is that taxing a risky investment at the risk-free rate should be neutral in terms of not distorting investors’ investment decisions, just as is taxing all income comprehensively (including accruing capital gains). 65. In the Risk-free return method of taxation paper from session 20, the Secretariat raised questions about what the risk-free rate actually is and raised the question of whether 3.5% might be an appropriate level, given that is what people can earn in short-term fixed term deposits at banks. Other Group members had different views on what the true risk-free rate was, suggesting government bonds were the better estimate. 1-year, 2-year, and 5-year government bonds currently yield 1.71%, 1.67%, and 1.93% respectively. 11 66. Average returns on foreign shares are higher than the risk-free rate. The Morgan Stanley Capital index shows an average annual return of 7.4% (inclusive of price appreciation and dividends) over the last 20 years. This means a low FDR rate may leave an impression of under-taxing foreign shares. However, if shares are taxed on an “expected” return basis, this could bias investment decisions away from investing in that asset class relative to a comprehensive income tax or risk-free return and would be a substantial disincentive to take risk. This is further explored in Appendix F. 67. If the rate were dropped then consideration would have to be given to taxing on a net equity basis (with interest deductions denied) rather than a gross basis (with interest deductions allowed). Otherwise, taxpayers may be able to borrow to invest 11 https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics/b2, accessed 25 October 2018 0.00 1.00 2.00 3.00 4.00 5.00 6.00 7.00 8.00 Jan 2006 Aug 2006 Mar 2007 Oct 2007 May 2008 Dec 2008 Jul 2009 Feb 2010Sep 2010 Apr 2011 Nov 2011 Jun 2012 Jan 2013 Aug 2013 Mar 2014 Oct 2014 May 2015 Dec 2015 Jul 2016 Feb 2017Sep 2017 Apr 2018 Secondary market government bond yields -5 year bonds Treasury:4032404v1 20 in shares and report tax losses because interest deductions were much higher than the deemed income. 68. Some people we have consulted with (managed funds advisors and Corporate Taxpayer Group) have indicated that if we change to taxing New Zealand shares on capital gains as well as dividends, while we continue to tax foreign shares on FDR, they would invest less in domestic shares and more in foreign shares than they do currently. They go on to say that this would have an adverse effect on New Zealand’s capital markets. 69. Given the competing arguments for and against lowering the FDR rate, the Secretariat recommends that it be considered further under GTPP. We also note that lowering the FDR rate will be revenue negative. 70. If the rate is lowered, the Secretariat suggests that the concession described above at paragraph 54 be removed, so that regardless of whether an individual or trust makes a loss, it pays tax on a deemed return of the FDR. Similarly, it might be worth looking at whether foreign tax credits should be limited to the treaty withholding rate as a proportion of the fair dividend rate, rather than being unrestricted. 4.3 Exclusion of Australian listed shares from the FIF regime 71. The Group noted in its Interim Report that it seems appropriate to simply tax realised gains and losses for portfolio interests in Australian listed companies that are not subject to the FIF regime. 72. The Secretariat notes that there may be scope for reconsidering this decision if capital gains are taxed more comprehensively. One of the reasons why Australian listed shares were excluded from the FIF regime (and taxed in the same way as New Zealand shares) was, at the time the FIF regime was introduced, it was believed that New Zealand and Australia could agree to mutual recognition of imputation and franking credits. Exploring mutual recognition is now a lower priority than it was when the exemption was developed. 73. However, there are other reasons why it may be desirable to continue taxing Australian listed shares in the same way as New Zealand shares. Australian listed shares tend to have higher dividend yields than many other countries because of their franking system. Moreover, there are many individual investors that only hold Australian and New Zealand listed shares, and taxing Australian shares under the FIF regime would increase their compliance costs. We also note that, if being taxed under the FIF regime is perceived to be more favourable than being taxed on realised gains and losses (and dividends), including Australian listed shares in the FIF regime could create a bias towards investment in Australian shares (particularly as Australian shares are more substitutable for New Zealand shares than other countries’ shares are). Treasury:4032404v1 21 74. This is not a central issue to taxing capital gains more comprehensively. As such, the Secretariat recommends that any change be decided following GTPP. Treasury:4032404v1 22 5. Foreign homes and rental properties held by New Zealand tax residents 75. New Zealand taxes based on both residence and source. New Zealand residents are generally taxed on their worldwide income, while non-residents are only taxed on New Zealand-sourced income. Under these general principles, gains derived by a New Zealand resident from the sale of property should be taxed in New Zealand, regardless of the source of that gain. 76. In Appendix B of the Interim Report, the Group considered whether there was a case for excluding gains derived by New Zealand residents on the sales of their foreign homes (at paragraph 21): ... there is an argument for exempting homes owned outside New Zealand if it was likely that no New Zealand tax on the foreign home would be collected. This could be the case if the other country also taxed any capital gain on the property. If that same gain was taxable in New Zealand, a credit for that foreign tax would be allowed against the New Zealand tax payable. Any New Zealand tax on sale would accordingly be relatively small, such that the compliance costs might not be justified. An alternative to a full exclusion for foreign homes would be to apply a ‘grey list’ where only homes subject to tax in countries imposing similar capital gains taxes (and not receiving any main home exemption) would be excluded from the rules. In any event, any arguments for exclusion need to be balanced against perceptions of fairness if some overseas homes are out of the base. The Group is still considering this. 77. This Chapter considers: a. whether it is likely that (little or) no New Zealand tax on foreign homes would be collected; b. the possibility of a ‘grey list’; and c. complexities with foreign mortgages and the financial arrangements rules. 5.1 Foreign homes/rental properties or foreign real property? 78. Although the quote above describes “foreign homes”, some of the reasons outlined for exempting foreign homes (i.e. if New Zealand tax collected would be relatively small) may also apply to other foreign real property such as rental properties, farms or commercial land. The Secretariat notes that, in some cases, it could be hard to draw the line between a foreign home, which is rented out occasionally, and a rental property. 79. This Chapter will only discuss if there is a case for excluding foreign homes or foreign rental properties from the New Zealand tax base. It does not discuss excluding foreign real property more generally. If capital gains were subject to lower taxes in other countries than in New Zealand, exempting foreign real property could create a tax incentive for New Zealand residents to invest in foreign real property (rather than in New Zealand). Treasury:4032404v1 23 5.2 Is it likely that little or no New Zealand tax on foreign homes/rental properties would be collected? 80. All DTAs give the primary taxing right for gains over immovable or real property to the country in which the property is situated. As a result, New Zealand would only have a secondary or ‘residual’ taxing right over foreign homes/rental properties that are located in one of the 40 countries with which it has a DTA. 12 Even where there is no DTA, taxpayers can receive credits for foreign tax paid under New Zealand’s domestic law. 13 81. This means that, if a New Zealand resident taxpayer derived a gain from the sale of land in another country, and the other country taxed that gain, New Zealand would give the taxpayer a tax credit for the amount of foreign tax paid. If the amount of tax paid in the other country is equal to or greater than the amount of New Zealand tax on that gain, there would be no net New Zealand tax payable (net of foreign tax credits). 82. However, net New Zealand tax would still be payable if the tax on the gain in the other country was less than the New Zealand tax on the same gain. For example, the gain may be taxed at a lower rate than 33% as shown in Example 3, or a country may only tax part of a gain (e.g. Canada generally only taxes 50% of a capital gain). A preliminary analysis shows that countries that are likely to tax capital gains at rates below 33% include Australia, 14 Canada, France, Japan, Norway, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States. Example 3 – NZ resident, holiday home in Spain Mahutu is a NZ tax resident with a holiday home in Spain that he purchased for €100,000. He sells it for €700,000 (a gain of €600,000). Spain generally taxes non-residents at a fixed rate of 19%, which would make Mahutu liable for €114,000 (€600,000 \* 19%) of Spanish tax. Assuming Mahutu is at the 33% marginal tax rate, NZ tax on the holiday home would be €200,000 (€600,000 \* 33%, ignoring foreign exchange). Mahutu would receive a foreign tax credit of around €114,000 to offset against his NZ tax liability, so the net NZ tax payable would be around €86,000. 83. Net New Zealand tax may also be payable if the country exempts the capital gain. For example, it may be an excluded home in that country, or exempted on death. 12 These countries are: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, China, Czech Republic, Denmark, Fiji, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland., Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Poland, Russian Federation, Samoa, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America and Vietnam. 13 Subpart LJ of the Income Tax Act 2007. 14 Even though the 50% capital gains discount is not available to “foreign residents”, it appears that a dual resident who is resident in New Zealand only under the DTA tiebreaker, would still qualify. Treasury:4032404v1 24 Example 4 – NZ resident dies with US rental properties Chi and her niece Cassie are both NZ tax residents. Chi owns five rental properties in the US. The cost base for each of these properties is US$50,000 each (total US$250,000). Chi dies and passes the rental properties to Cassie, who promptly sells them for US$200,000 each (total US$1m). Assuming the US allows a basis step-up on death, Cassie’s cost basis in the rental properties would be US$1m. The US ignores capital appreciation before death so the gains totalling US$750,000 would effectively go untaxed in the US. Assuming a 33% tax rate and New Zealand allowing rollover on death (with no basis step-up), Cassie would assume Chi’s cost basis in the properties of US$250,000. She would be taxed on a US$750,000 gain on the sale, resulting in US$250,000 worth of NZ tax (ignoring foreign exchange). The NZ–US DTA would not limit New Zealand’s taxing rights as there is no double tax. 84. Given the variety of ways in which different countries tax capital gains, and the fact that many countries tax capital gains at discounted rates, it is difficult to state with any confidence that including foreign homes/rental properties owned by New Zealand residents in the tax base would result in little or no New Zealand tax being collected. 85. We also note that it may be difficult to enforce compliance for gains derived on sales of foreign homes/rental properties. However, the Secretariat does not consider that this in itself is a good reason to exclude foreign homes/rental properties from the tax base. 5.3 Alternative ‘grey list’ approach 86. A ‘grey list’ is an alternative to full exclusion. The idea is that, if a New Zealand resident derives a gain (or loss) from selling a foreign home/rental property located in a grey list country, the gain (or loss) would be exempt from New Zealand tax altogether. A country could be included on the grey list if, after a survey of the country’s laws and the relevant DTA, it was found that there would be little or no net New Zealand tax from taxing the sale of a home/rental property in that country. 87. Inland Revenue’s past experience is that it is very difficult to keep grey lists up-to- date, as countries hardly ever notify New Zealand of changes to its tax laws (even though there is provision for doing so under most DTAs). 88. Even with Australia, there are a number of features of its tax laws (and not necessarily its capital gains tax laws) that, if changed, would affect how much net New Zealand tax could be collected. For example: a. Australia normally applies a 50% discount to calculating a taxable capital gain, if the asset sold had been owned for at least 12 months. This discount Treasury:4032404v1 25 was removed for “foreign resident” individuals for capital gains made after 8 May 2012. 15 b. However, the 50% discount still appears to be available to a taxpayer who is dual resident in Australia and New Zealand (e.g. if they have a house in each country) but treated as being only resident in New Zealand under the ‘tiebreaker’ provision in the NZ–Australia DTA. Under current law, such a person would be non-resident in Australia for purposes of the NZ–Australia DTA, but would remain tax resident in Australia for purposes of Australia’s domestic law. c. Australia is currently considering whether to align their domestic tax residence rules with residence under their DTAs. 16 If Australia decides to do so, this could effectively remove the 50% discount for many New Zealand residents with Australian homes/rental properties. This change was suggested in the context of a review of individual tax residency rules, and not the capital gains rules, which highlights why it is so difficult to ensure grey lists are kept up-to-date. 89. If the Group decides a grey list is appropriate, the Secretariat suggests that it should be limited to countries where New Zealand is likely to monitor changes in their tax laws. 90. We also note that grey lists can also cause issues with non-discrimination clauses in free trade agreements. 5.4 Complexities with foreign mortgages and the financial arrangements rules 91. Another reason why foreign homes/rental properties may be excluded is because of the complexities that arise with foreign mortgages under the financial arrangements (FA) rules. 92. A mortgage denominated in a foreign currency is a FA. Under the FA rules, income and expenditure (including foreign exchange gains and losses) is generally spread over the term of the arrangement on an accrual basis. Taxpayers who exit a FA (e.g. by fully repaying their mortgage) need to perform a ‘wash-up’ known as a base price adjustment (BPA) to ensure the correct amount of tax has been paid. 93. The FA rules include simplified rules for cash basis persons who fall under certain thresholds, on the basis that these persons have relatively small FA investments and pose little fiscal risk. Cash basis persons do not apply an accruals spreading method to their FAs. Instead, they only account for cash inflows and cash outflows and perform a BPA on exit. 15 Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) (ITAA 1997), s 115-105. A “foreign resident” is defined in s 995-1 as a person who is not a resident of Australia for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). 16 Board of Taxation Review of the Income Tax Residency Rules for Individuals: Consultation Guide (September 2018) at 16. Treasury:4032404v1 26 94. Currently, the FA rules cause issues with foreign mortgages as foreign exchange (FX) fluctuations can cause asymmetrical tax treatment (either in theory or in practice) with both foreign homes and foreign rental properties. Compliance cost issues can also arise. These issues are described below. Changes to the FA rules, including changes which would address some of these issues, are currently on the Tax Policy Work Programme and intended to be included in a future issues paper. Foreign homes and foreign mortgages 95. Under the current law, there are two asymmetries with foreign mortgages secured against foreign homes: a. (some) FX movements affecting the values of foreign mortgages are taxable, while FX movements affecting the values of foreign homes are not taxable. This can result in a taxpayer being subject to tax on a FX gain or loss even when the NZ dollar value of their net investment is unchanged; and b. FX gains for foreign mortgages are (theoretically) taxable but some FX losses may not be deductible because of the general permission or private limitation. We note that in practice, general non-compliance results in few FX gains on foreign homes actually being taxed. 96. Officials’ current thinking under the existing treatment of capital gains is to remove the theoretical asymmetry for foreign homes by treating private borrowings as excepted financial arrangements (EFAs), even if they are denominated in a foreign currency. This would make sense under the current law where the capital gain on the foreign home is not taxed in New Zealand, and would, for private borrowings, remove both asymmetries listed at paragraph 95 above. 97. If the capital gain on the foreign home is taxed in New Zealand, the first asymmetry listed above would automatically be removed (i.e. the private borrowings would not need to become an EFA). This is shown in Example 5 below. Law changes would still be required to remove the second asymmetry (by overriding the private limitation) and to ease compliance issues (discussed below). Example 5 – Foreign home with mortgage Sione is tax resident in New Zealand only under the NZ–Australia DTA. Assume the following facts on the last day of each income year. For simplicity, principal repayments, interest expenses and foreign tax credits are ignored: • Y0 – Sione buys a house in Australia for AU$500,000, financed by a mortgage of AU$400,000. The AUD to NZD exchange rate is 1 to 1. • Y1 – Sione’s mortgage is still AU$400,000, but the AUD to NZD exchange rate is now 1 to 1.10. • Y2 – Sione sells his house for AU$550,000 and uses the funds to pay off his AU$400,000 mortgage in full. The AUD to NZD exchange rate is now 1 to 1.15. Overall, in NZD terms, Sione’s net economic gain is NZ$72,500 (being a NZ$132,500 gain on Treasury:4032404v1 27 the property \[AU$550,000\*1.15 – AU$500,000\*1.00\] less NZ$60,000 of FX losses on the mortgage \[AU$400,000\*(1.15-1.00)\]). The NZ tax treatment under several options is as follows. Current position (FX losses non-deductible, capital gain not taxable) There would be no NZ tax consequences for Sione as his FX losses of $60,000 will not be deductible, but his capital gain of $132,500 would not be taxable, either. Note, however, that if the AUD to NZD exchange rates were reversed so that Sione overall had FX gains of NZ$60,000, the law would require Sione to treat the gain as taxable unless the law was amended to make the foreign mortgage an EFA. If capital gain is taxed If Sione’s capital gain is taxed, he will have a taxable gain of NZ$132,500 in Y2. He will also be able to claim FX losses of NZ$60,000 (all in Y2 if Sione is a cash basis person, or NZ$40,000 in Y1 and NZ$20,000 in Y2 if Sione is not a cash basis person and applies the mark-to-market spreading method). Overall, Sione’s net taxable income would be NZ$72,500, which matches his net economic gain. Exclude capital gain and FX movements from base If both the gain and FX movements are excluded from the tax base, there will be no New Zealand tax consequences for Sione. Foreign rental properties and foreign mortgages 98. Under current law, the first asymmetry described in paragraph 95 above arises as capital gains on the rental property are not taxed (i.e. FX movements affecting the values of foreign mortgages are taxable, while FX movements affecting the values of foreign homes are not). 99. The second asymmetry described does not arise as FX gains on foreign mortgages financing a rental property are taxable and FX losses are deductible. However, an integrity risk arises as taxpayers are more likely to claim FX losses than they are to declare FX gains (i.e. compliance tends to be asymmetrical). 100. There are also compliance cost concerns as the thresholds for qualifying as a “cash basis person” have not increased since 1999. 17 With current house prices, many taxpayers can exceed those thresholds even if they only hold one house. Officials’ current thinking is to include the following proposals in a future issues paper: 17 Currently a cash basis person is a person who, for all FAs to which the person is a party: (a) the absolute value of accrual income and expenditure in the income year is $100,000 or less; (b) the absolute value on every day in the income year of all FAs added together is $1,000,000 or less; and (c) the deferral amount (difference between accrual income/expenditure and cash income/expenditure) for the income year is $40,000 or less. Treasury:4032404v1 28 a. increase all of the thresholds by 50%, 18 broadly matching the rise in Consumer Price Index since 1999; and b. allow taxpayers with one foreign rental financed by a foreign mortgage to use the cash basis for returning FX gains and losses on the foreign mortgage (irrespective of the thresholds). If private borrowings to finance a foreign home are not made EFAs, this concession could also apply to foreign homes. 101. These measures would simplify compliance for most taxpayers, and remove the second asymmetry as a BPA requires FX gains and losses to be returned at the same time. If capital gains on foreign rental properties are taxed, this would also remove the first asymmetry. This is shown in Example 6. Example 6 – Foreign rental property with mortgage Assume the same facts as in Example 5 above, but instead of a foreign home, Sione has a single foreign rental property. For simplicity, principal repayments, interest and foreign tax credits are ignored. Overall, in NZD terms, Sione’s net economic gain is still NZ$72,500. The NZ tax treatment under several possible options is set out as follows. Current position (non-cash basis, capital gain not taxable) Assuming Sione is not a cash basis person and applies the mark-to-market method for spreading his FA income, he will have the following taxable income in each year: • Y1: Taxable FX loss of NZ$40,000 (being $400,000 \* (1.10 – 1)); • Y2: Taxable FX loss of NZ$20,000 (being $400,000 \* (1.15 – 1.10)). Overall, Sione has made a net economic gain but has taxable losses of NZ$60,000 as the capital gain on the rental property is not subject to tax in NZ. If capital gain is taxed and cash basis is allowed If Sione is allowed to use the cash basis for his rental property, he will have no NZ tax consequences in Y1. Instead, he will account for FX movements on a net basis on realisation. In Y2, Sione will be taxed on a capital gain of NZ$132,500, and will have a taxable FX loss of NZ$60,000 (being AU$400,000 \* (1.15 – 1.00)). Overall, Sione’s net taxable income is NZ$72,500, which is consistent with his net economic gain. Exclude capital gain and FX movements from base If both the gain and FX movements are excluded from the tax base, there will be no New Zealand tax consequences for Sione. 102. As shown above, some of the FA issues that currently arise can be resolved by taxing capital gains on foreign rental properties and extending the cash basis 18 The new thresholds, corresponding with those described in footnote 17, would be (a) $150,000; (b) $1,500,000; and (c) $60,000, respectively. Treasury:4032404v1 29 person concession, or by excluding the capital gains and FX movements altogether. 5.5 Secretariat recommendation 103. There does not appear to be a case for exempting foreign homes and rental properties solely on the grounds that little tax would be raised by including them in the tax base. 104. However, the Secretariat notes that if gains on foreign homes and rental properties are taxed, a foreign mortgage secured against that property should also remain taxed under the financial arrangement rules. The compliance costs involved may be for a relatively small amount of tax. 105. On the other hand, we are conscious that exempting foreign homes and rental properties if capital gains on New Zealand baches and rentals are taxed is likely to create perceptions of unfairness. 106. The Secretariat does not consider there is a clear case either way for including or excluding foreign homes and rental properties from the tax base. We therefore recommend that this issue be considered further under the GTPP process. In either case, the Secretariat recommends consistent treatment for foreign mortgages and capital gains on foreign homes and rental properties (i.e. either both are in the tax base or both are excluded). Treasury:4032404v1 30 Appendix A: Suggested text for Final Report The following is suggested Final Report text based on the Secretariat’s recommendations. Amended text will be provided if the Group come to different decisions. Decisions that we have asked the Group to consider, but which the Secretariat has not made a recommendation, have been put in square brackets \[ \]. We have not yet suggested text for the taxation of FIFs or foreign real property as this depends heavily on the decisions to be made by the Group. Migration 1. The Group has considered the tax consequences of taxable assets entering and leaving the New Zealand tax base when an asset owner becomes (‘immigrates’) and ceases to be (‘emigrates’) New Zealand tax resident. 2. As a preliminary point, we noted that under the current tax residence rules, it can be hard in some cases to determine exactly when tax residence ends or begins. The individual tax residence rules may therefore need to be amended, or applied in a modified form, for the purposes of the rules proposed in this Chapter. Emigration 3. In the Interim Report, we observed that if there is no tax imposed when a person emigrates, migration could become a simple way to avoid a realisation-based tax on capital gains. The solution suggested was to deem assets to be sold for market value immediately before the asset owner migrates (‘the deemed disposal rule’). 4. However, when an asset owner emigrates, some of the assets they hold may not leave the New Zealand tax base. Under New Zealand’s double tax agreements (DTAs), New Zealand retains taxing rights over New Zealand land and assets forming part of the business property of a New Zealand permanent establishment (PE). We also note that, as a practical matter, if the existing resident land withholding tax (RLWT) rules are expanded to include all New Zealand real property sold by a non-resident, New Zealand should be able to continue to collect tax on the sale of New Zealand land by non-residents. 5. The Group therefore recommends that the deemed disposal rule should not apply to New Zealand land or assets of a New Zealand PE. By narrowing the range of assets to which the deemed disposal rule would apply, the number of people who would be taxed on their capital gains when they leave New Zealand can be significantly reduced. 6. We do not consider it appropriate to make the deemed disposal generally optional, as is the case in Australia. The Australian Board of Taxation recently noted: 19 19 Australian Board of Taxation Review of the Income Tax Residency Rules for Individuals (August 2017) at \[1.288\]. Treasury:4032404v1 31 Since it is acknowledged that a negative cash-flow impact is associated with any ‘deemed’ disposal, a taxpayer may make the choice to defer any deemed gain or loss until ultimate disposal. Mechanically, this is achieved by deeming a non-TAP asset to constitute TAP and relying on the (now foreign resident) taxpayer to subsequently furnish their income tax return in Australia disclosing the disposal. The likelihood of this occurring was questioned during consultation, with the general view being that a revenue leakage is more likely than not to arise. 7. The Board suggested the rules may need to be reformed. Making the deemed disposal optional may therefore undermine the reasons for the deemed disposal rule. 8. We are, however, conscious that a deemed disposal may cause compliance cost and cash flow issues for temporary emigrants, taxpayers holding illiquid assets, and taxpayers with modest unrealised gains. In our view, these concerns could be addressed with more targeted measures that still adequately protect New Zealand’s tax base, such as an ability to \[unwind the tax,\] defer payment of tax and a de minimis threshold. 9. \[Where a taxpayer emigrates for a short period but becomes tax resident again, the assets they hold would leave and re-enter New Zealand’s tax base. A deemed disposal on emigration would therefore be an unnecessary compliance burden for the taxpayer. The Group suggests that, consistent with the approach in Canada, a taxpayer should be allowed to “unwind” a deemed disposal on emigration if they subsequently return to New Zealand holding the same assets in the same capacity. As this concession is aimed at temporary emigrants, we recommend that this option should not be available if the deemed disposal took place more than \[10\] years ago.\] 10. Where a taxpayer emigrates holding certain illiquid assets (for example, an unlisted business with assets not attributable to a New Zealand PE), a deemed disposal could cause cash flow and valuation difficulties. In such cases, the Group considers the deemed disposal should still apply on migration, to crystallise New Zealand’s taxing rights. However, we recommend that taxpayers be allowed to defer payment of the tax for a period. Conditions of deferral will be required to ensure New Zealand’s tax base is protected, but the conditions should also be workable for taxpayers. We recommend that these conditions be decided following consultation with taxpayers. 11. With a de minimis threshold, a deemed disposal that results in capital gains that, in aggregate, fall below a certain threshold can be ignored. As people can become non-resident and resident again multiple times in their lives, the de minimis should be set at a modest level so that it is unlikely to be used to avoid tax on capital gains. We recommend a threshold of $15,000 of capital gains. Immigration 12. If a person immigrates to New Zealand holding a taxable asset that they acquired while non-resident, the asset may enter the New Zealand tax base at the time the Treasury:4032404v1 32 person becomes tax resident in New Zealand. This does not apply to New Zealand real property and assets of a New Zealand PE, which are always in the New Zealand tax base. 13. The Group considers that when a person migrates to New Zealand, they should be treated as if they disposed of, and re-acquired their assets for market value at the time they become New Zealand tax resident. 14. This approach would ensure that any capital gain (or loss) accruing when the person was non-resident is not taxed in New Zealand, and is consistent with New Zealand’s existing DTAs. Taxation of FIFs 15. \[To add after Group has made its decisions.\] Foreign homes and foreign rental properties 16. \[To add after Group has made its decisions.\] Treasury:4032404v1 33 Appendix B: Summary of interim decisions made by Group 1. In the Group’s Interim Report, and as summarised in the Agreed Design Features 20 paper (as amended following the meeting), the Group made the following interim decisions on international issues. Taxation of non-residents 2. Non-residents would only be taxed on realisations of: a. interests in land located in New Zealand (defined broadly); b. interests in companies deriving more than half their value from New Zealand land (i.e. land rich companies) (other than for portfolio investors in a listed company); and c. assets of a New Zealand branch or permanent establishment. Taxation of shares in foreign companies 3. Gains on the sale of interests in non-attributing controlled foreign companies (CFCs) by New Zealand resident companies would not be subject to tax. 4. Gains on the sale of interests in non-attributing CFCs by persons other than New Zealand resident companies would be subject to tax. 5. Gains on the sale of interests in attributing CFCs would be subject to tax for all New Zealand resident shareholders. 6. Where a New Zealand resident company has interests in a CFC that are both attributing and non-attributing, the gain on sale would be taxable in the same proportion as the value of the assets giving rise to attributable income bears to the value of all assets of the CFC. 7. The FDR rules would be retained for taxing interests in FIFs. 8. Gains on the sale of portfolio interests in Australian listed companies would be subject to tax on realisation. 9. Gains on the sale of other interests in Australian companies by New Zealand resident companies would not be subject to tax. 10. Gains on the sale of other interests in Australian companies by persons other than New Zealand resident companies would be subject to tax. 20 Agreed Design Features Paper for Session 18 of the Tax Working Group (14 September 2018). Treasury:4032404v1 34 Migration 11. When a taxpayer becomes non-resident, they would be deemed to have disposed of their assets for market value before their tax residence ceases. 12. Where a person migrates to New Zealand, there would be a deemed disposal and reacquisition for market value on the first day they become a New Zealand tax resident (that is not a transitional resident). 13. Sales of non-New Zealand property made by a transitional resident would not be subject to tax. Treasury:4032404v1 35 Appendix C: Comparative analysis – Emigration Australia 1. When a resident taxpayer becomes non-resident, it is treated as a CGT event and the taxpayer is essentially deemed to dispose of any non-land/PE assets they hold at the time their tax residence ceases. 21 2. Individuals (not companies or trusts) can elect to defer the deemed gain/loss on their non-land/PE assets until ultimate disposal: 22 a. all non-land/PE assets held by the taxpayer will be deemed to be taxable Australian property (“TAP”) until another CGT event happens to the asset or the taxpayer becomes Australian resident again; b. if a subsequent CGT event happens to a deemed-TAP asset: i. while the taxpayer is non-resident, he/she will have to file a tax return and return any gain/loss. The gain may not be eligible for the 50% CGT discount (in whole or in part); 23 or ii. after the taxpayer has become resident in Australia again, they are effectively treated as having acquired as asset for its original cost on its original acquisition date (i.e. this overrides the ordinary rule that deems an immigrating taxpayer to have acquired their property for market value on the day they become tax resident). 3. Two significant problems with this concession are: a. If the taxpayer disposes of deemed-TAP assets while non-resident and does not file a return, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) has very little way of detecting or enforcing this. b. If the taxpayer becomes resident in a country with which Australia has a DTA, the DTA may prevent Australia from taxing capital gains on disposal of deemed-TAP assets. This is the case for Australia’s US and UK treaties. Board of Taxation notes 4. The Board of Taxation recently noted the problems outlined above in the course of reviewing the Australian tax residence rules (this was an ancillary issue in their review). 24 The Board noted the “general view” was that it was “more likely than not” there was revenue leakage from taxpayers not disclosing a sale of their deemed-TAP assets after they had left Australia. 21 Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), s 104-160. 22 Section 104-165. 23 Section 115-105 and 115-115. 24 Australian Board of Taxation Review of the Income Tax Residency Rules for Individuals (August 2017). Treasury:4032404v1 36 5. The Board suggested the rules might be improved by: a. including “deemed-TAP assets” in the foreign resident CGT withholding rules; 25 b. implementing an objective threshold (e.g. 6 years from deferral) after which the taxpayer will be deemed to have disposed of their “deemed-TAP assets”, unless they have become tax resident in Australia again; and/or c. upon ceasing tax residence, any “deemed-TAP assets” should be catalogued and reported to the ATO, who can use this as a reference point to track future disposal of the assets. This could be incorporated as part of the annual tax return process. Canada has this. Canada 26 6. Taxpayers are deemed to have disposed of all property, other than land, business assets of a PE, certain pension/retirement plans, at fair market value immediately before they cease tax residence. 27 7. If the fair market value of all property owned by the taxpayer on emigration is more than $25,000, they have to attach a list of all their property inside and outside Canada (except for any personal use property valued at less than $10,000) and attach it to their return. 8. Canada allows the following concessions: a. Election to defer: Taxpayers may also elect to defer payment of tax relating to the deemed disposition until they dispose of the property (without interest). Where the amount of federal tax deferred is more $16,500, the taxpayer has to provide adequate security to cover the amount (e.g. a letter of credit). b. Temporary emigrants: Taxpayers may elect to unwind a deemed disposition if they still own some or all of the property at the time they re-establish tax residence in Canada. c. Temporary residents: For taxpayers who were resident in Canada for less than a total of 5 years in the 10 years before emigration, there is no deemed disposition of property they already owned when they last became a resident or of property they inherited after they last became a resident. 25 Australia applies a 12.5% foreign CGT withholding rules tax on real property where the contract price is over $750,000. 26 https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/individuals-leaving-entering-canada-non- residents/dispositions-property.html 27 Income Tax Act (RSC 1985, c 1 (5 th Supp)), s 128.1(4)(b). Treasury:4032404v1 37 United Kingdom 9. There are no general exit taxes on individuals. Historically (pre-1998), there was widespread avoidance as people would go to another country for as little as a year to avoid a significant tax impost. 10. The United Kingdom’s rules are now very targeted to the more blatant cases of avoidance. Temporary non-resident individuals (taxpayers who go abroad for less than 5 years) are taxed on their return to the United Kingdom on any disposals made during their period of non-residence. This rule overrides treaties. 28 United States 11. The United States has less need for exit taxes as it taxes citizens regardless of their residence. For individuals giving up their citizenship, and certain long-term permanent residents ceasing to be tax resident, their property is deemed to be sold at its fair market value on the day before the expatriation date. 29 12. However, this deemed sale only applies if: a. the average net income tax of the expatriate for the previous 5 years is at least $155,000; 30 or b. the net worth of the expatriate is at least $2 million; or c. the expatriate failed to comply with US federal tax obligations for the last 5 years. 13. The first $600,000 31 of net gain is excluded from the amount realised on the deemed sale. If the expatriate later realises a gain or loss on the disposition or sale of the property, the amount realised will be adjusted according to the “mark to market” regime but the expatriate cannot use the $600,000 exclusion amount. South Africa 14. An emigrating taxpayer (individual, company or trust) is deemed to dispose of their non-land/PE assets at market value immediately before their tax residence ceases. 32 “Immediately before” is significant as, before the legislation was amended, a Court held that South Africa lost taxing rights under a DTA once the corporate taxpayer’s place of effective management had moved from South Africa to Luxembourg. 33 28 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (TCGA), ss 10A and 10AA(4). 29 Internal Revenue Code, s 877A. 30 This amount is adjusted for inflation. 31 $600,000 is the amount set in 2008. It is adjusted for inflation and was $663,000 in 2013. 32 Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, s 9H. 33 Commissioner for the South African Revenue Services v Tradehold Ltd \[2012\] ZASCA 61. Treasury:4032404v1 38 15. South Africa does not appear to have any concessions. However, ceasing tax residence in South Africa is generally a lot more difficult than it is in NZ and requires a person to notify the South African Revenue Service (SARS) that their tax residence has ceased. 16. South Africa has a withholding tax mechanism for land sold by non-residents. 34 34 Income Tax Act 58 of 1962, s 35A. Treasury:4032404v1 39 Appendix D: Comparative Analysis – Immigration Australia 1. When a person becomes an Australian resident (other than a temporary resident), they are deemed to have acquired certain assets at the time they became resident for their market value at that time. This determines the cost base of the assets for Australian capital gains tax purposes. 35 There is no “median rule” or equivalent. 2. However, this does not apply to assets acquired prior to 20 September 1985 and assets that were “taxable Australian property” (TAP) (e.g. land in Australia, a more than 10% interest in a company where 50% of the company’s assets are land in Australia, and assets that have been used in carrying on a business through a permanent establishment in Australia). Assets that were taxable Australian property continue to have their original cost base. There are also special rules for controlled foreign companies, certain employee share scheme interests. Canada 3. Where a person becomes a Canadian resident they are deemed to have sold their property and immediately reacquired it for a cost equal to its fair market value on the date the person became resident in Canada. 36 This will be the cost base for determining the capital gain or loss when the property is subsequently disposed of. There is no “median rule” or equivalent. 4. This does not apply to taxable Canadian properties (e.g. land and assets that have been used in carrying on a business through a permanent establishment in Canada). The cost base for these assets will be their actual cost. South Africa 5. Where a person becomes a resident of South Africa, the cost base of their assets for capital gains tax purposes is the market value of the assets the day before they became resident. 37 A “median” type rule applies to smooth out the gains or losses arising from the valuation. 38 (We note that South Africa generally does not seem to have basis ‘step-up’ clauses in their tax treaties, so the median rule is not overridden by a treaty step-up clause.) 6. This does not apply to immovable South African property (ie, land), or assets effectively connected with a permanent establishment in South Africa. The cost base of these assets will be their actual cost. 35 Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth), subdivision 855-B. 36 Government of Canada website, https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/individuals- leaving-entering-canada-non-residents/newcomers-canada-immigrants.html#PBC (accessed 23 October 2018). 37 Income Tax Act 1994, Eighth Schedule, paragraph 24. 38 Comprehensive Guide to Capital Gains Tax, Issue 6, South African Revenue Services, at 234-236. Treasury:4032404v1 40 United Kingdom 7. A deduction is allowed for the cost of acquiring the asset. 39 There is no allowance for a person to elect to treat a deemed disposal at market value where they become resident in the United Kingdom. A person may therefore be required to pay capital gains tax on the whole of the gain made on an asset, even if that gain arose when they were not resident in the United Kingdom. In practice, some tax advisors advise people to trigger a disposal of appreciated assets before they become tax resident in the United Kingdom to achieve a step-up in cost basis. 8. Broadly, a person who is not resident for a tax year, will not be subject to capital gains tax. 40 However, the individual may be liable for non-resident CGT in respect of the disposal of residential property, or otherwise caught by the temporary non- resident rules when they resume UK tax residence. In addition, United Kingdom residents who have their permanent home (“domicile”) outside the United Kingdom may not have to pay tax on non-UK capital gains. 41 United States 9. The basis of a property is generally its cost, and there is no provision to adjust the basis if the asset was acquired before the person became tax resident in the United States. 42 10. As in the United Kingdom, tax advisors generally advise people to trigger a disposal of appreciated assets before they become tax resident to achieve a step-up in cost basis. 39 Section 38, Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (United Kingdom). 40 Section 9, Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (United Kingdom). 41 HMRC website, https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/residence-domicile-and-remittance-basis-rules-uk-tax- liability/guidance-note-for-residence-domicile-and-the-remittance-basis-rdr1#how-does-domicile-affect-your-uk-income-tax- and-capital-gains-tax-liability. 42 IRS website, https://www.irs.gov/publications/p551. Treasury:4032404v1 41 Appendix E: Other options for establishing cost base of taxable assets on immigration 1. This Appendix discusses other options for establishing cost base of assets that enter the New Zealand tax base on immigration: a. Original cost; b. Median rule; and c. Straight-line apportionment. 2. The discussion below uses examples of taxpayers immigrating from Australia and the United Kingdom. These two countries have been chosen because many of New Zealand’s migrants come from these countries, yet they apply different approaches to taxes on emigration: a. Australia treats taxable assets as having been sold for market value on emigration (except where the taxpayer elects to treat the property as deemed- TAP property, as described above). If, say, a person migrates from Australia to New Zealand and is taxed in Australia on their assets on emigration, the NZ–Australia DTA allows that person to elect to be treated for New Zealand tax as if they had disposed of and reacquired their assets for market value immediately before they cease to be tax resident in Australia. The converse is true if a New Zealand resident migrates to Australia. b. The United Kingdom does not deem a disposal on emigration. Instead, it has a limited anti-avoidance rule for people who dispose of assets while temporarily non-resident (if the period of non-residence is less than 5 calendar years). Details of these countries’ rules on emigration are set out in Appendix C. For simplicity, New Zealand’s transitional residence rules are ignored in the examples. Option 1: Original cost 3. The first option is to set the cost base of taxable assets entering New Zealand at their original cost. In theory, this would allow New Zealand to tax the entire gain or loss on disposal, including any gain that accrued before the person became a New Zealand resident. The United Kingdom and the United States both use this approach for immigrants. 4. If the country from which the taxpayer came (the ‘other country’, for short) taxed the gain that accrued while the taxpayer was in that other country (by taxing a deemed disposal on emigration), New Zealand may be required to allow the foreign tax credit under the relevant DTA. This is the case under the NZ–Australia DTA. Treasury:4032404v1 42 Example 7 – Migration from Australia, original cost In Year 1, Tom, an Australian tax resident, buys some Australian shares for $100. In Year 3, Tom migrates to New Zealand. Tom ceases to be resident in Australia on the same day he becomes resident in New Zealand (‘Migration Day’). The value of his shares is $150. In Year 10, Tom sells the shares for their market value of $210. His actual capital gain is therefore $110. The tax consequences for Tom will be: • In Year 3, Tom is treated for Australian tax purposes as having a capital gain of $50. • In Year 10, Tom will be treated for New Zealand domestic tax purposes as having derived a capital gain of $110. However, this is modified by the NZ–Australia DTA, which allows Tom a cost base of $150, which effectively reduces (by way of a tax credit) the gain that is taxable in New Zealand to $60 (being $210 - $150). Overall, Tom has been taxed on his actual capital gain of $110 ($50 of which was taxed in Australia and $60 of which was taxed in New Zealand). 5. Setting the cost base of assets at their original cost has the advantage that, if the other country did not tax a deemed disposal on emigration, the entire gain or loss will still be taxed (in New Zealand only). This is the case with United Kingdom. Example 8 – Migration from the UK, original cost Assume the same facts as in Example 7, except that Tom migrated to New Zealand from the UK instead of Australia. The tax consequences for Tom will be: • There are no UK tax consequences as the UK does not generally tax assets on emigration. • In Year 10, Tom will be treated as having derived a taxable capital gain in New Zealand of $110 (being $210 - $100). The NZ–UK DTA does not affect this. 6. The main difficulty with using original cost as the cost base is that original cost can be easily manipulated by transfers between associated persons. It appears that some tax advisors in the United States and United Kingdom advise immigrants with substantial assets to trigger a realisation before they become tax resident. (Such a realisation may be structured so that it is not taxable, as countries often allow some rollover for transfers between associated persons.) 7. Although New Zealand has associated persons rules that could ordinarily deem such transfers to take place at market value, enforcing these rules for transactions taking place outside of New Zealand would pose practical difficulties. Treasury:4032404v1 43 Example 9 – Migration from the UK, with transfer to associated person Assume the same facts as in Example 8, except that Tom migrates to New Zealand with his wife Theresa, and, just before they migrate, Tom sells his shares to Theresa for $240 (market value of $150). Theresa ultimately sells the shares in Year 10 for their market value of $210. The tax consequences for Theresa will be: • There are no UK tax consequences as transfers between spouses are disregarded. Theresa would assume Tom’s cost base in the shares of $100, but as with Tom in Example 2, she will not be taxed in the UK on emigration. • In Year 10: o If New Zealand simply took actual cost as the cost base, Theresa will be treated as having a taxable capital loss in New Zealand of -$30 (being $210 - $240). o If New Zealand applied the same cost base that Theresa had in the United Kingdom ($100), she will be treated as having a taxable capital gain in New Zealand of $110 (being $210 - $100). However, it could be hard for New Zealand to find out what this would be. o If New Zealand applied our associated persons rules so that Tom is treated as having sold his shares to Theresa for market value of $150, Theresa will be treated as having a taxable capital gain in New Zealand of $60 (being $210 - $150). However, this could be hard to apply in practice. 8. We also note that, if original cost is the option used, it will be overridden by the median rule that applies on the Valuation Day for assets that the immigrant acquired before Valuation Day. As such, in at least the first few years after Valuation Day, the cost base of most assets entering the tax base on immigration will likely be their market value on Valuation Day. Option 2: Median rule 9. The median rule takes the cost base of an asset as being the median of: a. the actual cost, including costs incurred both before and after the taxpayer became tax resident; b. the market value on the day the taxpayer become tax resident, plus costs incurred after the taxpayer become resident; and c. the sale price. In the Valuation Day paper, the Secretariat recommended that the median rule apply to all assets except for listed shares on Valuation Day. 43 10. The reason why the median rule was recommended for transition on Valuation Day was to protect taxpayers against ‘paper gains’ (where there is a gain when measured from Valuation Day, but the asset was sold at a loss overall) and protect the Government against ‘paper losses’ (where there is a loss when measured from 43 Valuation Day Position Paper for Session 20 of the Tax Working Group (12 October 2018). Treasury:4032404v1 44 Valuation Day, but the asset was sold at a gain overall). On migration, this issue should not arise if there is a deemed disposal in the emigrating country (e.g. Australia, Canada and South Africa). 11. The median rule might be workable for countries that do not tax a deemed disposal on emigration but limiting it in this way would add complexity. In addition, the ease with which cost can be manipulated by associated person transfers occurring outside New Zealand suggests that the median rule is just as vulnerable to inflated market valuations as a market value rule (option 2). 12. An alternative reason for the median rule is to protect the tax base against inflated valuations and/or market highs on the transition date. However, countries that tax a deemed disposal on emigration often negotiate ‘step-up’ clauses in their DTAs, allowing the taxpayer to elect to be treated as if they had, immediately before their migration, sold and reacquired their assets for market value. Such clauses can effectively override the median rule when it would benefit the taxpayer as shown in the examples below, resulting in a ‘heads I win, tails you lose’ situation for the taxpayer. 13. South Africa uses a median rule for assets that enter the tax base through immigration, and it appears they do not tend to agree to ‘step-up’ clauses in their DTAs. South Africa’s DTAs with Australia, Canada and New Zealand do not have a ‘step-up’ clause, but New Zealand DTAs with Australia and Canada both have this clause. 14. If the taxpayer is coming from a country that taxes on emigration (e.g. Australia), the median rule may fail to protect the New Zealand tax base from a market high or inflated valuation if it is overridden by a DTA that allows a step-up from cost. This is shown in Examples 10 and 11. Example 10 – Median rule: market value above cost, asset sold at gain Assume the same facts as in Example 7, except with the following numbers: • Original cost $100 • Market value on Migration Day is $270 • Sales price $210 Applying the median rule, the cost base will be $210, and the tax consequences for Tom are: • In Year 3, Tom is treated for Australian tax purposes as having a capital gain of $170. • In Year 10, Tom will be treated for New Zealand tax purposes as having no taxable capital gain or loss. However, the NZ–Australia DTA may allow Tom to elect to be treated for New Zealand tax purposes as if he had, immediately before ceasing to be Australian tax resident, sold and reacquired the shares at market value. New Zealand may be required to allow Tom a tax loss of -$60 (being $210 – $270). In this case, Tom is taxed on an overall gain of $110 (being $170 in Australia and -$60 in New Zealand), which matches his economic gain. The median rule is overridden by the treaty and has no effect. Treasury:4032404v1 45 Example 11 – Median rule: market value above cost, asset sold at loss Assume the same facts as in Example 7, except with the following numbers: • Original cost $100 • Market value on Migration Day is $270 • Sales price $80 Applying the median rule, the cost base will be $100, and the tax consequences for Tom will be: • In Year 3, Tom is treated for Australian tax purposes as having a capital gain of $170. • In Year 10, Tom will be treated for New Zealand domestic tax purposes as having a capital loss of -$20. However, the NZ–Australia DTA may allow Tom to elect to be treated for New Zealand tax purposes as if he had, immediately before ceasing to be Australian tax resident, sold and reacquired the shares at market value. This could increase Tom’s taxable loss in New Zealand to -$190 (being $80 - $270). In this case, Tom is taxed on an overall loss of -$20 (being $170 in Australia and -$190 in New Zealand), which matches his economic loss. The median rule is overridden by the treaty and has no effect. 15. However, because ‘step-up’ clauses in DTAs are typically at the election of the taxpayer (as is the case with both Australia and Canada), the taxpayer would use this clause when it would result in a basis ‘step-down’ (i.e. lower than what they would get under New Zealand domestic law). In these cases, the median rule can cause New Zealand to forego tax revenue when the market value on Migration Day is below cost (e.g. during a market slump), whether or not the asset is ultimately sold for a gain or a loss. In this case the immigrant will be under-taxed, as shown in Examples 12 and 13. Example 12 – Median rule: market value below cost, asset sold at gain Assume the same facts as in Example 7, except with the following numbers: • Original cost $100 • Market value on Migration Day is $70 • Sales price $120 Applying the median rule, the cost base will be $100, and the tax consequences for Tom will be: • In Year 3, Tom is treated for Australian tax purposes as having a capital loss of -$30. • In Year 10, Tom will be treated for New Zealand domestic tax purposes as having a capital gain of $20. (The NZ–Australia DTA would not apply, as there is no reason for Tom to elect to have a lower cost base of $70.) In this case the median rule causes New Zealand to give up tax on $30 of Tom’s $50 gain since becoming a New Zealand tax resident, causing Tom to be under-taxed overall. Treasury:4032404v1 46 Example 13 – Median rule: market value below cost, asset sold at loss Assume the same facts as in Example 7, except with the following numbers: • Original cost $100 • Market value on Migration Day is $70 • Sales price $80 Applying the median rule, the cost base will be $80, and the tax consequences for Tom will be: • In Year 3, Tom is treated for Australian tax purposes as having a capital loss of -$30. • In Year 10, Tom will be treated for New Zealand tax purposes as having no taxable capital gain or loss. (The NZ–Australia DTA would not apply, as there is no reason for Tom to elect to have a lower cost base of $70.) In this case the median rule causes New Zealand to give up tax on $10, causing Tom to be under-taxed overall. 16. The above examples are summarised as follows: Effect of median rule Situation MV > Cost, Asset sold for gain MV > Cost, Asset sold for loss MV < Cost, Asset sold for gain MV < Cost, Asset sold for loss If DTA does not allow a step-up (e.g. UK) Protects NZ tax base Protects NZ tax base Protects taxpayer Protects taxpayer If DTA allows a step-up (e.g. Australia) No effect overridden by DTA (Example 10) No effect, overridden by DTA (Example 11) Under-taxes taxpayer (Example 12) Under-taxes taxpayer (Example 13) This table does not show situations where the market value is the median, as the result under the median rule would be no different to under the market value rule. Option 3: Straight-line apportionment 17. A third option is to allow a taxpayer’s overall gain to be apportioned based on the number of years the taxpayer held the asset while they were a New Zealand resident divided by the total number of year the taxpayer held the asset. We are not aware of any country that adopts this approach. 18. The straight-line apportionment method can result in taxpayers being under-taxed or over-taxed (relative to the actual gain that accrued while they were New Zealand resident). However, several issues with this method would tend towards under-taxation: a. This method uses the asset’s original cost to work out the total gain that is to be apportioned. As discussed earlier, original cost can be manipulated by associated person transfers outside New Zealand. Treasury:4032404v1 47 b. It can be very hard to verify the length of time that taxpayer held an asset for in the other country. c. Even if there is no manipulation, if a DTA allows a step-up to market value, the taxpayer is likely to choose this option only when it is to their advantage. Example 14 – Migration from Australia, original cost Assume the same facts as in Example 7 – i.e.: • In Year 1, Tom buys his shares for $100. • In Year 3, Tom migrates from Australia to New Zealand. The value of the shares is $150. • In Year 10, Tom sells the shares for market value of $210, realising a capital gain of $110. Tom was only tax resident in New Zealand for 7 out of the 10 years he held the shares. Under a straight-line apportionment approach, he would only be taxed on 70% of his $110 capital gain, being $77. This is likely modified by the NZ–Australia DTA, which allows Tom to be treated as if he sold his shares for $150 and reacquired them at the same price on his migration. Accordingly, the gain that is taxable in New Zealand is reduced to $60 (being $210 - $150). Treasury:4032404v1 48 Appendix F: Expected Return Method 1. This Appendix sets out the equivalence between a comprehensive income tax (CIT) and the RFRM, and contrasts that equivalence with what happens when, instead of a risk-free rate, an “expected rate of return” is used. To begin with, it repeats some material from section 2 of the RFRM paper. 2. To understand the basic idea, consider a simple example based on Annex A in the McLeod Review’s final report. An investor has $200 which is split equally between risk-free and risky investments. The risk-free investment generates $104 a year later, which is returned to the investor (i.e. the risk-free return is 4%). The investor invests the rest in a risky investment which returns $130 half of the time, but only $90 the remaining half of the time. The risky investment generates a 10% expected return. This provides a 6% risk premium over and above the risk free return which compensates investors for taking on risk. 3. The following table sets out the potential outcomes for someone with a 33% tax rate assuming, initially, that we have a CIT with full deductions for any capital losses. Table 1: Initial position with CIT Risk-free investment Risky investment Total before tax Tax Net return Risky investment does well $4.00 $30.00 $34.00 $11.22 $22.78 Risky investment does not do well $4.00 -$10.00 -$6.00 -$1.98 -$4.02 Expected return (50% \* each scenario above) $4.00 $10.00 $14.00 $4.62 $9.38 4. The person in the table above has an expected (or average) return after tax of $9.38. 5. If the government introduces the RFRM, the opening value of the portfolio is taxed at the risk-free rate of 4%. If the person does not adjust the portfolio, the change in tax treatment will result in the following outcomes: Treasury:4032404v1 49 Table 2: RFRM with no portfolio adjustment Risk-free investment Risky investment Total before tax Tax ($200 \* 4% \* 33%) Net return Risky investment does well $4.00 $30.00 $34.00 $2.64 $31.36 Risky investment does not do well $4.00 -$10.00 -$6.00 $2.64 -$8.64 Expected return (50% \* each scenario above) $4.00 $10.00 $14.00 $2.64 $11.36 6. The person’s expected return has increased from $9.38 to $11.36. At the same time the risk of the person’s portfolio has increased. The good outcome now provides $31.36 (instead of $22.78), and the bad outcome now provides a loss of $8.64 (instead of a loss of $4.02). Government tax revenue has shrunk from an expected $4.62 (with some market risk), to a definite $2.64 (without market risk). 7. If the investor wants to go back to the old risk exposure, she could sell $33 of her risky investment and put it into the risk-free investment so that she has $133 of risk-free investment and $67 of risky investment. If she did that, the result would be: Table 3: RFRM with portfolio adjustment Risk-free investment Risky investment Total before tax Tax ($200 \* 4% \* 33%) Net return Risky investment does well $5.32 $20.10 $25.42 $2.64 $22.78 Risky investment does not do well $5.32 -$6.70 -$1.38 $2.64 -$4.02 Expected return (50% \* each scenario above) $5.32 $6.70 $12.02 $2.64 $9.38 Treasury:4032404v1 50 8. You can see that the final column of table 3 is identical to the final column of table 1. Through portfolio adjustments, the investor has identical post-tax returns under the RFRM as she did under the CIT. Government revenue is lower, but it is risk- free. 9. It might be thought that a major advantage of taxing income as comprehensively as possible rather than having an RFRM is that doing so is likely to generate more tax revenue. However, there is an important flipside. While there would be a higher expected revenue stream under a CIT, this revenue stream would be risky and there are costs in being exposed to risk. As Weisbach (2004) has pointed out, if the government wants to earn additional revenue but expose itself to risk, it can do this by choosing a CIT regime, or separately investing into risky markets, including the share market. 10. Thus, this is the basic logic behind the RFRM as a possible alternative to a CIT (or a tax which gets as close to a CIT as is practicable). 11. Now we look at what happens if instead of a “risk-free return”, the expected return is used as the rate when there is an investment in the risky asset. It is assumed that the risk-free investment is taxed on its actual return. The expected return in the example is 10%. Table 4: Expected Return Method (ERM) with portfolio adjustments Risk-free investment Risky investment Total before tax Tax on risk-free asset Tax on risky asset ($133 \* 10% \* 33%) Total tax Net return Risky investment does well $5.32 $20.10 $25.42 $1.76 $4.39 $6.15 $19.27 Risky investment does not do well $5.32 -$6.70 -$1.38 $1.76 $4.39 $6.15 -$7.54 Expected return (50% \* each scenario above) $5.32 $6.70 $12.02 $1.76 $4.39 $6.15 $5.87 12. As can be seen in the table below, the expected return method reduces returns in all scenarios, and does not provide an equivalent outcome to the comprehensive income tax. It is over-taxation relative to the RFRM or the CIT. Treasury:4032404v1 51 Table 5: Comparison of CIT, RFRM, and ERM with portfolio adjustments CIT RFRM ERM Risky investment does well $22.78 $22.78 $19.27 Risky investment does not do well -$4.02 -$4.02 -$7.54 Expected return (50% \* each scenario above) $9.38 $9.38 $5.87 13. Potential advantages of an RFRM that have been suggested include that there would be no lock in (although this depends critically on there being accurate valuations). A realisation-basis tax on capital gains can lock taxpayers into existing assets even when it would be more efficient for them to swap to new assets. A disadvantage of an RFRM is the perception that it does not provide horizontal equity in terms of investors paying the same level of tax on their income.

The Group asked Australian CGT experts to review and comment on the Appendix in the Interim Report. These experts included: a senior tax partner from an international law firm, a senior tax partner from an international accounting firm, the tax manager in a large business operating in New Zealand and Australia (and globally), the Australian Tax Office, and an academic. The comments were received over a series of teleconference calls from each of the experts. To preserve what is commercially sensitive information provided by the adviser and/or the organisations they represent, the comments are not attributed. They have been anonymised and grouped broadly into topics. General 2. Caller 1 thought that, overall, CGT was important because it generates revenue and provides a secure mechanism for taxing some aspects of foreign investment. It is a secure tax for taxing ownership of land (if you’re going to tax rent, you should tax terminal value of land for equivalent). CGT is also important for their investment regime and Managed Investment Trusts (MITs). He also thought that CGT was a fundamental aspect of equity and maintaining perception of an equitable tax system. When CGT was introduced, there was a lot of political pushback but now, there is pretty much no pushback (debate is just focused on the discount). Overall he thought the Australian system has been working pretty well since 2010 (with the exception of small business concessions). 3. Caller 2 observed that the original CGT design in Australia was similar to NZ’s current proposals in terms of high level principles, but there had been many changes since 1985 (which have added a lot of complexity). Caller 2 focused his comments more on specific issues (particularly integrity) and provided less of a “big picture” assessment. 4. Caller 3 supported starting from general principles, and then carving out exemptions or concessions in specific areas where desired. Caller 3 said that we should bear in mind the interaction with other parts of our law but try not to overengineer it and keep the design simple. For example, instead of 60 different rollovers, just do 1-3 based on general principles and leave detail to the lower level. Overall design and copying what other countries have done 5. Feedback was mixed. Caller 1 strongly advocated we copy the Australian system as the rules had remained reasonably stable for the last ten years (i.e had been tested and amended significantly during the first 25 years but had remained stable since around 2010), Caller 2 advocated copying in parts (but also noted he may have a familiarity bias), while Caller 3 said we should develop our own system. 6. Caller 1 said the Australian tax system has worked out a lot of issues since enactment and, since 2010, has been relatively stable — in terms of legislation, interpretative material and litigation (legislation enacted 1987, rewritten in 1997, and regularly amended until 2010). He said that they copied the UK’s Act in 1985, even when they did not understand some provisions (and that in some cases they still don’t understand them). An advantage of copying the UK’s model was that it gave them a theoretical and legislative basis to fall back on, and created a lot less work. He observed that the main parts of the legislation that still give rise to concern are the small business concessions. 7. Caller 1 also thought that, given the close economic relationship between NZ and Australia, we should try to copy their laws (not just CGT law, but also shareholder- related relief in other tax law) as much as possible to ensure there are no Page 2 of 14 impediments to capital markets transactions. Similarly, Caller 2 said NZ’s rules should be similar to Australia’s to minimise cross-jurisdictional arbitrages, leakages. 8. Caller 2 observed there was a familiarity bias and said that, if there were times where he sounded like he was advocating for the Australian system, it was probably because of familiarity. What to tax 9. Caller 2 was firmly in favour of comprehensive inclusion with specific exclusions (e.g. personal use assets and excluded home), rather than a specific list of inclusions, as they’d never been able to come close to a comprehensive list of assets. He also pointed out that it’s easier to add exclusions to a list through regulations than to add asset classes in legislation. In particular it’s uncertain what is meant by “intangibles”, and there are issues with proceeds of litigation, etc. 10. Caller 2 thought the original model Australia used, based on property rights, was wrong. In 1989, they expanded the definition. Pre-CGT assets / grandfathering 11. Feedback was mixed. Overall, Caller 1 thought what Australia did (grandfathering the transition and then legislating close-out) worked very well, Caller 3 thought grandfathering was a very bad idea. Caller 2 was sceptical about the Valuation Day approach given difficulties with valuation, but didn’t seem to express a view either way on grandfathering. 12. The callers also disagreed about how common pre-CGT assets were at this point in time and how significant “lock-in” is. Callers 1 and 2 said they rarely saw pre-CGT assets now, and Caller 2 was not concerned about lock-in – he thought people didn’t hold onto assets and tended to sell them quickly, especially when assets pass through generations. He also said that often people thought they had a pre-CGT asset which turned out to be a post-CGT asset. In contrast, Caller 3 said that a lot of people with pre-CGT assets are starting to pass away now, and there is ultimate lock-in for those assets (which are regarded as “sacred cows”). They thought grandfathering really distorted decision-making and that people would do whatever they could (including with elaborate structures) to keep pre-CGT status as long as possible, even if it would’ve made sense to sell the asset long ago. 13. Pre-CGT assets can become post-CGT assets in a number of ways through “creeping asset” provisions: • Additions to existing assets: If a taxpayer does a significant capital improvement on land, the improvement is considered a post-CGT asset. • Change in shareholder continuity: If a company holds pre-CGT assets, but then has a more than 50% change in shareholding, all its assets are then considered to be post-CGT assets. • If entity value mostly consists of post-CGT assets: When at least 75% of the market value of a company’s assets are post-CGT assets, the shares in the company become post-CGT assets; this necessitates a valuation of the company’s assets at that time. 14. In some places there is no grandfathering. Caller 1 said that in 1998, Australia removed grandfathering assets for listed companies, which he thought was a great idea. Caller 2 said privatised entities used a valuation day approach. Caller 3 mentioned that, shortly after CGT was introduced, superannuation was brought into the base – this was painful at the time but there have been no issues since. 15. Caller 1 said that in the first 15 years of legislation there was a lot of CGT work done on those rules. He also said that there were one or two cases in the early-90s Page 3 of 14 on timing (because of how it applied to contracts to acquire assets) but that activity fell away quite quickly. However, Caller 1 said he expected that high wealth individuals in particular would still have pre-CGT assets. 16. Caller 3 noted that there were very complicated rules trying to work out how much value is pre-CGT and how much is post-CGT (e.g. if someone is selling an entity with both pre- and post-CGT assets). 17. Caller 3 said Australia should have learnt from the UK, which had grandfathering when the rules were introduced in the 1960s, and then switched to a valuation day approach (in 1988, the cost of assets held at 31 March 1982 were rebased to their market value). Market value 18. All callers agreed that valuation was difficult, particularly for intangibles. 19. Callers 2 and 3 pointed out valuations are still needed even with grandfathering as pre-CGT assets become post-CGT assets. Valuation is also needed for gifts. Caller 2 mentioned that all gifts are deemed market value disposals. 20. Caller 1 said that jurisprudence on market value is useless because it is unique to the particular factual circumstances, and cases just outline very preliminary principles. If there’s a difference of opinion, there’s a lot of frustration, uncertainty and cost. 21. Caller 2 said valuation is difficult not just because of the number of valuations required but because of the exercise itself. About 40-50% of the disputes he’d been involved in were valuation disputes. In one case, the difference between the ATO and taxpayer was the size of the Budget deficit in Australia. Valuers are not used to value CGT assets – rather, they value things for takeovers, purchases, etc. For example, when a trademark is registered – is the asset created part of the goodwill or is it from registration of the trademark? He thought there was good reason to value on migration to/from NZ, but not overall. Caller 3 also described issues with valuing intangibles and identifying the asset to be valued – for example was the asset goodwill or something else connected with or making up goodwill. 22. Caller 3 noted that shortly after Australia enacted a CGT, the ATO issued guidance on market value (TD 10). They said the guidance was quite relaxed (at least for transitions into the tax base – not sure if this applied more generally). Basically the guidance allows taxpayers to do whatever’s “reasonable” and taxpayers were not expected to pay for professional valuation advice. 23. Caller 3 said that there was some tension, even in related party transactions, that could help prevent excessively high or low valuations. People may want a valuation to be higher (for transferee to get a higher cost base later) or lower (so transferor pays less tax/stamp duty). Rate of tax – discounted or not 24. The callers seemed to agree that a 50% discount was too generous, and thought that we should tax capital gains at either 28% (Caller 1) or ordinary rates (Caller 3). Caller 2 did not express a view on what the rate should be, but thought that most of the complexity of a CGT came from integrity measures, rather than the rate differential. 25. Caller 1 thought that the economics and academic literature supported lighter taxes on income from capital, and that you shouldn’t seek to establish progressivity for capital income. He noted that, in Australia, a significant part of capital income is tax free because of generous (but inconsistent) exemptions/concessions for family home and retirement savings, and it was accepted that there was no coherent Page 4 of 14 policy position across different pools of savings (retirement savings, housing, and other). 26. However, Caller 1 noted that the discounted marginal rates for CGT created an arbitrage opportunity, whereby people could use negative gearing to arbitrage between the discounted CGT marginal rates on gains and deducting costs against labour full marginal rates. This was exacerbated by the fact that housing stock in Australia is mostly provided by retail investors (over 1.8m individuals in Australia invested in a second property for leasing). He observed that people taking advantage of this were in the top two quintiles of income, and so almost all at the 48% tax rate. (Negative gearing deductions from interest exceeding rental income taken against labour income (a 48% deduction) but gains on sale of the property at the discounted CGT tax rates.) 27. Caller 1 noted that the CGT discount is a political challenge. The Australian Labor Party has recently said they would reduce the discount from 50% to 25%. He noted that when it was introduced the discount rate based on indexation for inflation made sense – it was based on a 10 year holding period and inflation of 2.5%. But if you look at underlying inflation over past 10 years, the current discount is too generous. He also noted that there had been enormous asset growth in land (which has tapered off significantly now for residential land). 28. Caller 2 thought it was fair to say most gains were not taxed at 24% (half of 48%). There was a lot of income splitting in trusts, which might get effective corporate tax rate down to 13 or 14%. He also noted non-residents don’t get the discount, which was a macroeconomic decision. 29. Caller 3 agreed that as much as possible, we should tax capital gains like ordinary income and not have a discount. Loss ring-fencing 30. Feedback was mixed. Caller 2 was very concerned about loss integrity measures while Caller 3 doubted whether the complexity of ring-fencing was worth it (particularly if capital gains are taxed as ordinary income in other respects). 31. Caller 1 said that in the corporate community, carried forward capital losses are regarded as having virtually nil value and he’s never seen them recognised in the financial accounts as a deferred tax asset. This is because companies don’t often pay CGT. Listed companies that sell businesses tend to keep or de-merge successful ones and sell off unsuccessful ones (and make losses) (de-mergers are discussed further below). 32. Caller 2 said loss integrity measures were one of his top 3 concerns for revenue leakage (e.g. ability to take losses against revenue assets and the loss quarantine provisions). Caller 2 said the original rule was that something sold within 12 months would be “revenue” and outside 12 months would be “capital”. This changed after the stockmarket crash in 1987 – people made massive revenue gains for shares sold in the first half of the year, but when they sold their shares for losses in the second half of the year (e.g. to pay their tax bill) they couldn’t offset their losses against the gains. So now, if an asset is sold within 12 months it’s treated as a capital gain but can be offset against a capital loss sold outside 12 months (and converse is true). 33. Caller 3 did not think the benefit from ring-fencing outweighed trying to explain to people why their gains are taxed but their losses cannot be deducted (until later, anyway). They did accept that the cost of not having ring-fencing could be high. Page 5 of 14 Compliance costs and administration 34. Callers thought compliance costs were caused by the rate differential (according to Caller 3; Caller 2 disagreed), integrity measures (Caller 2), exceptions (Caller 3), prescribing how to calculate gains (Caller 3), and choices (Caller 3). 35. Caller 1 said that consolidation and CGT work is an enormous part of their practice. Transactions revolve around class rulings (similar to New Zealand’s Public Rulings) and there are a significant number of these rulings each year. 36. Caller 2 thought most of the complexity in the Australian rules came from ensuring integrity (rather than through the discounted rate). 37. Caller 3 said that two big aspects of compliance costs came from rate differentials and exceptions, and that they expected compliance costs would be lower if Australia did not have those. The third big aspect of compliance costs came from trying to prescribe calculation of the amount of gain – e.g. if a person’s profit from a sale looks different from their taxable “capital gain”. This could be caused by attempts to recapture deductions that occurred at different times but haven’t been accounted for properly in the past. 38. Caller 3 also said that a lot of the Australian rules allow choice, which adds to complexity and compliance costs. For example, people may need to keep parallel records because they don’t know which choice they will take until later. They suggested that choices be avoided where possible. Withholding and returns 39. Callers 2 and 3 seemed to agree that withholding was important for collecting from non-residents. However, Caller 2 did not think it was useful for managing compliance costs for residents. Caller 3 was more (cautiously) optimistic. 40. Caller 2 said it was very important to have effective withholding mechanisms – Australia did not use withholding for CGT until about 2 years ago. The withholding tax is not a final tax but can be credited to your final tax. Withholding was more about collecting from non-residents rather than simplifying the system for residents and Australia would probably regard it as a success on that front, even though there are compliance and administrative issues. Caller 2 thought that compliance costs could be better managed through information reporting and prepopulated returns by custodians, etc rather than withholding. 41. Caller 3 noted that the difficulty with withholding was that the withholding party may not know the cost. But if there’s an amount being withheld – e.g. 2-5% - that helps people acknowledge they will have a tax liability and file a return to get the right amount of tax sorted. They also pointed out that, particularly for individuals and small businesses, withholding could be a good way to help them manage their debt – i.e. it can be more convenient to get the cash at the time of the disposal, than 1-2 years later when they may have spent the proceeds. Provisional tax 42. Caller 2 said capital gains are excluded in working out provisional tax because they are lumpy, contract and payment may be in different periods, may not be known in time (e.g. if being assigned gains through a managed fund), etc. Cost base 43. Caller 2 noted that cost base analysis was in itself a high compliance cost – for example, to work out the cost base for a share portfolio held for some time, you’d have to work out the original cost, bonus issues, which shares were disposed of, etc. However, he did say that shareholders usually have good records through Page 6 of 14 custodians and share portals, and managed funds can manage compliance costs for investors. In contrast, he thought records for holiday homes were probably poor. 44. Caller 2 added that corporate accounting systems were not set up to work out the historical cost base. Australia is not prescriptive on lot management (FIFO, LIFO, etc). Rollover 45. Feedback was mixed. The callers all agreed that the rules had grown over time. Caller 1 thought there was a general unifying principle but Caller 3 did not. Caller 3 saw the rollovers as significantly increasing complexity and creating distortions and avoidance opportunities. 46. Caller 1 admitted that rollover was a bit of a patchwork but thought that overall it formed a coherent body. Generally, he thought, there was rollover if a transaction did not involve the release of cash. Practitioners would work to ensure that their clients got whatever rollover relief they were entitled to. Any significant corporate transaction occurs in the context of an ATO class/public ruling on de-mergers, buybacks, or return of capital of some sort. For example, if there were 3 parts to a transaction, and one part involved cash, they would work to make sure that the cash part does not cause the cashless parts to become ineligible for rollover. He said the system was not perfect and that the revenue authority has changed its position in applying those rules over time. 47. Caller 3 said that rollovers complicate the rules and create distortions. They suggested it was better if CGT was comprehensive at the high level, so that significant accretions of wealth could be brought to account, and then carve out specific exemptions/concessions where it is considered desirable (rather than letting the exemptions/concessions drive the design of your overall rules). 48. Caller 3 said the other issue with rollover was that there are too many and that they don’t know exactly how many because they’re not contained solely in CGT provisions (and some are even in non-tax law). Recently, they were surprised to find out there was one for common law superannuation plans. Moreover, the rollovers are all different and don’t follow the same model. Some are by choice, some aren’t; some are available to non-residents, some aren’t, etc. Caller 3 recommended any rollover be based on higher level basic principles, with conditions left to lower level. They described two basic types of rollover: • Involuntary (e.g. compulsory acquisition, divorce); or • Voluntary but don’t want to tax for some reason (e.g. like-kind reinvestment). 49. Caller 3 said that conceptually, rollover is meant to be a deferral. However, if there are multiple rollovers, that could wipe out tax in effect. For example: • Taxpayer buys Asset A for $100 • Taxpayer sells Asset A and buys similar replacement Asset B for $200 and qualifies for rollover. • If taxpayer then sells Asset B for $400, they should be taxed on a $300 gain ($400 less rolled over $100 cost base). But if they sell it for, say, $150, they just get taxed on a gain of $50 ($150 less $100), instead of having a $100 gain and a $50 loss. This seemed to be an issue because of the asymmetrical treatment of gains and losses in other parts of the tax system. Caller 3 said that some other countries have a “tagging” process where the disregarded gain is “tagged” to the new asset. But record keeping, etc would be complicated. Also, from a practical level, the revenue authority may not be able to tell where assets had been rolled over in the past (e.g. Page 7 of 14 in example above, the revenue authority may not know Asset B’s cost base should be $100). Death and gifting 50. Australia has rollover for testamentary gifts but not inter vivos gifts. The callers agreed that estate and succession planning was significant and complex. They agreed it was not an issue to deem gifts to be made at market value and taxed (Caller 2 in particular was very concerned that our proposal to allow rollover for gifts or settlements into trusts would create avoidance opportunities). 51. Caller 1 thought inter vivos gifts were relatively rare. Overall he did not see gifts as a significant issue (likely to be because of the deemed market value disposition). Australia also has relief in context of charitable donations. 52. Caller 2 said estate planning and wills was a difficult area. Rollover for transferring assets into a discretionary trust, and for inter vivos gifts were 2 of his top 3 concerns for revenue leakage from our proposals (the other one being loss integrity measures). He was a lot more comfortable with rollover for a transfer into a company (as the company or shareholder will get taxed when they sell their shares) instead of for transfer out of a company (e.g. into a trust). He said Australia had very few rollovers for things that are not going into a company. 53. Caller 2 said that family trusts are common so there’s little value sitting in estates. Estate planning is huge as there can be very different tax outcomes depending on the structure – e.g. transferring assets to 3 different trusts is taxable but not if it’s to one “family trust” with interests by 3 children. To get the tax benefit you need to make a "family trust election" and only distribute to that trust. There’s a penalty if distribute to someone outside the family network. He suggested that we should either (1) make sure vesting on death operates in the same way as in a discretionary trust; or (2) make the tax effects more widely known (for people who aren’t aware of it enough to plan properly). He did not see a lot of avoidance through discretionary trusts but thought this was due to other integrity measures. 54. Caller 3 agreed that there was lots of succession planning to avoid realising capital gains on death. They noted that Australia has a lot of rules on profit stripping and wealth extraction, so that profits extracted from a business are taxed as dividends. There is a lot of restructuring to avoid those extraction points. There is also planning to ensure realisation or extraction happens while someone is on a lower tax bracket. 55. Caller 3 said there wasn’t full rollover on death as it was time-bound. On introduction, a lot of people compared realisation on death to gift duty. The rules are complicated, but generally the transfer to the executor is exempted, and the executor then transfers the assets to beneficiaries. The beneficiary may include a discretionary trust, and the rollover deferral may survive a discretionary trust. There is also an issue in that some people inherit the cost base of an asset but do not get the information they need to evidentially support that cost or to determine what the cost actually is. 56. On inter vivos gifts, Caller 3 explained that a general feature of Australia’s rules is to deem non-arm’s length transactions to be at market value. They accepted this could be complicated. There are also particular rules for determining proceeds and the cost base, and Caller 3 suggested the rules could be less prescriptive. However, they still thought there was a need to deem a transfer to be at market value if an asset is transferred for no consideration or for below market value consideration. They accepted this could cause lock in until death. 57. Caller 3 observed there were some difficulties with jointly held pre-CGT assets – technically when a joint owner dies some part of the asset should be realised at Page 8 of 14 market value. However, people don’t comply and will just say the whole asset is pre-CGT. General business rollover (scrip for scrip and de-merger) 58. From 1997-99 there was a review of demerger relief, among other things (provisions enacted in 2002). 1 Chapter 19 of the report discusses scrip-for-scrip rollover and de-merger relief. Callers 1 and 2 thought the general business rollover provisions were important to capital markets. Caller 3 commented on rollover more generally, and not specifically on the general business rollovers 59. Caller 2 said that there are three types of rollover that facilitate top-end business: scrip for scrip rollover; demerger provisions; and top-hatting (ability to create single company above group). He thought we need to make sure these work well and facilitate business as CGT should not block sensible corporate transactions. He said it was important to follow and apply corporation law rules rather than tax rules. 60. Caller 1 said that if a company has a successful business it wishes to sell, it tends to de-merge it into the hands of shareholders and shareholders can each, individually, sell off their shares and access the CGT discount. This is much more tax efficient than having the company sell the business and distribute the proceeds to shareholders (taxable as dividends). The only things that companies sell for cash are foreign businesses (because they’re tax-free). 61. Caller 3 said there were many cases of people manipulating rollover and doing back-to-back rollovers in a way that wasn’t intended by the original provisions. For example, a taxpayer may try to sell a business, but will do it in 3 transactions that qualify for rollover instead of a single transaction that doesn’t – e.g. there may be a rollover to restructure a business a certain way; then they do a rollover to interpose an entity, then try to claim rollover or exemption on the final step. Small business concessions 62. All callers expressed concern with the small business concessions (including, but not limited to rollover). Callers 1 and 2 thought that the main parts of the legislation that are still unstable are the small business concessions; Caller 2 thought this was the area with the largest growth in concessions. Caller 3 also said the rules were complicated and incoherent, and they did not think the rules achieved the objectives they were aimed at (in some cases causing the opposite outcome to what was intended – e.g. inhibiting growth). 63. Caller 1 said any small business concessions need to be watertight, and that manipulation of these concessions by small businesses is rampant — because of the boundary issues, you need enormous care to ensure people who shouldn’t qualify don’t get it. Australia has a series of these concessions which he thought were essentially political. It is the one part of the CGT law he thought was not stable, as different governments always change them, and because the ATO is always discovering new ways they are being manipulated. 64. Caller 3 said the rules were complicated (both in the drafting and in the law itself), which has led to low practical compliance overall as it’s not often worth getting legal advice on this. People tend to self-assess themselves as being “small business” and assume they get a concession, rather than actually applying the laws. 1 New Business Tax System (Consolidation, Value Shifting, Demergers and Other Measures) Act 2002. The review appears to be the Ralph Review of Business Taxation, http://rbt.treasury.gov.au/. Page 9 of 14 65. Caller 3 suggested getting the rationale for the small business concessions clear: • One rationale was to ensure tax did not inhibit small business growth (Caller 2 also suggested this was one of the aims), but Caller 3 said the concessions had the opposite effect as taxpayers don’t want to grow above the thresholds. • Another rationale was that the business may represent some people’s retirement savings. However, the small business concessions had not been integrated with the retirement exemption of up to $1.6 million (the exemption for assets held for 15 years is still uncapped). Caller 3 suggested it would be better to design the CGT rules as they would ordinarily operate, and then have a separate retirement concession. If there is no general retirement concession, Caller 3 queried why specific concessions were needed for small businesses. • A third rationale may be to reduce compliance costs for small businesses (Caller 2 also suggested this). But Caller 3 thought the concessions had not done anything to reduce compliance costs. 66. Caller 3 also said the concessions were cumulative, quite generous, and not limited to rollover. There are many different rules (something like 28?) but broadly the types of thresholds/ factors involved were: • Net wealth – there are look-through rules to the business owners which involve lots of different tests, depending on how much of the business a taxpayer holds. Caller 3 noted this test can be manipulated (e.g. holiday homes are excluded from the asset test so people may kick tenants out of a rental property and claim it is a holiday home, even if it hasn’t been used as such for most of the period of ownership). They said the anti-avoidance rules were very rarely invoked. • Turnover ($2 million threshold) – the taxpayer only has to meet this threshold in the income year of the gain. • 15 year exemption – there is a complete exemption for assets that were held for at least 15 years, if it was an active asset for at least half the period of ownership. • Percent of ownership – 20% is needed to get one of the concessions (Caller 3 observed maybe it should be 100%, or at least controlling interest). But if you hold over 40%, all the value of the business is attributed to you (for the net wealth concession?). So there is lots of manipulation in between 20% and 40%. Caller 3 said taxpayers could choose one or the other (i.e. if they didn’t qualify under one threshold they could try the other) – one rule requires you to hold for 1 day, one rule requires to hold for 12 months, one rule requires to hold for 15 years. Overall they thought the rules did not make a lot of sense and it would be better if there was just one small business exemption – i.e. under a certain threshold, you don’t have to worry about the rules. 67. Caller 3 also noted that, because concessions exist at certain thresholds, people can become reluctant to expand their business. They suggested applying a consistent definition of “small business” (not necessarily just within tax law) – for example, there’s a $2 million turnover threshold for CGT concessions but $10m for some other concessions. They commented that, in a review/consultation of the small business rules, taxpayers have favoured a simple threshold based on number of employees rather than turnover or asset figure, because it is easier to know and control. 68. Caller 3 also queried why qualifying business assets excludes real property leased to third parties. They recommended having consistent definitions of “qualifying business asset” where possible. Page 10 of 14 69. When asked how much tax was at stake, Caller 3 said the CGT still collects a lot of tax, but noted that some of Australia’s wealthiest taxpayers qualify for the turnover test because of the two thresholds, and the fact that the asset test could be manipulated. There was also planning around rates, losses, and succession (in small business context). Taxation of shares – double deductions and double tax Double deductions and consolidation 70. All three callers thought the consolidation reforms worked well in dealing with double deductions within corporate groups. Before Australia had tax consolidation (in 2002), they just had lots of CGT provisions dealing with duplication of losses within capital groups. Consolidation can apply to wholly owned groups of companies. 71. Subdivisions 165-CC and CD deal with double deduction of losses (and still exist outside of consolidation). Broadly, they do 3 things: • Selling something with an unrealised loss – need an adjustment (Caller 2 said these are relatively simple). • Loss carry forward/loss testing for realised and unrealised losses when ownership changes, etc. – unrealised loss can only be recognised when the sale is eventually undertaken (Caller 2 also thought this was relatively simple). • Multi-tiered losses – adjust cost bases through chains when there are alteration events (major change in shareholding). Caller 2 said these rules worked to a point, but thought these were some of the most complex rules in the Australian regime. 72. Caller 2 said we should not model these rules as they are defective in numerous ways, but they could be used to understand problem areas. The immense complexity was one of the drivers for moving to consolidation. Caller 2 thought multi-tiered losses caused a lot more issues than subvention payments (Australia allows loss offsetting only if 100% common ownership, not 66% - he thought 66% was good). 73. Caller 1 thought there was lots of activity spent dealing with something done by relatively few people. The tax consolidation system has worked in that, within corporate groups, transfers generate no capital loss at all; and there is only tax if there is an external transaction for cash. Double tax 74. Australia has issues with inside basis vs outside basis for companies and trusts. Caller 1 did not think any effort should be made to solve double tax for companies as consolidation takes the problem away for groups. 75. There can be a distortion where a company has high basis in an underlying asset but shareholders have low basis in their company shares– Australia provides no relief, and has rules against people trying to manipulate out of that situation. Caller 1 thought that was right. 76. Caller 1 also noted that the way they administer trusts created opportunities to eliminate double tax (e.g. collapsing trusts). Australia has a lot of unit trusts. Avoidance, integrity and behavioural distortions 77. Caller 2 thought complexity came from integrity measures, and that Australia’s original rules in particular dealt poorly with proceeds of litigation; look through Page 11 of 14 entities; and market value substitution rules (when taxpayers are deemed to have paid/received market value). Value shifting and indirect transfers 78. All callers said we needed to think about value shifting — e.g. shifting value from one asset to another without disposing of either asset; or shifting value from one entity to another without triggering a disposal; restraint of trade payments that emasculate an asset instead of selling it; or other derivative rights over an asset short of full ownership. Australia has quite detailed rules for value shifting and have improved their market value substitution rules. 79. Caller 3 did not think the rules for dealing with derivative rights were robust enough and thought there should perhaps be an attribution rule. Gifting and trusts 80. Caller 2 was concerned about lack of tax on trusts, and was nervous about allowing the family home exclusion to apply to properties held in trusts. He mentioned an example of people rolling an asset over into a discretionary trust and then passing the trust onto someone in a tax-preferred way. 81. Although Caller 2 had some sympathy for the view that rollover for gifts to spouses is too limited, he said there could be many transactions where people pretend to have 12 unrelated transactions even though, if they had been combined (e.g. a gift plus a capital distribution) it would have been taxable. He agreed that not allowing rollover for gifting created an incentive to hold assets until death, but thought that may just be needed for integrity. 82. Caller 3 said there had been a recent resurgence in the use of life interests (e.g. right to occupy property) as this could be a way of providing value without significant cost, particularly with divorce and providing for children. Difficulties taxing non-residents 83. Caller 3 said it was a mistake to make the deemed disposal on emigration optional, because as a matter of practicality the ATO had no way to keep track of a person (and what they did with their assets) once they had left the country. 84. Caller 1 said there was a lot of difficulty in the hedge fund and private equity areas. In the past, there was lots of investment into mid-early stage mining companies and oil and gas with underlying land assets. Problems arose with treaty shopping, and interaction of CGT, revenue asset regime and treaty regimes. Some aspects may go away under the multilateral instrument (MLI). He said there has been a lot of reform of in this area. In particular, hedge funds and private equity tend to try and realise investments for cash, and play with many boundary issues to try and avoid tax on that. He described “long-arm” rules – e.g. if a Cayman Co sells Cayman Co 2, and fundamental value of Cayman Co 2 is from Australian land, Australia tries to tax that transaction. He was not sure how effective the rules were, but it has been a focus because there is a lot of foreign investment into the Australian resource base. He thought it may now be under control. Behavioural distortions 85. Caller 3 thought that there were distortions caused by grandfathering pre-CGT assets, rollover, and the various small business concessions (see above). 86. Caller 1 thought the two biggest distortions were overinvestment in residential property and negative gearing (see above), by a factor of 100. He thought that the generally tax-free nature of housing caused Australians to overinvest in their homes. He noted that the fundamental value of residential property arose from Page 12 of 14 zoning, but Australia’s zoning rules were quite restrictive. Caller 1 also said that when CGT was first introduced there was excessive investment in personal use assets, particularly cars. 87. Caller 1 noted that sometimes corporate restructures don’t qualify for rollovers so they don’t happen, but there weren’t a lot of those in Australia. Managed funds and PIEs 88. Caller 2 thought PIEs sounded similar to Australia’s attribution managed investment trusts (AMITs). Until the last 2-3 years, Australia’s system was unsophisticated. In most cases, AMITs distributed passive income and would only allocate capital gains at end of relevant year because they didn’t know the quantum until end of year. This led to the “last man standing” problem. However, Caller 2 pointed out that this was the case for 30 years and was not considered a huge concern. 89. Now the Australian rules allow the trustee to attribute gains independent of distribution to unitholders. Caller 2 said the tax rules were never used as a means of prescribing solution to that outcome and he didn’t think it was for the CGT rules to solve that problem. Instead, he thought the tax regime should just facilitate allocation of those gains, combined with corporate disclosure of those gains. Look through entities 90. Caller 2 said that every time a new partner is admitted to a partnership, there’d be a capital gain under the market substitution rules. ATO has said that for “no goodwill partnerships”, they ignore acquisition and disposal by admissions and retirements. Caller 2 used this as an example of the need for tax authorities to have support on the introduction of the regime, and for the need to be flexible. Proceeds of litigation 91. Caller 2 said there’s a detailed ruling about this. He says it’s not based in law but is practical and works. Again, Caller 2 used this as an example of the need for tax authorities to be flexible. Feedback from Business Caller 4 had the following comments: • CGT has had one big rewrite, when they dropped indexation, introduced consolidation, in the early 2000s. • Included assets: o When CGT was first introduced, it focussed on assets, following the UK model. This made things like restrictive covenants difficult where people get payments for granting contractual rights. The Cooling and Hepples cases are examples. So the rewrite happened, which defined the CGT events and how they are taxed. Caller 4 liked the prescriptive approach. o The Australian rule for personal use assets is that gains are only taxed if more than $10,000. Losses never deductible. o Sale of depreciable property – subject to tax as ordinary income in most cases, no CGT. • Anti-overlay provisions deal with the possibility that a gain might be subject to both income tax and CGT. Generally income tax takes precedence and there is no double counting. But just because a transaction is taxable under the income tax rules does not mean it is not also subject to CGT, where there might be residual tax due to quantum. So Caller 4 said every transaction is reviewed for CGT. Page 13 of 14 (This might not be the case under the design the Group is proposing.) Apparently there is no simplification rule for the capital/revenue distinction – whether an asset is on capital or revenue account is determined under the common law rules. • Consolidation: o Caller 4 said that when it came in the Government required corporate groups to adjust all their assets to market for tax purposes. The company Caller 4 was working for at the time wrote up depreciated plant and equipment by a few billion dollars. The Australian Government wore the loss of tax as the inevitable price of introducing a full tax consolidation regime. o Caller 4 thought NZ’s consolidation regime was hopeless, and we should at least move to having a single economic entity principle, rather than just eliminating certain intra-group transactions. o Caller 4 said the earlier version of the rules simply tried to stop loss duplication. Nobody understood the rules – they were famously impenetrable and probably did not work. Consolidation is very complex, but probably worth doing. Caller 4 thought it was probably the only satisfactory way to stop double deductions. o We asked about the rules for companies with less than 100% but greater than 50% common ownership. Caller 4 said there are rules to stop value shifting, but he was not familiar with this space. • Rollover: o Rollover is a pervasive feature of the CGT system. Caller 4 mentioned a range of restructuring type rules in addition to demergers and scrip for scrip. There is, of course, incorporation of a business by a sole trader or partnership. But also transfer of assets from one trust to another. o Caller 4 said that on death, Australia gives broad roll-over. o Australia has scrip for scrip as well as demerger relief. Also an outright exemption for sales of smaller businesses on retirement. • Cost base and record keeping o Every year the tax return asks the question, have you had a CGT event. People have to keep track of basis themselves. Note that individuals at least are allowed specific identification to establish the cost base of shares, so can sell those with the highest cost base first. o Caller 4 says CGT record keeping is a huge exercise. May have to keep track of basis for a long time and roll-over complicates this further. For corporates, CGT cost of assets is not the same as accounting cost in most cases. This means record keeping of cost base, even for corporates, is generally very poor. For individuals, records are generally inadequate and there is little/no auditing. o Cost base has a number of elements:  acquisition cost  transaction cost  non-deductible taxes eg stamp duty Page 14 of 14  holding costs  enhancement/improvement costs. • Complexity – Australian CGT is around 850 pages. Half (450 pages) is on basic principles. Most of the rest (370pp) is consolidation, then participation exemption. • Participation exemption – Caller 4 mentioned that the active/passive test is applied on the basis of the kind of income the target’s assets produce. Also, it has to be applied even if the company is in a listed country, i.e. one where none of its income is subject to attribution (e.g. the US). The test applies at the time of the CGT event which is contract date. This is annoying if the transaction requires the preparation of completion accounts at another date, e.g. settlement. Should use the settlement date, or other date used for transaction purposes (this was top of mind because Caller 4 was currently involved in sale of a foreign subsidiary). • Excluded home: o Important to define the exclusion by reference to the assets you are trying to exclude from the tax, rather than having a definition which is not tied to those assets o Australia allows a person to have two excluded homes for up to six months, where they are buying/selling. If the overlap is longer, the person has to choose one of them to be taxable for the additional period. (Logically you would expect people to would pick the one they are buying, so as to defer the tax.) o Caller 4 discussed holding costs where an excluded home ceases to be an excluded home and is later sold. Apparently, the system works by apportioning the gain on sale between the excluded and non-excluded period. Apparently, this also involves splitting holding costs between the two periods. This is done by aggregating those costs and then apportioning them. As most people have no idea of their holding costs while the home is an excluded home this is problematic. We suggested it would be better not to aggregate then split them, rather to only include in cost base those incurred while home is not excluded. In any event should not be a problem for us as the Group does not propose to include them in cost at all. • Valuation – Caller 4 noted that in order to do the tax return for sale of a manufacturing group worth around $800M, the cost of valuing the assets for tax purposes alone is about $1M (this cost would arise even without a capital gains tax in many cases, if the assets rather than the subsidiaries, were sold, since you would need to allocate the purchase price for depreciation purposes) .

Key points for discussion •Does the Group agree that recent developments have not significantly changed the recommendations on taxing the digital economy they made in the interim report? •Does the Group agree with the suggested text for the final report in the appendix? Recommended actions We recommend that you: a No te the developments outlined in this paper on the taxation of the digital economy. b Note that the sub-group has reviewed a draft of this paper and agrees with its conclusions. c Agree that these developments do not alter the Group’s conclusions on the taxation of the digital economy, as set out in its interim report. d Agree to include the text set out in the appendix in the final report. 2 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 3 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Further update on taxing the digital economy Position Paper for Session 23 of the Tax Working Group November 2018 Prepared by the Inland Revenue Department and the Treasury 4 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 1. Executive summary 1. This paper advises you on developments in the taxation of the digital economy since the Group’s interim report was published on 20 September 2018. 2. The main developments are that: • The UK announced the introduction of a digital services tax (DST), with effect from 6 April 2020. This measure will be repealed once an international solution is achieved. • Australia released a consultation paper on options for taxing the digital economy. This included consideration of the possibility of a DST as an interim measure. • The OECD is accelerating its consideration of an international solution. It has announced that it is aiming for a decision from the G20 in June 2019. 3. While these developments are important, we consider they should not significantly change the Group’s recommendation in the interim report – namely that New Zealand should continue to participate in OECD discussions, but be ready to introduce an interim measure if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction. However the Group may wish to emphasise the issues with a DST in the final report. Background 4. In the interim report, the Group concluded that: 24 New Zealand is very well-represented at the OECD, and the Group agrees strongly that New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD’s Inclusive Framework process. 25. Nevertheless, while international agreement is desirable, New Zealand should also be ready to act in its own best interests. Alongside participation in the Inclusive Framework process, the Government should ensure it is also ready to implement an equalisation tax, if the case for such a tax arises. 26. The introduction of an equalisation tax should depend on three key conditions: • A critical mass of other countries also adopting an equalisation tax. (The actions of Australia will be particularly important for New Zealand.) • New Zealand companies not being unduly affected by the tax. • The tax not simply being passed on to New Zealand consumers. 2. UK digital services tax 5. The UK announced the introduction of a DST on 26 October 2018 as part of its budget. The UK announcement is a reaction to the challenges posed by the 5 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE development of the digital economy to the sustainability and fairness of the international tax system. 6. The UK reiterated its commitment to an OECD multilateral solution by stating that a reform of the global tax system is the preferred long-term answer. However, the UK consider that progress internationally has been too slow. The UK’s interim measure is designed to ensure that in the interim digital businesses are not able to generate their value from UK users without paying any tax in the UK. The UK estimates that the DST will raise £1.5 billion in revenue over four years. Design of the Digital Services Tax 7. The UK DST will be a narrowly-targeted 2% tax on the UK related revenues of certain digital business models which derive significant value from active user contribution. Specifically, these business models are: • search engines; • social media platforms; and • online marketplaces. 8. The UK DST will apply to the revenue generated by these digital business models to the extent it relates to UK users. The UK DST will not apply to the direct digital sale of goods or services. To illustrate how the UK DST is intended to apply the UK provided the following examples: • if a social media platform generates revenues from targeting adverts at UK users, the government will apply a 2% tax to those revenues; • if a marketplace generates commission by facilitating a transaction between UK users, the government will apply a 2% tax to those revenues; and • if a search engine generates revenues from displaying advertising against the result of key search terms inputted by UK users, the government will apply a 2% tax to those revenues. 9. The UK DST will have the following key features: • A de minimis threshold of £500 million a year in global revenue. The first £25 million of relevant UK tax will also not be collectible. This is intended to keep small business out of scope. • A safe harbour allowing businesses making losses or lower profit margins to calculate their liability on an alternative basis. Those making losses will not have to pay the UK DST and those with very low profit margins will face a lower rate of tax. 6 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE • Deductible for UK corporate tax purposes rather than creditable against UK corporate tax. • Exclusion of financial payment services, provision of online content, sales of software/hardware and broadcasting services from scope. • A review clause will be included requiring the Government to formally review the UK DST in 2025 to determine whether it is still required following further multilateral work. It is intended that the UK DST will be repealed when an international solution is reached at the OECD. Next steps 10. The UK DST will be legislated for in the UK’s 2019/2020 Finance Bill and will apply from April 2020. As mentioned above, it will be reviewed in 2025 and will be repealed if and when a global solution is reached at the OECD. 11. A consultation document on the design of the UK DST will be issued in the next few weeks. This will explore key questions and concerns relating to the design to ensure that when implemented it will work as intended and will not place unreasonable burdens on businesses. 12. The UK’s announcement of an interim measure to address the tax issues associated with the digital economy may put pressure on other countries to introduce similar measures. 3. Australian Discussion Document 13. Australia released a discussion document on the taxation of the digital economy on 3 October 2018. The document sets out the Australian Government’s views on the digital economy, explores new options for taxing it (including the introduction of a DST), and invites public feedback on those options. The consultation period ends on 30 November 2018. 14. The discussion document (Australian Document) commences by observing that digitalised businesses provide enormous benefits to Australia. However under the current international tax rules, digitalised companies can have a significant economic presence in Australia but pay little tax. This is particularly an issue with ride-sharing and accommodation platforms, multi-sided platforms (like eBay), and digital advertising. 15. The Australian Document reviews all the recent international developments concerning the taxation of the digital economy, including the OECD discussions and the DSTs proposed by the EU and the UK. It canvasses several options for solving the tax problems, without expressing a clear preference for any of them. 7 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 16. The options fall into the usual 2 categories: changing the international tax framework at the OECD through multilateral agreement; or the introduction of a unilateral DST as an interim measure. Changing the international tax framework 17. The Australian Document notes that the definition of a permanent establishment would need to be changed in order to give a country taxing rights over a highly digitalised business. This would be achieved by expanding the definition to include a significant digital presence (without requiring a physical presence). 18. Next the profit attribution rules would need to be changed, so that some profit could be attributed to the digital presence and taxed there. The paper outlines various possible methods and asks for feedback on them. Some of the methods would apply just to highly digitalised companies, while others would apply more broadly. 19. The methods broadly are: • Attribute to the market country the value highly digitalised companies generate there from user-data or user generated content. • Attribute to the market country some of the income from a company’s intangibles. This would address a broader problem with the international tax rules, which currently allow a company to allocate much of its entrepreneurial profits to mobile intangibles, and then locate those intangibles in a low tax jurisdiction. This approach would apply to more than just highly digitalised companies. • a “deemed profit method”, which involves deducting presumed expenses from a company’s sales revenue from a country and taxing the resulting profit at the corporate rate. 20. The Australian Document also raises the issue of whether more fundamental reform is required for the tax system. A digital services tax (DST) 21. The Australian Document states that changing the international framework will require multilateral agreement. This will take some time to develop, and there is no guarantee that it will eventuate. Therefore a unilateral measure may be the only way to address concerns regarding the taxation of digital businesses in the near term. 22. Consequently the Australian Documents outlines a possible DST as another option for taxing the digital economy. This tax would have the following features: • It would apply to: 8 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE o digital advertising services; and o digital intermediation platforms (which match unrelated buyers and sellers on websites or apps). • It would have a threshold, below which it would not apply (eg local sales and/or global turnover). • It would apply to both Australian and overseas businesses, in order to comply with Australia’s world trade organisation and free trade agreement obligations. • It could be removed when a long-term multilaterally agreed solution was reached. 23. The Australian Document leaves the details of these features open for consultation. 24. The Australian Document also notes several disadvantages with a DST, such as double taxation of Australian businesses, increased costs for consumers, and high compliance and administration costs. 4. Developments at the OECD 25. Discussions on a multilateral solution at the OECD are progressing, with the task force on the digital economy scheduled to meet again on December 4-5. There is still no consensus on any solution, however 3 options are now being developed on a “without prejudice” basis for the OECD’s Inclusive Framework to decide on. These are: • A limited tax on digital services, focussing on social media, digital advertising, multi-sided platforms and data. • A broader approach, which would allow greater taxing rights to markets based on certain “market intangibles” created there by multinationals. This would apply beyond the digital economy, but we expect it to be targeted at large companies with significant intangible value in market jurisdictions. In particular, we do not expect it to apply to New Zealand’s agricultural exports, however we cannot be certain of this yet. This approach would not require the multinational to have a physical presence in the country. • A minimum tax type proposal. This would apply beyond digital transactions and would be targeted at related party transactions with low tax jurisdictions. This proposal really addresses some remaining BEPS issues and is not directly concerned with the digital economy. 9 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 26. The first two options are alternatives, and so only one of them would apply (or a combined version could be agreed on). The third option is independent of the first two, and so could apply in addition to them. 27. The OECD is putting a huge amount of effort into reaching a solution. It also appears to be accelerating its timeline and has stated that it wants to have a proposal for the G20 finance ministers to decide on in June 2019 1 . 5. Other developments 28. On 6 November 2018 the EU’s Economic and Financial Affairs Council configuration (ECOFIN Council) met to discuss details of the proposal for an EU DST. 2 There remains several technical issues to be worked out and there is disagreement as to how the EU DST should be applied in practice. Some members also clearly expressed their opposition to the EU DST as it stands. Members did agree that, if brought in, the EU DST should be temporary and no longer apply once a multilateral international solution is reached. It was suggested that the EU DST’s introduction be delayed until the end of 2020, to give the OECD a chance to reach an international solution. 29. Nevertheless, the Austrian Presidency reiterated that the objective is to reach agreement on the implementation of an EU DST by the end of the year, with a political debate to be held during the next ECOFIN meeting on 4 December 2018. 30. Accordingly the situation with EU DST is much the same as it was at the time of the Group’s interim report, with significant disagreement remaining between members as to the desirability of the tax. 31. However Spain has independently announced that it will introduce a DST, similar to the EU proposal, with effect from 1 January 2019. 6. Implications of developments for New Zealand 32. These developments should not significantly change the Group’s assessment in its interim report: • There is still no consensus at the OECD, although there has been some progress and the OECD has some new momentum to develop a solution. • A critical mass of countries have not yet adopted a DST. The UK announcement of a DST is significant, but they maintain their position that a multilateral solution is preferable and state that their DST will be repealed once one is achieved. Further the 2020 application date still gives 1 See the statements of Pascal Saint-Amans on October 16, as reported by Tax Notes International, October 22, 2018 on page 437. 2 The ECOFIN Council is made up of the economics and finance ministers from member states. Relevant European Commissioners also participate in meetings. 10 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE the OECD time to arrive at a multilateral solution before the UK DST comes into effect. In addition Australia has not announced that it will introduce a DST. • The desirability of adopting a DST still depends a lot on what happens in the first half of next year – in particular whether the G20 endorses the OECD’s proposed solution in June 2019. 33. However the Group may wish to emphasise the issues with a DST in their final report. These are: • The consistency of the tax with other tax settings. The DST would need to be designed so that it meshes with our elements of our tax system. This might still result in some double taxation of compliant firms (including possibly some compliant domestic firms). • The consistency of a DST with our international obligations. The tax could be designed as an excise tax (as with the EU and UK proposals), in which case it would not be covered by most of our double tax agreements (except for Australia, Mexico and Japan). However the tax would then be subject to World Trade Organisation (WTO) and free trade agreement (FTA) non-discrimination obligations. This might mean the DST needs to apply to some domestic firms as well as non-residents. • The economic incidence of the tax. The issue here is whether the tax would be passed along by the non-resident suppliers to New Zealand customers. We expect some of the cost of the tax to be passed on, but not all. • The effect on FDI and New Zealand’s reputation as a good place to do business. There is also potential for other countries to retaliate or adopt their own measures. While the total value of our annual exports for the year ended June 2018 was approximately $80 billion, a DST of the kind proposed by the UK and Europe would be unlikely to affect these exports. However the implications of adopting a DST for our export sector would need to be carefully considered. • The period of time for which a DST would be applicable. The OECD expects that any unilateral DSTs would be repealed once a multilateral solution is achieved. Accordingly if agreement was reached quickly at the OECD, then it may not be worth designing a DST that would only apply for a short period of time. • The administration and compliance costs of introducing a new tax. This is particularly an issue given that a DST is not expected to raise significant revenue. 11 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 34. In light of these issues, we recommend that the Government only consider adopting a DST if it becomes apparent that the OECD will not be able to reach a solution in a reasonable timeframe and a critical mass of other countries also adopt DSTs. In practice we expect the former to determine the latter - if a multilateral solution is not found at the OECD soon, we expect many other countries to adopt DSTs. Further any consideration of the potential net benefits of a DST should include a careful assessment of each of the issues outlined above. 12 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Appendix – suggested text for the final report 1. There have been several developments in the taxation of the digital economy since the Group’s interim report was published on 20 September 2018. The main developments are that: • The UK announced the introduction of a DST, with effect from 6 April 2020. Spain also announced the introduction of a DST, with effect from 1 January 2019. • Australia released a consultation paper on options for taxing the digital economy. This included consideration of a DST as an interim measure. • The OECD is accelerating its consideration of an international solution. It has announced that it is aiming for a decision from the G20 in June 2020. 2. We do not consider these developments significantly change our assessment in the interim report. The state of play is still fluid - it is still uncertain whether a multilateral solution will be reached at the OECD, and a critical mass of other countries have not yet adopted a DST (in particular, Australia has not yet adopted a DST). 3. The Group emphasises that a multilaterally agreed solution at the OECD is its preferred approach for taxing the digital economy in New Zealand (provided the effect of any such solution on New Zealand’s export sector is carefully considered). A DST has several issues, which the Government would need to work through before it decided to adopt one: • The consistency of the tax with other tax settings. The DST would need to be designed so that it meshes with our elements of our tax system. This might still result in some double taxation of compliant firms (including possibly some compliant domestic firms). • The consistency of a DST with our international obligations. The tax could be designed as an excise tax (as with the EU and UK proposals), in which case it would not be covered by most of our double tax agreements (except for Australia, Mexico and Japan). However the tax would then be subject to World Trade Organisation (WTO) and free trade agreement (FTA) non-discrimination obligations. This might mean the DST needs to apply to some domestic firms as well as non-residents. • The economic incidence of the tax. The issue here is whether the tax would be passed along by the non-resident suppliers to New Zealand customers. We expect some of the cost of the tax to be passed on, but not all. • The effect on FDI and New Zealand’s reputation as a good place to do business. There is also potential for other countries to retaliate or adopt 13 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE their own measures. While the total value of our annual exports for the year ended June 2018 was approximately $80 billion, a DST of the kind proposed by the UK and Europe would be unlikely to affect these exports. However the implications of adopting a DST for our export sector would need to be carefully considered. • The period of time for which a DST would be applicable. The OECD expects that any unilateral DSTs would be repealed once a multilateral solution is achieved. Accordingly if agreement was reached quickly at the OECD, then it may not be worth designing a DST that would only apply for a short period of time. • The administration and compliance costs of introducing a new tax. This is particularly an issue given that a DST is not expected to raise significant revenue. 4. Therefore, we recommend that the Government only consider adopting a DST if it becomes apparent that the OECD will not be able to reach a solution in a reasonable timeframe and/or a critical mass of other countries also adopt DSTs (including Australia). Further, any consideration of the potential net benefits of a DST should include a careful assessment of each of the issues outlined above.

MINORITY VIEW INSERT INTO CHAPTER 5 For: Tax Working Group From: Robin Oliver, Joanne Hodge Kirk Hope Date: 14 December 2018 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Re: Summary insert for Chapter 5 NB this has been prepared in advance of the revised Chapter 5 and so it might need some consequential amendments to fit within that content. This condenses our paper into the main points for inclusion in the appropriate place in Chapter 5 (after the summary for the majority). Minority Views The Group was asked to consider a system for taxing capital gains that would improve the tax system. In order to evaluate whether such a system would be an improvement or cause damage to New Zealand’s current tax system, the rules needed to be devised and then evaluated within the time available. \[These opening sentences could go elsewhere in Chapter 5 as they are generic.\] It is the view of three of the Group (Robin Oliver, Joanne Hodge and Kirk Hope) that the comprehensive approach to taxing remaining untaxed capital gains in New Zealand would impose efficiency, compliance and administrative costs that would not be outweighed by increased revenue, fairness perceptions, and possible integrity benefits. Our specific concerns follow. Tax system should not impede experimentation and innovation New Zealand needs to respond to demographic, technological and global economic change. Businesses must take risks and be encouraged to experiment with new ideas and methods; entrepreneurship and experimentation should be encouraged and not penalised. New Zealand’s tax system should not impede this. In our Terms of Reference the Government confirmed its view that our tax system should operate neutrally and as much in the background as possible and we agree with this. It can be seen from the circumstances noted below that the proposed capital gains taxing system will impose new impediments to innovation and is likely to distort investment decisions in more instances than at present. Residential rental housing We agree that there is a case for taxing more gains from residential rental property, based on advice from officials that the taxable income from such properties is low when compared with total economic returns. Comparing taxable income returned from this asset class with a rate representing a risk-free return applied to the same asset class indicates owners are relying on tax-free gains to complement their taxable returns from that investment. We accept the view from officials that there is a possibility that part of the incidence of any additional tax could flow through to higher rental costs. Given constrained supply of housing (through land supply, regulation and inadequate infrastructure) it is possible that this could lead to a reduction in the value of houses as well. However, the impact of imposing additional tax on housing will be only one aspect to be considered by Government in its policies aimed at rectifying housing unaffordability. If gains from residential property are to be more fully taxed, then this could be done with some modifications by extending current rules, including the bright-line tests (and the proposed rules contained in Volume II that deal with housing could be used as a basis to amend the current bright line tests). Alternatively, we consider that a simpler option could be to apply the risk-free return method, or something similar, to residential housing. This method taxes net equity in an asset at a fixed rate each year. Extending the tax base in this more limited way would generate much of the revenue expected from the comprehensive capital gains tax contained in Volume II. Officials estimate that some 39% of the total revenue from a capital gains tax would be from residential houses over a 10 year time period 1 . Other asset classes The incremental approach of extending the tax base carefully over time has served New Zealand well over many of years of tax reform. However, extending the taxation of capital gains to the additional asset classes referred to below in accordance with our proposed capital gains tax system (having regard also to the proposed timeframe for enactment of the legislation) is problematic. Other land and buildings, businesses and goodwill Land and buildings (other than residential rental) can be inextricably integrated with business activities conducted on or within them. Taxing gains on business assets, including goodwill, gives rise to an increasing need for roll-over reliefs and exceptions which are intended to reduce lock-in impacts and compliance costs, but can cause the reverse. It can be seen from the rules we have designed that there will be complexity, high compliance costs and inconsistent rules and these are characteristic of many overseas capital gains tax systems. The need to value business assets such as goodwill and other intangible assets on introduction date is one illustration. Valuing such property is likely to impose high compliance costs on businesses. It could also impose an unacceptable fiscal risk to the government (even with the proposed median rule). The response is to ring fence capital losses following from the valuation day cost base of these assets coming into the regime and this imposes a tax penalty on the experimental activity New Zealand needs to encourage. These particular rules are necessary to protect the tax base but they would directly impede experimentation and innovation. Taxing share gains Taxing both business asset gains and share gains could create double taxation and potentially double deductions. Complex rules are required to counter the latter and the former would create a comparative tax penalty on New Zealanders owning shares in New Zealand companies, as compared to the proposed tax treatment of foreign shares (under the fair dividend rate method). A comprehensive tax on capital gains requires a redesign of current tax rules applying to KiwiSaver and other Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs), changing the current relatively consistent tax treatment of investors irrespective of the entity through which investments are made. Such inconsistency risks damage to New Zealand’s capital markets. Additionally, taxing KiwiSaver and PIEs on Australasian share gains on an accrual basis and requiring the government to cash out accrued losses will create a significant fiscal risk to the government. Not to do so would impose a tax penalty on KiwiSaver and other PIE investors. The proposed capital gains tax system on shares increases the tax on New Zealand owners of shares in New Zealand companies while, because of our double tax agreement obligations, foreigners owning New Zealand shares would mostly have no tax increase. The same would apply to New Zealanders owning foreign shares. While the reasons for these as explained in Volume II are valid, the outcome is clearly adverse. 1 $0.18b out of a total of $0.59b in year 1 (30.5% of total CGT forecast) through to $2.4b out of a total of $6.2b in year 10 (39% of total CGT forecast in that year) While there is evidence that residential rental properties are under-taxed there seems little to suggest that overall, New Zealand companies or shareholders, with the possible exception of land rich companies, are taxed at less than full economic income in the same way that residential rental properties are undertaxed. Revenue to be raised The extra revenue forecast to be raised from the more comprehensive approach to taxing remaining gains seems relatively low, reflecting the additional fiscal risks the Government would assume. In taxing gains from business assets and shares the Government would assume a proportion of what has been private sector risk; the Government simply assumes a proportion of investor risk and in return receives as tax revenue a proportion of investor gains. The Government could assume the same risk and extra revenue by investing directly in the share market. Conclusion We agree that gains from residential rental property could be more fully taxed. Existing rules can be amended or more targeted rules introduced to achieve this. The fairness benefits from extending the proposed capital gains taxing system to other assets are likely to be overstated, especially given the exclusion of the family home set by our Terms of Reference. Our current tax system is relatively simple and efficient. It does not overly impede the type of experimental behaviour to be encouraged in the future. In our view it would be preferable to amend some current rules (residential rental homes) and to better enforce existing rules. For example, a study received by the Group 2 estimated that the hidden (untaxed) economy from underreporting of income by self-employed (on average, 20% of their gross income) could raise approximately $850 million per annum. Countering tax evasion and properly enforcing rules already in place relating to property gains seems more sensible than introducing a new comprehensive capital gains tax system with high revenue risks and relatively moderate additional tax revenue to be collected over the forecast period. For the reasons above it is our judgment that the disadvantages of the comprehensive capital gains taxing system we have worked on with the Group outweigh the advantages and it should not be implemented. 2 Cabral, A.

1 Re 4 May paper: 3.2 Company Tax Rate Issues – Supplementary information Bill Rosenberg The paper models the domestic impacts of a decrease in the company tax rate. As it states, this is difficult. I would just add that the type of model used by the Australian modelling is based on a number of assumptions that further limit confidence in its results. For example the Australian model uses a single representative household, so it does not allow modelling of distributional effects (and also ignores the progressive personal tax structure) nor the impacts on household debt (and a fixed savings rate is assumed). Because the single household is the sole supplier of labour (and owner of all domestically owned capital), the model is unable to model unemployment nor imbalances in bargaining power impacting wages. It is difficult to guess the impact of these simplifications, but certainly a reduction in the company tax could have distributional effects. It is not clear whether the New Zealand modelling presented differs significantly in this regard. Section 3 of the paper (p.18ff) discusses impacts of company tax rates on foreign investment. In a footnote it estimates the net inflows of capital from abroad over the last decade from the current account deficit at 3.5% of GDP. However care needs to be taken in doing this. It is important here to distinguish finance capital from other forms. Not all always brings capital deepening. The potential benefits of foreign investment in capital deepening, technology diffusion, know-how, transfer of skills (human capital) and export markets come principally from Foreign Direct Investment, the majority of which is equity sufficient to confer a degree of control of the firm. Finance capital in the form of debt may allow capital deepening but at the margin is used for buying houses (and appears to be in plentiful supply); in addition income from it is not taxed at the New Zealand company income tax rate. Finance capital in the form of portfolio equity investment (where no control is involved) is similar to debt in that it does not provide those additional benefits, but differs in the distribution of risk and in being subject to company income tax. Foreign direct investment is partly equity (subject to company income tax) and partly debt. Only the equity is taxed as company income, and so this is the key area of concern regarding the impacts of company tax rates. The other forms of foreign investment could in theory assist capital deepening but that depends on where they are invested (significant given so much ends up in housing) and other factors. If FDI is used to acquire existing assets, the question is how the financial proceeds from the takeover are used. Over the last decade, FDI equity inward flow has averaged 7.1% of business investment (gross fixed capital formation excluding residential buildings and weapon systems). FDI equity plus non-equity was 5.3% of business investment (there was an outflow of non- equity FDI in eight of the ten years). This is about a third of the 15.9% the paper estimates for all foreign investment using the current account deficit. Of the $397.9 bn stock of foreign investment in New Zealand at March 2017, $70.1 bn or 17.8% was FDI equity and $42.1 bn or 10.6% was FDI non-equity. Portfolio equity plus debt was another $185.1 bn of which 2 $39.1 bn was equity. The remainder was $25.1 bn in financial derivative liabilities and $74.7bn in “Other investment liabilities” which is mainly loans, currency and deposits. The return on equity is, as would be expected, significantly higher than on debt, and the after- tax rate of return to FDI equity (not including capital gain) averaged 11.8%, double the 5.6% return to portfolio equity over the decade. (Data from Statistics New Zealand’s Balance of Payments, International Investment Position and National Accounts: Infoshare series BOP058AA, IIP088AA, SNE034AA.) The question arises whether the FDI does in fact provide those potential benefits in New Zealand. The paper quotes Fabling and Sanderson (2011) whose research has cast some doubt on this. (Fabling, R., & Sanderson, L. (2011). Foreign Acquisition and the Performance of New Zealand Firms (Treasury Working Paper No. WP 11/06). Wellington, New Zealand: The Treasury. Retrieved from http://purl.oclc.org/nzt/p-1425). There is further research on other aspects: Sanderson, Fabling and Maré found that in contrast to international experience, which shows significant wage premiums for working in foreign‑owned firms, the wage premium in New Zealand is only 2.7 per cent to 3.5 per cent after taking account of factors such as firm size, location, industry, and the tendency of such firms to hire more highly skilled workers. They also comment: “These findings give little support to the argument that foreign firms provide substantial indirect or spillover benefits to domestic firms through human capital accumulation and labour mobility.” Maré, D.

Retrieved from http://purl.oclc.org/nzt/p-1696 Doan, Iyer and Maré looked for increased productivity through three types of potential “spillovers” in the form of local firms learning from their interactions with overseas firms. They concluded: “We find little evidence of substantial positive spillover effects from FDI to local firms’ productivity”. (Doan, T. T., Iyer, K. G., & Maré, D. C. (2014).

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Retirement villages and capital income Officials note from ETR report attached at end. There are three primary ways retirement villages generate accounting income: 1) Unrealised revaluations of the value of the retirement villages. The underlying land and buildings are rarely if ever legally sold. The valuation change comes from a p resent value of the expected cashflow from the occupancy advances (or interest free loans). 2) The ‘sale’ of occupancy advances for use of the properties. Such advances, perhaps less a management fee, are returned to the resident, or the resident’s estate, upo n vacating the property. These can be treated as interest free loans from the resident to the company with the effect that there is value transferred to the company the longer the loan is outstanding. Such an approach has a tax benefit for the residents. Instead of earning taxabl e i ncome from that advance and paying rent from the tax paid income; they get tax free imputed rents from the use of the property. That is instead of earning $100 which would give them $80 to pay rent; the entire $100 can provide an imputed rent. 3) Services to residents. This can come from periodic (often monthly) payments for services Tax effects 1) The unrealised revaluation income is not included in taxable income under normal income tax rules. Even with an extension of the taxation of capital income to realised gains this would not be included in taxable income. 2) There is a specific determination for the interest free loans. 1 Embedded in the consideration component is both the receipt from the resident and the future payment to the resident. The latter because there is a legal obligation to repay the funds. Similar outcomes arise if they are not treated as interest free loans but occupancy advances. The occupancy advance is taxable but there is an equivalent deduction at the same time as there is a legal obligation to repay at any point determined by the resident. 3) The services income is returned as earned. 4) As the provision of residential property is one of the objectives of retirement villages, this is GST exempt meaning that no input tax credits can be claimed for 1 http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/determinations/accrual/det-s16-retirement-village.html these supplies although GST output tax is paid and input credits claimed on services such as care. 5) Dividends paid to shareholders are generally unimputed. This means that tax will be paid by the shareholders. Although to the extent charities or tax exempt own these shares there will be no further taxation. Non-residents should pay non-resident withholding tax of 15%. Key cashflow effects 1) There are no cashflow effects from the unrealised revaluations. 2) Initially there is a cash outflow from the construction and a cash inflow from the interest free loan in the year it is received. Subsequently there is a cash outflow of the original advance and a cash inflow from the reoccupancy. According to the officials’ note this surplus is the basis of the dividends paid to shareholders. Overall effect High accounting profit, low or no tax paid but dividends paid from the cash surpluses. No GST input tax credits available on the provision of residential accommodation and some tax paid at the shareholder level. Options 1) Do nothing. In my view the time value of money benefit to the companies is the equivalent of rent. While rent is taxable; to earn a rental stream debt or equity is necessary to build the properties and buy the land. If debt is used, and as NZ companies there are no constraints, the interest would be deductible. Therefore it is arguable that the interest free loan – while providing no taxable income – also means there is no need for an associated deduction for interest. Further to the extent a dividend is paid there is tax paid at this stage. This argument weakens to the extent there are non-resident or exempts as shareholders. GST is a cost and a tax paid on the provision of residential property. Most importantly in the event income tax is extended to gains on the sales of shares; as the unrealised capital gains of the companies are reflected in the share price shareholders will be paying tax on the increase in the value of the properties. 2) Deem a realisation event when the occupancy changes hands. This could only be on the basis that the underlying substantive ownership has changed and this would be consistent with other realisation events. 3) Apply RFRM if rental properties generally were to become subject to RFRM. The logic could equally apply here. That is a component of the gain is the expected capital gain on sale. 4) Separate regime which delayed deduction til time was paid out. This would align with cashflows and how the business operates is terms of shareholders. Group’s preference If income tax is extended to gains on the sales of shares, the group’s preference is to do nothing particular for this industry as it will be fully taxed on its economic income albeit in a different way to other industries. A taxation of the gains on share sales will align New Zealand’s tax settings of this industry with Australia’s. On this basis nothing particular to this industry needs to be discussed in the interim report. If, however, such a change to the taxation of capital income does not occur this may need to be reconsidered. Andrea Black 8 August 2018 ii) Residential Care Services Explanation provided in April 2018 report based on a sample of tax adjustment schedules 1. Most residential care service groups are in a tax loss position and do not have an ETR. Others operate as charities and claim a business income tax exemption under section CW 42. Irrespective of whether they are in a tax loss or tax profit position, if a residential care service group is not tax exempt then it typically makes the following significant tax adjustments. Significant tax adjustments that decrease the effective company tax rate: Unrealised gains and occupation rights adjustments In addition to revaluations of properties owned by residential care services this includes adjustments made for sales of occupation rights. Occupation rights are effectively interest free loans that a resident provides to a retirement village that roughly matches the value of the property a resident is moving into. When a resident leaves, the village repays the loan (minus a fee) and enters into a loan with a new resident based on an increased value of the property. Some villages appear to treat the increase in the value of the loan as income for accounting; however the difference is not taxable. Deferred management fees Some firms have management fees that are payable when a resident of a retirement village leaves the village. There can be differences in when they are recognised as income for tax and accounting purposes. Interest adjustments This is mainly interest that is deducted for tax purposes but has been capitalised into the cost of the asset for accounting purposes Tax depreciation being greater than accounting depreciation Supplementary explanation 2. Residential care service groups do not have specific rules for calculating taxable income under the Income Tax Act. The form of the agreement between an operator and a resident will give rise to different tax consequences. 3. It is common for retirement villages to use “ingoing fees” (the entrance price), “exit fees” (a percentage of the ingoing fee when the resident leaves, eg 2% pa capped at 20%) and “exit entitlements” (a resident who leaves may receive an amount from the operator when the unit is sold to a new resident). 4. There are different views as to whether the economic gains should be taxed under current law. In general, retirement village operators claim that residents make an interest-free loan to the retirement village operator (usually around 80% of the price for outright purchase) in return for a right to occupy a unit.2 When the occupation right terminates and a replacement resident is found, the retirement village operator refunds the advance subject to certain deductions such as a 20% deferred management fee. The economic gain to the retirement village operator is equivalent to the difference between the original advance refunded to the exiting resident and the replacement advance paid by the new resident. 5. However this economic gain does not give rise to net income for tax purposes. This is because the replacement advance is fully repayable in the future (on the exit of the new resident). Accordingly any income arising on receipt of the replacement advance is immediately offset by an equal deduction for its future repayment3. This tax treatment is not altered by the fact that certain fees are offset against the future repayment. 6. A capital gains tax would not change this tax outcome. The tax outcome arises from the immediate offsetting of the replacement advance’s future repayment (resulting in no net income), rather than the characterisation of that replacement advance as income or capital. We note that Australia has the same issue with taxing its retirement village operators, despite having a comprehensive capital gains tax. 2 Some retirement villages structure the payment as a refundable lease premium, but this does not change the tax result. 3 This is under either the current financial arrangement rules (where the payments are structured as a loan) or the ordinary deductibility rules (where the payments are structured as refundable lease premiums) 7. The following example outlines the tax treatment of a typical residential care unit. Residential care: tax treatment of a single unit +$400,000 grant of occupancy right +$500,000 grant of new occupancy right +$650,000 grant of new occupancy right +$800,000 grant of new occupancy right -$300,000 cost of construction -$400,000 refund to exiting resident at end of occupancy -$500,000 refund to exiting resident at end of occupancy -$650,000 refund to exiting resident at end of occupancy (1) (2)(3)(4) Time and market value of land • Retirement village makes a cash gain on each new grant of an occupancy right for the unit, which occurs every 7 years on average. The gain equals the new grant price less the refund of the old grant price. • The grant price is proportional to the current market value of the unit (80% of the freehold value). So the retirement village makes a cash gain on each new grant provided the land’s market value has increased. • Cash gain is $100,000 at (1), 100,000 at (2), 150,000 at (3), 150,000 at (4) • The cash gain is returned as a realised profit for accounting purposes and used to pay dividends to shareholders. • For tax purposes, the cash gain is ignored. Instead tax only sees a series of refundable lease premiums (or loans). Since each payment will definitely be refunded in full, it is never returned as income. • Retirement villages also enjoy some tax deferral benefits in respect of depreciation and the deferred management fee. However, it is the above tax treatment that causes their persistently low effective tax rate.

What role can tax play in helping us manage this change? TE AO MĀORI AND THE FUTURE The Māori economy is growing - between 2010 and 2017, the Māori asset base grew from $36.9 billion to $50 billion. Māori have a thriving entrepreneurial base, with around 8,500 Māori owned businesses and 21,000 self-employed Māori across Aotearoa New Zealand. Māori values such as manaakitanga (the care of land and each other), whanaungatanga (wider kinship ties) and kaitiakitanga (guardianship and sustainability) drive business decisions. How can the tax system support this growth? THE CHANGING NATURE OF WORK We are seeing a growth in the ‘gig economy’ - where workers have a less regular income, fewer working hours and different conditions. This could have an effect on the collection of taxes as this would make collecting income tax on a pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) basis harder. A more internationally mobile and ageing workforce could also mean work looks very different in the future. Can tax play a role in managing this change? ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES New Zealand’s unique ecosystem makes an important contribution to our economy and quality of life. However, this could be under threat when you consider that 72% of native freshwater fish species are threatened or at risk of extinction; emissions of major air pollutants have increased; and we have the second highest level of carbon emissions per GDP in the OECD. Should current polluters incur the cost of any future financial loss being caused by their activity? Should they also pay for a possible loss in our future quality of life? TECHNOLOGY The digital revolution is already impacting many parts of New Zealanders’ lives. Online platforms have made it easier for people to rent out their car or home. New technological changes could also mean tasks that were once done by people are performed by machines. How can the tax system be flexible enough to keep collecting revenue whatever changes come? IMPROVING PRODUCTIVITY The productivity of the New Zealand economy is well below leading OECD countries. At the same time, New Zealand’s company tax rate is the tenth highest in the OECD. It is important that the tax system promotes the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy. Are the current settings working for New Zealand? INEQUALITY It’s not clear whether income and wealth inequality is increasing, decreasing or staying the same. It all depends on what you measure. But public concern about inequality is rising and is likely to continue to rise. Taxation plays a major role in redressing inequality. How could it be done better? GLOBALISATION Some multinational corporations pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. This is particularly a problem in the digital economy, where goods and services can be sold to New Zealanders from anywhere. This has to be addressed internationally, but are there issues that we in New Zealand should be particularly focused on?

TAX AND TE AO MĀORI A simple glance at our population tells us that Māori will play an important role in Aotearoa’s economic future. As citizens, taxpayers, business owners, and kaitiaki – we need to hear your views and ideas. The Tax Working Group’s job is to come up with a tax system that will support the Aotearoa of the future. Tax is all about how we organise our collective resources. It’s a big kaupapa so that’s why it’s important your voices are heard before we present recommendations to Ministers. We want to hear what matters to you, your whānau and your mokopuna. The mahi of this Group is relevant to all whānau. Whether you: pay tax on your income own a businesshave thoughts on housing in Aotearoa feel like the tax system needs to change to support your tamariki and mokopuna in the future have interests in Māori land have views on taonga assets like land or water WHAT MATTERS TO YOU? WHY IS THIS OPPORTUNITY DIFFERENT? The Tax Working Group wants to hear your views and is especially keen for tangata whenua to play an active role in this year’s discussions. We will have an increasingly older Pākehā population that will be dependent on a larger and younger proportion of working age Māori. Your voice matters. This group is focused on fairness, balance and how to ensure the system keeps pace with changes in our world. Māori voices need to be heard – and the group is listening. Everyone’s kōrero is crucial - from our rangatahi to our kaumātua. The Group needs to know how tax affects you. What works? What hurts? What might help you get ahead? What’s just plain hōhā? The Māori economy is a growing force with an estimated asset base worth $50 billion. This is a powerful engine of the New Zealand economy so your voice matters. Disparities persist - 44% of those deemed eligible for social housing are Māori. That’s a lot of whānau for whom owning their own home is a distant prospect. Your voice matters. It’s a chance to talk about what it means to have more than one job or to have a short-term contract. Does the tax system make this easy for you? You can also tell the Group whether parts of the tax system need to better incorporate the view of te ao Māori. What should the Tax Working Group keep in mind when considering how taxes affect taonga assets like land.

Alongside this process, the Group has developed and further refined its conclusions outlined in the Interim Report. The engagement process has reached out to various parts of society, including Māori, civil society, tax professionals, business and environmental organisations. There has also been discussion with tax professionals in Australia to learn from their experience. This engagement reflects and is reflected in the work the Group has undertaken since early September. As might be expected, the submissions on the Interim Report contained a wide variety of opinions. They ranged from full endorsement of the recommendations in the Interim Report, often wishing to see at least some of them go further, through to substantial rejection of the majority of the recommendations. Those wanting to go further were bunched into two clusters. The first primarily wished the Group to consider matters outside its Terms of Reference, such as the tax:welfare interface and higher tax rates (particularly for those on higher incomes). In this cluster there were also some who wished to revisit areas that the Group had already carefully considered, with a clear majority recommending no change (such as for a financial transactions tax). The second cluster was largely composed of groups or individuals wishing to strengthen or extend some part of the recommendations. These were most often concerned with environmental issues or the Interim Report’s conclusions on behavioural taxes (which some wished to be renamed health promotion taxes). The Group has carefully considered these submissions but has not accepted them all. In particular, we have adhered to our Terms of Reference, though we have made some incidental comments where we deemed it appropriate. We have also reaffirmed the views expressed in the Interim Report concerning the purposes of tax. This report does not repeat those sections in full. Similarly, it does not repeat a number of other sections from the Interim Report where we have made no changes. In other words, the Group’s consideration of particular propositions continues to reflect the fundamental proposition that there are three main ways in which the tax system supports the wellbeing of New Zealanders: as a fair and efficient source of revenue; as a means of redistribution; and as a policy instrument to influence behaviours. There was broad but not universal support for this position from submitters. As far as the Interim Report’s specific recommendations are concerned, those rejecting them did so primarily in relation to the chapter and the appendix dealing with the extension of capital gains taxation. Where possible, the Group has taken account of those submissions, especially in relation to the vexed question of compliance costs. Since the Interim Report the Group’s internal discussions have focused primarily on the extension of capital taxation. Given what capital income is taxed already, that has meant consideration of the taxation of capital gains. Despite differences of opinion on how far such taxation should go, the Group agreed that whatever is done should be part of the general income tax system and not a separate capital gains tax regime. The reasons for this are explained in this report. 6 Future of Tax Recommendations As I have indicated above, the Group was not of one mind on whether the proposed regime should proceed. A clear majority (eight to three) supported that position. But I should note and thank the three in the minority (Joanne Hodge, Kirk Hope and Robin Oliver) who played a full part in the lengthy development of the technical details. Their contributions were invaluable. It needs to be emphasised that this difference of judgement relates to the rather simplistic binary decision of being for or against the package of capital gains taxation as a whole. In reality, that is not the only question for the Government (or Parliament) to consider. As this report emphasises, it is possible to introduce the package in whole or in part, whether all at once or in stages. The balance between revenue and equity on the one hand and complexity and compliance costs on the other differs between asset classes. The most complex asset class is arguably the active business one – as Volume II of this report demonstrates. This report is about much more than capital gains taxation. I would draw attention, in particular, to the work done on encapsulating the Wellbeing Framework within a Māori world view (Te Ao Māori). This then flows into the substantive section on environmental taxation that goes beyond the near- term challenges to a longer-term tax framework to underpin a circular economy. It should be noted that no attempt has been made to incorporate possible revenue from environmental taxation in the development of revenue- or fiscally- neutral packages. Suffice to say that environmental tax revenue could be recycled in a number of ways, especially to fund and support a faster transition to a circular economy, as well as offsetting the impact of such taxes on modest-income households. Finally, let me thank all the members of the Group for their thoughtful participation and especially their forbearance of my occasional impatience. Our officials have been dedicated and assiduous in carrying out their tasks. It is difficult to single out anybody but Bevan Lye’s work as the principal scribe on the Interim and Final Reports has been masterful. Last but far from least, our independent advisor, Andrea Black, has laboured mightily to ensure a diversity of views has come before us. Hon Michael Cullen, KNZM Chair, Tax Working Group February 2019 Tax Working Group members: Marjan van den Belt Professor Craig Elliffe Joanne Hodge Kirk Hope Nick Malarao Geof Nightingale Robin Oliver, MNZM Hinerangi Raumati, MNZM Michelle Redington Bill Rosenberg Independent Advisor: Andrea Black 7 Future of Tax Recommendations Executive summary A national conversation on the future of tax 1.Over the past year, the Tax Working Group has engaged in a national conversation with New Zealanders about the future of the tax system. Thousands of New Zealanders – including iwi, businesses, unions and other organisations – have had their say. It is clear to the Group that tax matters to everyone. 2.There is good reason for this passion. The tax system underpins the living standards of New Zealanders in three important respects: as a source of revenue for public services, as a means of redistribution, and as a policy instrument in its own right. The Group has been alert to these multiple purposes in the course of its work. 3.The Group also considers it is important to bring a broad conception of wellbeing and living standards to its work, including a consideration of Te Ao Māori perspectives on the tax system. This approach reflects the composition of the Group, which includes members with a diverse range of skills and experience, including from beyond the tax system. 4.As part of this work, the Group has begun to develop a policy framework that would bring together concepts from Te Ao Māori, the four capitals of the Living Standards Framework, and principles of tax policy design. 5.This framework – He Ara Waiora – draws upon the concepts of waiora (wellbeing), manaakitanga (care and respect), kaitiakitanga (stewardship/ guardianship), whanaungatanga (relationships and connectedness) and ōhanga (prosperity). 6.The Group’s work on He Ara Waiora appears to have resonated with many people. In light of this feedback, discussions have been initiated with the Treasury about how He Ara Waiora could inform the ongoing evolution of the Living Standards Framework. The structure, fairness and balance of the tax system 7.One of the key tasks for the Group has been to assess the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. Although the tax system has many strengths, the Group has found that the tax system relies on a relatively narrow range of taxes and is not particularly progressive. There are a number of reasons for these outcomes but two issues it can address within its Terms of Reference stand out for the Group: •The treatment of capital gains. Unlike most other developed countries, New Zealand does not generally tax income in the form of capital gains (except in some specified instances). The inconsistent treatment of capital gains reduces the fairness of the tax system. It is also regressive, because it benefits the wealthiest members of our society. Both effects weigh against the sense that New Zealanders are all making a fair contribution, and risk undermining the social capital that sustains public acceptance of the tax system and so our shared prosperity in the long term. 8 Future of Tax Recommendations •The treatment of natural capital. New Zealand makes relatively little use of environmental taxation. There are clear opportunities to increase environmental taxation, both to broaden the revenue base and to help address the significant environmental challenges we face as a nation. Final conclusions The taxation of capital gains 8.All the members of the Group agree that there should be an extension of the taxation of capital gains from residential rental investment properties. Eight members of the Group support the introduction of a broad approach to the taxation of capital gains. This would involve a realisation-based tax that is applied to capital gains on a broad range of assets, at full rates, with no allowance for inflation. 9.In reaching this judgement the majority of the Group accepts that extending the taxation of capital gains would involve an increase in compliance and efficiency costs but judges that these costs would be outweighed by reductions in investment biases, as well as improvements to the fairness, integrity and fiscal sustainability of the tax system. Moreover, some of these costs could be offset by other measures within a package of tax reform. 10.Three members of the Group have reached a different judgement. 1 These members prefer the incremental approach of extending the tax base carefully over time, which they consider has served New Zealand well over many years of tax reform. In their judgement, the revenue benefits, perceptions of fairness and possible integrity benefits, would be outweighed by adverse efficiency impacts, increased compliance and administration costs and fiscal risk. 1 These members are Joanne Hodge, Kirk Hope and Robin Oliver. A note summarising their view is available at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/twg-bg-4050912-extending-the-taxation-of-capital-gains-minority-view Choices and options 11.The Government does not face a binary choice regarding whether or not to extend capital gains taxation. There is a spectrum of choices for the coverage of assets and the inclusion of each asset class will come with its own costs and benefits. 12.At one end of the spectrum, there is a clear case to include residential rental investment properties. At the other end of the spectrum, there will be greater complexity regarding the treatment of corporate groups, unlisted shares and business goodwill. 13.For this reason, the Government could choose to extend the taxation of capital gains to some asset classes only. The Government also has options about how to stage the timing of introduction, whether to phase in asset classes, whether to grandparent some or all asset classes and whether to apply the deemed return method. The importance of effective implementation 14.Regardless of their position on the merits of extending the taxation of capital gains, all members agree that the introduction of a system for taxing capital gains would be a significant endeavour requiring the full attention of the Government. 15.If the Government decides to proceed, it is crucial that Inland Revenue is fully resourced and has the capability to develop and implement the new tax. The policy and legislative processes must also include thorough consultation with a diverse range of voices, using both formal and informal channels. 16.The Group also notes that the Government’s stated timeframes for implementing tax reform will be challenging. The Government will need to ensure additional resources are available for implementation if these timeframes are to be achieved. 9 Future of Tax Recommendations 17.If the Government decides not to extend the taxation of capital gains to all asset classes, Inland Revenue will need to enforce fully the existing capital/revenue boundary. This includes taking test cases, as well as policy and investigative attention to existing areas of concern. Environmental and ecological outcomes 18.The Group considers there is significant scope for the tax system to play a greater role in sustaining and enhancing New Zealand’s natural capital. New Zealand faces significant environmental challenges that require profound change to existing patterns of economic activity. Taxation is one tool – alongside regulation and spending measures – that can support and guide this transition. 19.The task for policymakers is to think in terms of systems change and to develop a set of goals and principles that can guide a transition, over many decades, to a more sustainable economy. 20.In the short term, the Group recommends better use of environmental taxes to price negative environmental externalities. Environmental taxes can be a powerful tool for ensuring people and companies better understand and account for the impact of their actions on the ecosystems on which they depend. The immediate priorities should be to expand the coverage and rate of the Waste Disposal Levy, strengthen the Emissions Trading Scheme and advance the use of congestion charging. 21.In the medium term, environmental tax revenue should be used to help fund a transition to a more sustainable economy. 22.In the longer term, environmental taxes could become a much more significant part of the tax base through the development and adoption of innovative new tools to measure and value environmental impacts. 2 See Chapter 4 Environmental and ecological outcomes for a more complete description of the framework. 23.As an initial step, the Group has developed a framework for deciding when to apply taxes to address negative environmental externalities. A framework for taxing negative environmental externalities 2 Taxation can be used as a tool to enhance natural capital when unpriced externalities lead to the over-exploitation of resource stocks and degrade the integrity of ecosystems. The benefits of using taxation as an instrument may be greater when there is high behavioural responsiveness, a diversity of responses available and significant revenue-raising potential. The suitability of taxation as a policy instrument (relative to other potential instruments) can be assessed through the following criteria: measurability, risk tolerance and scale. The principles of tax policy design described in Chapter 2 of this report can also apply to environmental taxes. Building off these, there are seven design principles that warrant particular attention: Māori rights and interests must be acknowledged and addressed; distributional impacts must be assessed and mitigated; the suite of responses should reflect the full cost of externalities; the price should vary locally where there is local variation in impacts; international linkages should be considered; the tax should be integrated with other policy; and intertemporal fairness should be considered. 24.The Group has also found that New Zealand has limited institutional capability to design and implement environmental taxes. The Group recommends that the Government strengthen its environmental tax capability. This includes support for the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, which should be resourced to provide independent advice on environmental tax policy. 10 Future of Tax Recommendations The taxation of business and savings Business and productivity 25. The current approach to the taxation of business is largely sound. The Group does not see a case to reduce the company rate at the present time or to move away from the imputation system. However, the Government should continue to monitor developments in company tax rates around the world, particularly in Australia. The tax rate for Māori authorities also remains appropriate (although the rate should be extended to the subsidiaries of Māori authorities). The Group recommends against introducing a progressive company tax. 26. The Group has investigated and recommended a number of tax measures that could enhance productivity. These include changes to the loss- continuity rules, expanding deductions for ‘black-hole’ expenditure and concessions for nationally significant infrastructure projects. Some or all of these measures could form part of a package of tax reform. 27. The Group also assessed the merits of restoring building depreciation deductions. Subject to fiscal constraints, the Government could consider restoring depreciation deductions if capital gains taxation is extended. 28. The main focus of many submissions, however, was on the treatment of multinationals and digital firms. In this regard, the Group notes that New Zealand is currently participating in discussions at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on the future of the international tax framework. The Group supports this process but recommends that the Government stand ready to implement an equalisation tax on digital services if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction. 3 The Group’s Terms of Reference rule out increases to any rate of personal income tax. However, it would be possible to increase the second marginal tax rate (paired with increases in the bottom tax threshold) such that average tax rates do not increase for higher income earners. Retirement savings 29. New Zealand currently offers few tax incentives for retirement savings. The Group does not see a case to reform radically the taxation of retirement savings. However, the Group does support an increase in the tax benefits for low- and middle-income earners provided through KiwiSaver to encourage people to put more away for their retirement. There is also a case to exempt the New Zealand Superannuation Fund from New Zealand tax obligations. 30. The Group notes that, as lifespans have increased, people are now spending a much greater proportion of their lives in retirement. Although the Group has decided it is not necessary to adjust the tax system for inflation, we have identified a need for further work on options to maintain the purchasing power of people’s savings through their retirement. Personal income taxation 31. Any changes to personal income taxation will need to reflect the objectives of the Government. • If the Government wishes to improve incomes for very low-income households, the best means of doing so will be through welfare transfers. • If the Government wishes to improve incomes for certain groups of low- to middle-income earners, such as full-time workers on the minimum wage, then changes to personal income taxation may be a better option. 32. The Group has discussed a range of options to increase the progressivity of the personal tax system. The Group’s preferred approach is to increase the bottom tax threshold. This could potentially be combined with an increase in the second marginal tax rate. 3 11 Future of Tax Recommendations 33. Alongside these tax changes, the Government should consider increasing net benefit payments to ensure beneficiaries receive the same post- tax increase as other people on the same income. This would provide a fairer redistribution of revenue across individuals and have a greater impact on poverty reduction. 34. Overall, the personal tax changes discussed in this report are likely to have a minor impact on income inequality. A material reduction in income inequality through the personal tax system would require broader income tax changes, including an increase in the top marginal rate. Such a change is beyond the scope of the Group’s Terms of Reference. Potential packages for tax reform 35. A broad extension of the taxation of capital gains (as set out in Volume II) is projected to raise approximately $8.3 billion over five years. The revenue is expected to increase over time, rising to a long-run average of 1.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) per annum, but it will also be volatile. In light of these revenue projections, Ministers have directed the Group to develop revenue-neutral packages of tax reform for the Government’s consideration. 36. The Group has developed four illustrative packages: • A package that increases progressivity through reductions in personal income tax. • A package with a greater focus on measures to support businesses and housing affordability. • A package with a greater focus on supporting savers, particularly those on lower incomes. • A package with a more diversified focus, where business tax measures are deferred to enable greater savings measures. 37. While each package focuses on different themes, they all involve substantial reductions in personal income tax that deliver the greatest proportional benefits to lower income earners. Depending on its objectives, the Government could combine these or other measures into alternative packages for tax reform. 38. The best use of revenue from extending the taxation of capital gains will ultimately depend on the Government’s priorities. Tax reform is only one choice. The Government also has a wider set of options to consider beyond the tax system. 39. The Group recommends that the Government assess the options for tax reform against other needs and priorities to determine what would best enhance the wellbeing of New Zealanders. Other opportunities to improve the tax system 40. The Interim Report contained recommendations on many other aspects of the tax system. Time constraints have precluded further in- depth investigation of these issues but the recommendations remain an essential part of the Group’s prescription for reform. Matters requiring significant attention by the Government The future of work 41. The Group is concerned that the effectiveness of the pay as you earn (PAYE) withholding system will reduce if labour market changes increase the proportion of self-employed workers in the future. The Group therefore supports Inland Revenue’s efforts to increase the compliance of the self- employed. 42. The Group also supports expanding the use of withholding taxes to increase compliance and recommends that withholding be extended as far as practicable (including to platform service providers, such as ride-sharing companies) so long as this does not impose unreasonable compliance costs. 12 Future of Tax Recommendations The integrity of the tax system 43. The integrity of the tax system requires constant vigilance. Tax avoidance erodes social capital. It is also fundamentally unfair, because it means that compliant taxpayers must pay more to make up for the lost revenue. 44. At the moment, there appears to be a set of integrity risks associated with the use of closely held companies. Some of the underlying problems derive from the fact that the company and top personal tax rates are not aligned but there is a clear need for Inland Revenue to strengthen enforcement of the rules for closely held companies. Extending the taxation of capital gains could also reduce integrity risks by reducing opportunities for tax planning and tax avoidance. 45. The Group also recommends further developing measures to reduce the extent of undeclared and cash-in-hand transactions (sometimes known as the ‘hidden economy’). These measures could include increasing the reporting of labour income and even the removal of tax deductibility if a taxpayer has not followed labour income withholding or reporting rules. 46. Tax collection could be enhanced by increasing the remedies available to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to address non-compliance. The Group recommends the use of departure prohibition orders and introducing a regime similar to Australia’s Director Penalty Notice for serious cases, where the directors are the economic owners of the business and there has been persistent or intentional non-compliance. 47. The Group also recommends establishing a single Crown debt collection agency, to achieve economies of scale and more equitable outcomes across all Crown debtors. The administration of the tax system 48. The Group considers there is a need for greater public access to data and information about the tax system. Inland Revenue should review whether the information and data it currently collects offers the most useful insights or whether other datasets would better respond to the needs and interests of the public and future policy development. It is particularly important to have better data about the distribution of wealth in New Zealand. 49. The Group also considers there is a need to improve the resolution of tax disputes. The Group recommends establishing a taxpayer advocacy service to assist taxpayers in disputes with Inland Revenue and also wishes to ensure the Office of the Ombudsman is adequately resourced to carry out its functions in relation to tax. Tax technical capability 50. Inland Revenue must maintain deep technical expertise, alongside strategic policy capability. The Group strongly recommends that Inland Revenue continue to invest in the technical and investigatory skills of its staff. The Group also expects to see the Treasury playing a stronger role in the development of tax policy than it has in recent years. Matters requiring further work Charities 51. The Group received many submissions regarding the treatment of business income for charities and whether the tax exemption for charitable business income confers an unfair advantage on the trading operations of charities. 52. The Group considers that the underlying issue is more about the extent to which charities are distributing or applying the surpluses from their activities for the benefit of their charitable purposes. 13 Future of Tax Recommendations 53. The core question is whether the broader policy settings for charities encourage appropriate levels of distribution. In light of this, the Group recommends that the Government periodically review the charitable sector’s use of what would otherwise be tax revenue, to verify that the intended social outcomes are actually being achieved. 54. Another area of concern relates to the treatment of private charitable foundations and trusts. The rules about these entities appear to be unusually loose. The Government should consider whether to apply a distinction between privately controlled foundations and other charitable organisations, with a view to removing concessions for privately controlled foundations or trusts that do not have arm’s length governance or distribution policies. 55. The Group notes that the Government has launched a review of the Charities Act 2005. The Group has provided its analysis to Inland Revenue and the Department of Internal Affairs for further consideration as part of the Charities Review and the Tax Policy Work Programme. Goods and services tax (GST) 56. GST is an important source of revenue for the Government. Yet the Group has received many submissions calling for a reduction in the GST rate – or for the introduction of new GST exceptions – to reduce the impact of GST on lower-income households. 57. The Group acknowledges public concern about the regressive nature of GST but has decided not to recommend a reduction in the GST rate or the introduction of new GST exceptions. This is because other measures, such as increases in transfers or changes to the personal tax system, will increase progressivity more effectively than reductions to GST. 58. One problematic aspect of GST relates to the treatment of financial services, which are not subject to GST for reasons of administrative complexity. The Group has considered a number of options for taxing the consumption of financial services but has not been able to identify a means of doing so that is both feasible and efficient. However, the Government should monitor international developments in this area. 59. The Group does not recommend introducing a financial transactions tax at this point. Corrective taxes 60. A corrective tax is a tax that is intended to influence behaviour and lead to better health and wellbeing outcomes for New Zealanders. Outside of the environmental sphere, New Zealand currently levies corrective taxes on alcohol and tobacco. 61. Some submitters have suggested the development of a framework for deciding when to apply corrective taxes (similar to the framework developed by the Group for the use of environmental taxes). The Group supports this suggestion. 62. Detailed recommendations on the rates of alcohol and tobacco excise are beyond the expertise of the Group. However, the Group does recommend that the Government simplify the schedule of alcohol excise rates and is concerned about the distributional impact of further increases in tobacco excise beyond the increases that have already been scheduled. 63. The Group acknowledges widespread public interest in adopting a sugar tax. The case for a sugar tax must rest on a clear view of the Government’s objectives. If the Government wishes to reduce the consumption of sugar across the board, a sugar tax is likely to be an effective response. If the Government wishes to reduce the sugar content of particular products, regulation is likely to be more effective. In either case, there is a need to consider the use of taxation, alongside other potential policy responses. 14 Future of Tax Recommendations Final words 64. Everyone has an opinion on tax. It is a subject that arouses strong passions and even deep disagreements – but it is also a way in which we come together as a society (‘nāu te rourou, nāku te rourou’) to contribute to our nation’s broader prosperity (‘ka ora ai te iwi’). Tax should matter to everyone. 65. Over the past year, thousands of New Zealanders have shared their thoughts on the future of the tax system. The Group deeply appreciates the generosity of all submitters who took the time to set out their views to us. The submissions have informed and also challenged us. Our recommendations are better for having received them. 66. The process of tax reform will now move into a different phase, as the Government picks up and considers our recommendations. In this new phase, it is vital that public input continues to influence the direction of tax reform. 67. To this end, the Group encourages all New Zealanders to stay involved as the programme of tax reform is developed. Together, we can – and should – shape the future of tax. 15 Future of Tax Recommendations Summary of recommendations This chapter summarises the Group’s final recommendations. Capital and wealth 1. The majority of the Group recommends a broad extension of the taxation of capital gains. 4 2. If a broad extension of capital gains taxation were to occur, the Group recommends that it have the characteristics detailed in Volume II of this report. These characteristics are summarised below. What to tax The Group: a) recommends including gains and most losses from all types of land and improvements (except the family home), shares, intangible property and business assets. b) recommends not including personal- use assets (such as cars, boats or other household durables). c) considers that some types of transactions relating to collectively owned Māori assets merit specific treatment in light of their distinct context. d) recommends that the Government engages further with Māori to determine the most appropriate treatment of transactions relating to collectively owned Māori assets. e) recommends that the existing rules continue to apply to foreign shares that are currently taxed under the fair dividend rate method of taxation, as well as anything taxed under the financial arrangement rules. 4 Three members of the group (Hodge, Hope and Oliver) do not support a broad extension. f) recommends only taxing gains and losses that arise after the implementation date (Valuation Day). When to tax The Group: g) recommends the tax be imposed on a realisation basis in most cases. h) recommends rollover treatment for certain life events (such as death and relationship separations), business reorganisations and small business reinvestment. How to tax The Group: i) recommends that capital gains be taxed within the current income tax system and taxed at a person’s marginal rates. j) recommends no discount for capital gains and no adjustment for inflation. k) recommends that capital losses be ring-fenced for: portfolio investments in listed shares (other than when they are trading stock); associated party transactions; and losses from Valuation Day assets. l) recommends that capital losses on privately used land be denied entirely. m) recommends that capital losses (other than those described in recommendations (k) and (l) above) be treated in the same way as other tax losses and taxpayers should generally be able to offset losses arising from the disposal of capital assets against ordinary taxable income. 16 Future of Tax Recommendations Transitional rules The Group: n) recommends that taxpayers have five years from Valuation Day (or to the time of sale if that is earlier) to determine a value for their included assets as at Valuation Day. o) recommends that if no valuation is determined, then a default rule apply. (See Volume II for default valuation methods.) p) encourages the Government and Inland Revenue to develop tools and guidance to further assist taxpayers through the Valuation Day process. Development and implementation The Group: q) recommends that Inland Revenue be fully resourced and has the capability to develop and implement the new tax. r) encourages Inland Revenue to develop low- cost options for valuations required outside of Valuation Day that are sufficiently robust to maintain the integrity of the system. s) recommends that the policy and legislative processes include thorough consultation with a diverse range of voices, using both formal and informal channels. t) recommends that the policy and legislative process includes coverage of the following issues: i) Identifying further options for reducing the compliance costs. ii) Ensuring that the final rules do not create a bias in favour of investment in foreign shares. iii) Assessing whether there is a need for information reporting or withholding requirements for capital gains – and, if so, how widely to impose them. 3. The Group does not recommend introducing a wealth tax. 4. The Group does not recommend introducing a land tax. Environmental and ecological outcomes 5. The Group recommends the Government adopts the framework in Chapter 4 of this report for taxing negative environmental externalities. Greenhouse gases The Group: 6. supports a reformed Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) remaining the centrepiece of New Zealand’s emissions reduction efforts but recommends it be made more ‘tax-like’ – specifically, by providing greater guidance on price and auctioning emissions units to raise revenue (as recommended by the Productivity Commission). 7. recommends periodic review of the ETS to ensure it is fit for purpose and is the best mechanism for pricing greenhouse gas emissions. 8. recommends that all emissions face a price, including from agriculture, either through the ETS or a complementary system. Water abstraction and water pollution The Group: 9. recommends greater use of tax instruments to address water pollution and water abstraction challenges if Māori rights and interests can be addressed. 10. recommends further development of tools and capabilities to estimate diffuse water pollution to enable more accurate and effective water pollution tax instruments. 11. recommends introducing input-based tax instruments, including on fertiliser, if significant progress is not made in the near term on implementing output-based pricing measures or other regulatory measures. Solid waste The Group: 12. supports the Ministry for the Environment’s review of the rate and coverage of the Waste Disposal Levy. 17 Future of Tax Recommendations 13. supports expanding the coverage of the Waste Disposal Levy. 14. recommends a reassessment of the negative externalities associated with landfill disposal in New Zealand to ascertain if a higher levy rate is appropriate. 15. recommends a review of hypothecation arrangements of the Waste Disposal Levy to ensure funds are being used in the most effective way to move towards a more circular economy. Transport 16. The Group supports current reviews by the Government and Auckland Council into introducing congestion pricing. Concessions The Group: 17. recommends costs associated with the care of land subject to a QEII covenant or Ngā Whenua Rāhui be tax deductible. 18. recommends that the Government consider allowing employers to subsidise public transport use by employees without incurring fringe benefit tax. 19. recommends that the Government review various tax provisions specific to farming, forestry and petroleum mining with a view to removing concessions harmful to natural capital, while also considering new concessions that could enhance natural capital. Other matters relating to environmental taxation The Group: 20. recommends some or all of environmental tax revenue should be used to help fund a transition to a more sustainable, circular economy. 21. recommends consideration over the longer term of new tools, like an environmental footprint tax, or a natural capital enhancement tax. 22. recommends the Government strengthen its environment tax capabilities, including with the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment. 23. recommends that the Government commission incidence studies to better understand who will incur the costs of new environmental taxes and to design appropriate mitigation measures. 24. recommends further work to rigorously assess how taxes can complement other environmental policy measures and to work through the design principles identified in the Group’s framework for taxing negative environmental externalities. The taxation of business The Group recommends that the Government: 25. retain the imputation system. 26. not reduce the company tax rate at the present time. However, the Government should continue to monitor developments in company tax rates around the world, particularly in Australia. 27. not introduce a progressive company tax. 28. not introduce an alternative basis of taxation for smaller businesses, such as cashflow or turnover taxes. 29. retain the 17.5% rate for Māori authorities. 30. extend the 17.5% rate to the subsidiaries of Māori authorities. 31. consider technical refinements to the Māori authority rules, as suggested by submitters, in the Tax Policy Work Programme. 32. change the loss-continuity rules to support the growth of innovative start-up firms. 33. reform the treatment of black-hole expenditure, with: a) a new rule to recognise deductions for expenditure incurred by businesses that is not otherwise dealt with under the Income Tax Act 2007, including in respect of abandoned assets and projects. b) a clawback of tax deductions where an abandoned asset or project is subsequently restored, such that those deductions would be capitalised. c) the spreading of black-hole expenditure over five years. 18 Future of Tax Recommendations d) a safe-harbour threshold of $10,000 to allow upfront deductions for low levels of feasibility expenditure. 34. subject to fiscal constraints, consider restoring depreciation deductions for buildings if there is an extension of the taxation of capital gains. To manage the fiscal costs, the Government could reinstate building depreciation on a partial basis for: • seismic strengthening only • multi-unit residential buildings • industrial, commercial and multi-unit residential buildings. 35. consider tax measures that encourage building to higher environmental standards. 36. consider developing a regime that encourages investment into nationally-significant infrastructure projects. 37. examine the following options to reduce compliance costs: For immediate action: a) Increase the threshold for provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000 of residual income tax. b) Increase the closing stock adjustment from $10,000 to $20,000-$30,000. c) Increase the $10,000 automatic deduction for legal fees and potentially expand the automatic deduction to other types of professional fees. d) Reduce the number of depreciation rates and simplify the process for using default rates. Subject to fiscal constraints: e) Simplify the fringe benefit tax and simplify (or even remove) the entertainment adjustment. f) Remove resident withholding tax on close company-related party interest and dividend payments, subject to integrity concerns. g) Remove the requirement for taxpayers to seek the approval of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue GST Buyer Created Tax Invoices. h) Allow special rate certificates and certificates of exemption to be granted retrospectively. i) Increase the period of validity for a certificate of exemption or special rate certificate. j) Remove the requirement to file a change of imputation ratio notice with Inland Revenue. k) Extend the threshold of ‘cash basis person’ in the financial arrangement rules, which would better allow for the current levels of personal debt. l) Increase the threshold for not requiring a GST change-of-use adjustment. The Government should also review and explore the following opportunities: m) Adjust the thresholds for unexpired expenditure and for the write off of low-value assets. n) Help small businesses reduce compliance costs through the use of cloud-based accounting software. o) Consider compensation for withholding agents if additional withholding tax obligations are imposed. p) Review the taxation of non-resident employees. q) Review whether the rules for hybrid mismatches should apply to small businesses or simple business transactions. 38. The Group recommends that the Government give favourable consideration to exempting the New Zealand Superannuation Fund from New Zealand tax obligations. International income taxation The Group: 39. supports New Zealand’s continued participation in discussions at the OECD on the future of the international income tax framework. 19 Future of Tax Recommendations 40. recommends that the Government stand ready to implement a digital services tax if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction and it is reasonably certain New Zealand’s export industries will not be materially impacted by any retaliatory measures. 41. recommends that the Government actively monitor developments and collaborate with other countries with respect to equalisation taxes. 42. recommends that the Government ensure, to the extent possible, that New Zealand’s double tax agreements and trade agreements do not restrict New Zealand’s taxation options in these matters. Retirement savings The Group: 43. recommends that the Government, depending on its priorities, consider encouraging the savings of low-income earners by carrying out one or more of the following: a) Refunding the employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) for KiwiSaver members earning up to $48,000 per annum. This refund would be clawed back for KiwiSaver members earning more than $48,000 per annum, such that members earning over $70,000 would receive no benefit. b) Ensuring that a KiwiSaver member on parental leave would receive the maximum member tax credit regardless of their level of contributions. c) Increasing the member tax credit from $0.50 per $1 of contribution to $0.75 per $1 of contribution. The contribution cap should remain unchanged. d) Reducing the lower portfolio investment entity (PIE) rates for KiwiSaver funds (10.5% and 17.5%) by five percentage points each. 44. recommends that the Government consider ways to simplify the determination of the PIE rates (which would apply to KiwiSaver). Personal income tax 45. The Group’s recommendations on personal income tax are dependent on the objectives of the Government. a) If the Government wishes to improve incomes for very low-income households, the Group considers the best means of doing so will be through welfare transfers. b) If the Government wishes to improve incomes for certain groups of low- to middle-income earners, such as full-time workers on the minimum wage, the Group considers changes to personal income taxation may be a better option. The Group: 46. recommends that the Government consider increases in the bottom threshold of personal tax to increase the progressivity of the personal tax system. 47. recommends that the Government consider combining increases in the bottom threshold with an increase in the second marginal tax rate. 48. suggests that if this higher tax rate is adopted, the Government consider a reduction of the abatement rate of Working for Families tax credits to offset the impact of the increase. 49. prefers increasing the bottom threshold to introducing a tax-free threshold. 50. recommends that the Government consider an increase in net benefit payments to ensure beneficiaries receive the same post-tax increase as other people on the same income. 51. recommends that the Government consider changes to tax rates and thresholds alongside any recommendations made by the Welfare Expert Advisory Group. 52. recommends that the Government not reduce the top marginal tax rate on vertical equity grounds because it is already low by international standards and it would not increase progressivity of the tax system. 20 Future of Tax Recommendations 53. notes that many submissions called for increasing top personal tax rates in order to enable policies that would make a material reduction in income inequality through the personal tax system. As such increases are precluded by the Group’s Terms of Reference the Group did not undertake an analysis of the options (and their effectiveness). Future of work The Group recommends that the Government: 54. support Inland Revenue’s efforts to increase the compliance of the self-employed, particularly expanding the use of withholding tax as far as practicable, including to platform providers, such as ride-sharing companies. 55. support the facilitation of technology platforms to assist the self-employed meet their tax obligations through the use of ‘smart accounts’ or other technology-based solutions. 56. continue (through Inland Revenue’s current work) to use data analytics and matching information for specific taxpayers to identify under-reporting of income. 57. review the current GST requirements for contractors who are akin to employees. 58. align the definitions of employee and dependent contractors for tax and employment purposes. 59. provide more support for childcare costs, though the Group considers this support is best provided outside of the tax system. Integrity of the tax system The Group recommends: 60. a review of loss trading, potentially in tandem with a review of the loss-continuity rules for companies. 61. that, for closely held companies, Inland Revenue have the ability to require a shareholder to provide security to Inland Revenue if: a) the company owes a debt to Inland Revenue. b) the company is owed a debt by the shareholder. c) there is doubt as to the ability/and or the intention of the shareholder to repay the debt. 62. further action in relation to the hidden economy, including: a) an increase in the reporting of labour income (subject to not unreasonably increasing compliance costs on business). b) a review of the measures recently adopted by Australia in relation to the hidden economy, with a view to applying them in New Zealand. c) the removal of tax deductibility if a taxpayer has not followed labour income withholding or reporting rules. 63. that Inland Revenue continue to invest in the technical and investigatory skills of its staff. 64. further measures to improve collection and encourage compliance, including: a) making directors who have an economic ownership in the company personally liable for arrears on GST and PAYE obligations where there has been deliberate or persistent non-compliance (as long as there is an appropriate warning system). b) departure prohibition orders. c) aligning of the standard of proof for PAYE and GST offences. 65. the establishment of a single centralised Crown debt collection agency to achieve economies of scale and more equitable outcomes across all Crown debtors. 66. that Inland Revenue strengthen enforcement of rules for closely held companies. 67. that the Government explore options to enable the flexibility of a wider gap between the company and top personal tax rates without a reduction in the integrity of the tax system. Administration of the tax system The Group: 68. recommends that the Government: a) fund oversampling of the wealthy in existing wealth surveys. 21 Future of Tax Recommendations b) include a question on wealth in the census. c) request Inland Revenue to regularly repeat its analysis of the tax paid by high wealth individuals. d) commission research on using a variety of data sources on capital income, including administrative data, to estimate the wealth of individuals. 69. strongly encourages the Government to release more statistical and aggregated information about the tax system (so long as it does not reveal data about specific individuals or corporates that is not otherwise publicly available).The Government could consider further measures to increase transparency as public attitudes change over time. 70. encourages Inland Revenue to publish or make available a broader range of statistics, in consultation with potential users, either directly or (preferably) through Stats NZ. 71. encourages Inland Revenue to collect information on income and expenditure associated with environmental outcomes that are part of the tax calculation. 72. recommends that any further expansion of the resources available to the Ombudsman include consideration of provision for additional tax expertise and possibly support to manage any increase in the volume of complaints relating to the new Crown debt collection agency proposed by the Group. 73. recommends establishing a taxpayer advocacy service to assist with the resolution of tax disputes. 74. recommends that the Government consider a truncated tax disputes process for small taxpayers. 75. recommends the use of the following principles in public engagement on tax policy: a) Good faith engagement by all participants. b) Engagement with a wider range of stakeholders, particularly including greater engagement with Māori (guided by the Government’s emerging engagement model for Crown/Māori Relations). c) Earlier and more frequent engagement. d) The use of a greater variety of engagement methods. e) Greater transparency and accountability on the part of the Government. 76. notes the need for the Treasury to play a strong role in tax policy development, and the importance of Inland Revenue maintaining deep technical expertise and strategic policy capability. 77. encourages the continuing use of purpose clauses where appropriate and recommends including an overriding purpose clause in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specify Parliament’s purpose in levying taxation. Charities The Group: 78. recommends that the Government periodically review the charitable sector’s use of what would otherwise be tax revenue, to verify that intended social outcomes are being achieved. 79. supports the Government’s inclusion of a review of the tax treatment of the charitable sector on its Tax Policy Work Programme, as announced in May 2018. 80. notes that the income tax exemption for charitable entities’ trading operations was perceived by some submitters to provide an unfair advantage over commercial entities’ trading operations. 81. notes, however, that the underlying issue is the extent to which charitable entities are accumulating surpluses rather than distributing or applying those surpluses for the benefit of their charitable activities. 82. recommends that the Government consider whether to apply a distinction between privately controlled foundations and other charitable organisations. 83. recommends that the Government consider whether to amend the deregistration tax rules to more effectively keep assets in the sector or to ensure there is no deferral benefit through the application of these rules. 22 Future of Tax Recommendations 84. recommends that the Government review whether it is appropriate to treat some not-for-profit organisations as if they were final consumers or, alternatively, to limit GST concessions to a smaller group of non-profit bodies, such as registered charities. 85. recommends that the Government consider whether the issues identified by the Group in relation to charities have been fully addressed or whether further action is required, following the conclusion of the review of the Charities Act 2005. GST and financial transaction taxes The Group: 86. recognises the significant public concern regarding GST but does not recommend a reduction in the rate of GST. This is because lowering the GST rate would not be as effective at targeting low- and middle-income families as either: a) welfare transfers (for low-income households), or b) personal income tax changes (for low- and middle-income earners). 87. does not recommend removing GST from certain products, such as food and drink, on the basis that the GST exceptions are complex, poorly targeted for achieving distributional goals and generate large compliance costs. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the benefits of specific GST exceptions are passed on to consumers. 88. considers there is a strong in-principle case to apply GST to financial services but there are significant impediments to a workable system. The Government should monitor international developments in this area. 89. does not recommend applying GST to explicit fees charged for financial services. 90. recognises that there is active international debate on financial transaction taxes, which should be monitored but does not recommend the introduction of a financial transactions tax at this point. 5 Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration and Remedial Matters) Bill. 91. has already reported to Ministers on the issue of GST on low-value imported goods and the Government recently introduced a Bill in December 2018 advancing proposals to address the issue. 5 Corrective taxes The Group: 92. supports the development of a framework for deciding when to apply corrective taxes (similar to the framework developed by the Group for the use of environmental taxes). 93. recommends that the Government review the rate structure of alcohol excise with the intention of rationalising and simplifying it. 94. recommends that the Government prioritise other measures to help people stop smoking before considering further large increases in the tobacco excise rate beyond the increases currently scheduled. 95. recommends that the Government develop a clearer articulation of its goals regarding sugar consumption and gambling activity. Housing The Group: 96. recommends that the Productivity Commission inquiry into local government financing considers a tax on vacant residential land. 97. considers that residential vacant land taxes would be best levied as local taxes rather than a national tax. 98. recommends that the ‘ten-year rule’ which taxes a gain from the sale of property where the property has increased in value due to changes in land use regulation be repealed. 99. recommends that disclosure of the purchaser’s IRD number on the Land Transfer Tax Statement should be required when purchasing a main home. 23 Future of Tax Recommendations 1. Over the past year, the Tax Working Group has engaged in a national conversation with New Zealanders about the future of the tax system. Thousands of New Zealanders – including iwi, businesses, unions and other organisations – have shared their thoughts and had their say on the future of tax. 2. The views and suggestions have differed from submission to submission. Yet the Group has been struck by the depth of interest and passion expressed by all submitters on the issues before us. It is clear that tax matters to everyone. 3. There is good reason for the passion we have seen. If the ultimate purpose of public policy is to improve wellbeing, then few areas of public policy contribute as much to the wellbeing of New Zealanders as the tax system. 4. There are three main ways in which the tax system supports the wellbeing of New Zealanders: • A fair and efficient source of revenue. Taxes provide revenue for the Government to fund the public goods and services that underpin our living standards. The tax system thus represents a way in which citizens come together to channel resources for the collective good of society. • A means of redistribution. Taxes fund the redistribution that allows all New Zealanders, regardless of their market income, to participate fully in society. While much of this redistribution occurs through the transfer system, the progressive nature of income tax means that the tax system also plays a role in reducing inequality. • A policy instrument to influence behaviours. Taxes can also be used as an instrument to achieve specific policy goals by influencing behaviour. Taxes influence behaviour by changing the price of goods, services or activities; taxes can discourage certain activities and favour others. In this way, taxes can complement – or even replace – traditional policy tools, such as regulation and spending. This may be particularly important in the health and environmental spheres. 5. In light of these perspectives, the Group has decided to take a rounded view on the purpose of the tax system. The tax system is essential as a source of revenue to the Government – but it is also an important tool that can be used positively to pursue distributional goals, shape behaviour, improve living standards and develop sustainably. The Group has been alert to these multiple purposes in developing its recommendations. 1 The purposes of tax 24 Future of Tax Recommendations 25 Future of Tax Recommendations 1. The Group considers it is important to bring a broad conception of wellbeing and living standards to its work on the tax system. This approach reflects the composition of the Group, which includes members with a diverse range of skills and experience, including perspectives from beyond the tax system. 2. Many factors affect living standards and many of these factors have value beyond their contribution to material comfort. Only a subset of those values can be captured in monetary terms but non-monetary factors are key determinants of wellbeing and living standards. As an example, certain types of economic activity may increase material comfort but reduce wellbeing overall, if the by-products of that activity degrade the natural environment. 3. To measure wellbeing comprehensively, income measures must therefore be supplemented with measures of other factors, such as health, connectedness, security, rights and capabilities, and environmental and ecological sustainability. In the Interim Report the Group applied three perspectives for assessing the full range of impacts from tax policy: the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework, Te Ao Māori perspectives, and the established principles of tax policy design. 4. These frameworks complement each other. A combination of these frameworks also led the Group to develop a specific framework for deciding when to use taxation to achieve environmental and ecological outcomes. (This framework is discussed in Chapter 4.) The Living Standards Framework 5. The Living Standards Framework identifies four capital stocks that are crucial to wellbeing: financial and physical capital, human capital, social capital and natural capital. Wellbeing depends on the sustainable development and distribution of the four capitals, which together represent the comprehensive wealth of New Zealand. 6. The Living Standards Framework encourages policymakers to explore how policy change affects the four capitals. It widens the scope of analysis to include a more comprehensive range of factors, distributional perspectives and dynamic considerations. In this way, the Living Standards Framework is consistent in intent with international wellbeing frameworks, such as the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (Ormsby 2018). Te Ao Māori perspectives on wellbeing and living standards 7. The Group has also been working with Māori academics and experts to develop a framework that draws on principles from Te Ao Māori, the Living Standards Framework and the principles of tax policy design, to arrive at a more holistic view of wellbeing. 2 Frameworks for assessing tax policy 26 Future of Tax Recommendations 8. As discussed in the Interim Report, this prototype framework is centred on the concept of waiora. Waiora is commonly used in Te Ao Māori to express wellbeing; it comes from the word for water (wai) as the source of all life. Accordingly, the framework is called He Ara Waiora – A Pathway towards Wellbeing. 9. He Ara Waiora draws on four tikanga principles: manaakitanga (care and respect); kaitiakitanga (stewardship/guardianship); whanaungatanga (the relationships/connections between us); and ōhanga/whairama (prosperity). These principles support the preservation and sustainable development of the four capitals of the Living Standards Framework. 10. During the Group’s engagement with Māori academics and experts, Associate Professor Mānuka Henare proposed that these tikanga sit within an integrated framework that incorporates a clear sense of purpose, as well as guidance for how policy is developed and implemented, and performance and accountability measures. Figure 2.2 illustrates what such an integrated framework might look like. 11. In this framework, the concept of waiora or wellbeing would be encapsulated in kawa. This moral imperative in supporting wellbeing could be grounded in the ‘Āta noho’ principle from the preamble of the Māori text of Te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Treaty of Waitangi) – meaning that the moral imperative for the tax system could be that all New Zealanders live a life they value, with specific recognition of Māori living the lives that Māori value and have reason to value. 6 The 6 The preamble of the Māori text of Te Tiriti states, “kia tohungia ki a ratou o ratou rangatiratanga me to ratou wenua, kia mau tonu hoki te Rongo ki a ratou me te Atanoho hoki”. This is translated in principle as the desire “to preserve to them their full authority as leaders (rangatiratanga) and their country (to ratou wenua) and that lasting peace (Te Rongo) may always be kept with them and continued life as Māori people (Atanoho hoki)”, (Henare, 1988). four tikanga identified in figure 2.1 map across to the principles, ethics and values in figure 2.2, while the ritenga and āhuatanga in figure 2.2 are areas that require further development to enable practical application and understanding of impact. 12. The importance of addressing each level of this framework was reinforced in discussions in a series of hui in October. The Group heard broad support for the intent of the work as a meaningful reflection of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, reflecting our continuing maturation as a nation. While the provenance of tikanga resides with Māori, values that are derived from tikanga have a strong resonance with contemporary New Zealand. However, participants suggested that further work is needed to preserve the integrity of the use of tikanga when applied to policy. There should also be awareness and careful navigation of the range of understandings of tikanga in different contexts and places in the country. 13. There was also a view that a tikanga framework should have a broad ambit, rather than just focus on tax – because its value will come from the extent to which it improves the lives of Māori and all New Zealanders. 14. In light of this feedback, discussions have begun with the Treasury about how He Ara Waiora might inform the evolution of the Living Standards Framework. A discussion paper on the future development of He Ara Waiora will be released to keep the public informed on this progress. 15. The process around He Ara Waiora is only just beginning. The Group looks forward to seeing how this work influences policy over time. 27 Future of Tax Recommendations Figure 2.1: He Ara Waiora – A Pathway towards Wellbeing Figure 2.2: A proposed integrated framework S ource: The Treasury (2018) Āhuatanga Ritenga Tikanga Kawa Kawa is the foundational principlewhich establishes the customs we value as a society and set the imperative for the principles (tikanga) that guide the way we interact with each other in society to help us to acheive our common goals. Tikanga are the principles, ethics, and valuesthat set the guidlines for general behaviour in our daily lives. Tikanga derives from the base word tika (correct, true, fair, accurate). To be tika it must also be pono (valid, honest, genuine, and sincere). Ritenga are behaviours and enactmentswhich, guided by tikanga, set out the practical tools and methods through which we apply tikanga. In policy, robust analytical processes can increase the enhance the way we practice our kawa and tikanga in our day-to-day lives. Āhuatanga are the attributes, traits, and characteristicsachieved through the way society live their kawa, tikanga, and ritenga. 28 Future of Tax Recommendations The established principles of tax policy design 16.Previous tax reviews, in New Zealand and elsewhere, have used a relatively consistent set of principles to assess the design of the tax system. These principles are: •Efficiency – minimising impediments to economic growth and avoiding distortions to the use of resources. •Equity and fairness – achieving fairness, including through enhancements to ‘horizontal equity’ (the principle that people with similar income and assets should pay the same amount in taxes) and ‘vertical equity’ (the principle that those with higher income or assets should pay higher amounts of tax). Procedural fairness is also important for a tax system. •Revenue integrity – minimising opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. •Fiscal adequacy – raising sufficient revenue for the Government’s requirements. •Compliance and administration costs – minimising the costs of compliance and administration and giving taxpayers as much certainty as possible. •Coherence – ensuring that individual tax rules make sense in the context of the entire tax system. 17.Two further important principles in the tax system are predictability and certainty – meaning that taxpayers should be able to understand clearly what their obligations are before those obligations are due. 18.The Group considers these principles remain valid and useful in assessments of the tax system, particularly when considering the costs and benefits of options for reform. These principles complement the system’s perspective offered by a broader living standards analysis. In turn, the other frameworks discussed in this chapter will help policymakers interpret and apply these principles in the future. 29 Future of Tax Recommendations 1.Over the past year, the Group has carefully examined the tax system to form a view about its overall structure, fairness and balance. 2.These are subjective concepts and there are different ways to work towards a judgement on them. The Group has borne the following questions in mind in the course of its work: •Does the tax system treat income consistently, no matter how it is earned and in which sectors it is earned? •Does the tax system minimise opportunities for tax avoidance? •Are the bases of the tax system likely to be sustainable over time? •Should taxation be used as a tool to influence behaviour? 3.The Submissions Background Paper began the process by setting out the main features of the tax system, while the Interim Report provided the Group’s initial views on these features. This chapter presents the Group’s final assessment on the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. Key features of the tax system 4.In the Interim Report, the Group highlighted two distinctive features of the tax system – its reliance on a relatively narrow range of taxes and its relative lack of progressivity (compared to other developed countries). The range of taxation 5.New Zealand’s current tax system is underpinned by a tax policy framework known as ‘broad base, low rate’. In a broad-based system, there should be few exceptions to the base on which the tax is levied. The benefit of a broad-based system is that it allows the Government to raise substantial amounts of revenue at relatively low rates of taxation. 6.The tax system relies on income tax (mainly personal and company) and goods and services tax (GST). The broad base, low rate framework applies to each of these taxes. New Zealand raises about 90% of its tax revenue from these two taxes. Corrective taxes, such as tobacco and alcohol excise, are the third largest source of revenue. 7.Compared to other developed countries, however, New Zealand makes little use of other sources of taxation, such as environmental taxes and social security levies. Thus, while the taxes levied by New Zealand have broad bases, the overall range of taxation is relatively narrow. 8.New Zealand’s treatment of capital gains is also distinctive. Unlike other developed countries, New Zealand does not generally tax capital gains. 9.The most significant gains currently outside the tax net are gains from the sale of land and housing (other than by developers, dealers or speculators), shares (other than portfolio investments in non-resident companies), business goodwill and intellectual property, in cases where those assets have been acquired for a purpose other than sale. 3 The structure, fairness and balance of the tax system 30 Future of Tax Recommendations Figure 3.1: Source of tax revenue across OECD countries (2015) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% France Japan Slovak Republic Czech Republic Poland Netherlands Spain Italy Slovenia Korea Germany Belgium Luxembourg Hungary Austria Greece Switzerland Turkey Estonia United States OECD average Latvia Finland United Kingdom Portugal Mexico Norway Israel Canada Sweden Ireland Iceland Australia Chile New Zealand Denmark % of tax revenue IndividualsCorporatesGST (customs inclusive)Other New Zealand OECD average Source: OECD New Zealand’s approach to the taxation of capital gains New Zealand’s income tax law is founded on a distinction between ‘revenue’ gains and expenditure, which are taxed and deductible and ‘capital’ gains and expenditure, which are not taxed and non-deductible. In principle, gains derived in the ordinary course of carrying on a business – or with the intention of making a gain – are income and are taxable. Other non-systematic gains are generally not taxed. In practice, however, it is often difficult to draw this distinction, because the particular rules require judgements about a person’s intentions, the nature of their business and the role of a particular asset, liability or payment within that business. 10.As the following section elaborates, the current treatment of capital gains reduces the progressivity of the tax system. Distributional outcomes 11.Overall, relative to other OECD countries, the tax system is not particularly progressive. Figure 3.2 illustrates this point by showing tax and transfers as a percentage of taxable income. This figure shows that there is not a significant increase in average effective tax rates across taxable income deciles, even though the amount of tax paid increases by decile. The average rate of income tax paid by households ranges from 23% for lower income households, to 31% for higher-income households. Progressivity is instead largely delivered through transfers, such as Working for Families. 12.It is also important to note that the inequality- reducing power of the tax and transfer system has fallen over the last three decades (Nolan 2018, Perry 2017). This outcome reflects the fact that the tax system and the transfer system have both become less effective at reducing inequality. 31 Future of Tax Recommendations Figure 3.2: Taxes and transfers, by income decile (2012/13) -80% -60% -40% -20% 0% 20% 40% Decile 1 Decile 2 Decile 3 Decile 4 Decile 5 Decile 6 Decile 7 Decile 8 Decile 9 Decile 10 % of taxable income Decile of equivalised taxable household income TaxesTransfersTaxes less transfers Note: Taxable income excludes, by definition, untaxed capital gains.

Source: The Treasury 13.It is difficult to compare distributional outcomes across countries, because the results will be affected by the features of each economy, as well as choices about which taxes are included in the analysis. According to the OECD, however, New Zealand’s tax and transfer system reduces income inequality by less than is the case in Australia or, on average, across OECD countries (see figure 3.3). Problems, challenges and opportunities 14.The outcomes generated by the tax system reflect deep structural choices about what is taxed and what is not taxed. Two issues have been particularly prominent in the Group’s discussions over the past year: the treatment of capital gains and the treatment of stocks of natural capital. In the Group’s view, these structural choices have significant impacts on the fairness and balance of the tax system as a whole. The treatment of capital gains 15.The current treatment of capital gains creates a set of interlinked problems. Equity and fairness 16.A sense of fairness is central to maintaining public trust and confidence in the tax system. This is because a system that distributes the costs of taxation in a way that is perceived to be unfair will generate resentment and undermine social capital. 17.The inconsistent taxation of capital gains is unfair. It means that people earning the same amount of income can face quite different tax obligations, depending on whether their income is earned as capital gains or, say, as wages. 32 Future of Tax Recommendations Figure 3.3: Reduction in income inequality on account of the tax and transfer system across OECD countries (2014/15) 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Mexico Turkey Chile Korea Israel Switzerland United States New Zealand Canada Latvia Lithuania Estonia Australia United Kingdom OECD average Netherlands Spai n Sweden Poland Italy Hungary N or way Portugal Iceland Slovak Republic Greece Luxembourg Germany Denmark France Czech Republic Austria Slovenia Ireland Belgium Finland % reduction in Gini coefficient New Zealand OECD average Note: Estimated as the percentage difference in the Gini coefficient of income inequality before and after taxes and transfers. This figure is based on the OECD Income Distribution database. It includes personal income taxes, employees’ social security contributions and cash transfers but excludes payroll taxes and value-added taxes such as GST. Source: OECD 18. The resulting outcomes are also regressive. The distribution of net wealth is concentrated in the top 20% of households (see figure 3.4) and is even more concentrated when owner-occupied housing is excluded. This indicates that the distribution of untaxed capital gains is also likely to be quite skewed. Evidence from countries with capital gains taxes indicates that high-income people derive a much greater share of their income from capital gains than low- and middle- income people. How does the treatment of capital gains affect our tax obligations? Example 1 This year, Oliver earned $50,000 in wages. He will pay $8,020 in tax on this income. Judy, on the other hand, earned $25,000 of taxable income from part-time work. She also sells shares in a business and received a non- taxable capital gain of $25,000. Judy has also earned $50,000 but under current law, Judy will pay $3,395 in tax. Example 2 Paul earns a salary that roughly corresponds to the median New Zealand wage. Over the last ten years, he has earned about $450,000 of income from his job. He has paid tax of approximately $70,000 on that income. Paul’s friend Art purchased some residential property 10 years ago. He has been managing the property on a break-even basis by renting it to tenants and claiming deductions for maintenance, mortgage payments and rates. Art recently sold this property, making a gain of $195,000. (This gain roughly corresponds to the difference in median New Zealand house prices across the 10-year period.) He is not subject to any tax on this gain under current tax rules, as the gain is of a capital nature. 19. The inconsistent taxation of capital gains therefore has the effect of reducing the proportion of tax paid by the wealthiest members of our society. 33 Future of Tax Recommendations Figure 3.4: Total net worth (excluding owner-occupied housing), by net worth quintile (2015) -$0.1 $29 $54 $105 $602 $(100) $- $100 $200 $300 $400 $500 $600 $700 Quintile 1 Under $39,500 Quintile 2 $39,500 to $183,699 Quintile 3 $183,700 to $399,799 Quintile 4 $399,800 to $814,799 Quintile 5 $814,800+ $ billion Household net worth quintile Note: Net worth estimates exclude owner-occupied housing.

The Group is concerned that the resulting perceptions of unfairness will erode public acceptance of the prevailing levels of taxation, as well as the spirit of voluntary compliance that underpins efficient tax collection. Integrity 21. The current approach reduces the integrity of the tax system because it creates opportunities and incentives for tax minimisation and avoidance. Taxpayers have a strong incentive, for example, to argue that their gains are on capital account and are therefore not taxable. 22. Other tax minimisation strategies – such as dividend avoidance – also take advantage of the inconsistent taxation of capital gains. These types of integrity risks sharpen perceptions of unfairness and further erode social capital. 23. It is often difficult to establish the boundary between capital gains and ordinary income. For example, take a person who spends a couple of months renovating a residential investment property and then sells the property for a substantial gain. A large portion of the gain will reflect the return on the person’s labour. In the current system, however, it is likely to be treated as an untaxed capital gain. 24. In the case of certain sales of assets, the administration of the tax system is hampered by the need for subjective tests to assess the purpose or intention of those sales. These tests can create uncertainty for taxpayers when attempting to determine their tax obligations. Little revenue is collected, even with a bright line rule. This may also reflect problems with enforcement. Fiscal adequacy and sustainability over time 25. As the population ages, a greater proportion will live off capital income in retirement. Together with the impact of technological change, this is likely to increase the capital intensiveness of the economy and the ratio of capital income to labour income. 26. A tax system that is more sustainable over time – and that is fair in an intergenerational sense – will need to draw much more upon capital income in the future. Capital gains can be an important component of this income. 34 Future of Tax Recommendations 27. A broader tax base would also provide more flexibility to respond to future challenges. At present, the gap between the company rate and the top personal rate is small but there are still integrity problems, with people using company structures and tax-free gains to lower their effective tax rates. These pressures will only grow if the company rate is lowered or the top personal rate is raised in the future. 28. At the same time, an increased dependence on capital gains taxation will create a revenue risk, particularly in relation to the treatment of capital losses. These issues are considered further in Chapter 5 Extending the taxation of capital gains. Efficiency and productivity 29. The efficiency impacts of the current approach are difficult to establish. Yet it is clear that the inconsistent taxation of capital gains does affect the tax obligations facing different sectors of the economy. This, in turn, could affect productivity by distorting decisions about the allocation of savings and investment. 30. The data on capital gains by sector is incomplete. The key piece of available data comes from the IR10 filings of small-to-medium enterprises (which are defined as having annual turnover of less than $80 million). There are significant caveats to this data source. It does not capture capital gains earned by large companies, by the Government, or by managed funds. It understates untaxed capital gains from the financial sector and from residential investment properties. It also covers a relatively short time period; data over a longer time period is not available. 31. Nevertheless, the data is suggestive. Figure 3.5 shows the proportion of accounting profit by industry that is an untaxed realised capital gain. In broad terms, the main industries where untaxed capital gains represent a high proportion of total accounting profit are: agriculture, forestry and fishing; property and leasing services; and financial services. For most other manufacturing and service sectors, untaxed capital gains represent around 10% or less of total accounting profits. These outcomes (at least in some of the sectors) reflect the substantial increases in land values over the past 20 years. 32. Since capital gains are untaxed, there is a tax incentive to invest in those industries that have a high proportion of untaxed realised gains. To put it more bluntly, the tax system is subsidising the activities of these industries.

This chapter has thus far assessed the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system from a traditional perspective. A broader perspective would consider the relationship between natural capital and the tax system and acknowledge natural capital as a profound and non- substitutable basis for the economy. It would also recognise that natural capital is productive in its own right; even ‘unused’ or ‘vacant’ land, for example, produces a stream of ecosystem services that underpin human existence. 34. Natural capital is not prominent in current conceptions of tax systems in New Zealand or other developed countries. New Zealand also makes little use of environmental taxation, other than excise duty on fuel and road-user charges. New Zealand ranked 30th out of 33 OECD countries for environmental tax revenue as a share of total tax revenue in 2013 (OECD, 2018). There is little consideration of natural capital impacts in the development of tax policy and no reporting on the environmental impacts of tax policy. 35. There is also a strong revenue argument to increase the use of environmental taxation. As with capital gains, expanding environmental taxation would increase the flexibility and sustainability of the tax base over time. The additional revenue could be used to respond to increasing demands for public services or it could be recycled into measures that support a transition towards a more sustainable economy. 36. Given the non-substitutable nature of natural capital, the declining state of New Zealand’s environment, and the increasing fiscal costs of mitigation and adaptation, the Group sees a compelling case to broaden the tax base and make greater use of environmental taxation. Opportunities to improve the tax system 37. The Group has spent much time discussing the treatment of capital income and of natural capital but it has also looked across the tax system as a whole. Beyond the issues identified in this chapter the Group has identified a raft of opportunities to improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. 38. These include measures to increase progressivity, boost productivity and reduce compliance costs for small businesses. In addition, the Group has examined the gaps and behaviours that give rise to the ‘hidden economy’ and has identified measures to improve integrity and boost tax collection. The Group has also identified opportunities to increase transparency, strengthen taxpayer rights and improve policy development – particularly so that a more diverse range of voices can help to shape the system. 39. The challenges and opportunities in these areas were first explored in the Interim Report and are summarised in Chapter 9 of this report. Summary assessment 40. Over the past year, the Group has carefully examined the tax system in order to form a view about its overall structure, fairness and balance. Although the tax system has many strengths, the Group has found that the tax system is not particularly progressive and relies on a relatively narrow range of taxes (although the taxes that are levied by New Zealand have broad bases). 41. The outcomes generated by the tax system reflect deep structural choices about what is taxed and what is not taxed. Two issues have been particularly prominent in the Group’s discussions: the treatment of capital gains and the treatment of stocks of natural capital. In the Group’s view, these structural choices have significant impacts on the fairness and balance of the tax system as a whole. 42. The current treatment of capital gains reduces the fairness, progressivity and integrity of the tax system. Yet it is not enough to identify a problem: 36 Future of Tax Recommendations it is also necessary to identify a solution. The Group also acknowledges there are important choices and judgements involved in dealing with these problems – and that the extent to which the problems are dealt with effectively depend greatly on the details of policy design. 43. Chapter 5 Extending the taxation of capital gains outlines the Group’s preferred approach to dealing with these problems. In devising these recommendations, the Group has been very alert to the risk that, with poorly designed policy, the costs can outweigh the benefits. 44. There are also clear opportunities to increase the use of environmental taxation. The Group has prioritised considerations of environmental taxation during the course of its work. Chapter 4 Environmental and ecological outcomes sets out the Group’s framework for deciding when to apply environmental taxes. It also shows how the tax system could be developed, over time, to enhance natural capital. 37 Future of Tax Recommendations 1. The wellbeing of New Zealanders is critically dependent on the state of our natural environment and the health of our ecosystems. The Living Standards Framework reflects this relationship, including natural capital as one of the four capitals affecting wellbeing. Natural capital refers to all aspects of the natural environment needed to support life and human activity. 2. Chapter 2 Frameworks for assessing tax policy explores how Te Ao Māori perspectives can inform our understanding and application of the Living Standards Framework, which includes natural capital. Waiora – which is commonly used in Te Ao Māori to express wellbeing – centres our conception of wellbeing in wai (water) as the source of all life. As human beings, we are largely comprised of water and we draw our sustenance from the natural environment. Our wellbeing is inextricably linked to the wellbeing of our natural capital. Our success in managing ourselves in relation to these natural systems and resources will determine the sustainability and wellbeing of our people over time. 3. Owing to the symbiotic relationship of all things in the natural world, there is mutual benefit in responsible management of ourselves in relation to natural resources. From a tikanga perspective, kaitiakitanga (stewardship/ guardianship) encapsulates our obligations to undertake responsible resource management of our natural capital, as a basis for the sustainable development of our human, social and physical and financial capitals. Extending the principles of kaitiaki to the way we manage these four capitals collectively can support our approach to achieving wellbeing for our environment and our people. 4. It is also important to acknowledge that the natural environment has intrinsic value that goes beyond utility, because our sense of who we are as people is deeply embedded in our connection to it. Through manaakitanga (care and respect) we are incentivised to practise kaitiakitanga and our whanaungatanga (relationships to each other) are enhanced. 5. These values are not exclusive to Te Ao Māori. It is evident from public submissions that many New Zealanders are deeply concerned about the state of the environment. Their concerns cover effects at the local, national and global levels including pollution in our waterways, declining biodiversity, threats to our coastal zones and the impacts of climate change. 6. The Group has been tasked to respond to these concerns by examining the role the tax system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term. Environmental challenges 7. There are urgent environmental problems facing both New Zealand and the globe. Climate change is an especially critical threat. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has found that if global warming is to be limited to 1.5°C, rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, infrastructure and industrial systems will be required (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2018). In the OECD, New Zealand is among the highest emitters of greenhouse gases per dollar of GDP (OECD, 2014). 4 Environmental and ecological outcomes 38 Future of Tax Recommendations 8. Other environmental challenges are both linked to and extend well beyond, climate change. Biodiversity loss is especially concerning. The global population of vertebrate animals has declined by 58% since 1970 (WWF, 2018). In New Zealand, native biodiversity has rapidly declined and continues to be threatened, especially on private land – New Zealand now has one of the highest proportions of native species at risk. Nearly 75% of native forests and 90% of wetlands have been cleared or drained, although protections have had a significant impact in stemming the loss of native forest (Ministry for the Environment, 1997; Stats NZ, 2018b). A review of 71 rare ecosystems in New Zealand found that 45 of them were threatened with extinction (Stats NZ, 2015). 9. Surface water use is under pressure in many parts of the country. 72% of native freshwater fish species are now threatened by, or at risk of, extinction and approximately 30% of our waterways fail the Government’s standard for being swimmable (Ministry for the Environment and Stats NZ, 2017). Nitrate levels have generally worsened at monitored water sites for the period 2005-14, although phosphorous levels have improved (Ministry for the Environment and Stats NZ, 2017). 10. There are also challenges in our oceans. New Zealand administers a marine area of approximately four million square kilometres but only 0.3% of this area is classified as marine reserve (Ministry for the Environment, 2008). New Zealand has one of the largest and most comprehensive fishing quota systems in the world to maintain fish stocks. Nonetheless, 17% of fish stocks are deemed to be overfished and 6% have collapsed (Ministry for Primary Industries, 2018). 11. In summary, our natural capital is losing its capacity to produce the ecosystem services that we depend on. 7 Similar economic approaches include ecological economics, transitioning economics, regenerative economics, sharing economics and doughnut economics. System goals and principles 12. These environmental challenges call for profound changes to the structure of economic activity. Policymakers will need to think in terms of systems change – and develop a set of goals and principles that can guide a transition, in the short and long term, to more sustainable patterns of economic activity. 13. Under traditional economic approaches, environmental challenges are often approached from a cost perspective. A transition will be expensive unless benefits and pathways to possible solutions are constructively mapped. 14. The Living Standards Framework and Te Ao Māori perspectives can support and enrich the transition towards greater systems thinking. Mātauranga Māori already contains knowledge systems and frameworks that reflect a holistic and interconnected view of the natural world and its resources. 15. The circular economy envisages a system in which we minimise the extraction and use of new material and energy resources, maximise the value of resources that are in use and then recover and regenerate resources at the end of their service life. 7 Tikanga, such as kaitiaki and manaaki, and mātauranga Māori more broadly, can help facilitate transitions that move towards more sustainable management practices like the circular economy. Observations of sustainable resource management have formed the basis of these knowledge systems, which are preserved in mātauranga Māori and tikanga values. Fully utilising the different knowledge systems of Aotearoa/New Zealand will improve on what we currently have and accelerate our potential to achieve our collective resource management, sustainability and development goals. 39 Future of Tax Recommendations 16. These connections between healthy ecosystems and human wellbeing are also reflected in the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are signed by all United Nations (UN) member states, including New Zealand and provide a set of timebound goals across all domains of wellbeing. In the environmental sphere, the goals set targets for clean water (SDG6), climate action (SDG13), life below water (SDG14) and life on land (SDG15). The SDGs provide one blueprint for defining and measuring a just transition over time. 17. The Group notes that many of these goals and concepts are already beginning to inform the public debate on the future of the economy, including through the Living Standards Framework. The Group encourages further efforts to develop a shared vision about the goals and pathways towards an ‘Aotearoa Economy’ that can be sustained within a safe ecological operating space. The role of the tax system – a vision for the short, medium and long term 18. As outlined in Chapter 1 taxation is not simply a means of raising revenue. Tax can also be used as an instrument to achieve specific policy goals by influencing behaviour. The Group considers the tax system can play an expanded role in New Zealand’s environmental policy, helping to change behaviours and fund the transition towards a more regenerative, circular economy. 19. The Group has taken a broad view of taxes for assessing their role in improving environmental and ecological outcomes. The Group’s working definition of an environmental tax is an economic instrument that can be potentially revenue- raising for central or local government and that can improve environmental and ecological outcomes. 8 The definition encompasses nationally uniform taxes or levies, locally variable taxes or levies and tradeable emissions permits for national and local markets where the permits are sold by the Government. 8 Environmental outcomes could be improved by encouraging behaviour change and/or by funding environmental improvements, mitigation works or assisting people through change. 20. In the short term (the next 1 - 5 years) the Group recommends better use of environmental taxes to price negative environmental externalities. Environmental taxes can be a powerful tool for ensuring people and companies better understand and account for the impact of their actions on the ecosystems on which they depend. 21. Tax will not always be the right tool to address environmental externalities. The Group has therefore developed a framework to help decide when tax should be part of the policy response to environmental challenges – see When to apply environmental taxes. Using this framework, this chapter explores five specific areas for better deployment of environmental taxes: greenhouse gas emissions; water pollution; water abstraction; solid waste; and road transport. What are externalities? In economics, an externality is a cost or benefit that falls upon an unrelated third party. One example of a negative environmental externality is air pollution from an industrial plant that reduces air quality in a neighbouring district: the residents in that district may have no connection to the industrial plant but nevertheless suffer the effects of the downwind air pollution. Externalities can also be positive. For example, a restored wetland might provide flood protection for the surrounding area and also improve water quality. Social and ecological enterprises also produce positive externalities. 22. The Group also recommends removing tax concessions that are harmful to natural capital – see Tax concessions later in the chapter for the Group’s recommendations about specific provisions. 23. In the medium term (the next 5 - 10 years) environmental tax revenue should be used to help fund a transition to a more sustainable economy – see The medium term – revenue recycling later in this chapter for further discussion. 40 Future of Tax Recommendations 24. In the longer term (the next 10 - 30 years) the Group considers there is scope for environmental taxes to broaden New Zealand’s current tax base, sitting alongside income tax, GST and excise taxes. This could be underpinned by innovative new tools to measure and value environmental impacts, such as an environmental footprint tax or a natural capital enhancement tax – see Longer- term opportunities – an extension of the tax base. It could also be supported by expanded use of taxes on both renewable and non-renewable resources use. Environmental taxes in New Zealand 25. Stats NZ estimates that in 2016, the Government raised approximately $5 billion in environmental taxes, as defined by the System of Environmental Economic Accounting (SEAA). This was equivalent to 6.2% of tax revenue, up from 4.8% in 1999 (Stats NZ, 2018a). Compared to other countries, New Zealand is a relatively low user of environmental taxes. New Zealand ranked 30th out of 33 OECD countries for environmental tax revenue as a share of total tax revenue in 2013 (OECD, 2018). 26. Figure 4.1 shows the sources and uses of New Zealand’s environmental tax revenue. Most of this revenue comes from taxes that are actually levied for non-environmental purposes: fuel taxes, road-user charges and vehicle registration fees make up over 80% of environmental tax revenue. These taxes are largely hypothecated to the National Land Transport Fund to pay for land transport infrastructure, or to ACC to provide compensation for road-related injuries. 27. Only a small share of environmental tax revenue comes from pollution taxes (such as the Waste Disposal Levy) or resource taxes (such as energy resource levies). This mix of environmental tax revenue is similar to other countries. Across all OECD countries with data, a majority of environmental tax revenue comes from transport and energy taxes, with relatively little from other pollution and resource taxes. Figure 4.1: Sources and uses of environmental tax revenue in New Zealand (2016) Notes: 1) Includes customs import duties. 2) Royalties are included in this figure but are typically excluded from environmental tax estimates as they are considered the sale of an asset. 3) Includes energy resource levies, the Waste Disposal Levy and other energy and resource taxes. 4) Includes local authorities and the Waste Minimisation Fund. 5) Numbers may not add owing to rounding. Source: Stats NZ, the Treasury 41 Future of Tax Recommendations Framework for taxing negative environmental externalities 9 Mitigation measures could include complementary changes to tax and transfer settings. 10 Where the only response is a tax, the tax should be set to reflect the cost of the externality. However, part of the cost might be best managed by regulation, insurance policy or some other measure. The cost of externalities can be difficult to estimate. However, a tax that is 50% above or below the true cost will still likely perform well in terms of welfare gains (Parry, Norregaard, & Heine, 2012). In situations where certain externalities cannot be costed, the price of the tax may need to be set higher than the costed externalities to allow for uncosted externalities. Taxation can be used as a tool to enhance natural capital when unpriced externalities lead to the over-exploitation of resource stocks and degrade the integrity of ecosystems. Favourable attributes: The case for using taxation is stronger if one or more of the following criteria are met: • Behavioural responsiveness: The level of damaging activity is relatively responsive to feasible price signals (i.e. it is relatively price elastic). If the damaging activity is relatively price inelastic, a tax might still be desirable as compensation to society for the costs being imposed and as a means of raising revenue. • Revenue-raising potential: Large revenues could be raised from the tax, allowing for the reduction of more distortionary taxes and/or spending on other government priorities. • Diversity of responses: There is a range of potential abatement responses with differing costs, including investment in innovation, such that regulating a particular response could impose high costs. Essential attributes: The suitability of taxation as a policy instrument – relative to other instruments, such as regulation and spending – can be assessed through the following criteria: • Measurability: The damaging activity, or a reasonable proxy of it, can be measured. • Risk tolerance: There is sufficient time for a tax instrument to be developed and refined. • Sufficient scale: The environmental problem is sufficiently large-scale and persistent to justify administration and compliance costs in comparison to regulation. Principles for designing externality taxes The principles of tax policy design described in Chapter 2 of this report can also apply to environmental taxes (including compliance and administration costs). Building off these, there are seven design principles that warrant particular attention: 1. Māori rights and interests must be acknowledged and addressed. 2. Distributional impacts should be assessed and mitigated. 9 3. The suite of responses should reflect the full cost of externalities. 10 4. The price should vary locally where there is local variation in impacts. 5. International linkages should be considered, including international obligations and agreements. 6. The tax should be integrated with other policy, complementing other regulatory responses. 7. Intertemporal fairness should be considered to ensure that resources are used in a way that is fair to future generations and other species. 42 Future of Tax Recommendations 28. The Group has also found that New Zealand has limited institutional capability to design and implement environmental taxes – a concern also raised by submitters. The Group recommends that the Government strengthen its capability to use tax to enhance environmental and ecological outcomes. This includes support for the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, which should be resourced to provide independent advice on the environmental tax work of the Government. When to apply environmental taxes 29. Taxation can be a tool to change behaviour but it is not always the best tool. Sometimes, regulation or spending may be more effective tools; in other cases, taxation may be complementary. As has been stressed by public submitters, tax should not be considered in isolation when dealing with the environment. Instead, the merits of tax as a policy instrument should be assessed, together with the merits of other tools and approaches. 30. Over the past months, the Group has developed a framework for deciding when to apply taxes to address negative environmental externalities, building off the approaches outlined in Chapter 2 Frameworks for assessing tax policy. This framework, which is presented above, sets out the circumstances in which taxation is likely to be an effective tool and the characteristics of a well- designed externality tax. 31. This framework provides only limited guidance on the type of tax instrument to use. As noted above, the Group has taken a broad view of potential tax instruments. Where there is a case for taxing environmental externalities, different instruments should be reviewed. This includes fixed-rate emission charges and tradeable emission permits. 32. The Group has given more limited consideration to the taxation of natural resource use (or resource rents). There are some existing frameworks in New Zealand that have been used to shape the royalty regimes for petroleum and minerals (Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) 2012). Future assessments should also include consideration of intertemporal fairness, ensuring resources are used in a way that is fair to future generations of people, as well as other species. The short term – negative externalities and concessions 33. The Group has considered changes to the tax system that would enhance environmental and ecological outcomes in the short term, using its framework for taxing negative externalities. 34. The Group wishes to highlight five specific areas for further attention in the short term: greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, water abstraction, solid waste and road transport. 35. The following discussion focuses on criteria in the negative externality framework which are only partially met and on design principles of particular relevance to each resource. 36. The Group has also considered changes to tax concessions – both the removal of existing concessions that harm natural capital and the introduction of new concessions to support natural capital. These are discussed below as part of possible short-term tax changes. Greenhouse gas emissions Evaluation against the framework 37. Greenhouse gases generally meet the criteria of the Group’s framework, suggesting they are well suited to the use of tax instruments (where tax instruments include auctioned tradeable emission permits). Of particular note is the wide range of abatement opportunities. This means abatement of emissions is likely to be achieved at a lower cost by using taxation than by mandating particular actions through regulation. There is also evidence that putting a price on greenhouse gas externalities drives innovation in abatement (Dechezlepretre, Martin & Bassi, 2016). 38. Greenhouse gases could be a significant source of revenue over the medium term and New Zealand already has an environmental tax tool for pricing some greenhouse gas emissions in the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). 43 Future of Tax Recommendations 39. The Group’s framework also highlights potential challenges with applying tax instruments to greenhouse gases. The main challenges relate to measurement, international linkages and pricing. Measurement 40. Greenhouse gas emissions from diffuse sources, such as biological sources in agriculture, are more difficult to estimate accurately than point- source emissions from fossil fuels. 11 This has been an important issue in expanding the ETS to include agriculture. 41. There are different approaches to measuring agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. At the more precise end of the spectrum, there are modelling tools such as OVERSEER that attempt to estimate greenhouse gas emissions accounting for farm-specific characteristics. These tools can be expensive to administer but account for some differences in farm management practices. At the less precise end of the spectrum, there are approaches such as processor-level charges 12 . These approaches are simpler to administer and encourage some mitigation but do not reflect differences in farming management practices. 42. There is still much work to do on this issue but the Group notes that even imprecise approaches could provide a useful price signal that accounts for land use and intensity decisions. International linkages 43. If New Zealand imposes the full cost of carbon but other countries do not, there is a perceived risk of ‘emissions leakage’ – production reduces here and expands in countries with weaker climate action, with no net global reduction in emissions (Levinson & Taylor, 2008). 11 Diffuse source pollution (or nonpoint source pollution) is pollution from widespread or dispersed sources, such as pasture run off from animal wastes and fertilisers, as well as run off from paved surfaces in urban areas. 12 For example, charging on a per-litre-of-milk basis, using an estimate of the average quantity of greenhouse gas emissions embedded in a litre of milk. 13 A carbon tax is another economic instrument that could be used to price emissions. 14 Stiglitz-Stern estimate the Paris Agreement objectives require a pricing corridor of $US40-80/t-CO 2 e in 2020 and $US50- 100/t-CO 2 e in 2030 (Stern & Stiglitz, 2017). This is roughly equivalent to $NZ58-116/t-CO 2 e in 2020 and $NZ73-145/t-CO 2 e in 2030. Biological emissions – almost half of New Zealand’s total emissions – are also excluded from the ETS. 15 The one-for-two transitional measure allows non-forestry businesses to pay one emissions unit for every two tonnes of CO 2 e emissions. 44. At a minimum, this points to the importance of supporting globally coordinated action, including United Nations Climate Change Conference agreements (the most recent being COP24). There are also policy options for mitigating leakage risks. These options include transitional assistance for impacted industries, targeted revenue recycling, and regulation to level the carbon playing field between domestic producers and importers. 45. There are economic and social benefits from taking faster action on climate change. It could encourage innovation and reduce the cost of meeting New Zealand’s international commitments. The Emissions Trading Scheme and pricing 46. As noted above, New Zealand already has a tool for pricing carbon through the ETS. 13 A major criticism of the ETS is that it has significantly underpriced carbon. 14 The Productivity Commission reports that New Zealand’s emissions price (approximately $NZ20/t-CO 2 e in 2018) will need to rise to at least $75/t-CO 2 e (and possibly to more than $200/t-CO 2 e) over the next few decades if New Zealand is to achieve its international commitments (NZPC, 2018). 47. There is scope to address the weaknesses of the ETS. Some reforms have already taken place – for example, the removal of the one- for-two policy. 15 The Group also notes a range of reforms recommended by the Productivity Commission: these include introducing mechanisms that provide guidance about the path of future emissions prices, and the auctioning of emissions units (NZUs) to achieve this (NZPC 2018). The ETS could also raise the same amount of revenue as a carbon tax if free allocation were eliminated. 44 Future of Tax Recommendations 48. Retaining the ETS also supports policy stability and durability. It is sensible to take advantage of the existing infrastructure around the ETS. It is also important to give stability about the long-term direction of policy, so that businesses and individuals have the confidence to invest in emissions abatement. 49. The Group supports an emissions pricing regime with comprehensive coverage, including of agriculture. However, the Group does not have a view on whether this is best done inside the ETS or through other pricing approaches. Revenue potential 50. The Government does not currently auction emissions units but could generate significant revenue by doing so. 51. The revenue potential of greenhouse gas emissions depends on policy choices about the treatment of biological emissions and limits to free allocation. The Secretariat for the Tax Working Group has modelled revenue scenarios based on carbon budget forecasts from the Ministry for the Environment (MfE). 52. Under current settings and assuming the NZU price rises to $50/t-CO 2 e in 2030, the auction of NZUs is forecast to raise approximately $130 million per annum over the coming decade. 53. If agriculture faces a charge for 5% of its emissions, and free allocation is reduced linearly by one percentage point each year, revenue will roughly double to $240 million per annum, assuming no change in emission volumes. 54. If free allocation is reduced by three percentage points each year (the upper end of the broad- based reduction rates being considered by other countries), and this same reduction rate is also applied to agriculture, revenue will double again to $530 million per annum. 55. The total revenue that could be raised by removing all free allocation is estimated to be $2.1 billion per annum, assuming no change in emissions volumes. This is equivalent to replacing the ETS with a comprehensive carbon tax, assuming prices are the same. 56. Revenue will be sensitive to the emissions price. If the price rises to $80/t-CO 2 e in 2030 (the highest rate in scenarios used by the Productivity Commission), revenue will increase by approximately 40% above the estimates in the table. At $30/t-CO 2 e (the lowest rate in Productivity Commission scenarios) revenue will decrease by approximately 27%. Table 4.1: Fiscal potential from auctioning emissions units   Share of biological emissions charged for Change in free allocation, relative to current rates Average annual forecast revenues, 2021-30 Status quo0%0%$130 million Scenario 15%Reduction of 1%-point p.a.$240 million Scenario 25% in 2021, increasing 3%-points p.a.Reduction of 3%-points p.a.$530 million Scenario 310% in 2021, increasing 5%-points p.a.Reduction of 5%-points p.a.$830 million Note: The modelling is based on current MfE carbon budget projections. It assumes no change in emission volumes as a result of changes in free allocation or biological emission charging, and also assumes a linear increase in the emissions price from $20/t-CO 2 e in 2021 to $50/t-CO 2 e in 2030. These price paths do not reflect the Group’s views on the appropriate price of carbon – as noted in this report, prices above $200/t-CO 2 e may be needed to achieve New Zealand’s carbon reduction targets. The fiscal impact of higher prices will depend on the accompanying change in emissions volumes. Revenue forecasts are preliminary and indicative. Source: Ministry for the Environment, Secretariat for the Tax Working Group 45 Future of Tax Recommendations 57. Greenhouse gas emissions may not be a reliable tax base in the long term if New Zealand substantially reduces its net emissions. In the short-to-medium term, however, even modest changes to the ETS settings could raise reasonable amounts of revenue. Assessment 58. Greenhouse gases are well suited to the use of tax instruments. However, there are significant shortcomings in the current pricing and coverage of emissions in New Zealand. 59. The Group supports a reformed ETS remaining the centrepiece of New Zealand’s emissions reduction efforts but recommends it be made more ‘tax-like’ – specifically, by providing greater guidance on price and auctioning NZUs to raise revenue (as recommended by the Productivity Commission). The Group also supports pricing agricultural emissions. 60. The Group is not well placed to take a view on specific ETS settings, such as the appropriate settings of a price band to drive the desired behaviour change. The work of the Interim Climate Change Committee and future Climate Commission will be important in ensuring that the ETS establishes a credible and enduring price signal to de-carbonise the New Zealand economy. 61. The Group recommends periodic review of the ETS to ensure it is fit for purpose and is the best mechanism for pricing greenhouse gas emissions. Water pollution Evaluation against the framework 62. The pollution of fresh waterways is a significant environmental problem in New Zealand. A range of pollutants reduce water quality, including nitrogen, phosphorous, sediment and pathogens, such as E. coli. Water pollutants come from both rural and urban sources (MfE 2017). 16 The technical capacity of OVERSEER to model sediment, pathogens and phosphorous run off, as well greenhouse gas emissions, is significantly less advanced than for nitrogen run off. 63. Applying our framework to water pollution, a number of criteria are only partially met. Output measurement of diffuse pollutants is challenging and modelling of some water pollutants is more difficult than others. Opportunities for abatement will vary by catchment, as will the environmental benefits. Risk tolerance may have been exhausted in some catchments and it may be necessary to ban discharges to restore those waterways to healthy states. In designing potential tax instruments, consideration of Māori rights and interests will be critical, as will pricing and equity issues. Measurement and pricing issues are further explored below. Measurement 64. There are significant measurement challenges for water pollutants and a range of approaches to measuring and estimating emissions. 65. Direct measurement of diffuse pollutants (e.g. by the use of probes) can be expensive and difficult to relate back to specific emission sources. 66. Input-based approaches measure emission- producing inputs (e.g. fertiliser use). Inputs are generally easier to measure but can be poor proxies for actual emissions and environmental impacts. 67. There are also output-based modelling approaches, such as OVERSEER. OVERSEER was designed as an on-farm nutrient budgeting and management tool. It has also been used for estimating some types of nutrient run off (notably nitrogen) for environmental management purposes. 68. The Group acknowledges concerns raised by a range of submitters about OVERSEER, including transparency, ownership and accuracy, especially for some types of emissions. 16 The Group welcomes the recent findings of Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment, which highlights current limitations of OVERSEER as a regulatory tool. The Group supports further development of a broad range of modelling and measuring tools. 46 Future of Tax Recommendations 69. The better the measurement, the clearer the price signal is to reduce harmful emissions. Nonetheless, tax instruments based on relatively coarse estimates may be better than the status quo for some pollutants, such as nitrogen. They can provide a price signal that is sensitive to land use and intensity decisions and incentives to abate below consent levels. Localisation of pricing 70. Water pollution costs vary significantly by location. The marginal cost of emissions differs significantly across catchments, based on a range of geophysical variables and the level of current emissions. Pricing tools should also allow for local variation. 71. Locally variable pricing tools could take various forms. For example, catchment-level nitrogen discharge trading schemes have already been used in the Lake Taupo catchment, and are planned for the Rotorua Lakes; an alternative might be a national tax levied on estimated emissions, with catchment-level variation in rates. 72. Locally variable pricing tools could involve significant administrative and compliance complexity. An alternative approach is nationally uniform charging – for example, a fertiliser tax. Revenue raised from a nationally uniform charge or a nationally administered pricing tool could still be regionally allocated. 73. Setting the price may require challenging value judgements about the desired level of water quality. This is a key function of the National Policy Statement on Freshwater Management. Swimmability, drinkability, ecosystem health and aesthetic amenity considerations point to a range of possible standards. There may also be challenges in valuing and accounting for lost fauna, flora and ecosystems. 17 Costing externalities is important for the design of both tax instruments and regulation – both require policymakers to balance costs and benefits. 74. As with other environmental resources, it may not be possible to reflect the full cost of water pollution in the price but this shouldn’t preclude the use of tax instruments in pursuit of positive environmental and ecological outcomes. 17 Revenue potential 75. The Group has not found comprehensive estimates of the revenue that could be generated by water pollutant taxes in New Zealand. To give a sense of the potential magnitude, the Group estimates that a $2/kg charge on leached nitrates could raise approximately $270 million per annum at current leaching rates and assuming 100% coverage. Assessment 76. If Māori rights and interests can be addressed, there could be a role for making greater use of tax instruments to address water quality with current tools, especially for nitrogen, and especially for regions struggling with excessive discharges. Even tax instruments using simple estimation approaches are likely to be preferable to having no tax instruments. 77. Water pollutant tax rates should ideally be sensitive to local catchment conditions (e.g. through local trading markets or locally differentiated rates). Pricing frameworks and systems should be developed, potentially at a national level for local application, to reflect this. 78. The Group encourages the further development of tools to estimate (and ultimately directly measure) diffuse water pollution, which would enable more accurate and effective water pollutant tax instruments. There is also a need to strengthen capabilities and capacities to develop and apply modelling tools, as well as verify compliance. 79. If significant progress is not made in the near term on implementing output-based tax instruments or other regulatory measures, the Group recommends the introduction of input- based tax instruments, including on fertiliser. 47 Future of Tax Recommendations 80. Regulation, education and support will therefore likely need to continue to play an important role in complementing potential tax instruments. Water abstraction Objectives of a water abstraction tax 81. Water abstraction taxes have a broader set of potential objectives than some of the other environmental tax opportunities. They include: • rationing the total water take (i.e. pricing externalities) • improving the efficiency of water use within allowable water takes (i.e. ensuring that water is allocated to its highest value use, including ecological and social uses) • taxing natural resource use (i.e. capturing resource rents) • funding the restoration of degraded water bodies. 82. The Government has taken a regulatory approach to the first objective: minimum flows and maximum takes are set following processes outlined in the National Policy Statement for Freshwater Management. Water tax instruments can play a complementary role by supporting the other three objectives. Evaluation against the framework 83. Fresh water abstraction generally meets the criteria in the Group’s framework. It is generally feasible to measure major water takes, price signals can incentivise significant changes in behaviour and there is potential for significant long-term revenue. 84. However, there are significant design considerations that would need to be addressed before advancing potential water tax instruments, including Māori rights and interests, pricing localisation concerns and equity issues. 18 The value of water will also be sensitive to the prices of the products produced using the water e.g. milk and electricity. 19 Special consideration may be warranted for non-consumptive users of water, such as hydroelectric generation. Water may still have value after non-consumptive use, although its ecological and economic value may have been depleted. Māori rights and interests 85. Any potential water taxes will need to take account of Māori rights and interests in water. There are well established concerns about questions of access, as well as ownership. Māori have less access to water than other land owners. Analysis from the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) suggests that in drier regions of New Zealand, only 3% of good quality Māori- owned land is irrigated, compared to 27% of all good quality land. There is ongoing work to better address Māori rights and interest in water, including through the Waitangi Tribunal and discussions between the Crown and iwi/Māori. Localisation of pricing 86. Water allocation pressures vary significantly by time of year and catchment. 18 Tax instruments should be sensitive to both time and place to reflect differences in the scarcity and value of water for ecological, social, cultural and economic purposes. 87. Better pricing of water has the potential to encourage a broad range of efficiency measures by water users, as well as greater investment in water storage and transport infrastructure that enhances natural capital. 88. There are risks to having tradeable water rights in highly localised water markets – there may be a small number of participants making it difficult to ensure competitive processes. The administrative costs of tradeable water schemes would also need to be considered. Equity and distributional impacts 89. Equity and efficiency considerations suggest environmental and resource taxes should, by default, have broad coverage. Applying this to water abstraction, this means all exclusionary users of water should be in scope for potential water taxes, including agriculture, hydroelectric generators and urban users. 19 48 Future of Tax Recommendations 90. There are equity challenges in any potential allocation of water rights. Some of the value of existing water consents is likely capitalised in land prices and hydroelectric generator share prices. These equity concerns will need to be balanced against the interests of those who cannot obtain water consents, as well as the expectations of a fair return to the public, Crown or Māori. Water bodies may themselves have rights and interests, as recognised in the granting of legal personhood to the Whanganui River. 91. The distributional impacts on households of a water tax will also need to be considered, both from the direct cost of water charges and the incidence of any water charges imposed on firms (e.g. agriculture and electricity providers). People cannot live without water and it will be important to ensure that households have affordable access to water. Assessment 92. Water abstraction is a particularly challenging policy area in New Zealand owing to a range of different interests in the resource. Water is an essential resource for life, for recreation and for commerce. Water policy also impacts Māori rights and interests. 93. If Māori rights and interests can be addressed, water tax instruments (including auctioned tradeable permits) could be useful tools for improving the efficiency of water use. They could also be a significant and sustainable source of revenue over the long term. Solid waste Evaluation against the framework 94. Solid waste meets the criteria in the Group’s framework for the application of an externality tax. Solid waste streams are generally measurable. There is a diverse range of waste- reduction opportunities, including greater resource recovery and recycling, and investment in product designs and circular systems. Overseas experience has shown that landfilling is responsive to price signals. Waste taxes also have the potential to raise significant revenue in the short-to-medium term. 95. New Zealand already taxes waste through the Waste Disposal Levy. The levy is set at a rate of $10 per tonne. It only applies at landfills that accept household waste. The limited scope means the levy is only applied to 11% of landfills, covering approximately 30% of waste disposed to landfills. The levy currently raises about $30 million per annum (MfE 2017). Pricing 96. Well-run landfill sites internalise many of the environmental costs in the disposal fees they charge. However, even well-run landfills generate externalities, such as leachates, air emissions (other than greenhouse gases covered by the ETS) and reduced amenity. 97. It is unclear whether the levy fully prices the externalities associated with waste and landfill disposal. Robust estimates of these externalities are challenging and depend on the site and waste product. A review in 2012 estimated that the costs of the environmental externalities – above the disposal costs of the landfill – ranged from $1-$19 per tonne (Covec, 2012). These estimates take a relatively narrow view of the externalities from waste, so it may be appropriate to look at a wider set of externalities, which could in turn justify a higher levy rate. Behavioural responsiveness 98. A significant increase in the levy rate will likely change behaviour. The generation of waste is highly sensitive to price: overseas experience suggests that higher landfill taxes reduce waste production and increase recycling (Covec, 2012). As illustrated by figure 4.2, higher landfill taxes have driven extraordinary reductions in landfill volumes in the United Kingdom (although this has also been accompanied by increased incineration and waste exports). 49 Future of Tax Recommendations Figure 4.2: Landfill tax rates and waste volumes in the United Kingdom £0 £10 £20 £30 £40 £50 £60 £70 £80 £90 £100 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 19961998200020022004200620082010201220142016 Level of standard tax rate (£ per tonne) Tonnes of waste land fillne d at standard rate (millions of tonnes) Waste landfilled at standard rateTax rate Source: HMRC 20 Approximately half of the funds raised goes to local councils and half is hypothecated to waste reduction projects through the Waste Minimisation Fund. 99. Increased efforts will be necessary to mitigate the risk that individuals resort to illegal dumping to avoid the levy. This could include refuse, reuse and recycling programmes, stronger penalties, education programmes and monitoring and enforcement measures. Fiscal potential 100. The Waste Disposal Levy currently raises approximately $30 million per annum. 20 A recent study by Eunomia, commissioned by the New Zealand Waste Levy Action Group, modelled revenue changes from increases in the levy to up to $140/t for standard waste with a lower rate for inert waste (Eunomia, 2017). The modelling exercise found up to $200 million in additional annual revenue from rate increases. The Group has not fully assessed modelling assumptions or approaches used in this analysis. 101. In the long run, the price elasticity of waste means that waste taxes may not be a sustainable tax base. Assessment 102. The Ministry for the Environment is currently reviewing the rate and coverage of the Waste Disposal Levy. The Group supports this work. There is a case to expand the coverage of the Waste Disposal Levy beyond the 30% of waste currently covered, potentially with split rates to account for different external costs associated with different types of waste. 103. The Group recommends a reassessment of the negative externalities associated with waste and landfill disposal in New Zealand to ascertain if a higher levy rate would be appropriate. Higher rates should be introduced after an expansion of coverage to prevent leakage to unlevied landfills. Incineration levies may also be necessary to reduce waste generation. 104. The Group also supports revisiting the current approach to hypothecation, i.e. allocation of the Waste Disposal Levy, especially if there are significant increases in funds raised, to ensure they are being used in the most effective way to move towards a more circular economy. 50 Future of Tax Recommendations Road transport Evaluation against the framework 105. Road transport generates a number of different negative externalities. These include road damage, congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, noise, surface pollution, injuries and death. Some of these externalities better meet the criteria for negative externality taxes than others but there is generally a good fit. 106. A number of tax instruments already address some road transport externalities. For example, the ETS prices greenhouse gas emissions, and petrol and registration levies fund costs relating to injuries and death. Measurement and pricing 107. Congestion is likely to be the largest unpriced externality in road transport. Local air pollution, surface pollution and noise are also unpriced. These externalities are highly specific to time, place and type of vehicle. This has historically created measurement and pricing challenges. 108. There are now a range of technical solutions to make measuring and charging for these externalities feasible. For example, an enhanced road user charging system that captures information on location, time, type of vehicle and load could allow for more refined pricing of a broad range of externalities. Equity 109. Several submitters raised equity concerns with transport pricing, especially the impact of fuel taxes on low-income households. It is difficult to generalise about the impact of transport taxes. It will be important to assess the distributional impacts of specific proposals, and equity constraints could mean that pricing is used to signal some types of externalities, rather than accurately price them. 21 Estimated revenues in FY2017-18 from petroleum, minerals, coal and ironsands royalties, as well as energy resource levies on coal and gas – https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/ise/budget-2018-data-estimates-appropriations-2018-19. The Government collects additional revenue from mining operations from corporate income tax. Assessment 110. The Government and Auckland Council are currently considering whether or not to introduce congestion pricing in Auckland. The Government’s Urban Growth Agenda is also scoped to review the future of the transport revenue system. The Group supports these reviews as an opportunity to better align road transport charges with externalities. Other pollutants and resources 111. New Zealand has royalty regimes for taxing minerals and petroleum mining. These royalty regimes were last reviewed in 2012 (MBIE, 2012). 112. The fiscal impact of any change to the petroleum and minerals royalty regimes will be relatively small. Royalties from petroleum and minerals mining were approximately $200 million in 2017/18 or 0.2% of core Crown revenue. 21 In the absence of any new discoveries, royalties are forecast to decline in the coming years, reflecting declining petroleum production volumes and the decision not to grant further exploration permits for offshore petroleum mining. The Group does not recommend any changes to the royalty regimes. Any future reviews should take account of the Group’s framework for taxing negative environmental externalities. 113. The Group acknowledges submitter concerns about the use of pesticides and suggestions for the introduction of a pesticide tax. The Group did not have sufficient information to assess whether tax was the most appropriate response to the underlying concerns. Regulation, including banning, may be more appropriate in some circumstances. 51 Future of Tax Recommendations Distributional impacts and equity considerations 114. Environmental taxes can increase the cost of essential goods, such as energy, food and transport. Low-income households tend to spend a larger share of their income on these goods than higher-income households, so environmental taxes are often assumed to be regressive (Kosonen, 2012). 115. The actual incidence of environmental taxes will depend on a number of factors, including the consumption patterns of the taxed item, the availability of substitutes and the extent to which additional costs can be passed on to the final consumer. The distributional impact will also depend on the extent to which the revenue is recycled to help affected parties transition to more sustainable practices. 116. Environmental taxation can have a progressive impact if it successfully addresses the environmental issue, since lower income people can be disproportionately impacted by the degradation of the environment and ecosystem services. 117. The Group has not conducted a detailed assessment of the distributional impacts of the taxes in this chapter. However, the Group does not believe that potentially regressive impacts should rule out consideration of these taxes. Instead, the Government should be alert to distributional impacts and look to mitigate them as appropriate. Chapter 7 Personal income tax outlines a number of options for increasing the progressivity of income tax, which could also offset the distributional impacts of environmental taxation. 118. The Group recommends that the Government commission incidence studies to better understand who will incur the costs of new environmental taxes and to design appropriate mitigation measures. 119. The Group is also mindful of the particular impacts that environmental taxes can have on Māori and has included addressing Māori rights and interests as a key design principle for environmental tax instruments. Submissions to the Group by Māori organisations highlighted a range of viewpoints and concerns. Summary evaluation 120. Tables 4.2 and 4.3 summarise the performance of the five resources and pollutants against its negative externality framework. Tax concessions Care of the land 121. Several submitters suggested that costs associated with the care of land subject to QEII covenants should be treated as a deductible expense. The submitters argued that deductibility would support the purpose of the QEII covenant regime, as well as reduce compliance and administration costs. The Group agrees with this suggestion. The Group also recommends that privately incurred costs associated with the care of Ngā Whenua Rāhui should also be tax deductible. 122. Farming-specific deduction rules and depreciation rates should be reviewed as part of the Tax Policy Work Programme. This is to ensure they do not incentivise activities that destroy natural capital or disincentivise activities that enhance natural capital. This could involve both removing harmful concessionary provisions but also introducing positive incentives. 52 Future of Tax Recommendations Table 4.2: Evaluation of environmental tax opportunities in the short-to-medium term – criteria   Greenhouse gases Water pollution\* Water abstraction\*\* Solid waste Road transport\*\*\* FAVOURABLE ATTRIBUTES      Behavioural responsiveness\*\*\*\* ✔✔✔✅✅ Revenue-raising potential ✅✔✅✔✔ Diversity of response ✅ ✔/✅ ✔✅✔ ESSENTIAL ATTRIBUTES      Measurability ✔ ✔/✅ ✅✅✔ Risk tolerance ✅✔✔✅✅ Sufficient scale ✅✅✅✅✅ ✅ Largely met/high ✔ Partially met/medium – Not met/low \* Overall assessment of key water pollutants (nitrates, phosphates, sediment and pathogens). \*\* Water abstraction taxes might be considered for taxing natural resource use, rather than pricing negative externalities, which could make some of the above criteria redundant. \*\*\* Overall assessment of key unpriced road externalities, including congestion. \*\*\*\* Assessment of short-term behavioural responsiveness.

The forestry tax regime should also be reviewed to ensure it is delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes in the most cost- effective way for the Government and does not disincentivise activities that enhance natural capital over the longer term (such as growing native trees for carbon storage). Petroleum mining 124. The Group notes concerns raised by submitters around tax provisions for petroleum mining. The Group has not been able to assess these concerns in detail and recommends they be reviewed by officials as part of the Tax Policy Work Programme. Car parking and public transport 125. The Group has also considered the treatment of car parks and public transport. At the moment, the provision of free car parking to employees is not subject to fringe benefit tax in many instances. Yet any contributions made to an employee’s public transport costs are taxed. This treatment has the perverse effect of discouraging the use of public transport. 126. The Group acknowledges the practical difficulties involved in applying fringe benefit tax to employee car parks. In recognition of this constraint, the Group suggests the Government consider allowing employers to subsidise public transport use by employees without incurring fringe benefit tax. The medium term – revenue recycling 127. There is a strong case to recycle some or all of the revenue from environmental taxation into measures that support the transition to a more sustainable economy. This could help support those impacted transition to activities or land use that have a more positive impact on natural capital. For example, revenue could be recycled to help a farm with high emissions and high resource use in an ecologically sensitive area transition to a lower-impact operation. 128. Recycling environmental tax revenue has several benefits. It can reinforce the purpose of the tax by funding complementary activities (just as the Waste Disposal Levy is used to fund waste minimisation projects). It can address equity concerns arising from the incidence of the tax. It also enhances transparency, demonstrating that the tax is being introduced for environmental reasons and not to raise money for general government expenditure. Longer-term possibilities – an extension of the tax base 129. Over the longer term, environmental taxes could play a significantly greater role in the tax system and become a much more significant tax base. Innovative new tools could broaden the scope of negative externalities that can be measured, valued and taxed. 130. Greater tax revenue could also come from an expanded use of taxes on renewable and non- renewable resource use. A new approach to resource taxation, with a focus on intertemporal fairness, can ensure resources are used in a way that is fair to future generations of people and other species. 131. There are significant environmental challenges in New Zealand that are less well suited to environmental taxes. These tend to be environmental problems, where specific activities driving environmental change are more challenging to measure, such as biodiversity loss and impacts on ecosystem services. 132. The Group received several submissions highlighting new approaches that could be developed to address some of these challenges. An environmental footprint tax, for example, is a form of land tax set according to the intensity of land use and consequent impact on the environment. This has informed the Group’s thinking on a natural capital enhancement tax. Biodiversity tax credits should also be considered. 54 Future of Tax Recommendations A natural capital enhancement tax A natural capital enhancement tax is based on the idea of an environmental footprint tax and operates as a modified form of land tax. The tax is levied per unit area of land or privately owned coastal area. However, the rate of the tax is set to reflect the ecological impact of activities occurring on that land or coastal zone. Higher tax rates are applied to areas of land with low or degraded ecological value, for example, paved surfaces. Lower or even negative tax rates are applied to areas of land with high ecological value, for example, native forest or wetland. The tax aims to recognise that natural capital produces valuable ecosystem services. It provides incentives for the conservation, restoration and regeneration of high-value natural capital, going beyond more narrowly targeted negative externality taxes. Remote sensing technologies, combined with mapping and modelling tools, could potentially be used to assess both the level and change in the ecological value of a specific area of land or coastal zone. 133. Discussions with submitters indicate that further work is needed to validate approaches like this, calibrate prices with externalities, and work through integration with other environmental taxes. Nonetheless, a natural capital enhancement tax is one example of the potential for new environmental tax instruments in the longer term. Summary assessment 134. The tax system can play a greater role in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes in New Zealand. It can help change behaviours and fund transitions towards a more regenerative, circular economy. 135. Environmental taxes should be considered together with other policy options, such as regulation and education, for achieving positive environmental and ecological outcomes. Our framework identifies a range of criteria and design principles for environmental taxes to be effective. 136. In the short term, there are opportunities to better use environmental taxes to price negative environmental externalities. Areas for improvement include the Waste Disposal Levy, the ETS and congestion charging. Further out, there could be benefits from greater use of tax instruments to address challenges in both water pollution and water abstraction. 137. The Group recommends reviewing a number of existing industry-specific tax provisions and the introduction of targeted new concessions to ensure the tax system is supporting and not harming natural capital. 138. The Group recommends the Government strengthen its capability to use tax for promoting positive environmental and ecological outcomes. 139. The Group recommends the Government commission incidence studies to better understand who will incur the costs of new environmental taxes and to design appropriate mitigation measures. 140. In the medium term, environmental tax revenue should be used to help fund a transition to a more sustainable, circular economy. 141. In the longer term, environmental taxes could extend New Zealand’s tax base in a regenerative economy. This could be enabled by the consideration and design of innovative new tools like an environmental footprint tax or a natural capital enhancement tax. 142. This chapter identifies opportunities for using tax to achieve positive environmental and ecological outcomes. Further work is needed to rigorously assess how taxes can complement other environmental policy measures and to work through the design principles identified in this chapter. 55 Future of Tax Recommendations 5 Extending the taxation of capital gains 1. Over the past year, the Group has assessed the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. Through this work, the Group has come to the view that there are good grounds to consider an extension of capital gains taxation. 2. It is difficult, however, to make a recommendation about these matters in the abstract. This is because the extent to which the costs and benefits of extending the taxation of capital gains are realised in a New Zealand context will depend heavily on detailed design choices. It is therefore necessary to develop a concrete, worked-up set of options that can be assessed against each other. 3. In the Interim Report, the Group presented two broad options for dealing with these issues: • an extension of capital gains taxation (through the taxation of gains on assets that are not already taxed), and • the taxation of deemed returns from certain assets. 4. The Group’s preferred option for detailed consideration is an extension of capital gains taxation. Since the publication of the Interim Report, the Group has fleshed out the design of a potential system for taxing capital gains. This chapter sets out the main features of that system, along with an assessment of its potential impacts. 5. It is worth emphasising at the outset that these are very much matters of judgement. None of the issues around capital gains are simple and reasonable people can disagree about the best way to deal with them. 6. On balance, the majority of the Group recommends a broad extension of capital gains taxation. Three members of the Group do not recommend this and prefer the incremental approach of carefully extending the tax base over time, which they consider has served New Zealand well over many years of tax reform. This chapter sets out the main issues considered by the Group in reaching these respective views. A system for taxing capital gains 7. This section briefly summarises the main features of a potential system for taxing capital gains. The Group has developed this system to allow for more detailed considerations of the advantages and disadvantages of extending capital gains taxation. 8. In broad terms, the system involves a realisation- based tax that is applied to gains on a broad range of assets. The gains would be taxed at full rates, with no discount and no allowance for inflation. Volume II provides a fuller description of the design features developed by the Group to underpin this system. 56 Future of Tax Recommendations What to tax A broad coverage of assets 9. The Group has taken a broad approach to the coverage of assets, to minimise differences in the tax treatment of different types of assets. The system would include gains from all types of land and improvements (except for the family home), as well as gains from shares, intangible property and business assets. The system would not include personal-use assets (such as cars, boats or other household durables). 10. The Group considers that some types of transactions relating to collectively owned Māori assets merit specific treatment in light of their distinct context. The Group recommends that the Government engages further with Māori to determine the most appropriate treatment of these types of transactions. 11. The system would use a defined list of ‘included assets’ to avoid the difficulties experienced by other countries, where unintended gains or losses have been brought into the tax base as a result of extending tax to all capital gains. Gains after ‘Valuation Day’ 12. The system would only tax the gains and losses that arise after the implementation date (referred to subsequently as ‘Valuation Day’). This approach would require taxpayers to establish a market price for each included asset as at Valuation Day. This market price would represent the new ‘cost base’ against which future gains and losses would be measured. 13. The Group is not proposing that all assets need to be valued by valuers on Valuation Day, as this would impose an unmanageable burden on valuers. Instead, taxpayers should have five years from Valuation Day (or to the time 22 Lock-in describes a situation where an investor is unwilling or unable to dispose of an asset because of the tax liability that will crystallise when the asset is disposed of. The investor is thus locked into ownership of the asset, even if they would otherwise prefer to sell and another owner could make more productive use of the asset. 23 Under straight-line apportionment, an asset owner would determine the total gain on sale that had been made since they acquired the asset and then use a pro rata rule to assign a portion of that gain to the period after Valuation Day. of sale if that is earlier) to determine a value for their included assets as at Valuation Day. If no valuation is determined, then a default rule should apply. This is considered in further detail in Chapter 5 Transitional rules of Volume II. 14. There are strong reasons to adopt a Valuation Day approach, since it would bring all assets into the tax base as soon as possible. The alternative approach – limiting the application of the tax to assets acquired after the date of introduction – would magnify lock-in effects, reduce the revenue raised by the tax and create an unfair distinction between people who bought assets before and after the introduction of the tax. 22 It might also require complex assessments to determine whether any changes to non-included assets would make those assets subject to the tax. 15. The Group acknowledges that there are differences in the ease of valuation, depending on the type of asset. 16. For land and improvements, the valuation options could include rating valuations or comparisons with other properties (for example, using a commonly available algorithm, such as QV valuation). Alternative valuation approaches could be used for other types of assets that are more difficult to value, such as the straight-line apportionment method. 23 17. The Group encourages the Government and Inland Revenue to develop tools and guidance to further assist taxpayers through the Valuation Day process. In accordance with good administrative practice, the valuation process would need to strike a balance between achieving accurate valuations and imposing reasonable compliance costs on taxpayers. Taxpayers should also have the right to obtain a professional valuation and lodge it with Inland Revenue if that is a cost they are willing to bear. 57 Future of Tax Recommendations When to tax A realisation-based tax 18. The tax would be imposed on a realisation basis in most cases. Imposing tax on realisation would ensure that the amount of the gain had been finally determined and – at least in most cases – that the person subject to the tax had the funds to pay it. Realisation is also the basis on which revenue account property is taxed under the current rules. Volume II provides examples of the situations that would count as ‘realisation events’. 19. The existing rules would continue to apply to foreign shares that are currently taxed under the fair dividend rate (FDR) method of taxation, as well as anything taxed under the financial arrangement rules. Rollover treatment in certain circumstances 20. Rollover treatment provides a deferral from taxation in certain situations. Rollover treatment does not mean that a gain or loss is never taxed. Instead, taxation is deferred until a later realisation event occurs that does not qualify for rollover. Rollover relief is a feature of all regimes involving capital gains taxation but the extent of relief varies markedly across jurisdictions. 21. Rollover relief can mitigate the distortionary impacts or perceived unfairness of a realisation- based tax. Yet rollover treatment reduces the revenue potential of the tax and is a source of much of the complexity in capital gains taxes in other countries. 22. The Group considers that decisions on rollover should be guided by two broad principles: • A case for rollover treatment may arise when there is a realisation but no change in the substance of ownership. One example of this is a transfer of relationship property, where the change in legal ownership merely reflects the fact that the recipient partner always had an equivalent interest in the property. • A case for rollover treatment may also arise when there is a legal change in ownership but the transaction does not create a gain that has ‘come home’ to the vendor. One example of this is a case where land is compulsorily acquired for public works and the landowner uses the proceeds to acquire other land as a replacement. This situation can be contrasted with a voluntary sale to an unrelated party, where the vendor has willingly converted gains on certain assets into funds to use at their discretion (including for consumption) – in which case a clear gain has ‘come home’. 23. Volume II outlines the Group’s full recommendations on rollover treatment. Rollover treatment is predominantly limited to certain life events (such as death and relationship separations), business reorganisations and small business reinvestment. How to tax Consistent treatment with other forms of income 24. The Group has applied a principle that, as a form of economic income, capital gains should be taxed within the current income tax system. This means that any gains would be taxed at a person’s marginal tax rate. There would be no discount for capital gains and, consistent with the approach taken elsewhere in the tax system, there would be no adjustment for inflation. 25. The Group acknowledges that some submitters called for the application of reduced rates to gains. Reduced rates would increase complexity and compliance costs. Reduced rates would also limit the extent to which the tax improves the horizontal and vertical equity of the tax system. In any case, relative to an accruals-based tax, a realisation-based tax would already confer a significant deferral advantage on asset owners, which would offset the impact of inflation. There is not an obvious case to provide further favourable treatment beyond that. 58 Future of Tax Recommendations 26. The Group considered whether any adjustment is needed to address the ‘bunching effect’, where taxpayers are pushed into higher tax brackets as a result of realising a capital gain. The Group has decided that no adjustment should be made to compensate for this effect. Compared with other countries, New Zealand has a relatively flat tax scale, with the highest tax rate applying where a person earns more than $70,000. Therefore, the Group does not consider that an adjustment is necessary. 27. In addition, there is likely to be no need for special rules for applying provisional tax to a capital gain earned during an income year. Taxpayers can manage volatility in their taxable income caused by capital gains and losses through existing options, such as tax pooling or the use of the different provisional tax calculation methods. 28. Expenditure incurred in acquiring an asset would be deductible at time of sale and costs incurred on improvements would be deductible from sale proceeds. Current law would be used to identify the costs of acquiring or improving an asset. Treatment of losses 29. If capital gains are taxed in the same way as any other income, then capital losses should be treated in the same way as other tax losses. Taxpayers would generally be able to offset losses arising from the disposal of capital assets against ordinary taxable income (and not just against capital gains). 30. The ability to deduct capital losses from ordinary taxable income comes with some risks and would require careful monitoring by the Government. The Group is also concerned about integrity risks in certain situations where taxpayers have greater scope to bring forward losses and defer or exempt the tax on their gains. 31. Rollover treatment, particularly for realisation events within a taxpayer’s control, creates opportunities for taxpayers to ‘cherry pick’ by deferring gains and realising losses. Loss ring- fencing rules reduce this risk by only allowing losses from the sale of an asset to be offset against gains from the same or similar asset class. Therefore, the greater the extent of rollover treatment, the more loss ring-fencing is required. 32. In light of these considerations, the Group recommends that ring-fencing apply to portfolio investments in listed shares (other than when they are trading stock) and associated party transactions. 33. There is also a transitional issue associated with assets that enter the tax base on Valuation Day. As only gains and losses after Valuation Day would be taxed, the cost base of these assets would be set by a valuation rather than an arm’s-length market price. To ease compliance costs on taxpayers, the Group has proposed that taxpayers should be able to choose from a variety of different valuation options. Some taxpayers might choose the highest valuation possible and not necessarily the most reliable. 34. The Group therefore recommends that losses from Valuation Day assets be ring-fenced against gains from other capital assets. The implication of this is that there would be extensive ring-fencing for some time. Assets purchased from a third party after Valuation Day would not generally be ring-fenced. Other matters 35. Volume II sets out further details of the system, including the treatment of KiwiSaver and other investment funds, tax on international investment and issues associated with taxing gains in companies. 59 Future of Tax Recommendations The deemed return method 36. While the deemed return method is not the Group’s preferred method for dealing with the issue of capital gains, the Group has considered further how such a tax might be designed. This section sketches out the key features of the deemed return method. Key features 37. The Group considers that if the deemed return method were to apply then the asset best suited to the method is residential rental investment property. The deemed return tax would replace existing taxation on any rental income and would involve a simple calculation to determine the investor’s tax obligations: Equity value at the beginning of year x Deemed rate of return x Investor’s tax rate Example: Residential rental investment property Tina owns a residential rental investment property worth $1,000,000 at the beginning of the income year. The property is funded with $300,000 of debt, implying equity of $700,000. Tina is on the top marginal tax rate. The deemed rate of return is 3.5%. Tina would owe tax for the year of $8,085 (i.e. $700,000 x 3.5% x 33%). There would be no tax on any rent Tina earns from that property. Treatment of second homes 38. The deemed return tax would not apply to second homes that are rented out for some parts of the year. For second homes, any rental income arising from the home would be taxed under existing income tax rules but there would be no deductions for any expenses. Any capital gains on second homes would be taxed on realisation. 39. There would be boundary questions about whether a property is a rental property or a second house but there are boundary questions throughout the tax system and these can be resolved. Treatment of speculative gains 40. Deemed return taxation would work well for most rental properties but some mechanism like the bright-line rule may be needed to tax speculative short-term realised gains. In that case, any deemed return tax paid up until that point could be credited against the tax on realised gains. Revenue impacts 41. Using illustrative rates for the deemed return of 1.7% and 3.5%, projections by the Secretariat for the Tax Working Group show a substantial increase in revenue from residential rental investment properties, relative to the status quo. Table 5.1: Additional revenue from deemed return taxation on residential rental investment properties ($ million)2021/222022/232023/242024/252025/262026/272027/282028/292029/302030/31 3.5% rate9981,0151,1481,2411,3431,4441,5551,6651,7941,922 1.7% rate148105188230263304354394443501 Note: 1.7% is an illustrative rate for two-year Government bonds – a proxy for the risk-free rate. 3.5% is an illustrative rate for two-year bank deposits, which are also very low risk. Revenue estimates are relative to the status quo, which incorporates tax revenue from rental income, tax arising from the bright-line test and additional revenue from ring-fencing residential rental losses. Revenue estimates are preliminary and indicative. 60 Future of Tax Recommendations Policy insights 42. The substantial additional revenue projected from deemed return taxation (relative to the status quo) indicates that residential rental investment properties are significantly undertaxed. 24 This accords with recent experience, where total returns on residential rental investment properties (including capital gains) have been well above returns for tax purposes. The increase in forecast revenue reflects the fact that the current approach to taxing rental income does not come close to taxing the expected total income from residential rental investment properties when capital gains are included. 43. The Group’s preferred option for detailed consideration is an extension of capital gains taxation. The following section outlines the Group’s assessment of this option. A policy assessment of the system for taxing capital gains 44. In deciding whether to recommend an extension of capital gains taxation, the Group has needed to come to a broad overall judgement: In broad terms, will the fairness, integrity, revenue and efficiency benefits from reform outweigh the administrative complexity, compliance costs and efficiency costs arising from the extension of capital gains taxation? 45. The following sections work through the potential impacts of the Group’s preferred design for taxing capital gains and then set out the final judgements reached by the Group. Equity and fairness impacts 46. Equity and fairness concerns provide the strongest rationale for contemplating an extension of capital gains taxation. A broad 24 Revenue forecasts are over current projected revenue from residential rental income, tax arising from the bright-line test and additional revenue from ring-fencing residential rental losses. extension to taxing capital gains would improve the fairness of the tax system by reducing inconsistency in the treatment of income, no matter how it is earned. It would also increase the progressivity of the tax system. 47. In forming this overall judgement, however, the Group acknowledges that a number of new inconsistencies would arise from various aspects of the design (such as the exclusion of the family home, which was required by the Terms of Reference). Distributional impacts 48. The individual impact of extending capital gains taxation will depend on each person’s specific circumstances and will vary over time. International experience indicates, however, that capital gains taxes are highly progressive and primarily affect the wealthiest members of society. Burman and White (2003) provide one summary of the international evidence: In Canada, 1 percent of returns accounted for 60 percent of capital gains in 1997. In the United States, the richest 0.4 percent of returns accounted for nearly 60 percent of capital gains in 1998. In the United Kingdom, less than 0.1 percent of returns accounted for 60 percent of reported capital gains in 1997-1998 and paid more than 75 percent of all capital gains taxes. Capital gains are an important source of income for the wealthy but much less so for the middle class. Over a ten-year period, capital gains accounted for almost 40 percent of the income of the richest 1 percent of taxpayers in the United States. By comparison, they made up only 5 percent of income for all non-elderly taxpayers and 14 percent of income for all those over age 64. A similar study in Canada found that, in 1987, capital gains averaged nearly 25 percent of income for the top 0.8 percent of taxpayers, compared with only about 1 percent for the bottom 75 percent. 61 Future of Tax Recommendations 49. In the absence of any capital gains data for New Zealand households, it is not possible to provide precise estimates of the distributional impact of extending capital gains taxation in New Zealand. However, one way of assessing the distributional impacts of capital gains taxation is to explore the ownership of the assets that would potentially be subject to the tax. 50. The ownership of these assets is skewed towards the wealthiest deciles. Figure 5.1 shows the distribution of household assets (excluding cash, deposits and owner-occupied housing) by household taxable income and household net worth deciles. 36% of these assets are owned by the top taxable income decile (using equivalised household income) while 70% of these assets are owned by the top net worth decile (using unequivalised total household net worth). This indicates the potential distributional impact of capital gains taxation (and is subject to the caveat that the data used to construct the income deciles does not include income from capital gains). 51. It is possible to derive a rough estimate of the distributional impact of extending capital gains taxation from the available data on household assets and the projected revenue from taxing capital gains. The total capital gains tax liability can be distributed between deciles based on their share of the assets that could attract capital gains taxation. 52. Extending the taxation of capital gains is likely to be highly progressive with respect to net worth deciles. Figure 5.2 below shows the potential distribution of the average annual capital gains tax payment, when expressed as a percentage of disposable income (excluding capital gains) by household net worth decile. This illustrative scenario suggests that, on average, households with higher net worth would pay a higher amount in tax as a percentage of disposable income than lower net-worth households. Figure 5.1: Share of household assets that could be subject to capital gains taxation, by taxable income and net worth decile (2014/15) 4% 3% 3% 6% 6% 12% 6% 10% 14% 36% 0% 0% 1% 1% 2% 2% 4% 7% 12% 70% Decile 1Decile 2Decile 3Decile 4Decile 5Decile 6Decile 7Decile 8Decile 9Decile 10 Share of assets by equivalised household taxable income decile Share of assets by total household net worth decile Note: Data corresponds to figure 3.4. Source: Stats NZ (Household Economic Survey 2015), the Treasury 62 Future of Tax Recommendations 53. This analysis is limited by focusing on the legislative incidence of the policy. The actual distributional impact of extending the taxation of capital gains will depend on who bears the economic incidence of the tax and dynamic effects of the policy. 54. This analysis is also based on data from a single point in time and does not reflect the lifetime incidence of taxation. This is a significant limitation, because there is a strong age pattern to saving and hence to wealth. The housing market impacts of capital gains taxation 55. One key aspect of the economic incidence of the tax relates to its impact on the housing market. An assessment of these impacts is complicated by the fact that the tax would apply to residential property investments but not to owner-occupied housing. 25 In a highly constrained housing market, landlords are likely to have significant pricing power and will already be pricing rents at what the market will bear. If landlords attempted to pass on the tax to tenants in higher rents, demand for rental property would be likely to fall: an increased number of tenants will find home ownership more affordable than renting. 56. Theory suggests that extending capital gains taxation would increase the ratio of rents to house prices owing to rents increasing, house prices falling or a combination of both. However, the supply of housing in New Zealand is very constrained. In a constrained market, where housing supply is unresponsive to changes in demand, theory suggests that extending capital gains taxation will have less of an impact on rents than would otherwise be the case and more of an effect in moderating prices. 25 57. The Group has reviewed the results of two theoretical models to better understand the potential range of housing market impacts. These models both estimate an increase in rents relative to house prices – but generate inconsistent estimates for the effects on house prices. Figure 5.2: Estimated annual average capital gains tax payment as percentage of disposable income, by net worth decile 0.1% 0.1% 0.2% 0.3% 0.4% 0.5% 0.8% 1.4% 1.9% 7.7% Decile 1Decile 2Decile 3Decile 4Decile 5Decile 6Decile 7Decile 8Decile 9Decile 10 Household net worth decile Note: These estimates are based on the share of total household net worth that could be subject to capital gains taxation by household net worth decile (see figure 5.1) and projected revenue from the taxation of capital gains (see figure 5.3). Estimates for revenue from capital gains taxation are for the fifth year after introduction, discounted to 2021-22 tax year when the extension of capital gains tax is assumed to take effect. See Appendix A Assumptions in projected revenue for extending the taxation of capital gains. Estimates are preliminary and indicative. Source: Stats NZ (Household Economic Survey 2015), the Treasury 63 Future of Tax Recommendations 58. There are some important caveats to this modelling. Models used in New Zealand tend to ignore (or provide a simplified treatment of) the impact of risk and uncertainty. The models reviewed by the Group assume that current tax parameters, interest rates, inflation and future returns on housing are all known and are certain to continue into the future. These are all strong assumptions. 59. In any case, empirical data suggests that other changes in the market are likely to swamp any effects from tax changes. The Group has explored the impacts of similar tax changes on housing markets in other countries (including Canada, Australia and South Africa). The Group has not observed significant increases in rents relative to prices in those countries – to the contrary, rents actually fell relative to prices. While there are only a small number of examples to observe, there is no evidence of a general rise in rents or a fall in prices following the implementation of capital gains taxes. 60. On balance, the Group expects that an extension of capital gains taxation would lead to some small upward pressure on rents and downward pressure on house prices. These impacts are likely to be small in relation to the impacts of more fundamental housing policy initiatives, such as the Government’s KiwiBuild programme. Integrity impacts 61. Extending the taxation of capital gains would support the integrity of the tax system by reducing opportunities for tax planning and tax avoidance. In particular, it would reduce the incentive to classify assets on capital account in order to realise non-taxable gains. It should also ensure that income earned in companies – which is made available to shareholders for their personal use – is ultimately taxed at the personal tax rate. However, the Group recognises that another option for dealing with some of these issues in companies could be through the use of targeted anti-avoidance rules. 62. To ensure the effectiveness of an extension of capital gains taxation, there would be a need for new anti-avoidance rules to buttress the system, along with active monitoring and enforcement of avoidance activity by Inland Revenue. 63. The Group also notes that mandatory consolidation rules became necessary in Australia to ensure tax base integrity. The Government would need to consider equivalent rules in New Zealand. These rules would generate complexity and increase compliance costs. 64. Chapter 9 Other opportunities to improve the tax system outlines the Group’s full set of recommendations to improve the integrity of the tax system. Revenue impacts Base broadening and fiscal sustainability 65. Extending capital gains taxation would broaden the tax base. It would also help to safeguard the Government’s future revenue collection ability – particularly if the capital intensity of the economy increases as a result of technological change and/or demographic change. The additional revenue could be used to increase the Government’s flexibility for dealing with future challenges or pay for other revenue-reducing reforms. Future flexibility 66. At present, the gap between the company rate and the top personal rate is small but there are still integrity problems with people using company structures and tax-free gains to lower their effective tax rates. This creates a strong imperative to maintain as much alignment as possible between the company rate and the top personal rate. 64 Future of Tax Recommendations 67. Extending capital gains taxation, on the other hand, would allow the tax system to sustain a larger divergence between the company rate and the top personal rate – giving future governments greater flexibility in their choices about the levels of company and personal income taxation (subject to consideration of any efficiency, compliance and administration costs). 26 Revenue estimates 68. The Secretariat for the Tax Working Group has modelled the revenue impact of extending the taxation of capital gains. These revenue projections are subject to considerable uncertainty because they depend heavily on assumptions (including future movements in asset prices). The assumptions underlying these projections are provided in Appendix A. 26 Currently, a shareholder earning income through a company can avoid paying the ‘top up tax’ (where they must pay the difference between the 28% company rate and their personal 30% or 33% rate) if a company does not distribute its income as a dividend, and a shareholder sells shares in that company for a capital gain. 69. Revenue is projected to be small relative to GDP and total tax revenue. In the first ten years of implementation, an extension of capital gains taxation is projected to generate revenue of approximately 0.2% – 1.2% of GDP each year. Revenue should generally increase over time but the profile of the revenue will be volatile, because it will depend on movements in asset prices. The fiscal implications of this revenue volatility are discussed further below. Over the long term, revenue is projected to end up fluctuating around approximately 1.2% of GDP. 70. Extending capital gains taxation is projected to generate between 1% and 4% of total yearly tax revenue in the first ten years. Figure 5.4 illustrates the fiscal impact.

Estimates are preliminary and indicative. Source: Secretariat for the Tax Working Group 27 The revenue generated by the Australian capital gains tax was affected significantly by the policy decision to ‘grandparent’ assets owned at the time of the introduction of the tax. Revenue volatility 71. The actual revenue from an extension of capital gains taxation is expected to be volatile because of its dependence on asset price movements. As figure 5.5 illustrates, the experience in Australia suggests that there can be significant peaks and troughs in capital gains revenue. 27 72. Revenue from the taxation of capital gains will tend to increase during economic upswings and decrease during economic downswings. This will occur ‘automatically’ as the level of tax revenue collected will depend on the size of capital gains, which tend to rise and fall with the economic cycle. Extending the taxation of capital gains would thus serve as an ‘automatic stabiliser.’ Automatic stabilisers dampen fluctuations in economic activity and smooth the edges of the business cycle by reducing the amount of tax that households pay when the economy is in a downswing (and increasing tax paid in an economic upswing). 73. There are benefits to New Zealand having automatic stabilisers, particularly if there continues to be less scope for monetary policy to act in such a role. However, the effectiveness of extending the taxation of capital gains as an automatic stabiliser is uncertain. The impact on dampening economic fluctuations will partly depend on how household spending responds to changes to the taxation of capital gains. The effect may be weak to the extent that the tax is mostly borne by high-income households, which have a lower propensity to alter their spending in response to marginal changes in net income. 74. Greater revenue volatility will also require disciplined fiscal management, so that future governments do not lock themselves into permanent spending commitments on the basis of temporary peaks in capital gains revenue. 66 Future of Tax Recommendations Figure 5.4: Fiscal impact of extending the taxation of capital gains 20% 22% 24% 26% 28% 30% 32% 34% 19941996199820002002200420062008201020122014201620182020202220242026202820302032 Core Crown tax revenue as % of GDP BaselineWith broad extension of capital gains taxation Projections Introduction of tax change (April 2021) Note: The projection of revenue from extending the taxation of capital gains is preliminary and indicative.

Extending the taxation of capital gains would have multiple impacts on productivity. Broadly, there are two competing influences: • positive impacts arising from improvements to the allocation of investment across the economy, and • negative impacts arising from a higher level of capital taxation, an increase in compliance costs and the effect of lock-in on investment decisions. 76. It is difficult to estimate which of these influences would dominate. New Zealand has a known low productivity problem. However, international agencies – including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the OECD – have concluded that extending the taxation of capital gains would generate net benefits for New Zealand. 77. The following sections examine each of the productivity impacts in turn. The allocation of investment 78. There can be valid public policy reasons for the Government to influence investment decisions through the tax system. For example, Chapter 4 Environmental and ecological outcomes outlined a number of ways in which the tax system could be used positively to support a transition to a more sustainable pattern of economic activity. 79. In the absence of a broader public policy rationale, however, the tax system generally strives to achieve ‘neutrality’ in the treatment of different types of investments. A neutral tax system – which does not favour one type of investment over another – reduces the incentive for firms to make investments solely for tax reasons. 80. As discussed in Chapter 3 The structure, fairness and balance of the tax system, the current treatment of capital gains gives rise to a significant ‘non-neutrality’ in the tax system. This is because the inconsistent taxation of capital gains reduces the tax obligations of some sectors and industries relative to others. 81. The current treatment of capital gains may reduce productivity to the extent that it distorts investment into less productive – but tax- favoured – sectors and industries. A more comprehensive approach to taxing capital gains would enhance productivity by greatly reducing this distortion. The IMF (2017) finds that greater neutrality in the tax treatment of investment can ‘chip away’ at the problem of resource misallocation and enhance productivity across the economy. 82. The Group acknowledges that some aspects of the design – such as rollover treatment and loss ring-fencing – would generate new distortions. Higher capital taxation 83. An extension of capital gains taxation is, effectively, an increase in the taxation of savings and investment. In economic theory, this type of ‘capital taxation’ is generally expected to have a negative impact on levels of investment in the economy. 84. By itself, this effect may reduce productivity. Yet the additional taxation would generate a new stream of revenue. It is not possible to form a judgement about the overall impacts on productivity without considering how the additional revenue would be spent. 85. Most business investment takes place through companies. Extending the taxation of capital gains would influence company investment in two main ways: by taxing gains from the assets owned by companies and by taxing gains on shares in the company. 68 Future of Tax Recommendations 86. Additional taxes on investment at the company level could reduce business investment to the extent that a company’s profits come from capital gains. The impact of taxing gains of its shareholders, however, would depend on the extent of the company’s access to international capital markets. • For New Zealand companies with significant foreign shareholdings, the cost of capital is largely influenced by the demands of foreign shareholders. Under current double taxation agreements with other countries, it is not generally possible to tax foreign shareholders on the gains from their shares. 28 An extension of capital gains taxation in New Zealand would thus have little effect on foreign shareholders and is unlikely to increase the cost of capital by very much for companies with substantial access to international capital markets. • Most small-to-medium enterprises, however, cannot readily access international capital markets. Instead, they depend on funding from domestic investors to make additional investments. Taxing domestic investors on the gains from their shares would increase the cost of equity capital for these types of companies and could reduce investment. 87. Complex rules would be required to counter double deductions in corporate groups. There is also a prospect of double taxation for shareholders. Double taxation would impose a tax penalty on New Zealanders owning shares in New Zealand companies relative to investment in foreign shares (which would continue to be taxed under the fair dividend rate method). 88. An extension of capital gains taxation would require a redesign of the rules that apply to KiwiSaver and portfolio investment entities (PIEs). The current rules offer a relatively consistent tax treatment of investors, irrespective of the entity through which investments are made. Any inconsistencies arising from the new rules risk damage to New Zealand’s capital markets. The Group recommends further consultation to ensure that the final rules do not create a bias in favour of investment in foreign shares. 28 One exception is that gains in the value of shares in land-rich companies may sometimes be taxed. Lock-in 89. Any realisation-based taxation of capital gains would create some degree of lock-in but the exact impacts are difficult to quantify. Lock-in may encourage some investors to take a longer-term perspective to their investment decisions but it could also deter others from investing into new classes of assets. 90. The extent of lock-in would be particularly influenced by design choices regarding rollover treatment. More generous rollover treatment would reduce lock-in in the short term but could increase lock-in in the long term, as untaxed gains accumulate in those assets. A greater use of rollover treatment would also increase compliance costs, increase distortions and reduce revenue. Compliance and administration costs 91. An extension of capital gains taxation would increase compliance and administration costs. For taxpayers, there would be two types of compliance costs: one-off costs associated with the introduction of the tax and ongoing compliance costs. One-off compliance costs 92. Major one-off compliance costs would arise as a consequence of taking a Valuation Day approach to the introduction of the tax. The Group has sought to reduce the compliance costs associated with Valuation Day in a number of ways – such as allowing taxpayers up to five years to obtain a valuation for their assets and encouraging Inland Revenue to develop low-cost and easy-to-access options to help taxpayers comply with their obligations. Ongoing compliance costs 93. The ongoing compliance costs would mostly relate to valuation, record-keeping and compliance with complicated rules (such as rules for rollover treatment or integrity rules to prevent double deductions). 69 Future of Tax Recommendations 94. Valuation issues would arise when certain assets are transferred between associated parties or when certain assets move in or out of the tax base. As with Valuation Day, the Group encourages Inland Revenue to develop low-cost options for valuation that are sufficiently robust to maintain the integrity of the tax system. 95. In terms of record-keeping, the Group recommends that information on the cost base of assets (including additions made that year to the cost base, as well as when an asset has been rolled over) be filed on a contemporaneous basis. This may increase short-term compliance costs but should also reduce the number of disputes when the asset is finally disposed of or sold. 96. Other costs may arise if the Government imposes information reporting requirements or withholding taxes. The Government should consult on whether there is a need for such requirements – and, if so, how widely to impose them. Compliance cost estimates 97. There have been few studies of the overall compliance costs of capital gains taxes in other countries. The Group has reviewed studies on the compliance costs generated by capital gains taxes in Australia and the United Kingdom. 98. In Australia, the capital gains tax affects relatively few taxpayers each year, so it has lower annual average compliance costs for businesses compared to other types of taxes. However, the set of taxpayers that are affected by Australia’s capital gains tax face high costs, and compliance costs are high relative to the revenue raised by the tax. 99. Tables 5.3 and 5.4 illustrate the average costs – in terms of both time and money – imposed on businesses by the Australian capital gains tax regime. 100. Although this research suggests that average compliance costs across the economy are small, anecdotal evidence from Australia indicates that taxpayers can face very high compliance costs at certain moments in time. 101. According to Australian practitioners contacted by the Group, some of the key sources of compliance costs are valuation (particularly for intangible property or when a valuation is disputed by the Australian Taxation Office), record-keeping, rollover, small business concessions and other exceptions. 102. One example of this type of cost is the need for large corporates undergoing business reorganisation to obtain a ruling from the Australian Tax Office that the reorganisation qualifies for rollover treatment. 103. Many of the compliance costs arise from the rules that are necessary to buttress the integrity of the tax. These include the rules for preventing double deductions (outside of consolidated groups) and the qualifying criteria for small business concessions (which have been subject to frequent law changes). Overall impacts on efficiency and productivity 104. Extending capital gains taxation is likely to reduce the tax bias on investment decisions but the Group acknowledges that it would also generate an important set of efficiency costs. It may be possible to mitigate these costs by using some of the additional revenue to fund productivity-enhancing reform elsewhere in the tax system. Chapter 6 The taxation of business and savings outlines a range of options for boosting business productivity. A summary of the advantages and disadvantages 105. The Group’s analysis of capital gains taxation has covered a wide range of dimensions. Table 5.5 summarises the main advantages and disadvantages covered by the Group’s analysis. 70 Future of Tax Recommendations Table 5.3: Average hours spent per year by small- and medium-sized businesses on tax compliance Size of business by turnover Capital gains tax Income tax (excluding capital gains tax)GSTAll taxes Up to AU$75,0000.415.815.737.5 AU$75,000 to $2 million2.63566.6143.6 AU$2 million to $50 million12.455.4148.5482.2 Average for all businesses up to $50 million of sales43369185 Source: Evans, Lignier and Tran-Nam (2014) Table 5.4: Large corporations’ total tax compliance costs (percent of total) Type of cost for large corporation Capital gains tax Income tax (excluding capital gains tax)GST Fringe benefit tax External tax advisor costs (% of total cost)2.1%66.4%9%5.3% Internal staff time spent on tax activities (% of total time)2.6%52.9%15.9%11.7% Source: Evans, Lignier and Tran-Nam (2016) Table 5.5: The advantages and disadvantages of extending capital gains taxation ImpactsAdvantagesDisadvantages Revenue• Enhances fiscal sustainability by broadening the tax base. • Enhances flexibility of tax system by allowing for greater future divergence between company rate and top personal income rate. • Source of revenue for additional public services and/or tax reform. • Volatile source of revenue.

Over the past year, the Group has built a good understanding of the rules needed to impose a system for taxing capital gains and the trade- offs involved. It is clear, though, that these are very much matters of judgement. None of the issues around capital gains are simple and reasonable people can disagree about the best way to deal with them. 107. All the members of the Group agree that there should be an extension of the taxation of capital gains from residential rental investment properties. This sector is undertaxed when only rental income is in the tax base. Moreover, rents are low relative to house prices (particularly in areas where land prices have been rapidly increasing). This suggests that investors have been investing with the expectation of capital gains, which are generally untaxed. 108. Eight members of the Group support the introduction of a broad approach for taxing capital gains, in accordance with the system outlined in this chapter and detailed in Volume II. In reaching this judgement, the majority accepts that extending capital gains taxation would involve an increase in compliance and efficiency costs but judges that these costs would be outweighed by reductions in investment biases, as well as improvements to the fairness, integrity and fiscal sustainability of the tax system. Moreover, some of these costs could be offset by other measures within a package of tax reform. 109. Three members of the Group have reached a different judgement. These members prefer the incremental approach of extending the tax base carefully over time, which they consider has served New Zealand well over many years of tax reform. In their judgement, the revenue benefits, perceptions of fairness and possible integrity benefits would be outweighed by adverse efficiency impacts, increased compliance and administration costs, and fiscal risk. Choices and options 110. The Government does not face a binary choice regarding whether or not to extend capital gains taxation. There is a spectrum of choices for the coverage of assets, and the inclusion of each asset class comes with its own costs and benefits. 111. At one end of the spectrum, there is a clear case to include residential rental investment properties (by taxing either the realised gains or deemed returns from those assets). In the middle of the spectrum, there are listed shares, land-based businesses and commercial property. At the other end of the spectrum, there is greater complexity regarding the treatment of corporate groups, unlisted shares and business goodwill. 112. For this reason, the Government could choose to extend the taxation of capital gains to some asset classes only. The Government also has options around how to stage the timing of introduction, whether to phase in the inclusion of asset classes, whether to grandparent some or all asset classes or whether to apply the deemed return method. 113. If the Government decides not to extend capital gains taxation to all asset classes, Inland Revenue must have sufficient resources and capability to fully enforce the existing capital/ revenue boundary. This includes the taking of test cases (to ensure that revenue gains cannot be reclassified as capital gains) as well as policy and investigative attention to existing areas of concern. 72 Future of Tax Recommendations The importance of effective implementation 114. Regardless of their position on the merits of capital gains taxation, all members agree that the introduction of a system for taxing capital gains would be a significant endeavour requiring the full attention of the Government. 115. If the Government decides to proceed, it is crucial that Inland Revenue is fully resourced and has the capability to develop and implement the new tax. The policy and legislative processes must include thorough consultation with a diverse range of voices, using both formal and informal channels. It will be particularly important to identify further options for reducing the compliance costs of the new tax. 116. The Group also notes that the Government’s stated timeframes for implementing tax reform will be challenging. The Government will need to ensure additional resources are available for implementation if these timeframes are to be achieved. 117. Nevertheless, while introducing a system for taxing capital gains is a significant task, it would also open up new opportunities for broader reform of the tax system or for investment into public services. The following chapters outline a range of options for tax reform that could be unlocked by the additional revenue. 73 Future of Tax Recommendations The taxation of business 1. The Group discussed the taxation of business at some length in the Interim Report. In that report, the Group concluded that the current approach to the taxation of business is largely sound. The Group does not see a case to reduce the company rate or to move away from the imputation system. The tax rate for Māori authorities also remains appropriate (although the rate should be extended to the subsidiaries of Māori authorities). 2. The Group also considered in the Interim Report whether there is a case to introduce a progressive company tax (i.e. a lower company rate for small businesses). The Group found that progressive taxation is already possible through the use of look-through company structures. Beyond this, the Group judged that the efficiency costs and integrity risks associated with a progressive company tax would outweigh any benefits in terms of faster small-business growth. 3. However, the Group has identified a number of areas where tax reform could support the productive economy, boost investment and reduce compliance costs. Supporting the productive economy 4. The Group has considered two measures that could help to boost the productive sector of the economy: changes to the loss-continuity rules and changes to the treatment of ‘black-hole’ expenditure. 29 Alternatively, the losses can be used to offset the taxable income of other ‘commonly owned’ companies (i.e. companies in which at least 66% of shareholders are the same as in another company). Loss-continuity rules 5. Losses and income are treated asymmetrically under New Zealand’s company tax system. Companies pay tax when their income is positive but the Government does not provide a refund when income is negative. Instead, losses can be carried forward to offset any tax obligations associated with the future income of the company. 29 6. The loss-continuity rules determine whether losses from a previous year can be used in a future year. Generally, losses may be used to offset future income, unless more than 51% of the company’s shares have changed hands since the losses were incurred. 7. The loss-continuity rules require a balance between efficiency and integrity objectives. Strict rules can reduce efficiency by discouraging risk taking but loose rules may allow companies to reduce their taxable income by trading in losses. 8. The Group considers the existing loss-continuity rules are appropriate for most companies but may not be working well for start-up firms. These firms require equity capital to grow. The capital is often raised over time, through multiple rounds, from differing types of investors. Yet these firms are often inherently loss-making as they grow from an idea to a viable business. The existing loss-continuity rules may be constraining their ability to grow through additional equity capital. 6 The taxation of business and savings 74 Future of Tax Recommendations 9. The Group recommends changes to the loss- continuity rules that would support the growth of innovative start-up firms. Any relaxation of the rules would need to be carefully calibrated to ensure that the change does not facilitate trading in losses among larger firms. The Group does not recommend an extension of loss-continuity rules from one based on shareholding to one based upon a ‘same or similar’ business test, as is the case in Australia. Black-hole expenditure 10. Black-hole expenditure is business expenditure of a capital nature that is not immediately deductible for tax purposes and does not give rise to a depreciable asset and therefore deductible over time. An example of black-hole expenditure arises when a business incurs costs to try and develop an investment in a new asset, process or business model. • If the expenditure results in the acquisition or development of a new asset, the expenditure can be capitalised and depreciated over time. • If, on the other hand, the firm decides along the way not to proceed with the project and no asset is acquired or developed, then the expenditure incurred up to that point may not be deductible and the expenditure is said to have fallen into a ‘black hole’. 11. The current treatment of black-hole expenditure could mean that firms are less likely to take risks on new assets, processes or business models unless they are reasonably certain that the investment will pay off. It therefore discourages the risk taking and innovation that drive productivity growth. 12. The Group therefore recommends that the Government reform the treatment of black-hole expenditure. This would involve: • A new rule to recognise deductions for expenditure that is incurred by businesses and not otherwise dealt with under the Income Tax Act. This rule would also apply if an asset is abandoned, either fully or partially, before its completion. • Where an abandoned asset or project is subsequently restored, any corresponding tax deductions would be clawed back and the taxpayer would capitalise the value of those deductions. The capitalised value of the asset would be deductible via the tax depreciation rules in the Income Tax Act. • Expenditure would be spread over five years. 13. To reduce compliance costs – particularly for small businesses – there would be a safe-harbour threshold of $10,000 to allow upfront deductions for low levels of feasibility expenditure. 14. In the Group’s view, a decision to extend the taxation of capital gains would only strengthen the case to deduct black-hole expenditure. If income is to be taxed on a more comprehensive basis, then it will generally be appropriate to allow a broader range of deductions. Goodwill 15. The cost of acquiring goodwill is not currently deductible. If goodwill becomes taxable at sale under the proposed extension to the taxation of capital gains, or under future targeted tax reforms, then the appropriate timing and quantification of deductions for expenditure on goodwill needs to be determined. 75 Future of Tax Recommendations Boosting investment 16. One of New Zealand’s long-running economic challenges is its low rate of capital investment. The Group has considered a number of ways in which the tax system affects investment, as well as options for supporting investment in nationally significant infrastructure. Building depreciation deductions 17. New Zealand abolished depreciation deductions for buildings in 2010, with effect from the 2011-12 tax year. Data at the time suggested that over a particular time period, the value of some types of building capital had appreciated (even though building structures themselves deteriorate over time). The change was also introduced as part of a package that included a reduction in the company tax rate. 18. The result of this change is that the tax system may now discourage efficient investment in new improvements. This is because there are very high effective tax rates on new building activity in New Zealand. As shown in figure 6.1, New Zealand had the highest effective tax rate for foreign investment into both manufacturing plants and office buildings among OECD countries in 2015 (Hanappi, 2017). 30 Reintroducing building depreciation at illustrative rates of 1% or 2% would move New Zealand closer to the OECD average. 19. The absence of building depreciation deductions does not affect all industries equally. Some industries have a greater reliance on buildings 30 The effect for domestic investors is muted by the role of imputation. Furthermore, these figures only partially capture the effect of the taxation of capital gains in other countries, as although it includes a capital gains tax, it does not assume any real appreciation in the value of the asset. As a result, the higher business tax rate overseas from an expected real appreciation of a given asset is not included in these rates. for their output, and so the abolition of building depreciation deductions has disadvantaged some industries relative to others. 20. Figure 6.2 outlines the relative disadvantage faced by some industries by comparing the value of the non-residential building stock in that industry to a measure of business profits (Gross Operating Surplus). Figure 6.2 shows, for instance, that retail and agriculture are impacted much more than mining or business services. The appropriate rate of depreciation 21. International evidence suggests that large buildings typically depreciate at a rate of 2%- 4% per annum (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2003). However, there are reasons to consider a lower rate. The first is fiscal cost. The second is that inflation will increase the nominal value of sold buildings and end up having a larger effect on longer-lived assets than shorter-lived assets. Further, if more capital gains become taxed, owners may claim tax losses on sale if the depreciation rate is set too low. On balance, a rate of 1% might be appropriate. 22. The Group also notes that the imperative to set the ‘correct’ rate of depreciation will lessen with the taxation of the capital gains, because any difference between tax depreciation and economic depreciation will be reversed on realisation. Losses on sale will become deductible. The only cost or benefit that will arise will be based on the timing of receipt of the allowance for depreciation. 76 Future of Tax Recommendations Figure 6.1: Corporate marginal effective tax rates for manufacturing plants across OECD countries 31 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% Poland Ireland Iceland Turkey Switzerland Finland Slovenia Slovak Republic Canada Denmark Hungary Greece Portugal Mexico Average Austria Sweden Luxembourg Italy Australia Belgium Spain Norway Chile Germany Israel United Kingdom Japan NZ - 2% DV France NZ - 1% DV United States NZ - current Tax rate Note: DV indicates declining value – e.g. a depreciation rate of 1% DV allows a building owner to claim 1% of the adjusted tax value of an asset each year.

As a result, the 2017 analysis has been used for this report. 77 Future of Tax Recommendations The treatment of seismic strengthening expenditure 23. In the course of discussions on building depreciation deductions, the Group has noted that no deductions are allowed for expenditure on seismic strengthening. 24. The current approach results in a counter- intuitive outcome: deductions may be claimed if a building collapses in an earthquake but no deductions may be claimed on expenditure that will prevent the building from collapsing. 25. Even if the Government decides not to reinstate deductions for building depreciation, there is a clear case to allow deductions in some form over time for seismic strengthening. Options for building depreciation 26. The revenue impact of reinstating building depreciation deductions will be substantial (even at a depreciation rate of 1%). To manage these costs, the Government could reinstate building depreciation on a partial basis for: • seismic strengthening only • multi-unit residential buildings 32 • industrial, commercial and multi-unit residential buildings. 27. The Group does not recommend reintroducing depreciation deductions for standalone residential buildings, as the evidence that such buildings depreciate is weaker than for multi-unit residential, commercial and industrial buildings. 32 Multi-unit residential building refers to a building comprised of multiple residential units (e.g. an apartment block). 28. Table 6.1 sets out the revenue impacts of these options. Table 6.1 Revenue impacts of building depreciation options Option Approximate fiscal cost over 5 years Restore building depreciation solely for seismic strengthening work on commercial, industrial and multi-unit residential buildings (up to 67% of new building standard, 30-year straight-line deductions). Total cost $70 million Restore building depreciation at 1% on multi-unit residential buildings. Total cost $150 million Restore building depreciation at 1% on industrial, commercial and multi-unit residential buildings. Industrial $425 million Commercial $880 million Multi-unit residential $150 million Total cost $1.46 billion 29. The Group notes that restoring depreciation on multi-unit residential buildings could support the Government’s housing affordability goals by increasing the supply of housing and supporting greater intensification in urban areas – thereby putting downwards pressure on house prices and rents. 30. The Government might also wish to consider tax measures that encourage building to higher environmental standards. These measures could be funded by revenue from environmental taxes. 78 Future of Tax Recommendations Loss ring-fencing for residential rental property 31. A key argument for the planned introduction of residential rental loss ring-fencing rules has been the lack of a tax on capital gains on rental properties. Landlords are currently able to claim tax losses when they are making untaxed economic profit owing to capital gain. 32. The case for residential rental loss ring-fencing is reduced if the taxation of capital gains is extended to cover residential rental investment property. Gains will be taxed when properties are sold although there will still be some timing benefits for landlords if losses are not ring-fenced because gains are taxed only on realisation. 33. To the extent the taxation of capital gains could put upward pressure on rents, the removal of ring-fencing on residential rental property may aid in limiting potential rent increases. 34. The Group suggests that the Government consider whether or not it wishes to remove loss ring-fencing on residential rental property if the taxation of capital gains is extended to include residential rental investment property. The cost of this policy change is approximately $830 million over five years and would need to be balanced against the Government’s other priorities. Nationally significant infrastructure projects 35. The New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZSF) has suggested the use of a limited tax incentive to spur investment into Government-approved, nationally significant public infrastructure projects that would benefit from unique international expertise. 36. NZSF suggested that investors pay a concessionary rate of 14% (i.e. half of the current company rate of 28%) on profits made in New Zealand from qualifying projects. Qualifying investors would need to have a demonstrated capability to deliver world-class infrastructure 33 The OECD aims to get G20 approval for the proposals in June 2019 and reach a consensus solution by the end of 2020. projects; they would also need to bring expertise that is not ordinarily available in New Zealand and commit that expertise to the delivery of the infrastructure. 37. NZSF’s suggestion has merit. The Group recommends that the Government consider the development of a carefully designed regime to encourage investment into large, nationally significant infrastructure projects that both serve the national interest and require unique international project expertise to succeed. International income taxation 38. The Group has received many submissions about international taxation and the tax practices of multinational companies and digital firms. It is clear from the submissions that many people feel a deep sense of unfairness about the way in which the tax system deals with these firms. This is a worrying phenomenon: perceptions of unfairness have the potential to erode public support for the tax system as a whole. 39. The Group’s discussions have focused on issues related to the tax treatment of cross-border revenues from digital services, where some of the sharpest concerns about the taxation of multinational companies have arisen. 40. Since the release of the Interim Report, a number of countries – including France and the United Kingdom – have announced their intention to pursue a digital services tax. Australia also recently released a discussion paper on the digital economy and the future of Australia’s corporate tax system. 41. New Zealand continues to participate in discussions at the OECD on the future of the international income tax framework. 33 The Group supports New Zealand’s involvement in this multilateral process but New Zealand must also be ready to act in its own best interests. 79 Future of Tax Recommendations 42. The Group recommends that New Zealand stand ready to implement a digital services tax if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction and it is reasonably certain that New Zealand’s export industries will not be materially impacted by any retaliatory measures. 43. The Government must also ensure – to the extent possible – that New Zealand’s double tax agreements and trade agreements do not unduly restrict our taxation options in these matters. Opportunities to reduce compliance costs 44. The Group has heard many concerns about the compliance costs imposed by the tax system, particularly on small businesses. In their response to the Interim Report, the Ministers of Finance and Revenue also asked the Group to provide an expanded list of opportunities for reducing compliance costs. 45. Following consultation with submitters and discussions with business representatives, the Group has identified a set of opportunities for immediate action. These are: • an increase in the threshold for provisional tax from $2,500 to $5,000 of residual income tax • an increase in the closing stock adjustment from $10,000 to $20,000 - $30,000 • an increase in the $10,000 automatic deduction for legal fees and a potential expansion of the automatic deduction to other types of professional fees (but not to other potential capital expenditure, such as repairs and maintenance) • a reduction in the number of depreciation rates and a simplification of the process for using default rates. 46. In addition to these opportunities, the Government should consider the merits of adjusting the thresholds for both unexpired expenditure and the write-off of low-value assets. 47. Subject to fiscal constraints, the Group also recommends that the Government: • simplify the fringe benefit tax and simplify (or even remove) the entertainment adjustment • remove resident withholding tax on close company-related party interest and dividend payments, subject to integrity concerns • remove the requirement for taxpayers to seek the approval of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue GST buyer-created tax invoices • allow special rate certificates and certificates of exemption to be granted retrospectively • increase the period of validity for a certificate of exemption or special rate certificate • remove the requirement to file a change of imputation ratio notice with Inland Revenue • extend the threshold of ‘cash basis person’ in the financial arrangement rules, which would better allow for the current levels of personal debt • increase the threshold for not requiring a GST change-of-use adjustment. 48. The Government should also explore opportunities to help reduce compliance costs for small businesses through the use of cloud- based accounting software. Regimes (such as the rules for the deductibility of entertainment expenditure) should be designed through the lens of ‘automation first’ – meaning that any new set of rules created should be easily programmable to reduce compliance costs. Compensating withholding agents 49. Withholding taxes can be an effective approach to minimising the overall compliance and administrative costs of a tax. However, they impose compliance costs and risks on withholding agents. The Group notes that some countries give withholding agents administrative fees to compensate for taking on risk and the costs of compliance and this could be considered if additional withholding tax obligations are imposed. 80 Future of Tax Recommendations Non-resident employees 50. The Group recommends a review of the taxation of non-resident employees. There is a particular problem when such employees are frequently in and out of the country and it is unclear whether they will breach the 92-day or 183-day thresholds for taxation. It would be desirable to simplify the obligations relating to these employees, for example, by requiring employers to consider the taxation of genuinely transitory non-resident employees at year-end only. Hybrid mismatch rules 51. There are also issues with the hybrid mismatch rules. These rules deal with cross-border arrangements that can exploit differences in the tax treatment of instruments across jurisdictions. The current rules appear to be creating some unintended compliance issues for small businesses. The Group recommends that the Government review whether these rules should apply to small businesses or simple business transactions (such as the transfer of trading stock and the utilisation of losses). The taxation of retirement savings 52. Individuals save for a variety of reasons. The saving and investment choices of firms, individuals and the Government – aggregated across the economy – shape the accumulation of financial and physical capital in New Zealand. Rates of private saving therefore have broader impacts on the performance of the New Zealand economy. 53. There are many reasons for individuals to save. One of the primary motivations is the need to ensure an adequate standard of living in retirement. The Group considered the tax treatment of retirement savings in the Interim Report and concluded that there is not a case to radically reform the current arrangements. However, the Group’s view is that an increase in the tax benefits provided through KiwiSaver would encourage more people to save for their retirement. 54. The Group has discussed a range of possibilities to encourage low-income earners to save. The Group also recognises that non-tax measures (such as adjustments to the design parameters of the KiwiSaver scheme and income adequacy measures arising from the work of the Welfare Expert Advisory Group) could also promote greater saving. Within the tax system, an illustrative set of options could include: i. A contribution-based tax benefit, which could take one or more of the following forms: • Employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). Inland Revenue would refund ESCT for KiwiSaver members earning up to $48,000 per annum. The ESCT would be refunded to the taxpayer’s KiwiSaver account. The refund would be progressively clawed back for employees earning more than $48,000 per annum, so that employees earning over $70,000 would receive no benefit. This is a modification of the capped ESCT exemption that was discussed in the Interim Report. • Parental benefit. A KiwiSaver member on parental leave would receive the maximum member tax credit, even if they did not make the full $1,042 of contributions. • Member tax credit. An increase in the member tax credit from $0.50 per $1 of contribution to $0.75 per $1 of contribution. The contribution cap would remain unchanged at $1,042. ii. PIE rate reductions. A five percentage point reduction in the lower PIE rates for KiwiSaver funds (i.e. the 10.5% and 17.5% rates). As discussed in the Interim Report, the schedule of PIE rates should also be simplified. 55. The Group notes that, as lifespans have increased, people are now spending a much greater proportion of their lives in retirement. Although the Group has decided it is not necessary to adjust the tax system for inflation, we have identified a need for further work on options to maintain the purchasing power of people’s savings through their retirement. 81 Future of Tax Recommendations The taxation of the New Zealand Superannuation Fund 56. During its discussions on retirement savings, the Group noted the oddity that the NZSF must pay tax to the New Zealand Government. The NZSF reports that it paid $1.2 billion in tax, or 9% of New Zealand’s corporate tax take, in the 2016-17 tax year (New Zealand Superannuation Fund, 2017). 57. This treatment is unusual from an international perspective. Government investment funds in other countries are not generally subject to tax. It is also notable that the New Zealand Government’s other large investment funds – the investment fund of ACC and the Natural Disaster Fund of the Earthquake Commission – are not subject to tax. 58. The NZSF’s tax status in New Zealand affects its tax status in some foreign jurisdictions. Some countries recognise the principle of sovereign immunity from taxes – meaning that a government should not be subject to tax when it invests in another government’s jurisdiction. It is more difficult to argue that the NZSF should benefit from sovereign immunity when it is subject to tax in its home jurisdiction. The NZSF reported paying approximately $14 million in tax to foreign governments in the 2016-17 tax year (New Zealand Superannuation Fund, 2017). This is a cost to the NZSF that does not benefit New Zealand. 59. Tax-exempt status would better recognise the fact that the NZSF is an instrument of the Government of New Zealand and make it easier for the NZSF to apply for tax exemptions in foreign countries where they are available. Not all governments recognise the principle of sovereign immunity, so the NZSF may still have to pay tax in some jurisdictions, even if it becomes tax-exempt in New Zealand. Nevertheless, the NZSF will benefit from lower compliance costs in New Zealand and some reduction in foreign taxes. 60. Tax-exempt status would also reduce the amount of contributions that need to be made by the Government over time in terms of the funding formula in the New Zealand Superannuation and Retirement Income Act 2001. 61. The Group therefore recommends that the Government give favourable consideration to specifically exempting the NZSF from New Zealand tax obligations on the basis it is an instrument of the Government of New Zealand. Summary assessment 62. The current approach to the taxation of business is largely sound. The Group does not see a case at this time to reduce the company rate or to move away from the imputation system. However, the Government should continue to monitor developments in company tax rates around the world, particularly in Australia. The tax rate for Māori authorities also remains appropriate (although the rate should be extended to the subsidiaries of Māori authorities). The Group recommends against the introduction of a progressive company tax. 63. The Group has investigated a number of options for tax reform that could enhance productivity and boost investment. These include measures such as changes to the loss-continuity rules, an expansion of black-hole deductions, building depreciation deductions, removal of residential rental loss ring-fencing, and concessions for nationally significant infrastructure projects. Some or all of these measures could form part of a package of tax reform, alongside an extension of capital gains taxation. 64. New Zealand currently offers few tax incentives for retirement savings. The Group does not see a case to radically reform the taxation of retirement savings but an increase in the tax benefits for low- and middle-income earners provided through KiwiSaver would encourage people to put more away for their retirement. There is also a case to exempt the NZSF from New Zealand tax obligations. 82 Future of Tax Recommendations 83 Future of Tax Recommendations 7 Personal income tax 1. Personal income tax is the largest source of revenue for the Government. It is also – alongside GST – the primary way in which most New Zealanders interact with the tax system. The fairness and integrity of the personal income tax regime therefore bears directly on New Zealanders’ views of the fairness and integrity of the tax system as a whole. The current approach to personal income taxation 2. Personal income tax applies to individuals. It is the ultimate tax paid by individuals after income has worked its way through the various taxable entities and structures, taking the form of wages, salaries, self-employed income, dividends, interest and other income. 3. Most personal income tax is collected from employees. Employees do not receive any deductions for work-related expenses. (Nor are they required to register for GST.) Income tax on employee salaries and wages is withheld at source, so most employees do not need to file tax returns. 34 34 Some employees, however, are subject to an ‘end-of-year square up’ for other items, such as social policy entitlements or earnings from which tax has not been withheld. For the 2016-17 tax year, approximately 2.4 million individuals received personal tax summaries or filed an IR3 returns. Approximately 1.4 million people with PAYE income (excluding interest income) did not file returns. From the 2018-19 tax year, Inland Revenue will automatically calculate individuals’ income tax liability based on information it holds (subject to legislation being enacted). 35 A progressive rate structure is one where the proportion of income paid in tax rises as income rises. 4. Non-employees – whether operating as businesses or as contractors – receive the opposite treatment. They receive deductions for work-related expenses and generally need to register for GST. There are, however, various levels of withholding tax on some contractors. Common law tests determine the employment status of an individual for tax purposes; consequently, the taxable status of an individual may differ from their contractual status. 5. Unlike the other tax bases, personal income tax has a progressive rate structure. 35 The current rates and thresholds are as follows: Table 7.1: Personal income tax rates and thresholds Taxable income Tax rate 0 – $14,00010.5% $14,001 – $48,00017.5% $48,001 – $70,00030% $70,001 +33% 6. Two-thirds of taxpayers earn less than $48,000 and therefore have incomes below the second tax threshold. 84 Future of Tax Recommendations Table 7.2: The distribution of taxpayers (2017) Taxable income bracket Number of people in each bracket Percentage of people in each bracket 0-$14,000787,190 36 20.9% $14,001-$48,0001,720,58045.6% $48,001-$70,000612,20016.2% Over $70,000655,36017.4% Source: Inland Revenue The rates and thresholds of income tax 7. In their response to the Interim Report, the Ministers of Finance and Revenue asked the Group to develop measures that would reduce inequality and increase the fairness of the tax system. This has informed the Group’s consideration of personal income tax settings. 8. In the Interim Report, the Group noted that any changes to personal income taxation would need to reflect the specific objectives of the Government: • If the Government wishes to improve incomes for very low-income households, the best means of doing so would be through welfare transfers. • If the Government wishes to improve incomes for certain groups of low- to middle-income earners, such as full-time workers on the minimum wage, then cuts in lower marginal tax rates or increases in lower tax thresholds can provide support for these groups and make personal income taxes more progressive. All higher-income groups would also benefit but low- to middle-income earners would receive the largest proportional benefits. 9. The extent of any changes to personal income taxation will also require trade-offs and prioritisation against other tax reform measures. 36 This includes 95,000 people on nil income. People with negative income because of losses are recorded as having nil taxable income in the tables. 10. The following sections of this chapter present a set of options, all of which include benefits for low- to middle-income earners. The Group has not considered a reduction in the top marginal rate because it is already low by international standards and the Group does not wish to reduce the progressivity of the tax system on vertical equity grounds. 11. The transfer system, in its current state, includes tax credit payments, as well as benefit payments. Changes to transfer settings are outside the Group’s Terms of Reference. The Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG) is reviewing the welfare system and is expected to release its final report with recommendations by February 2019. The Tax Working Group recommends that any changes to tax rates and thresholds be considered alongside any recommendations made by the WEAG. Options for personal income taxation Tax-free thresholds 12. A tax-free threshold establishes a dollar amount limit under which no income tax is payable. Tax- free thresholds are a feature of many tax systems around the world. In Australia, for example, the first $18,200 of annual income is not taxed. The usual motivation for a tax-free threshold is to enhance the progressivity of the tax system, although in many countries social security taxes still apply in this threshold. Policy assessment 13. If the Government adopts in full the recommendations of the Tax Working Group on capital gains taxation and $1.6 billion (per annum) was earmarked to establish a tax-free personal income threshold, then that threshold could be set at around $5,000 a year by 2022-23. This would be equivalent to a tax cut of about $10 a week at and above that threshold. 85 Future of Tax Recommendations 14. It should be noted, however, that beneficiaries, other than New Zealand Superannuitants, would not receive any increase in their net income because of the way benefits are calculated under the current law. If the law were to be changed, so that such beneficiaries were to receive the same post-tax increase as other people on the same income, the cost would increase to approximately $1.8 billion per annum. 15. A tax-free threshold would increase the net income of many low-income earners. However, it would also benefit people in households that are not necessarily low income. Approximately 570,000 income earners aged over 15 earn less than $14,000 per annum (the bottom tax threshold). 37 Of these, 46% are secondary earners in households that earn above median income. 16. This suggests that while a tax-free threshold could increase the net income of many low- income households, much of the increase would also flow through to higher-income households. 17. Transfers such as tax credits and benefit payments are likely to be a better means of delivering assistance to people on low incomes and the Group is aware that the WEAG is considering these options in its deliberations. Rate and threshold adjustments 18. Working within the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference, an alternative approach to enhancing the progressivity of the tax system would be to increase the bottom threshold of personal tax. This would reduce the marginal tax rate of those on low incomes transitioning into work, which a tax-free threshold would not. For the same fiscal cost, this approach could also deliver a bigger tax break for many individuals transitioning into work, relative to a tax-free threshold. An increase in the bottom threshold could also reduce the instances of some low- income earners with more than one job facing a higher secondary tax rate. 37 According to the Household Economic Survey in 2017. This excludes individuals with zero income (and no negative sources of income). 19. The Group prefers increasing the bottom threshold to introducing a tax-free threshold due to the support the threshold adjustment gives for those transitioning into work, and the risk that more of the increase in income from the tax-free threshold will also flow through to higher-income households. 20. The Group has developed a number of illustrative options to aid the Government’s considerations. In setting the scale of these illustrative options, the Group has been aware of the total revenue projected to be generated by extending the taxation of capital gains (as discussed further in Chapter 8). 21. Option 1a involves an increase in the bottom threshold from $14,000 to $22,500, while Option 1b involves an increase in the bottom threshold to $20,000 (to reduce the revenue impact). Table 7.3 illustrates the resulting changes to the thresholds. 22. An alternative approach would combine an increase in the bottom threshold with an increase in the second marginal rate. The increase in the second marginal rate would generate additional revenue to allow for a more significant increase in the bottom threshold. Under Option 2, an increase in the bottom threshold to $30,000 is combined with an increase in the second marginal tax rate to 21% from 1 April 2021. The resulting fiscal cost is similar to Option 1a. Table 7.4 illustrates the resulting changes to the rate and threshold. 23. The Terms of Reference rule out increases to any rate of personal income tax. However, the Group has raised this possibility because it would generate greater benefits for lower- income earners than the other options, while also reducing average tax rates for higher- income individuals – ensuring that no one is left worse off as a result of the change. 86 Future of Tax Recommendations Table 7.3: Potential personal income tax changes – Options 1a and 1b Status quo income brackets Option 1a income brackets Option 1b income bracketsTax rate (%) 0 – $14,0000 – $22,5000 – $20,00010.5 $14,001 – $48,000$22,501 – $48,000$20,001 – $48,00017.5 $48,001 – $70,000$48,001 – $70,000$48,001 – $70,00030 $70,001 +$70,001 +$70,001 +33 Table 7.4: Potential personal income tax changes – Option 2 Status quo income bracketsStatus quo tax rate (%) Option 2 income brackets Option 2 tax rate (%) 0 – $14,00010.50 – $30,00010.5 $14,001 – $48,00017.5$30,001 – $48,00021 $48,001 – $70,00030$48,001 – $70,00030 $70,001 + 33$70,001 + 33 Policy assessment Equity and fairness impacts 24. Under each of the options, all individuals earning more than $14,000 would benefit with most of those earning closer to $14,000 receiving a proportionally greater increase in their take- home pay than those on higher incomes. These impacts are illustrated in figure 7.1. • With Option 1a, individuals earning between $14,000 and $22,500 would gain between $0 and $595 per year and all higher-income earners would gain $595. • With Option 1b, individuals earning between $14,000 and $20,000 would gain between $0 and $420 per year and all higher-income earners would gain $420. This option has a lower fiscal cost than the others considered. • With Option 2, individuals earning between $14,000 and $30,000 would gain between $0 and $1,120 per year. If their income is between $30,000 and $48,000, their gain would be between $490 and $1,120. Higher income people earning more than $48,000 gain $490 per year. 25. Option 2 provides greater gains than Option 1a for those earning between $22,500 and $45,000. This occurs because individuals earning more than $45,000 gain less in Option 2 compared to Option 1a and this relatively lower gain is redistributed to the lower income earners. Under every option, all individuals earning more than $14,000 will benefit but individuals on lower incomes would generally benefit proportionally more than higher-income individuals. 26. Under each of the options, average tax rates fall for all individuals currently with incomes greater than $14,000. In equivalised household incomes, figure 7.2 shows that the greatest dollar gains to lower-income households come from Option 1a and Option 2. Under every option, households in the lowest income deciles generally gain proportionally more than households in higher income deciles. 87 Future of Tax Recommendations Figure 7.1: Annual benefit to individuals from personal income tax changes $595 $420 $1,120 $490 $0 $200 $400 $600 $800 $1,000 $1,200 $0$20,000$40,000$60,000$80,000$100,000 Individual taxable income Option 1a: The first tax threshold is raised to $22,500 Option 1b: The first tax threshold is raised to $20,000 Option 2: The first tax threshold is raised to $30,000, and the second rate is raised to 21% Source: Inland Revenue Figure 7.2: Average change in household disposable income from personal income tax changes, by income decile 38 $0 $200 $400 $600 $800 $1,000 $1,200 $1,400 Decile 1Decile 2Decile 3Decile 4Decile 5Decile 6Decile 7Decile 8Decile 9Decile 10 Equivalised disposable household income decile Option 1a: The first tax threshold is raised to $22,500 Option 1b: The first tax threshold is raised to $20,000 Option 2: The first tax threshold is raised to $30,000, and the second rate is raised to 21% Source: The Treasury 38 The average gain is higher for households in decile 9 relative to decile 10 because of household composition effects: households in decile 10 typically consist of one or two high income earning persons, whereas households in decile 9 have more multi-family households with more earners per household on average. 88 Future of Tax Recommendations 27. Table 7.5 illustrates the average gains delivered by each option to different types of households. 28. Options 1a and 2 have very similar impact profiles on these types of households. Couples and multi-family households gain the most from the tax changes because, on average, they have more than one income earner. 29. Overall, adjustments to the bottom rates and thresholds would increase the progressivity of personal income tax. The Group notes, however, that the personal tax changes that have been discussed are likely to have only a minor impact on income inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient. For example, Option 2 would have the greatest impact on progressivity of the three options considered, however, this would only decrease the Gini coefficient from 0.3272 to 0.3255 (a 0.5% decrease). Interactions with the transfer system As a matter of fairness, the Group recommends that income tax reductions should benefit all low-income households – including households on benefits. At the moment, some benefits are set to ensure that beneficiaries receive a given level of income after tax so there is no change in net benefit levels as a result of tax changes. Any tax reductions should be paired with equivalent increases in benefit levels to ensure fair treatment of all income earners. The fiscal cost of this has not been included in our package costings.

Reductions in the bottom rates and raised thresholds of income tax should enhance efficiency. Evidence points to small reductions in economic efficiency from higher average tax rates but high effective marginal tax rates can have significant impacts on certain groups of people, such as people who are on the edge of moving between benefits and work. 31. Effective marginal tax rates are already high for some households receiving Working for Families tax credits. If the second marginal rate is raised to 21%, effective marginal tax rates might increase even further for some households. If this higher tax rate is adopted, the Group suggests that the Government consider a reduction of the abatement rate of Working for Families tax credits to offset the impact of the increase. 32. Factors that affect work decisions can also affect decisions on saving and investment, upskilling, and the general development of human capital. Revenue impacts 33. Since changes in the bottom rates or thresholds carry through to all individuals, even small changes can have large revenue impacts. 34. Table 7.6 presents the revenue impacts of the options, over the five years from 2021-22 to 2025-26. Options 1a and 2 are similar in fiscal cost over the five-year period to 2025-26. Other impacts 35. The Group sees no significant compliance, administration or integrity issues arising from changes to the lower rates or thresholds of personal income tax. Summary assessment 36. Any changes to personal income taxation would need to reflect the objectives of the Government. • If the Government wishes to improve incomes for very low-income households, the best means of doing so would be through welfare transfers. • If the Government wishes to improve incomes for certain groups of low- to middle-income earners, such as full-time workers on the minimum wage, then changes to personal income taxation may be a better option. 37. The Group has discussed a range of options to increase the progressivity of the personal tax system. The Group’s preferred approach is to increase the bottom tax threshold. This could potentially be combined with an increase in the second marginal tax rate. 38. The Group prefers increasing the bottom threshold to introducing a tax-free threshold owing to the support the threshold adjustment gives to those transitioning into work and the risk that more of the increase in income from a tax-free threshold will flow through to higher income households. 39. The Group considers that tax credits and benefit payments are likely to be a better means of delivering assistance to low-income households than tax rate or threshold changes. In that context we note the Terms of Reference of the WEAG. The Government will need to consider the WEAG’s recommendations alongside those of the Tax Working Group. 40. Changes in personal income taxation do not lead to changes in beneficiary incomes. If tax changes are introduced that are intended to increase household incomes at the bottom of the income distribution, the Government should consider a corresponding increase in net benefit payments. This would provide a fairer redistribution of income across individuals. 41. Overall, the personal tax changes discussed in this report are likely to have a minor impact on income inequality. A material reduction in income inequality through the personal tax system would require broader income tax changes, including an increase in the top personal marginal rate. Such a change is beyond the scope of the Group’s Terms of Reference. 90 Future of Tax Recommendations 91 Future of Tax Recommendations 8 Illustrative packages to improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system 1. A broad extension of capital gains taxation (as set out in Volume II) is projected to raise approximately $8.3 billion over the first five years from introduction. The revenue is expected to increase over time, although it will also be volatile. In light of these revenue projections, the Group has been directed to develop revenue-neutral packages of tax reform for the Government’s consideration. 2. In their response to the Interim Report, the Ministers of Finance and Revenue specified that these packages should reduce inequality and increase fairness across the tax system. The packages should also improve housing affordability, promote a more balanced savings culture, and deepen capital markets. The Group has developed a range of illustrative packages that are directed towards these goals. 3. The best use of revenue from extending capital gains taxation, however, will ultimately depend on the Government’s priorities. Tax reform is only one choice; the Government also has a wider set of options to consider beyond the tax system. Ministers will need to assess the options for tax reform against other needs and priorities to determine what would best enhance the wellbeing of New Zealanders. 39 Revenue-neutral for this chapter is considered by taking the total projected additional revenue from extending capital gains taxation when added up over the first five years and comparing with the total cost of revenue-negative measures when added up over the same five years. Illustrative packages 4. The Group has developed four illustrative packages for the Government’s consideration: • A package that increases progressivity through reductions in personal income tax. • A package with a greater focus on measures to support businesses and housing affordability. • A package with a greater focus on supporting savers, particularly those on lower incomes. • A package with a more diversified focus, where business tax measures are deferred to enable greater savings measures. 5. All four of the packages are broadly revenue- neutral over five years. 39 While each package focuses on different themes, they all involve substantial reductions in personal income tax that deliver the greatest proportional benefits to lower-income earners. 6. These packages are intended as examples to illustrate the tax measures that are available to the Government. Depending on its objectives, the Government could combine these or other measures into alternative packages for tax reform. 92 Future of Tax Recommendations The main building blocks of the packages Revenue from extending capital gains taxation 7. The revenue estimates are highly uncertain but a broad extension of capital gains taxation is projected to raise approximately $8.3 billion over five years. The revenue is expected to increase over time but it will also be volatile. This volatility will require disciplined fiscal management, so that future governments do not lock themselves into permanent spending commitments on the basis of temporary peaks in capital gains taxation revenue. Revenue arising from other Group recommendations 8. In the Interim Report, the Group proposed a range of measures that would increase revenue by enhancing integrity and improving collection in the tax system. 40 It is not possible to estimate the revenue benefits of these measures with precision, so the Group has not included them in the packages considered here. 9. Nevertheless, the revenue benefits of these measures could be significant. Cabral and Gemmel (2018) estimate that, on average, the self-employed under-report 20% of their income. Under a fairly conservative set of assumptions, this could represent foregone revenue of around $850 million per annum or 0.3% of GDP. 41 The actual revenue foregone could be even greater still. 10. Similarly, Chapter 4 Environmental and ecological outcomes identifies a range of opportunities for expanding environmental taxation. These opportunities could deliver significant revenue 40 These integrity measures are summarised in Chapter 9 Other opportunities to improve the tax system. 41 This estimate only relates to self-employed people who are sole traders or in a partnership. Estimating the potential revenue foregone for all self-employed is not possible using the methodology by Cabral and Gemmel as consumption by shareholder employees can be funded legitimately through loans by companies. Revenue estimate is for 2016. benefits to the Government. However, most of this revenue potential will emerge over the medium to long term and is thus beyond the five-year window for the packages considered in this chapter. 11. Also, the Group supports recycling some or all of the revenue from environmental taxation into measures that would support a transition to a more environmentally sustainable economy. Environmental taxes should therefore be considered as a complementary set of reforms to the packages presented in this chapter. Revenue-reducing measures 12. Previous chapters of this report have discussed the main revenue-reducing measures for inclusion in a package of tax reform. Table 8.1 summarises the main measures and their approximate revenue cost over the five-year period of the packages. The shape of the packages 13. Table 8.2 outlines the four packages developed by the Group. These packages are illustrative only and are intended to provide a sense of the options available to the Government to consider, rather than serve as a definitive blueprint for the Government to follow. 14. As a matter of fairness, the Group considers that income tax reductions should benefit all low income households – including households on benefits. The tax reductions in each package should be paired with equivalent increases in benefit levels to ensure a fair treatment of all income earners. 93 Future of Tax Recommendations Table 8.1: Revenue-reducing measures ItemKey benefit Approximate revenue cost over 5 years Savings measures Remove ESCT on employer’s matching contribution of 3% of the salary to KiwiSaver, for members earning up to $48,000 per year. Provide support to low-income savers.$1.1 billion Remove ESCT on employer’s matching contribution of 3% of the salary to KiwiSaver. The amount of ESCT that is exempt is reduced by 6 cents per dollar of income over $48,000 (so no exemption for employees earning over $70,000). Provide support to low-income savers. Remove fiscal ‘cliff’ of above option. $1.7 billion Reduce lower PIE rates by five percentage points for KiwiSaver funds (5.5%, 12.5%, 28%).

Provide support to savers.$2.6 billion Primary caregiver KiwiSaver member receives full member tax credit in year of child’s birth regardless of their KiwiSaver contributions. Provide support to savers, in particular, women during maternity. $70 million Business tax and housing measures Restore building depreciation on commercial, industrial and multi-unit residential buildings. Fiscal costs in this table assume a 1% diminishing value depreciation rate. Increase neutrality of investment by reducing the tax cost of investing in buildings and building-owning businesses. Encourage supply of multi-unit rental accommodation. Commercial $880 million Industrial $425 million Multi-unit residential $150 million Restore building depreciation solely for seismic strengthening work (up to 67% of new building standard, 30 year straight-line deductions). Provide support to property owners undertaking seismic strengthening work. $70 million Expand deductibility for ‘black-hole’ expenses. Fiscal costs in this table are with a five year spreading of expenses. Increase neutrality of investment by improving incentives for innovation and risk-taking. $120 million Remove residential rental loss ring-fencing restrictions. Reduce upward pressure on rents and encourage more investment in rental housing. $830 million Reduce restrictions on loss carry-forwards when a company is sold. Improve incentives for innovation and risk-taking. $240 million Total fiscal cost (excluding personal income tax reductions and mutually exclusive measures). $7.6 billion Personal income tax reductions Personal income tax reductions (i.e. increase in bottom threshold). Support those on lower incomes. May result in modest improvements in incentives to work and save. Depends on level of income tax reduction. Revenue estimates are preliminary and indicative. Revenue estimates are based on specific assumptions and design features. As a result, estimates may change with further design and if better information becomes available. 94 Future of Tax Recommendations Table 8.2: Illustrative packages Package 1: Increasing progressivity through reductions in personal income tax Personal income tax reductionsSavings measuresDepreciation deductions $6.8 billion 42 1.

Remove residential rental loss ring- fencing (from 2021-22 tax year). Impact assessment Impacts common to all packages 15. All of the packages involve a broad extension of capital gains taxation, alongside the Group’s recommendations on integrity and compliance cost reductions. This means all of the packages would deliver a common set of impacts in the following areas as a result of the extension of capital gains taxation: • Equity and fairness. Would increase horizontal equity and increase the progressivity of the tax system, particularly in relation to wealth. • Efficiency and productivity. Is likely to improve the allocation of investment across the economy but it would also reduce after-tax returns and create lock-in effects. The impacts would differ across sectors and individuals. The aggregate effects on efficiency and productivity would ultimately depend on how the revenue generated by the additional taxation is used. • Housing market. There could be an increase in rents and a decrease in house prices but any impact is likely to be small. • Savings. There would be a more equal tax treatment of different forms of savings. However, an extension of capital gains taxation would increase the overall level of taxation on savings. • Revenue integrity. There would be reduced incentives and fewer opportunities for tax avoidance and minimisation. Package-specific impacts 16. The following section considers the impacts from package-specific measures. Distributional impacts and inequality (social capital) 17. All four packages have a focus on personal income tax reductions. These reductions would further increase the progressivity in the tax system and provide modest benefits to most households. 96 Future of Tax Recommendations 18. Packages 2, 3 and 4 increase the bottom personal tax threshold to $20,000. This would provide an additional $420 per annum ($8 per week) to individuals with annual taxable incomes above $20,000. Those earning between $14,000 and $20,000 would receive a smaller benefit, for example, those earning $17,000 would receive an additional $210 per annum ($4 per week). 19. Package 1 provides greater income tax reductions. Increasing the bottom threshold to $22,500 would provide an additional $595 per annum ($11.40 per week) to individuals with annual taxable incomes above $22,500. 20. The alternative option (increasing the bottom threshold to $30,000, while increasing the second rate to 21%) would provide an additional $1,120 ($21.50 per week) to those earning $30,000 and $490 per annum to those earning more than $48,000 ($9.40 per week). Efficiency (financial and physical capital) 21. Packages 2 and 4 are more focused on financial and physical capital and include efficiency- and productivity-enhancing measures that would promote investment, economic efficiency and productivity. For example, reintroducing building depreciation at a 1% rate is estimated to decrease the marginal effective tax rate for inbound foreign investment on industrial buildings from 44.3% to 39.9% and on commercial buildings from 41.5% to 37.2%. 22. These measures would help to offset any negative economic effects arising from an extension of capital gains taxation. They could also support the rebalancing of the economy by reducing the taxation of productive assets relative to the taxation of speculative investments in land. 23. Packages 1 and 3 focus more on personal tax reductions and savings measures. As a result, these packages are less supportive of productivity than packages 2 and 4 and do less to mitigate the potential negative impacts of taxing more capital gains.

All four of the packages reduce personal income taxes. These reductions could help to compensate lower-income households if rents increase as a result of extending capital gains taxation. The Accommodation Supplement (which is automatically linked to housing costs) would also provide a buffer to help mitigate any potential increase in rents for lower-income households. The fiscal cost of this has not been included in these packages. 25. Packages 2 and 4 also include measures that may improve housing supply by allowing the owners of multi-unit residential properties to claim deductions for depreciation and removal of residential rental loss ring-fencing. KiwiSaver (financial and physical capital, social capital) 26. All four packages provide personal tax reductions and savings measures that are targeted at low-income KiwiSavers. All four packages reduce taxes on low-income KiwiSavers. Table 8.3: Tax cost/benefit for KiwiSavers from packages, including effect of taxing more capital gains Net tax cost/benefit for KiwiSavers earning (2021-22) Package $0- $48,000 $48,000- $70,000$70,000+ Package 1 – Personal income tax reduction focus $238m benefit $7m benefit $43m cost Package 2 – Business and housing focus $238m benefit $7m benefit $43m cost Package 3 – Savings focus $465m benefit $233m benefit $90m benefit Package 4 – Diversified focus $238m benefit $103m benefit $43m cost Estimates are preliminary and indicative. Source: Secretariat for the Tax Working Group Living standards framework assessment 27. The packages mainly affect wellbeing through their impacts on New Zealand’s social capital and financial and physical capital. All four packages are likely to increase social capital through improving horizontal equity and the integrity of the tax system. The four packages are also likely to improve the progressivity of the tax system. However, the degree of progressivity differs by package, with packages 1 and 3 having a greater focus on progressivity- enhancing measures. 28. Packages 2 and 4 are likely to deliver greater benefits for financial and physical capital through business measures to enhance productivity and efficiency. However, the net impact on financial and physical capital is ambiguous for all packages, given the uncertain impacts of taxing capital gains on productivity. 29. The direct impact on human capital of all the packages is likely to be smaller. Personal income tax reductions can improve incentives to work, and influence incentives to improve human capital, for example, by investing in training and education. However the net effects on these incentives are unlikely to be large compared with the effects on social, physical and financial capital. 30. The Group recommends a complementary set of measures to support natural capital in Chapter 4 Environmental and ecological outcomes. As previously noted, much of the potential revenue from environmental taxes is beyond the five- year window for the packages considered in this chapter. Further, the Group supports recycling some or all of the revenue from environmental taxation into measures that would support a transition to a more environmentally sustainable economy. 98 Future of Tax Recommendations Summary assessment 31. The four packages outlined in this chapter illustrate the range of options available to the Government if it decides to extend the taxation of capital gains. The best use of this revenue, however, will ultimately depend on the Government’s priorities. Tax reform is only one choice; the Government also has a wider set of options to consider beyond the tax system. The Group recommends that the Government assess the options for tax reform against other needs and priorities to determine what would best enhance the wellbeing of New Zealanders. 99 Future of Tax Recommendations 9 Other opportunities to improve the tax system 1. In the Interim Report, the Group made recommendations covering a broad range of tax issues. In the preceding chapters of this report, the Group has only revisited some of these issues. Time constraints have precluded further indepth investigation of the other issues but the recommendations remain an essential part of the Group’s prescription for reform. 2. This chapter revisits recommendations relating to these other issues and provides links to supporting analysis in the Interim Report. 3. On some issues, the Group has revised or added to its recommendations. This was often in response to suggestions raised during public consultation on the Interim Report. 4. These recommendations should be read as opportunities to improve the tax system, not detailed proposals. The Group recommends that these measures be progressed as part of the Government’s Tax Policy Work Programme and subject to the Generic Tax Policy Process. Matters requiring significant attention 5. The Group wishes to highlight several issues for particular attention by the Government. These issues pose significant risks to revenue collection and the administration and credibility of the tax system. The future of work For supporting commentary, see Chapter 13 of the Group’s Interim Report, which is available at: https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax- interim-report-html#section-18 6. The world is living through a period of intense innovation: digital technology is transforming established business models and altering traditional relationships between business and workers. As with other sectors of the economy, technology has the potential to disrupt existing paradigms in taxation, too. Combined with globalisation, generational demographics and climate change, there may be significant challenges for our workforce in the future. Challenges to the PAYE system 7. Most income tax is collected through the PAYE system. PAYE – or ‘pay as you earn’ – is a withholding system in which employers are responsible for deducting and paying income tax on their employees’ behalf. PAYE has served New Zealand extremely well but its effectiveness will reduce if labour market changes increase the proportion of self-employed workers in the future. 100 Future of Tax Recommendations 8. The Group supports Inland Revenue’s efforts to increase the compliance of the self-employed. The Group particularly supports an expansion in the use of withholding taxes to increase compliance and recommends that withholding be extended as far as practicable (including to platform service providers, such as ride- sharing companies). This should include making better use of technology platforms to deal with contractors’ tax obligations. 43 The Group also recommends that Inland Revenue continue to use data analytics and information matching to identify taxpayers who are under-reporting income. Rules and definitions 9. The Group has identified two areas where a review of existing rules and definitions is necessary. First, the Group recommends a review of the existing GST treatment of contractors, as the current approach appears to impose compliance costs for little net tax collected. 10. Secondly, it has also become apparent to the Group that there is a risk of quite different definitions of employment status, including particularly ‘employee’ and ‘dependent contractor’ being used across Government. The Group recommends that the Government seek, where possible, to align these definitions for tax and employment purposes. Childcare costs 11. The Group has discussed support for childcare costs to increase participation in the workforce but considers this support is best delivered outside of the tax system. 43 One example of this is ‘smart accounts’, where tax is automatically deducted and paid to Inland Revenue. The integrity of the tax system For supporting commentary, see Chapter 15 of the Group’s Interim Report, which is available at: https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax- interim-report-html#section-20 12. Most New Zealanders recognise the importance of paying tax and meet their tax obligations. Some, however, do not. Tax avoidance reduces the integrity of the tax system and erodes social capital. It is also fundamentally unfair, because it means that compliant taxpayers must pay more to make up for the lost revenue. 13. A number of integrity risks have been addressed over the years. For example, the alignment of the trustee rate and the top personal income rate has greatly reduced the use of trusts to shelter income and avoid tax. Nevertheless, the Group has identified a number of areas where further action is required. The hidden economy 14. There are many ways to describe the hidden economy: it has been called the cash economy, the informal economy, the shadow economy and the underground economy. The hidden economy arises because some taxpayers decide to hide some or all of their income. These actions – which can often seem innocuous to the participants – have a corrosive effect on the tax system. 101 Future of Tax Recommendations 15. The Group commends the measures proposed under Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation process for the increased use of data matching and analytics. It also recommends further measures to reduce the extent of the hidden economy (i.e. undeclared and cash- in-hand transactions). These measures could include an increase in the reporting of labour income and even the removal of tax deductibility if a taxpayer has not followed labour income withholding or reporting rules. The Group also recommends that the Government review recent Australian initiatives to address the hidden economy, with a view to applying them in New Zealand. Collection 16. The Group recommends the use of departure prohibition orders in cases of deliberate or persistent non-payment of GST and PAYE by a company whose directors (or their associates) are the main economic owners of the business. 17. Such cases also justify a lowering of the corporate veil. The Group therefore recommends the introduction of a regime similar in design to Australia’s Director Penalty Notice. As in Australia, a warning system would go hand in hand with the regime. If the pattern of non- payment of GST and PAYE continues, despite clear warning, it is appropriate to make directors who have an economic ownership in the company personally liable for GST and PAYE. Defences similar to those in Australia – such as illness, taking reasonable steps to ensure payment and the like – would be available to directors under this regime. 18. Aligning the standard of proof for GST and PAYE offences would also encourage compliance. 19. The Group recommends the establishment of a single Crown debt collection agency, with (as far as possible) consistent rules for treatment of debtors, to achieve economies of scale and more equitable outcomes across all Crown debtors. Closely held companies 20. The Group is aware of a number of tax integrity concerns relating to closely held companies. Some of the underlying problems derive from the fact that the company and top personal tax rates are not aligned but there is a clear need for Inland Revenue to strengthen enforcement of the rules for closely held companies. The Group also recommends that the Government explore options to enable the flexibility of a wider gap between the company and top personal tax rates without a reduction in the integrity of the tax system. 21. The Group recommends that Inland Revenue should have the ability to require a shareholder to provide security to Inland Revenue if: (i) the company owes a debt to Inland Revenue; (ii) the company is owed a debt by the shareholder; and (iii) there is doubt as to the ability and/or the intention of the shareholder to repay the debt. Trusts 22. With the alignment of the trustee rate and the personal income rate, the trust tax rules are basically sound. Many of the remaining challenges associated with trusts relate to deeper issues in the tax system, such as the inconsistent taxation of capital income and should be considered within that context. 23. The one discrete issue that may need attention relates to trading in trust losses. The Group recommends that the Government consider this issue if the general anti-avoidance rule is insufficient, potentially in tandem with a review of the loss-continuity rules for companies. Tax technical capability 24. The integrity issues identified in this report and ones identified in the past, have all come from the work of technically skilled investigators. No matter how good the tax policy and tax administration systems are, tax investigation is a complicated task. The Group recommends that Inland Revenue continue to invest in the technical and investigatory skills of its staff. 102 Future of Tax Recommendations The administration of the tax system For supporting commentary, see Chapter 17 of the Group’s Interim Report, which is available at: https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax- interim-report-html#section-22 25. Tax policy is given effect, day in and day out, through the administration of the tax system. The quality of administration is central to public perceptions of the legitimacy and fairness of tax policy; the effectiveness of administration will determine the Government’s ability to achieve its policy intent in levying taxation. Tax secrecy and tax transparency 26. Tax secrecy is a topical issue in tax administration at the moment. The Group recommends that the Government release more statistical and aggregated information about the tax system (so long as it does not reveal data about specific individuals or corporates that is not otherwise publicly available). The Government could consider further measures to increase transparency as public attitudes change over time. 27. The Group also recognises there is a need for good quality data for both the public and the Government to understand the current functioning of the tax system, and to provide the basis for advice when further changes are contemplated in the future. 28. Areas of likely need include data on the distribution of income, wealth and taxation, effective tax rates, international taxation, the finance sector, different sources of income, and compliance. The Group recommends that the Government build the ability of its agencies, including Inland Revenue and Stats NZ, to provide such information and make it available to the public for information and research purposes. This would be assisted by interagency collaboration with MBIE to increase transparency regarding the beneficial ownership of companies and limited partnerships. 29. To better understand the profile of capital income, wealth and its owners in New Zealand, the Group recommends that the Government: • fund an oversampling of this group in existing wealth surveys • include a question on wealth in the Census • request Inland Revenue to regularly repeat its analysis of the tax paid by high-wealth individuals (Inland Revenue, 2016) • commission research, using a variety of sources of data on capital income (including administrative data) to estimate the wealth of individuals. 30. As part of the Government’s efforts to build a more sustainable economy, the Group encourages Inland Revenue to collect information on income and expenditure associated with environmental outcomes that are part of the tax calculation. Tax disputes 31. The Group also recognises there is a need to improve the resolution of tax disputes. The Group recommends the establishment of a taxpayer advocacy service to assist taxpayers in disputes with Inland Revenue and also recommends that the Office of the Ombudsman be adequately resourced to carry out its functions in relation to tax. 32. Following the introduction of a taxpayer advocacy service, the Group recommends that the Government design a truncated tax dispute process for small taxpayers. 103 Future of Tax Recommendations The development of tax policy 33. The Group has discussed opportunities to improve the development of tax policy and legislation. In particular, it is important to include a more diverse range of voices in the development of tax policy. To achieve this outcome, the Group recommends the use of the following principles to guide public engagement on tax policy: • Good faith engagement by all participants. • Engagement with a wider range of stakeholders, particularly including greater engagement with Māori (guided by the Government’s emerging engagement model for Māori/Crown Relations). • Earlier and more frequent engagement. • The use of a greater variety of engagement methods. • Greater transparency and accountability on the part of the Government. 34. The Group has noted the need for the Treasury to play a strong role in tax policy development and for Inland Revenue to maintain deep technical expertise and strategic policy capability, including greater strength in environmental issues and a Te Ao Māori perspective. Legislative frameworks 35. The Group encourages the continuing use of purpose clauses in legislation, where appropriate, and recommends the inclusion of an overriding purpose clause in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to specify Parliament’s purpose in levying taxation. 36. This overriding clause could explain that the legislation specifies the: • rules for effective and efficient administration and collection of tax revenues so the Government can improve the wellbeing of New Zealanders • rights and obligations of taxpayers • rights and obligations of Inland Revenue. Matters requiring further work The Group wishes to highlight the following issues for further work by the Government. Charities For supporting commentary, see Chapter 16 of the Group’s Interim Report, which is available at: https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax- interim-report-html#section-21 37. Charities and non-profit organisations make important contributions to the wellbeing of New Zealand. The activities of these organisations enhance the social, human and natural capital of New Zealand. In turn, the Government supports the work of charities by offering tax exemptions for charity income and tax benefits for donations to charities. Business income, accumulation and distribution 38. The Group received many submissions regarding the treatment of business income for charities and whether the tax exemption for charitable business income confers an unfair advantage on the trading operations of charities. 39. The Group considers that the underlying issue is more about the extent to which charities are distributing or applying the surpluses from their activities for the benefit of the charitable purpose. If a charitable business regularly distributes its funds to its head charity, or provides services connected with its charitable purposes, it will not accumulate capital faster than a taxpaying business. 40. The question, then, is whether the broader policy settings for charities are encouraging appropriate levels of distribution. The Group recommends the Government periodically review the charitable sector’s use of what would otherwise be tax revenue, to verify that the intended social outcomes are actually being achieved. 104 Future of Tax Recommendations 41. In this regard, the Group notes that other countries, such as Canada, have introduced regimes where all registered charities are required to spend a minimum amount each year on their own charitable activities or on gifts to qualified donees (for example, other charities). Private charitable foundations and trusts 42. The Group is concerned about the treatment of private charitable foundations and trusts. These foundations and trusts benefit from the donor tax concessions but are not required to have arm’s-length governance boards or distribution policies. The rules around these foundations and trusts appear to be unusually loose. 43. The Group recommends that the Government consider whether to apply a distinction between privately controlled foundations and other charitable organisations and removing concessions for privately controlled foundations or trusts that do not have arm’s-length governance or distribution policies. Other rules 44. The Group considers that the charity deregistration tax rules could be amended to more effectively keep assets in the sector and also questions whether the current GST concessions for non-profit bodies are appropriate. 45. The Government has launched a review of the Charities Act 2005 to ensure it remains effective and fit for purpose. The Group has provided its analysis to Inland Revenue and the Department of Internal Affairs for further consideration as part of the Charities Review and the Tax Policy Work Programme. GST and financial transaction taxes For supporting commentary, see Chapter 12 of the Group’s Interim Report, which is available at: https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax- interim-report-html#section-17 46. GST has proven to be a stable and efficient tax base and is a major source of revenue for the Government. The Group acknowledges public concerns about the regressive nature of GST but has decided not to recommend a reduction in the GST rate or the introduction of new GST exceptions (for example, for food and drink). 47. This is because there are more effective ways to increase progressivity than a reduction in the rate of GST. Increases in welfare transfers would have a greater impact on low-income households. Changes to personal income tax can also have a greater impact on low- and middle-income earners. GST exceptions are complex, poorly targeted for achieving distributional goals and generate significant compliance costs. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the benefit of specific GST exceptions are passed on to consumers. 48. Further, if GST is removed from one good or service, it becomes difficult to argue against further exceptions on similar grounds. Increasing numbers of exceptions will erode the GST base and require tax increases elsewhere to make up the lost revenue. 49. The Group also notes that maintaining a GST rate of 15% ensures that this tax is collected from people who would not otherwise be in the tax base, such as tourists. 105 Future of Tax Recommendations The treatment of financial services 50.One other problematic aspect of GST relates to the treatment of financial services. Financial services are not subject to GST for reasons of administrative complexity. There is a strong in-principle case to apply GST to financial services but the Group has not been able to identify a means of doing so that is both feasible and efficient. The Government should monitor international developments in this area. Low-value imported goods 51.The Group has already reported to Ministers on the issue of GST on low-value imported goods and the Government is advancing this work. Financial transactions taxes 52.The Group recognises there is active international debate on financial transaction taxes, which should be monitored. However, it does not recommend the introduction of a financial transactions tax at this point. Corrective taxes For supporting commentary, see Chapter 10 of the Group’s Interim Report, which is available at: https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax- interim-report-html#section-15 53.A corrective tax is a type of tax that is primarily intended to change behaviour and lead to better health and wellbeing outcomes for New Zealanders. 44 Outside of the environmental sphere, New Zealand currently levies corrective taxes on the consumption of alcohol and tobacco. 54.Some submitters have suggested the development of a framework for deciding when to apply corrective taxes (similar to the framework developed by the Group for the use of environmental taxes). The Group supports this suggestion. 44 Some submitters have suggested that the Group use the terms ‘health-promoting taxes’ or ‘behavioural-enhancing taxes’ instead of ‘corrective taxes’. While acknowledging that these taxes can be used to promote health or enhance behaviour, the Group prefers to use the term ‘corrective taxes’, as it is generally understood in the field of tax policy. Alcohol and tobacco excise 55.Detailed recommendations on the rates of alcohol and tobacco excise are beyond the expertise of the Group. However, the Group does recommend the Government simplify the schedule of alcohol excise rates and is concerned about the distributional impact of further increases in tobacco excise beyond the increases that have already been scheduled. 56.The Group’s preference is that, once the current schedule of tobacco excise increases end, the Government prioritise other measures to help people stop smoking before it considers further large increases in tobacco excises. Some of the revenue from tobacco excise could also be directed towards smoking-cessation programmes. Sugar taxes 57.The Group acknowledges widespread public interest in the adoption of a sugar tax. The case for a sugar tax must rest on a clear view of the Government’s objectives. If the Government wishes to reduce the consumption of sugar across the board, a sugar tax is likely to be an effective response. If the Government wishes to reduce the sugar content of particular products, regulation is likely to be more effective. In either case, there is a need to consider the use of taxation alongside other potential policy responses. 58.The Group has provided the relevant agencies with its work on these issues. 106 Future of Tax Recommendations Housing For supporting commentary, see Chapter 8 of the Group’s Interim Report, which is available at: https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax- interim-report-html#section-13 59. Housing affordability is one of the key issues for consideration by the Group. The Terms of Reference direct the Group to have special regard to housing affordability, as well as to consider whether housing tax measures would improve the tax system. The Group’s work on housing affordability is closely linked with its work on the taxation of capital income. 60. Since the Interim Report, the Group has given further consideration to a tax on vacant residential land, or on empty homes in residential areas, to encourage the use of existing urban areas. There are international examples that could inform the development of similar taxes in New Zealand. 61. These types of taxes would appear to be most feasible in cases where a local authority has rezoned the land and provided infrastructure but the land remains vacant. The Group recommends that the Productivity Commission include these taxes within its review of local government funding and financing. The main risk with these taxes is that they encourage the token (rather than substantive) use of land or homes. 62. The Group’s view is that such taxes are best levied at the local rather than the national level. Any new housing spurred on by these taxes would also need to occur on a planned and environmentally sustainable basis. 107 Future of Tax Recommendations Appendix A: Assumptions in projected revenue for extending the taxation of capital gains Assumption: Growth rate 1. The value of residential investment property is assumed to grow at a 3% nominal annual rate (2% inflation plus 1% real growth rate). That rate is also used for other categories of real property. 2. New Zealand shares are assumed to appreciate at 3% per year. 45 Assumption: Size of base 3. Table A.1 shows how initial values (from 1 April 2021) were derived from the most recently available data. Prices are assumed to increase at a rate of 3% per year until 1 April 2021. In addition, the base for residential rental property, second homes and commercial and industrial property are assumed to increase by an additional 2.8% to reflect additional building investment. 45 NZX capital index information shows New Zealand shares appreciated by 3.7% per year, on average, from 1990-2017. 46 The values for second homes have been uplifted by historical appreciation rates from 2014-2018. From 2018 onwards the uplift is based on an assumed 3% price appreciation and 2.8% new investment. 4. For managed fund assets the total value of shareholdings are projected to grow at 5% per annum. Assumption: Turnover rate 5. The costings are on a realisation basis for all assets not held by managed funds. For real property, holding periods are taken from Corelogic data for property sold from 2008-2018. The average holding period using this data is: • residential investment property: 8.4 years • commercial and industrial property: 8.7 years • agricultural property: 9 years. 6. New Zealand shares are assumed to have an average turnover rate of 33% (based on data from World Federation of Exchanges).

The costings assume that extending the taxation of capital gains will cause behavioural changes through a ‘lock-in effect’. The costings assume that the average holding period will increase by 10% as a result of this lock-in effect. 47 Assumption: Rollover relief 8. The costing incorporates rollover relief recommendations made by the Group. The assumptions regarding these rollovers are based on the following in Table A.2. Assumption: Average marginal tax rate 9. The assumed average marginal tax rates for each property category: 48 • Residential rental property and second homes: 26%. • Commercial, industrial and other property: 25%. • Rural property: 25%. 47 This 10% is based on the difference in average holding periods between New Zealand and Australia. 48 The average tax rates for real property are based on the average tax rates for small and medium enterprises in New Zealand that earned untaxed realised gains. These are increased slightly to account for large enterprises that are likely to be on the 28% rate. • Domestic listed shares not held by managed funds: 28%. • Domestic shares held by managed funds: 25%. 10. The average tax rate for rural, commercial, industrial and other land is assumed to be 1 percentage point lower as a result of allowing small businesses sold in retirement to utilise PIE tax rates. Risks: Risks that the projected revenue could be understated 11. Unknown parts of the base – The projected base uses elements of the base that are known through published statistics – values of real property and New Zealand shares. Some elements of the base are not known and so are not costed. These include shares in Australian listed companies, shares in private companies and intangible property such as goodwill, brands, trademarks and intellectual property. Table A.2: ProposalProperty it affects Proportion of realisations covered by rollover reliefSource Replacement active assets held by small businesses (turnover <$5m) Rural, commercial, industrial and ‘other’ land 34% of rural, commercial, industrial and ‘other’ land sales Annual enterprise survey and Linked Employer-Employee Dataset. Based on proportion of: • fixed assets held by businesses in sales threshold • non-residential land held passively • self-employed that appear to be retiring. Inherited property, relationship property and insurance All assets costed10% for land 5% for shares For inherited land, rollover assumption based on proportion of land transfers that were made to an executor in 2018. For relationship property and shares acquired through an inheritance, rollover assumption estimated using methodology in (Briggs, 2008). Insurance rollover based on value of insurance proceeds for commercial damage. 109 Future of Tax Recommendations Risks: Risks that the forecast revenue could be overstated 12. Overlap with current revenue account property – Some property is already subject to tax on gain when sold (revenue account property). The most significant of these are real property sold by developers and dealers. This is not adjusted for owing to lack of information. This also includes property subject to the bright- line rule and taxable under the intention test. 13. Compliance with rules – The costing assumes full compliance with the rules for extending the taxation of capital gains. Revenue may be lower as a result of non-compliance. Risks: Risks that could either overstate or understate the forecast 14. Variation from assumptions – actual conditions may vary from what is assumed. In particular, the actual appreciation rate is likely to vary over time and be both above and below the assumed growth rate at times. Other factors, such as size of the base and turnover rates, could also vary from the assumptions. The impact of rollover reliefs are difficult to estimate as there is a lack of data regarding who would be able to utilise reliefs. 15. The impact of any variations of assumptions is significant. Small changes in the main assumptions can lead to significant changes in the revenue projections. As a result the projected revenue should be considered as indicative and subject to considerable uncertainty. 16. In addition, revenue from taxing capital gains is likely to be volatile and be greater when there is asset price growth and decline when asset prices fall. 17. Revenue estimates for the taxation of capital gains are done for capital gains earned during tax years. Revenue estimates may change when accruing revenue to specific fiscal years. 110 Future of Tax Recommendations 111 Future of Tax Recommendations Appendix B: Summary of consultation and submissions The Group received over 600 submissions on its Interim Report. 49 The Group considered the submissions as part of its decision-making process and is grateful for the time and effort that people put into submissions. The main topics submitted on were an extension to the taxation of capital gains, environmental and ecological outcomes, retirement savings and personal income. The high-level themes of submissions on these topics are outlined below. The Group also undertook some targeted consultation on the implications of the proposals and ideas raised in the Interim Report. This included Māori engagement and consultation on environmental and ecological issues. The Group is grateful for the invitations members received to discuss matters raised in the Interim Report. Regretfully, the Group was not able to meet with all interested submitters. Extension to the taxation of capital gains Following the release of the Group’s Interim Report, the Group consulted widely with expert stakeholders on the topic of an extension to the taxation of capital gains. This included meetings with key tax policy stakeholders, such as Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and the Corporate Taxpayers Group. The Group consulted with Australian experts that spoke to the nature of Australia’s capital gains tax regime and the 49 Submissions formally closed on 1 November 2018. Six hundred and eighteen submissions were received by 12 November 2018 and form the basis of this analysis. implications for New Zealand. The Group also received many submissions about an extension to the taxation of capital gains. A summary of the key design elements that were raised most frequently by submitters is outlined below. Excluded home In its Terms of Reference, the Group was asked to exclude the family home and the land under it from the design of any extension of the taxation of capital gains. Twenty-six submissions commented on the topic of the family home exclusion. Most submitters who commented on this topic supported excluding the family home. However, a number of submitters raised concerns that such an exclusion could lead to a ‘mansion effect’, whereby homeowners would improve their houses, rather than investing in other forms of savings, to get a tax- free return. Some submitters considered this could be addressed to some extent by putting a cap on the value of the property that was excluded from the tax. Some submitters considered that private-use second homes (e.g. baches) should be exempt from any tax on capital gains. This was on the basis that they are personal property in the same way that owner- occupied housing is, rather than income-producing assets. Some submitters considered that modest rural lifestyle blocks that exceeded 4,500m 2 should be exempt and it was also argued that the 4,500m 2 limitation could create compliance difficulties for the farming community. 112 Future of Tax Recommendations Other aspects of the excluded home topic that were commented on included: • ownership of homes by trusts or jointly with extended family • situations where the family owns more than one home (or owns one house but lives elsewhere for work reasons) • ensuring that interests held via flat-owning companies would be entitled to the excluded home rule, and • ensuring that the design of the excluded home rule would not hinder people from borrowing against their property to fund their retirement (‘reverse mortgages’). Valuation Day and compliance costs Ten submitters specifically commented on the ‘Valuation Day’ approach preferred by the Tax Working Group in the Interim Report. All of these submitters were either opposed to or expressed concern with this approach, specifically owing to the high compliance cost and uncertainty associated with ascertaining the value of assets for their entry into the tax base. In particular, submitters thought that obtaining business valuations would be difficult, the market may not have the capacity to carry out the number of valuations required and that disputes over the estimated values may arise. Submitters emphasised the need for low compliance cost methods for determining an asset’s value and stressed that ‘near enough’ is ‘good enough’ to help manage compliance costs. The preferred alternative to a ‘Valuation Day’ approach was the approach taken in Australia where the rules applied to all assets acquired after the commencement date. In addition to the initial costs associated with a Valuation Day approach, a number of submissions also commented more generally on the compliance costs from extending the taxation of capital gains. Submitters were concerned that the tax would require many complex rules and that compliance costs may be high relative to the additional revenue that the tax would raise. Rollover and loss ring-fencing 22 submitters made submissions on rollover. Most advocated for specific forms of rollover but several also pointed out that rollover creates complexity and emphasised the importance of a clear framework to ensure it is coherent. Several submitters supported rollover for sales of business assets followed by reinvestment but did not always make clear whether they supported requiring the reinvestment to be in a replacement asset. Some submitters supported rollover for business reorganisations with no change in ownership in substance. Some submitters supported rollover on death in some form. Some submitters also supported rollover that accounts for the way that Māori assets are held collectively and passed down from generations. The few submitters that commented on involuntary disposals (e.g. forced sales and separations) supported rollover relief for such situations. Only one submitter was generally opposed to rollover that allowed tax liability to be deferred indefinitely even where assets had changed hands. Nine submitters spoke to general ring-fencing of capital losses with a majority opposed. Some of these submitters queried whether concerns about taxpayers cherry-picking losses and deferring gains could be better addressed by other means, such as targeted anti-avoidance rules or requiring losses to be offset against rolled over gains first before being available to offset other income. A few submissions also opposed, or asked the Government to reconsider, rental loss ring-fencing. Shares There were 15 submissions to the Interim Report that focused on how extending the taxation of capital gains would apply to shares. Issues raised in these submissions included: • The extension should not apply to New Zealand and listed Australian shares. It was argued that taxing these would discourage investment in such assets, particularly if there was no change to the taxation of other shares (i.e. if the fair dividend rate continues to apply). 113 Future of Tax Recommendations • Any changes to the taxation of shares has to apply both to direct investment and funds, to preserve neutrality. • If Australasian shares are taxed, for funds, the taxation should be on an accrual basis, with a discount to recognise the time value of money. • Listed portfolio investment entity (PIE) treatment for share-owning listed PIEs should be replaced by an extension of the multi rate PIE regime, though this would require updated registry systems. • If shares are taxed, this should be on an RFRM basis. • Double taxation issues raised by taxing both companies and shares in companies are real and need to be addressed. They could be solved by taxing only at the investor level, or the company level. • The effect of taxing sales of shares on corporate groups needs to be considered. The Australian single economic entity approach was not supported. • Taxing shares is double taxation because the shares have often been acquired using tax paid income. Building depreciation and seismic strengthening All 10 submitters who commented on building depreciation supported reinstating depreciation. Some submitters commented that building depreciation should be reinstated regardless of the decisions reached on extending the taxation of capital gains and one submitter supported raising the corporate tax rate to fund the fiscal cost if required. There was generally more support for depreciation on commercial and industrial buildings than on residential buildings and for the proposal to reinstate depreciation for multi-unit residential buildings but not standalone residential buildings. One submitter considered that the current position allowing the Commissioner to set provisional rates for buildings with an expected useful life of less than 50 years was not working adequately. Several submitters acknowledged the large fiscal cost of reinstating building depreciation and were generally supportive of a phased reintroduction. Few submitters commented on the depreciation rate, though the ones that did supported the previous rates of 2% straight- line or 3% diminishing value. Eight submitters agreed with the Group’s comment in the Interim Report that the current tax treatment of seismic strengthening is counterintuitive (namely that a deduction is allowed if a building collapses but deductions cannot be claimed in respect of expenditure to strengthen a building). They noted that there is a large public benefit gained from seismic strengthening. These submitters wanted the Group to recommend a change to the current treatment, whether that was a deduction or an ability to depreciate. One submitted that any change should be retrospective so that taxpayers who have already strengthened their buildings are not disadvantaged. Another submitted that the tax treatment should not distinguish between residential owner occupiers and other taxpayers (e.g. investors, landlords, commercial building owners). Risk-free rate of return method (RFRM) The Group received 27 submissions following the Interim Report on the topic of the risk-free rate of return method. These submissions were generally negative. In particular, submitters highlighted the following issues: • the lack of cash flow to pay the tax • the requirement for up-to-date valuations • the perception that it encourages people to take on debt to reduce equity • that the tax could vary based on interest rates over time • the perception that it could discourage improvements which previously that have received a tax deduction • that it may result in sale of assets by Māori organisations to meet tax liabilities as a number of settlement assets are locked into low yields as part of the settlement process • that it would inappropriately tax land that is used for public purposes (even if privately owned) and is not generating income. Some submitters favoured the simplicity of the tax and thought it provided greater certainty than a realisation-based capital gains tax and that it would lead to fewer disputes. 114 Future of Tax Recommendations Environmental and ecological outcomes Consultation on environmental tax issues occurred through three avenues: focus groups made up of primarily representatives from environmental interest groups who had made earlier submissions to the Group; industry meetings with representatives from energy and agriculture sectors; and written feedback from participants in either the focus groups or industry meetings. In addition, the Group received 459 submissions (including 430 standard form submissions based on a New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union template) that commented on environmental tax issues in the Interim Report. A diversity of views was expressed in consultation. Overall, feedback was generally supportive of the frameworks, although there were a range of proposed changes. A common message from environmental interest groups was that the report did not go far enough to acknowledge New Zealand’s pressing environmental problems and the urgency of action. Industry representatives raised a number of concerns, including about how taxes would practically work and their efficacy for addressing particular environmental problems. Submissions were generally supportive of the Group’s focus on environmental issues and the potential for environmental taxes to play a greater role in the tax base. Most submitters were supportive of the Group’s suggested frameworks for when to use environmental taxes, although some submitters suggested additional design principles and criteria, or raised concerns about consistency with other tax policy principles. There were mixed views on hypothecation of environmental tax revenues – most submitters supported the Group’s recommendation in the Interim Report to ring-fence revenue for environmental purposes, while a minority were opposed. Several submitters raised industry-specific concerns about the adverse impacts of particular taxes, especially relating to hydroelectric generation and agriculture. There were calls for the Group to give greater consideration to the broader impacts of the tax system on natural capital. There was also significant opposition (the vast majority from submissions based on a New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union template) to the Group’s recommended changes to the emissions trading scheme and the waste disposal levy on the basis of their impact on households and the lack of an objective framework accounting for both costs and benefits. Engagement with Māori In October 2018 the Tax Working Group carried out engagement hui with Māori in five locations around New Zealand. The objectives of this process were to ensure that the recommendations and ideas raised in the Interim Report were well understood by Māori organisations and to collect feedback to inform further advice. In relation to the Māori authority regime, participants expressed support for the Group’s recommendation to extend the 17.5% tax rate to wholly-owned subsidiaries of Māori authorities. A number of issues were raised concerning extending the taxation of capital gains. While there was generally support for making the tax system fairer, there was concern that in practice it may generate more inequities. A key area of discussion was around how principles of rollover might apply to the acquisition of ancestral land by collectively owned Māori organisations and the reorganisation of assets within iwi or other Māori entities. Participants also spoke about the difficulties associated with attracting capital to develop Māori Freehold Land, as well as the legislative and practical issues that arise from owning such land collectively With regards to He Ara Waiora and the development of a Te Ao Māori framework for tax policy, participants were generally supportive of the intent but signalled clearly the risks of tokenism and were interested in seeing more work on how the framework could have practical application. Following the hui, Sacha McMeeking (Head of Māori Studies, University of Canterbury) presented a consolidated response from the Māori engagement process to the Group, supporting the direction of the work and recommending that He Ara Waiora be taken forward by the Treasury in the context of the Living Standards Framework. 115 Future of Tax Recommendations A range of other issues were also raised. There was widespread interest in seeing efforts to preserve and develop natural ecosystems recognised, for example, through biodiversity tax credits. There was considerable discussion on charities and interest from Māori in the Department of Internal Affairs’ review of the Charities Act 2005. Participants expressing a desire for greater recognition for the extensive amount of unpaid work done by Māori was also a theme of discussions. Retirement savings The Group received thirty-four submissions on the topic of retirement savings. Submitters who commented on the issue of retirement savings had a mixed view of the recommendations in the Interim Report. While there was general support for the Group’s position, some submitters believed that the Group had not adequately made the case for retirement saving tax incentives. Further, most submitters who supported the Group’s retirement savings proposals advised that the proposals should be applied more broadly, rather than being restricted to KiwiSaver. In particular, it was argued that the Group’s proposal to reduce the lower PIE tax rates for KiwiSaver funds should be extended to all PIEs. It was argued that this would avoid distortions and prevent practical issues from arising for KiwiSaver scheme providers that also offer other PIE products to investors. In light of the Group’s equity objectives, some submitters also recommended raising the top PIE tax rate to 33% to align it with the top personal income tax rate and the trust tax rate. Many submitters also had a view on the Group’s proposal to provide an employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) exemption for amounts paid to individuals earning up to $48,000 per year. It was argued that this proposal could be complicated to administer for employers because they would not necessarily be aware of an employee’s income other than employment income (and they may also have income from a second job). Instead, it was suggested by some submitters that Inland Revenue is better placed to provide a credit for ESCT once it is verified that an individual has total income under the recommended $48,000 threshold. Submitters also considered that an ESCT exemption should be available for non-KiwiSaver retirement schemes, such as workplace savings schemes. Personal income The Group received 465 submissions (including 437 standard form submissions based on a New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union template) on the topic of personal income taxation. Submissions were generally positive, particularly in relation to reducing the income tax rates for lower- and middle-income earners. Some submitters thought that the Group should have considered a steeper progressive tax scale, particularly at the higher-income level. There was also significant support (the vast majority of which came from standard form submissions based on a New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union template) for indexing of tax thresholds such that they are adjusted with changes in average earnings or inflation. Civil society engagement Following the release of the Interim Report, members of the Group met with a number of representatives of the civil society sector. A broad range of tax issues were raised. On extending the taxation of capital gains, some submitters thought that the family home and houses held in Trusts should not be exempt from tax. However, if family homes were to be exempt, submitters were supportive of the Group’s suggestion to include an upper threshold of $5 million. On the environment, several submitters thought that the role of tax should be to incentivise behaviour change. This would mean that environment taxes would potentially collect almost no revenue if successful in changing behaviours. Some submitters disagreed with the Group’s recommendation that the ETS should be ‘tax-like’. One submitter was supportive of the recommendation to review alcohol and tobacco excise structures. Concerns were raised that these taxes are aimed at changing behaviour, however, demand for the products are inelastic meaning behaviour doesn’t change and only revenue is generated. 116 Future of Tax Recommendations Concerns were raised about inconsistencies between the tax and the transfer systems, such as unit of assessment (i.e. household vs individual) and treatment of gifts. Some submitters were concerned about aspects of the analysis in the Interim Report. The Interim Report includes analysis showing the higher deciles paying disproportionately higher levels of tax than other deciles. Some submitters viewed this analysis as incomplete, given these groups had both disproportionately higher levels of income and untaxed capital gains. There was also concern that income from capital gains was not part of the income in some distributional analyses. There was support expressed for a range of measures, including a gift tax; a tourist tax (to address environmental concerns); the Group’s recommendation for a centralised Crown debt collection agency; and for continuing work on a financial activities tax and the stabilisation role of the tax system. Corrective taxes Members of the Group met with representatives of public health providers and researchers. There was concern over the term ‘corrective taxes’ as their preferred term was ‘health promoting taxes’. There was also concern with the use of the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) framework and a preference for development of a framework similar to the one developed for environmental and ecological taxation. For tobacco there was concern that the Group was proposing that the current schedule of increases be stopped in preference for measures to help people stop smoking. There were mixed views on the Group’s recommendation that the Government should consider other measures for tobacco control after the current schedule of increases end. Some submitters agreed with the Group’s concern about the recessive nature of a tax on an addictive substance while others felt this concern was overplayed as compensatory measures were possible. One submitter argued for any increase in tobacco excise to come in on 1 July rather than 1 January as there were no services available to help cease smoking in January. For alcohol there was general support of the recommendation to review the excise structure. However, there was concern with a suggestion that the alcohol content be taxed on a linear volumetric basis. This was because it would make spirits relatively less expensive than wine and beer, changing the price signals we have now. An alternative proposal was for three bands of excise, a low band for low alcohol products, a wine and beer band, and a high band for spirits and ready- mix drinks. Overall, submitters wanted to see a 50% rise in excise rates, pointing to overseas evidence suggesting it would have a positive behavioural response and reduce harm. Other issues raised in submissions In addition to the main topics that were submitted on and outlined above, submissions were also made on a number of other topics, including the following: • housing affordability • international tax • GST and financial transactions taxes • taxation of business • integrity of the tax system • charities, and • administration of the tax system. A large number of the submissions received by the Group were made with the use of a New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union template. Submissions received with this template generally made the following points (other than those mentioned in relation to the topics above): • There should not be any new tax on capital but if there is, that the revenue generated from such a policy is used to reduce other taxation. • There should be a tax exemption for the inflation component of interest income. • There should not be increases to tobacco excise or alcohol excise. • There should not be a sugar tax. 117 Future of Tax Recommendations Appendix C: List of Secretariat and other advice In the course of its consideration of the issues discussed in this report, the Group received advice papers from its Secretariat (a cross-agency group of officials mainly from the Treasury and Inland Revenue) and external officials. Some Group members also provided notes for the consideration of their colleagues. A list of that advice follows.

been established by the Government in order to examine further improvements in the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. The New Zealand tax system has been justifiably commended internationally for being a simple and efficient system. The Government’s starting position is that the guiding principle for the New Zealand tax system – namely, that tax should operate neutrally and as much in the background as possible – is sound. The Working Group will consider what improvements to this framework could improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. In particular, the Working Group will consider the impact on the tax system of the likely economic environment over the next decade. The Government has the following objectives for the tax system: • A tax system that is efficient, fair, simple and collected; • A system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy; • A system that supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30 per cent of GDP; • A system that treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner, having special regard to housing affordability; • A progressive tax and transfer system for individuals and families, and • An overall tax system that operates in a simple and coherent manner. The Working Group should report to the Government on: • Whether the tax system operates fairly in relation to taxpayers, income, assets and wealth; • Whether the tax system promotes the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy; • Whether there are changes to the tax system which would make it more fair, balanced and efficient; and • Whether there are other changes which would support the integrity of the income tax system, having regard to the interaction of the systems for taxing companies, trusts and individuals. In examining the points above, the Working Group should consider in particular the following: • The economic environment that will apply over the next 5-10 years, taking into account demographic change and the impact of changes in technology and employment practices and how these are driving different business models; • Whether a system of taxing capital gains or land (not applying to the family home or the land under it), or other housing tax measures, would improve the tax system; • Whether a progressive company tax (with a lower rate for small companies) would improve the tax system and the business environment, and 122 Future of Tax Recommendations • What role the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term. In considering the matters above, the Working Group should have due regard to the overall structure of the tax system to ensure it is fair, balanced and efficient, as well as simple for taxpayers to understand and comply with their tax obligations. The following are outside the scope of the Working Group’s review: • Increasing any income tax rate or the rate of GST; • Inheritance tax; • Any other changes that would apply to the taxation of the family home or the land under it, and • The adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system (this will be considered as part of a separate review of Working for Families). In addition, the focus of the Working Group should not be on more technical matters already under review as part of the Tax Policy Work Programme, including: • International tax reform under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agenda; and • Policy changes as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The Working Group will be able to recommend further reviews be undertaken on specific issues which the group considers it has not been able to explore sufficiently, or that were excluded from its Terms of Reference but which could benefit from being considered in the context of its recommendations. The Working Group’s membership will include individual(s) with expertise in Māori community and business environments. The Working Group will be supported by a secretariat of officials from Treasury and Inland Revenue and it will be able to seek independent advice and analysis on any matter within the scope of its Terms of Reference. The Working Group will have an independent advisor to analyse the various sources of advice received by the Working Group and help to analyse and distil the information to assist the Working Group’s deliberations. The Working Group will be expected to engage with the public in developing its recommendations. The Working Group should have its first meeting no later than February 2018, issue an Interim Report to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue no later than September 2018, and issue a final report to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue no later than February 2019. These dates may be varied with the consent of the Minister of Finance. 123 Future of Tax Recommendations Glossary Accommodation supplement: A non-taxable benefit payment that provides cash assistance for a person’s accommodation costs in the private market (both owners and renters).
