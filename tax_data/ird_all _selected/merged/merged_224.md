The articles are in single-column format, and where one refers to other material that’s available on our Website, a link will take you directly to the second article. Online TIB articles now appear on our website as soon as they're available – even before the whole TIB for the month is finalised at mid-month. For example, you can read the first July TIB articles on our website from mid-June onwards. At the mid-July cut-off date we’ll finalise the July TIB, and start uploading the August articles for you to read. Individual TIB articles will print satisfactorily from the online TIB, but it’s not the best format if you want to print out the whole TIB. Printable TIB (PDF format) All TIBs from July 1989 (the start of the TIB) are available in Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF). Use this version if you want to print out the whole TIB to use as a paper copy. The result you get will look essentially the same as the hard copy TIB that we mail out. However, the double-column layout means this version is not easy to read on-screen. Where to find us Our website is at: www.ird.govt.nz It also includes other Inland Revenue information which you may find useful, including any draft binding rulings and interpretation statements that are available. If you find that you prefer the TIB from our website and no longer need a paper copy, please let us know so we can take you off our mailing list. NEW SERVICE IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 1 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Livestock – 1998 national average market values This determination may be cited as “The National Average Market Values of Specified Livestock Determination, 1998”. This determination is made in terms of section EL 8(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and shall apply to specified livestock on hand at the end of the 1997-98 income year. For the purposes of section EL 8(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 the national average market values of specified livestock, for the 1997-98 income year, are as set out in the following table.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Fringe benefit tax – prescribed interest rate increased to 11.23% The prescribed interest rate used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment related loans has been increased to 11.23% for the quarter beginning on 1 July 1998. This rate will continue to apply to subsequent quarters until it is further adjusted. The prescribed rate is up from 10.50% for the quarter that began on 1 April 1998.

The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will insert a new asset class “Hi-trim shelter trimmers” into the “Agriculture, Horti- culture and Aquaculture” industry category, with a depreciation rate of 18% D.V. (12.5% S.L.), based on an estimated useful life of 10 years. The proposed deprecia- tion rate will apply to the trimmer itself and the sub- frame that mounts on to the tractor. The tractor itself should be depreciated as a separate asset using the appropriate depreciation rate. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rate is based on the estimated useful life set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 8 Comparators (consumer electronics comparative display units) Draft general depreciation determination We have been advised that there is currently no suitable general depreciation rate for consumer electronics comparative display units, known in the electronics and retail industries as “comparators”. These units are placed in retail outlets where they are used to display electronic products, such as car audio products, and allow potential customers to “sample” and compare product ranges. A typical comparator will comprise: •custom designed and built wooden/metal frame •power supply and switching units •battery. Due to the continually changing nature of the product ranges being displayed using these comparators, the average useful life of a comparator is approximately three years. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will insert a new asset class “Comparators (Consumer Electronics Comparative Display Units)” into the “Shops” industry category, with a depreciation rate of 50% D.V. (40% S.L.), based on an estimated useful life of 3 years. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rate is based on the estimated useful life set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 9 Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Rev- enue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess tax- payers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. Meaning of “incurred” – the Privy Council decision in the Mitsubishi case The appendix to this TIB considers the Privy Council decision Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited (1995) 17 NZTC 12,351. That case dealt with the timing of deductions and, in particular, the meaning of “incurred” (as it now appears in section BD 2(1)(b)) in the context of warranty expenditure. The Privy Council held that the taxpayer in the case incurred future estimated warranty expenditure in the year in which it sold the warranted vehicles and, as a consequence, was entitled to take a deduction for that estimated expenditure in that income year. The statement sets out Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the meaning of “incurred” in the light of Mitsubishi. It also considers: •what is required in terms of a reasonable estimation of future estimated expenditure; •how to account for estimated liabilities, including in the first year that an estimated basis is adopted; and •the application of section EF 1. See the appendix to this TIB for the full interpretation statement IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 10 Standard practice statements These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. Unacceptable interpretation – non application of a tax law Standard Practice Statement INV-206 Summary If a tax shortfall has been identified and the Commis- sioner is satisfied that the taxpayer did not apply their mind to the tax laws or make an interpretation, the unacceptable interpretation standard will not apply. If a taxpayer has taken the advice of a tax advisor, or a tax advisor has prepared their tax return, the Commis- sioner has the expectation that the tax advisor applied his/her mind to the tax laws and exercised his/her judgment. The unacceptable interpretation standard will apply unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the tax advisor did not apply his/her mind to the tax laws or make an interpretation. This Standard Practice Statement amends SPS INV-205 to the extent that a taxpayer must have turned their mind to the tax laws or made an interpretation to have taken an unacceptable interpretation. Application This practice applies to assessments of the unacceptable interpretation shortfall penalty issued on or after 1 June 1998. Legislation Section 141B(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 defines an unacceptable interpretation as follows: “In relation to a tax position taken by a taxpayer, an unaccept- able interpretation – (a)Is an interpretation or an interpretation of an application of a tax law; and (b)Viewed objectively, that interpretation or application fails to meet the standard of being about as likely as not to be correct.” Background Inland Revenue’s Standard Practice Statement INV-205 set out the policy with respect to “non-application of a tax law” as follows: There may be instances where a taxpayer argues that he or she did not apply a section of the Act, therefore, did not interpret the particular section as applying. Accordingly, the taxpayer contends that the unacceptable interpretation standard does not apply. The non-application of a tax law will in all cases be considered to be applying the tax law. Inland Revenue took the view that, in being liable for a penalty for taking an unacceptable interpretation of the law, taxpayers do not have to put their minds to the particular tax position taken. We have now reviewed this policy, and it will not apply to assessments of the unacceptable interpretation shortfall penalty issued on or after 1 June 1998. Practice applicable from 1 June 1998 If a tax shortfall has been identified and the Commis- sioner is satisfied that a taxpayer did not apply their mind to the tax laws or make an interpretation, the unacceptable interpretation standard will not apply. Therefore, Inland Revenue will not consider whether or not the taxpayer has breached the unacceptable interpre- tation standard. However, we will consider whether or not the taxpayer has been culpable under the reasonable care, gross carelessness or evasion standards. If a taxpayer has taken the advice of a tax advisor, or a tax advisor has prepared the tax return, Inland Revenue expects that the tax advisor has interpreted the tax laws and exercised his/her judgment, so the unacceptable interpretation standard will apply. This is a rebuttable presumption and Inland Revenue will take this position unless the tax advisor can demonstrate that this is not the case. Inland Revenue considers that the following is appropri- ate to each case: (1) Taxpayers who prepare their own returns without the assistance of an advisor A taxpayer takes a tax position that results in a tax shortfall that is based on a tax law and exceeds the threshold for consideration of a penalty for taking an unacceptable interpretation. The taxpayer asserts that they did not apply the law because they did not consider the issue. If the taxpayer’s actions confirm that the taxpayer looked at the legislation and demonstrate that they have considered the tax laws with respect to the transaction, Inland Revenue can consider the unacceptable interpre- tation penalty. If Inland Revenue is satisfied that the taxpayer did not make an interpretation, we will not consider the unac- ceptable interpretation standard. However, the taxpayer IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 11 Examples Business taxpayer – deduction claimed for capital item A business taxpayer employs an office person to com- plete its tax returns. The office person has a knowledge of the tax laws concerning deductible expenditure. During an audit of the company’s 1998 income tax return, it is ascertained that a large item of plant that was purchased during the return period was claimed as deductible expenditure. The expenditure is disallowed and a tax shortfall results which is based upon the application of a tax law and exceeds the threshold for consideration of an unacceptable interpretation penalty. The taxpayer contends that, when they took their tax position, they did not consider the tax laws with respect to the item purchased but that they just claimed the total amount of expenditure as noted in the ledger. They contend that the unacceptable interpretation penalty cannot apply, as they did not make an interpretation of the tax laws. The company has good systems in place from which the tax returns are prepared. The particular purchase was coded to repairs and maintenance. At the time of prepar- ing the tax return, the office person did not check to ensure that items of expenditure that are not deductible for tax purposes were not included. Also, as the total repairs and maintenance for this year was substantially larger than the previous year, the office person should have been aware that it may not have been correct. The taxpayer did not put its mind to the tax laws relevant to the claim – they did not make an interpretation. Therefore, the unacceptable interpretation standard will not apply. However, a taxpayer in that category of taxpayer would be aware that they should have reviewed the expenditure in their accounts to ensure that capital expenditure was not included in the claim for deductible expenditure. The company did not do this so Inland Revenue would consider that it did not take reasonable care. Accord- ingly, the 20% penalty for not taking reasonable care would be imposed. New business taxpayer with professional advisor – GST input claimed early A taxpayer has purchased a franchise to undertake garden maintenance and landscaping. The taxpayer is new to this type of business and is not familiar with the tax laws relating to self-employed people. The taxpayer also registers for GST. The taxpayer engages the services of a tax advisor to provide tax law advice for both income tax and GST and also to prepare the income tax returns. During a GST return period, the taxpayer purchased a section that is intended for use in the taxable activity. The taxpayer was told that a tax invoice would be made continued on page 12 may have breached the reasonable care, gross careless- ness or evasion standards, and we would need to con- sider these. This does not mean that just because Inland Revenue cannot penalise a taxpayer under the objective unaccept- able interpretation standard the penalty for lack of reasonable care, gross carelessness or evasion will automatically be imposed. It means that Inland Revenue will consider whether or not those standards have been breached. (2) Taxpayers who have in-house tax professionals A corporate taxpayer employs tax professionals to make decisions upon the tax treatment of its transactions. The tax employees, also, prepare all of the taxpayer’s tax returns. The taxpayer takes a tax position that results in a tax shortfall that is based on a tax law and exceeds the threshold for consideration of a penalty for taking an unacceptable interpretation. In this case, Inland Revenue will take the view that the tax employees will have interpreted the law with respect to the tax positions taken, and the unacceptable interpre- tation standard applies. The exception would be if the Commissioner were satisfied that the tax employees did not make an interpretation, in which case the unaccept- able interpretation standard would not apply. However, the taxpayer may have breached the reason- able care, gross carelessness or evasion standard and this would be considered. (3) Taxpayer seeks advice from an advisor A taxpayer is unsure of the tax position to take regarding a transaction. The taxpayer seeks the advice of a tax advisor, and that advisor puts their mind to the issue and makes an interpretation. In this case, the unacceptable interpretation penalty can be imposed. This same result would occur if the taxpayer engaged a tax advisor to prepare his/her tax returns. Inland Rev- enue has the expectation that during preparation of the return, the tax advisor has applied their mind to the tax laws and exercised judgment when deciding to take the various tax positions in that return. The exception would be if the Commissioner were satisfied that the tax advisor did not make an interpreta- tion, in which case, the unacceptable interpretation standard will not apply. To be satisfied that a tax agent did not make an interpretation or exercise judgment, Inland Revenue staff will be making inquiries with respect to the tax treatment of transactions in returns prepared by the advisor. In this case, if the taxpayer has reasonably relied upon the advisor, the taxpayer will have met the reasonable care standard. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations Policy IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 12 The taxpayer consults the advisor who advises, after reviewing the tax laws, that sale of the property is covered by the exemption in section CD 1(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and is therefore not taxable. Inland Revenue considers that, as there has been a pattern of buying houses and living in them while renovating them prior to sale, that sale of the particular property is part of the taxpayer’s gross income. A tax shortfall is ascertained which exceeds the thresh- old for requiring an unacceptable interpretation, is based upon the tax law and is a tax position which, viewed objectively, is not about as likely as not to be correct. In this case, the tax advisor has turned his/her mind to the tax laws. Accordingly, the 20% shortfall for taking an unacceptable interpretation penalty is imposed. No apportionment of GST input claim for assets not used in taxable activity A taxpayer registers for GST and purchases a farm that will be used in the taxable activity. Upon completing the first GST return, the taxpayer claims 1/9 of the total purchase price of the property. No apportionment is made for the fact that part of the property will not be used in the taxable activity. The return is audited and the portion of the GST input claim relating to non-taxable supplies is disallowed. The tax shortfall is based upon the application of a tax law and is over the threshold requiring the taxpayer to have an acceptable interpretation. When questioned, the taxpayer advises that they did not know that they could not claim a GST input credit for the portion of the property that did not relate to the taxable activity. The taxpayer claims that they did not interpret the law and did not consider it at all. As the taxpayer did not interpret the law, the unaccept- able interpretation penalty does not apply. When completing the first GST return, a reasonable person in the taxpayer’s circumstances would have inquired about which GST input credits could be claimed. A reasonable person would be expected to read Inland Revenue’s GST guide or consult a tax advisor. The taxpayer didn’t do this, so Inland Revenue considers that the taxpayer did not take reasonable care. Accord- ingly, a 20% penalty for not taking reasonable care would apply. from page 11 available soon, as the property was being purchased from a GST registered person. During the return period, the deposit had been paid and the contract became unconditional. All of the relevant information was provided to the tax advisor. The advisor told the taxpayer to make the claim for the GST input credit for the entire purchase price of the section in the GST return. The tax advisor told the taxpayer that a tax invoice needed to be held but as it was to be made available shortly, the input claim could be made. After the GST return is furnished, the taxpayer becomes aware that the vendor of the property is not GST regis- tered. Therefore, the taxpayer has purchased a second- hand good from an unregistered person. The GST return is audited and the GST input claim relating to the unpaid portion of the property is disal- lowed. The tax shortfall is based upon the application of a tax law and exceeded the threshold for requiring an acceptable interpretation. Even though the taxpayer had not put his mind to the provisions of the law when taking his tax position, he had put his affairs in the hands of an advisor. The test is objective, so the efforts of the taxpayer are not taken into consideration. The tax advisor asserts that the tax laws were not interpreted when the claim for the entire GST input credit was made. However, it is clear from the conversa- tion with the taxpayer that the tax advisor had put his/her mind to the tax laws. The tax advisor was aware that the tax invoice was required when the advice was given. Therefore, the tax advisor had turned his/her mind to the tax laws. The tax advisor, for the taxpayer, had clearly taken an unacceptable interpretation of the law. Accordingly, the 20% penalty for unacceptable interpretation would apply. Business taxpayer with tax advisor The taxpayer is a property developer. He has been in business for a number of years and purchases houses and sections for development. He considers that the proceeds of one particular property that he has purchased and developed are not taxable because he and his family lived in the property for a short period of time prior to sale. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 13 GST returns – correcting minor errors Standard Practice Statement INV-490 Introduction This standard practice statement (SPS) states the Com- missioner’s operational policy on allowing GST regis- tered persons to correct minor errors from earlier GST returns with an adjustment in a subsequent GST return. It replaces the item in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Four, No.7 of March 1993. The purpose of the SPS is to provide a pragmatic solution for correcting GST return errors, consistent with promoting compliance and minimising compliance costs. The amended SPS applies from 1 July 1998, and to adjustments made on or after this date, regardless of the return period when the error occurred. Background The Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (ICANZ) asked Inland Revenue to revise the tolerance that had existed since 1993. This was timely because the standard practice review also looked at the impact of recent reforms such as the Compliance and Penalties regime and Disputes Resolution process. The previous standard practice published in Tax Infor- mation Bulletin Volume Four, No.7 basically allowed a one-off correcting adjustment in the next available return, if correcting the error(s) would result in less than $50 of tax to pay. Revised standard practice Inland Revenue’s revised standard practice uses the size of a registered person’s annual turnover to limit the amount of an error that can be corrected in a subsequent GST return. We have used the $250,000 statutory threshold for six-monthly returns as the cut-off point. Registered persons may make the following error adjustments in a later return: •Up to $200 GST per return, for businesses with an annual turnover up to $250,000 •Up to $500 GST per return, for registered persons whose annual turnover is $250,000 or more. Registered persons can make these adjustments without having to adhere to the formal disputes resolution process. However, they must keep the following details as part of their return working papers, to be available to IRD on request: •return period error occurred •GST amount involved •nature of error •return period correction made Excepted situations A registered person may have made adjustments to a number of return periods, or several like adjustments in varying periods. Such a situation may fall outside this concession and may be considered under the compliance and penalties provisions. Inland Revenue may review error adjustments when examining the registered person’s records, and may consider such situations under the compliance and penalties provisions for lack of reasonable care or more serious penalties if appropriate. General discussion GST legislation The GST Act 1985 specifies how registered persons are to calculate their GST liability to be paid by due date for payment. It makes no provision for errors or method for correcting them. Disputes resolution process The disputes resolution process requires registered persons to issue a notice of proposed adjustment (NOPA – see section 89D(4), Tax Administration Act 1994) to the Commissioner, serving notice of their proposal to seek an assessment to make adjustments to GST returns to correct an error(s). For a NOPA to have effect, it must be sent to the Commissioner within the response period (2 months of the original self-calculated assessment) as per section 89D(5). If Inland Revenue receives a NOPA in time, we will consider the proposed adjustments and if we agree, alter the assessment. If the response period has expired, the disputes resolu- tion process does not provide a simple mechanism resolving errors other than Commissioner’s discretion under section 113 of the TAA 1994. For the Commis- sioner to exercise discretion, registered persons or their agents would need to advise Inland Revenue of cases they seek to rectify and the reasons for filing amended GST returns. Such a process is cumbersome for Inland Revenue and presents additional compliance costs for registered persons. To reach a pragmatic solution, Inland Revenue consid- ered the Care and Management provisions. Care and management Section 6A(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner discretion, notwithstanding anything in the Inland Revenue Acts, consistent with the duty of the Commissioner to collect over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to all of the following – •the resources available to the Commissioner •the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts •the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 14 for voluntary compliance with obligations to avoid use of money interest and other stringent penalties. Inland Revenue views cases that resemble voluntary error corrections as low risk, so we will allow the means of simple resolution set out in this standard practice statement. The care and management provisions can be used to obtain resource efficiencies and promote compli- ance by encouraging self assessment corrections. Tony Bouzaid National Manager Operations Policy The GST Act 1985 is specific on which adjustments can be made in future return periods. The Commissioner has used the Care and Management provisions to carry forward and update the previous operational policy as set out in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Four, No.7. Compliance and penalties provisions The introduction of the compliance and penalties provisions signalled tougher rules on use of money interest when errors occur, to compensate Government for the period of omission. From 1 April 1997, the compliance and penalty provisions emphasised the need from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 15 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Debts acquired as part of merger – whether assessable Case:Wrightson Limited (formerly Wrightson NMA Limited) v CIR Decision date:13 May 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 65(2) Keywords:Assessablilty of profits derived from acquisition of book debts., merger, profits or gains, capital. Summary:Justice Heron found that assessing the profits derived on the recovery of debts was incorrect. The book debts arose as a result of a merger between the taxpayer and another stock and station agency. Facts:Stock and station agencies provide a wide range of services to rural communi- ties. One of these services is a credit and loan function, offering both short and long term credit facilities. In 1986 WNMA acquired all the rural services of Dalgety Crown as part of a merger. This included Dalgety’s book debts (‘advance accounts’) bearing a face value of $117m. These were valued at $104.3m being realisable value less 10%. The discount reflected the uncertainty of realisation of the debts as they were contingent upon the solvency of the individual debtors. The Objector was as- sessed by the Commissioner for tax liability of profits or gains derived on the debts acquired. Decision:Justice Heron found that although the Objector carried out a substantial degree of money lending, that activity was integral to its essential characteristic as a stock and station agent. His Honour found that as part of an overall merger transaction the debts were part of the capital acquired by WNMA. Rejecting any liability under s65(2)(a) and the third limb of (2)(e), he said: “... the asset purchase of which the advance accounts were part was for the long term advance- ment of Wrightson in its stock and station activity. ... But as part of an overall merger type transac- tion, the accounts were part of capital acquired by Wrightsons.” His Honour considered that in the context of section 65(2)(l) the gains were from the business activities of Wrightsons and not from ‘any other source.’ Implications:The Commissioner is considering whether to appeal. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 16 Retirement payment or redundancy payment – nature of sum received Case:William Cranson v CIR Decision date:25 May 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 68(2) Keywords:Retirement v redundancy Summary:This was an appeal by the Commissioner from the High Court. Justice Heron found against the Commissioner and distinguished this case from CIR v Lupton as being “a different case from the facts”. Facts:The Objector was employed for 44 years as a security advisor for Telecom and its predecessors. In 1993 he was asked to take voluntary severance, as his position was surplus to requirements. The Objector elected to take redundancy with early retirement. The Objector received a lump sum payment on his departure part of which was identified as “retiring leave”. The Commissioner assessed the entire amount as a taxable redundancy payment. The TRA (Case T7 (1997) 18 NZTC 8,033) found for the Objector. Decision:Justice Heron stated that he thought it was open to the Authority to say, in respect of contractual provisions of benefit to the taxpayer, which were opera- tive, that the employee using those provisions negotiated a special deal by which he achieved a redundancy payment but retained a retirement payment: “... it seems to me that there will be those rare cases where although the operative cause of the termination of the employment is redundancy ... the employee truly retires early and receives his entitlement by virtue of contractual entitlement under one head and not under another.” Implications:The Commissioner is considering whether to appeal. Forestry block sold early – cessation of activity for GST purposes? Case:CIR v Norman Keith Edison Drummond, Robert Lane Chappell and Bruce Wyllie Mackrell as Trustees of the Norman Keith Edison Drummond Trust Decision date:15 May 1998 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 6(2) and 51(1)(c) Keywords:Liability for GST registration Summary:This was an appeal by the Commissioner from the Taxation Review Authority (see notes in TIB Volume Nine, No.2, at page 5). Justice Gallen found that the Objectors were not to be deemed registered for GST as the termination of their enterprise was premature and fell within an exemption under section 51(1)(c) Facts:Prior to 1974 the Objectors, acting as trustees of a family trust purchased a farm property and planted 26 hectares of that land with pine trees. The Deed of Trust was structured to run some 36 years. In 1992 the trustees found themselves no longer able to manage the forest and decided to sell the afforested portion even thought it had not yet reached full maturity. The Trust was not registered for GST and did not account for GST on the sale. The Commissioner assessed the proceeds of the sale as being subject to GST under the deeming provisions of section 51(1). The Taxation Review Authority held that the Trust was not liable to be registered for GST because it had prematurely ceased its forestry business. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 17 Decision:Justice Gallen found that what had been contemplated by the Trust was that the trees would be cultivated to maturity then sold. The Trust ceased that activity prematurely, in a sense that cessation took place at a time earlier than was other- wise contemplated in the life of the business. His Honour considered ‘termina- tion’ of a taxable activity which section 6(1) deems to be accountable, as distinct from ‘cessation’ under section 51(1)(c), which is excepted. His Honour held, upholding the TRA decision, that ‘cessation’ has “at least an element that the activity has terminated prematurely”, whereas “‘termination’ ... connotes the conclusion of an activity at its completion”. FBT on vehicles used by employees of earthmoving company Case:Lindsay G and Janette H Schick v CIR Decision date:15 May 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, sections 336N(1) and 336S(2) Keywords:Fringe benefit tax, Employees use of vehicles, home, private or domestic. Summary:This was an appeal by the Commissioner from the Taxation Review Authority regarding the use by the Objector’s employees of company vehicles (see TIB Volume Nine, No.2, at page 6). Justice Gallen, finding for the Objectors, held that the word “travel” when used in the definition of private use or enjoyment, means travel which confers a benefit of a private or domestic nature. Facts:The Objectors are a partnership operating as earthmoving contractors. The business involves the excavation of land at clients’ premises. In order to travel to the particular work sites, four employees were supplied with motor vehicles, fitted with the necessary equipment. All employees signed agreements regarding the use of the motor vehicles. The agreements contained clauses stating that the vehicle must only be used between their residences and the work sites each day. The Taxation Review Authority found in favour of the Objector on the basis that additional work activities were expected of the employees to be carried out from their homes and the employees needed to be available to carry out emergency work. Judge Willy found that the travel between the employees’ home and work sites was business related travel. Decision:Justice Gallen upheld Judge Willy’s interpretation of “travel” in the context of s 336S(2): “...there was in fact no benefit to the employees in this case and that the definition of ‘private use or enjoyment’ was not sufficient to categorise the activities as taxable ... because ‘home’ where used in that particular definition was not apt to include a starting point or destination which was ... reasonably to be categorised as a workplace even if it also had the characteristics of a home.’ As such, His Honour concluded that the Authority was right in the decision to which he came. Implications:This is a significant decision in the area of fringe benefit tax. The Commissioner is considering whether to appeal. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 18 Whether the Commissioner can set retrospective due dates Case:William Patrick Withey and Susan Margaret Withey v CIR Decision date:13 May 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 398(5) Keywords:Due date for income tax payments Summary:This was a judgment confirming the interim judgment reported at (1998) 18 NZTC 13,606. The Commissioner is not empowered by legislation to set retrospective dates for the payment of due tax. Facts:The taxpayers’ 1987 tax (as assessed from the return) was due to be paid by 7 February 1988 and was so paid. However in 1992 the Commissioner reassessed an additional $44,730 for the 1986/87 tax year under the tax avoidance provision s99(3) of the Income Tax Act 1976. A further sum of $29,157 was claimed under s398(2) on the basis that the avoided amount was due on 7 February 1988. The taxpayer challenged the due date for income tax payment. An objection was received. After a delay, in October 1996 a revised due date of 6 March 1992 was set under section 398(5); that date being prior to the decision to set a new date. Decision:Justice Baragwanath held that the new date must always be prospective. Section 398(5) did not provide that the Commissioner could set a retrospective due date. Further, that until a ‘new date’ is set, no additional tax is payable. “Where there has been no default there can be no occasion for the imposition of additional tax, which is to be characterised as a penalty for default. The law does not compel a citizen to do that which is impossible to perform” Implications:The Commissioner is considering whether to appeal. Power company – deductibility of replacing overhead cables with underground cables Case:Poverty Bay Electric Power Board Limited v CIR Decision date:22 May 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 108 Keywords:Capital expenditure or revenue expenditure Repairs, Alterations Summary:Justice Ellis found for the Commissioner that replacing overhead cables with an underground network was an affair of capital that had the effect of enhancing the objector’s asset structure. As such the expenditure constituted renewal rather than maintenance. Facts:Poverty Bay Electric Power Board (“PBEPB”) is an electricity supplier. The Objec- tor supplies electricity from the East Coast to south of Gisborne. PBEPB replaced urban overhead power lines in its area with underground cables and claimed a deduction for revenue expenditure of $422,658 in respect of 14 of the sites. The Commissioner disagreed and assessments were issued on the basis that the expenditure was in the nature of capital. Decision:Justice Ellis accepted that the asset was a small area, namely Gisborne City and the laying of underground cables in that small area was capital expenditure and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 19 non-deductible. His Honour also found that the alteration work increased the capital value of the urban reticulation system by at least the cost of the work. Having reviewed the authorities, his Honour held: “The works together and separately were part of \[a\] planned programme of renewal” Factors to consider are: the asset in question; the purpose of the work; the result of the work; the fiscal treatment by the taxpayer; the function of the new work; and the valuation of the work. Implications:The Objector is expected to lodge an appeal. Tax avoidance – reverse takeover arrangements Case:TRA No 93/126, 93/127, 93/128, 93/129, 96/167, 93/82, 93/123, 93/124, 93/154, 93/182, 93/180. Decision No 15/98 Decision date:21 May 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 s99(3) Keywords:Tax avoidance Summary:Judge Barber held that in terms of section 99 an arrangement such as the complex ‘reverse takeover’ template is void against the Commissioner for income tax purposes. His Honour criticised most submissions as ‘reruns’ of those put, and rejected in the Miller, McDougall and Managed Fashions cases. Facts:This is another group of cases, involving four companies and ten individuals as Objectors flowing from an application of the JG Russell template (see Miller & Ors v CIR (1997) NZTC 13,219) Ten of the thirteen submissions of the Objectors had been well covered in the previous JGR cases but the Authority dealt with each insofar as the objectors’ facts differed from previous decisions, or evidential and/or procedural matters required. Decision:Judge Barber held that in terms of section 99 such a scheme or arrangement is absolutely void against the Commissioner for income tax purposes. The assess- able income of persons affected by the arrangement is to be adjusted as the Commissioner considers appropriate in accordance with section 99(3). Also, in the present circumstances the Commissioner must not confine himself to merely defining the character of the receipts and payments of the transactions entered into, but must look at the overall effect of the transactions and ascertain whether they had the purpose or effect of avoiding tax. His Honour found it would be contrary to section 99(4) if, when individual taxpayers were assessed for the money taken out of the profit company by way of administration charges, there were no adjustments in favour of the profit company. The Commissioner has then granted a deemed deduction under sec- tion 44(4) of the administration charge to the profit company to avoid the same income being taxed twice. Regarding the submission that the Commissioner merely went where the money was, His Honour held that if the perceived ability to pay were the only factor in making an assessment then such an assessment would be invalid, however that circumstance did not arise. With regards to the consulting fee Judge Barber held that such would only be deductible where evidence was available that a genuine consulting service took place separately from and not in relation to the tax avoidance scheme. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 20 Redundancy payment received at time of early retirement Case:TRA No 94/131. Decision No 11/98 Decision date:19 May 1998 Act:Income Tax Act 1976, section 68(2) Keywords:Redundancy payment, retirement leave Summary:Judge Barber found in favour of the Commissioner, being bound by the High Court judgment of Williams J in Lupton v CIR. Facts:The Objector had been employed by Telecom and had his employment termi- nated in 1993 on the basis that his position had been made surplus to Telecom’s requirements. At termination the Objector was 55 years old and had 38 years of service for Telecom. He received a lump sum voluntary severance payment, which was made up of severance pay and retiring leave. Telecom deducted PAYE from the entire payment. In the TRA the Objector contended that the retiring leave pay was separate from the redundancy payment and should be free of tax under the exemption in section 68(2)(b). Decision:Judge Barber found that the payment made to the Objector was payable to him in terms of the definition of “redundancy payment” in section 68(1) of the Act and no part of it can be construed as a retiring allowance. His Honour found it was a situation of a voluntary redundancy and not a situation of early retirement. The issues were ‘virtually identical’ to the High Court judgment of Williams J in Lupton v CIR and as such his Honour was bound by that decision. The Objector also submitted that the payment not be taxed until the following tax year. Judge Barber held that the Commissioner ‘ ... has no choice but to tax wage and salary earners on a cash basis i.e. in the year when the income is re- ceived.’ Business acquired from receiver as going concern – whether GST input claim allowable Case:TRA No 97/82. Decision No 14/98 Decision date:19 May 1998 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, section 11 Keywords:Supply of a going concern, zero rated, express intention of parties. Summary:Judge Willy found that the Commissioner was correct in disallowing an input tax credit claim for GST Facts:By agreement for sale and purchase of a business, the Objector purchased its business from a receiver. Clause 16(1) of the agreement said that unless other- wise expressly stated the parties were contracting on the understanding that the supply was a supply of a going concern and zero rated for GST purposes. The Objector claimed a GST input tax credit claim on the basis that a valuation of certain assets for the purpose of the sale included a GST component. The Com- missioner disallowed the claim. Decision:In the TRA Judge Willy found that nowhere in the agreement did it expressly state that the supply was to be other than zero rated for GST purposes and found in favour of the Commissioner. The words of the agreement showed “... the clear intention of the parties and it is quite hopeless in my view for the objector to contend otherwise by reference to the way in which the valuation of the assets ... were carried out.’ IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 21 Foreign tax credits disallowed – case dismissed for non-appearance Case:TRA No 97/9. Decision No 12/98 Decision date:19 May 1998 Act:Taxation Review Authority Act 1994 section 22(1)(a) Keywords:Foreign tax credits Summary:The Authority found in favour of the Commissioner as the Objector failed to appear. Facts:The Objector owned music copyrights and derived income from customers overseas. The foreign customers deducted foreign withholding tax from the royalties due to the Objector. The Objector’s directors’ policy was that the Objector would pay additional shareholders salaries from whatever profits remained each year. These profits would be calculated in the income tax accounts. The Objector over-claimed foreign tax credits allowed and assessments were issued limiting the credits to be claimed. Decision:The Objector failed to appear and the Authority invoked the provisions of sec- tion 22(1)(a) of the Taxation Review Authority Act 1994 to order costs of $750 for non-appearance. The objection was consequently dismissed and the Commissioner’s assessments confirmed. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 22 Compliance and penalties – concerns expressed by Institute of Chartered Accountants Internal memorandum to Inland Revenue Staff, 17 February 1998 This item reproduces an internal Inland Revenue memorandum which went to all IRD staff in February 1998. This memorandum is part of a wide range of communication products available to staff. We have reproduced it here to show the steps that are taken to ensure that the penalties regime is administered in a consistent and appropriate manner. 1. Introduction Some criticism has been levelled at Inland Revenue over a number of months regarding the application of the shortfall penalty regime. Amongst other things there is a feeling that we are taking a “hard line” approach, being inconsistent and applying the provisions inappropriately. Overall there can be little dispute that the number of assessments for shortfall penalties issued up to 31 De- cember 1997; when compared to the number of adjust- ments made during the same period (11.6%), is not high. This is despite the fact that because of a wider range of offences than under the old penal tax regime there will be more cases. However a considerable amount of dialogue and discussion can take place before the issue of the assessment and, if this is not handled appropri- ately, can give rise to criticism and misunderstanding. We must be conscious of the fact that the application of the regime is governed by legislation and we should be ensuring that we are applying that legislation in a consistent and impartial manner. 2. Purpose of this memorandum This memo is not intended to outline the overall depart- mental policy in relation to shortfall penalties. Explana- tions of the legislation and Departmental policy are outlined in a number of internal and external publica- tions including: •Tax Information Bulletin Volume Eight, No.7 •Compliance and Penalties Investigations Participant Package •Standard Practice Statements •Operations Policy Manual – Compliance Provisions •IR 240 – Taxpayer Obligations, Interest and Penalties booklet •IR 240J – New Shortfall Penalties Fact Sheet, •Penal and Shortfall Penalties Procedural Manual. I do however want to emphasise certain points. They are not changes in policy, but are mentioned to ensure they are followed in future cases where shortfall penalties are being considered. 3. Shortfall penalties in general – objectivity The proposed imposition of a shortfall penalty is an objective test involving an analysis of the law to the relevant facts. In some cases, such as lack of reasonable care, there may be some subjective elements that follow, like the circumstances of the particular taxpayer, but even these have to be considered “objectively” by looking at what a reasonable person would have done in the circumstances. By applying objectivity the proposed imposition of a shortfall penalty is based on fact. It cannot be used as a threat to obtain information or to enter into a discussion to obtain a settlement of a dispute. It is not a bargain- ing tool. It either applies or it does not. While, of course, there can be discussion as to whether the penalty is appropriate based on the facts, it should never be proposed in an attempt to ensure that a lower form of penalty “sticks”. 4. Lack of reasonable care This form of shortfall penalty accounts for 80% of shortfall penalty assessments issued up to 31 December 1997. The standard for this penalty is the cornerstone of the penalties regime, which requires taxpayers to act reasonably in the conduct of their tax affairs. It is a fluid concept that recognises the distinct characteristics of particular obligations and the different burdens placed on various taxpayers. The standard recognises taxpayers’ varying abilities and reflects a balance between the need for returns to be correct and the recognition of the difficulties taxpayers may face in ensuring they are correct. Reasonable care is not intended to be overly onerous to taxpayers and does not mean perfection. Circumstances that may be taken into account when determining whether a taxpayer has exercised reasonable care include: •the complexity of the law and the transaction (the need to balance the complexity of the law with the category of taxpayer) •the materiality of the shortfall (consideration must be given not only to the nature of the shortfall, but also the size of the shortfall in relation to the taxpayer) •the difficulty and expense of taking the precaution (consider whether the types of controls in place are commensurate with the size and nature of the tax- payer) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 23 Consideration has been given to whether a policy decision can be made to ease some of the concerns. As soon as a decision is made you will be notified. However even before this is done there is a possibility of a 40% reduction for a voluntary disclosure – see paragraph 8 below. (Note: The decision has now been made to change the policy – see Standard Practice Statement INV-230 in TIB Volume Ten, No.5 of May 1998.) We however need to be certain in these cases that there is a breach of a standard by applying the objective tests. Just because there is a timing error does not mean automatically that a shortfall penalty will apply. The tests of complexity, materiality etc must be considered. 8. Reductions for voluntary disclosures While there have been a number of reductions in the assessments issued to 31 December 1997 as a result of voluntary disclosures we need to remind ourselves that the provisions exist and encourage taxpayers to consider the options. The 75% reduction occurs when a full voluntary disclo- sure is made before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. The first notification could be in writing or by telephone. This latter form of contact is particularly prevalent in the cases of GST refund checks. If disclosure is made after receipt of the letter or the phone call, the only reduction available is 40%, providing it is made before the “start” of the audit or investigation. An audit or investigation starts at the earlier of: •the end of the first interview, •the records being inspected. If, in the case of a GST refund check query the taxpayer sends in their documents and at the same time advises that their claim is incorrect, they would be entitled to a 40% reduction. If the taxpayer does not advise at this point and Inland Revenue examines the documents and notices the error, no reduction would arise. 9. Conclusion The compliance and penalties regime is new and we are coming under a high level of scrutiny to ensure that we are applying the provisions in an appropriate manner in accordance with the law. While there will understand- ably be a larger number of cases involving shortfall penalties than under the old penal tax regime, we need to ensure that the objectivity tests overriding the legislation are given due heed.

Tax agents/advisors A taxpayer who has reasonably relied on the advice of a tax advisor will usually be considered to have exercised reasonable care. However they may still be exposed to a penalty for lack of reasonable care should they: •fail to provide adequate information when seeking advice •fail to provide reasonable instructions to a tax advisor, or •unreasonably rely on a tax advisor or on advice (when they have reason to believe that the advice is not correct). While an “agent error” is not grounds for imposing a shortfall penalty on the taxpayer, agents also have responsibility to obtain relevant information about their clients. Matters to be considered would include: •whether or not a questionnaire was completed, •was the information compiled accurately? •was the questionnaire discussed with the client? Taxpayers have a responsibility to fully and comprehen- sively advise their tax agents of their tax affairs. 6. Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) In all cases where agreement is not reached with the taxpayer or agent regarding the imposition of a shortfall penalty a NOPA is to be issued. This is also the case where agreement is reached regarding the adjustments, but not the proposed penalties. Only if agreement is reached in respect of the penalties can an assessment for shortfall penalty be issued without progressing through the disputes resolution process. Although this tends to elongate the process this is a requirement by law and we must ensure proper procedures are followed. 7. Temporary shortfalls There has been considerable criticism regarding the imposition of shortfall penalties where there has been little or no fiscal risk. This applies particularly when a GST refund check is made and a timing error is detected. There has been no time for the taxpayer to permanently reverse or correct the situation in a subsequent return period, and thereby benefit from the 75% reduction, nor has the taxpayer had the benefit of the refund. It is considered that the imposition of a 20% penalty is harsh in the circumstances. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) 24 Depreciation determinations issued since last update of IR 260 Depreciation booklet This list shows the contents of all depreciation determinations we’ve issued since the last update of our Depreciation booklet (IR 260). We’ve published it so you can quickly check whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers. For these determinations we’ve simply listed a cross-reference to the original TIB article rather than reproduce several pages of figures here. This list is essentially a summary; if you’re claiming depreciation on any of these assets we recommend that you refer to the original TIB article to make sure you get the full context of the determination, including the relevant industry categories.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998) 5 1998 deemed rate of return announced for foreign investment fund regime The deemed rate of return used for the foreign investment fund regime has been set at 11.01% for the 1997-1998 income year. The rate will apply to all types of investments, including interests in superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. The FIF regime taxes the income earned by foreign entities on behalf of New Zealand residents, when the Con- trolled Foreign Company rules do not apply. The deemed rate of return method is one of four methods for calculating FIF income or loss. The rate for future income years will continue to be set annually. 2.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Farm and fishing vessel ownership savings accounts Withdrawals without payment of withdrawal tax Introduction The Farm and Fishing Vessel Ownership Savings Schemes (Closure) Act 1998 allows farm and fishing vessel ownership savings accounts to be closed without payment of withdrawal tax. Background Section KG 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 allows a tax rebate of 45 cents in the dollar for deposits (within certain limits) to farm and fishing vessel ownership accounts. Withdrawals from the two schemes that did not satisfy the criteria of the schemes were subject to withdrawal tax (Subpart IZ of the Income Tax Act refers). Key features The amendments provide that certain withdrawals which do not satisfy the criteria can be made without payment of withdrawal tax if accounts are closed. Accounts continuing to exist as at 30 June 2001 will be closed automatically, with deposits being refunded and no withdrawal tax being charged. From 30 June 1998 savers who have not deposited funds since 14 May 1998 will be able to close their accounts without attracting withdrawal tax. If deposits are made after 30 June 1998, normal rules will continue to apply, except that the account will be closed on 30 June 2001. All deposits will be refunded on that date, no withdrawal tax will be payable. Transitional rules apply to deposits made after 14 May 1988 but before 30 June 1998. If accounts are closed before 30 June 2001, withdrawal tax will be charged on the withdrawal of deposits made between 14 May 1998 and 30 June 1998 only. Application date The amendments apply from the date the Act received the Royal assent (22 May 1998). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998) 6 Electricity revenue and data logging terminals Draft general depreciation determination We have been advised that there is no suitable general depreciation rate for Electricity Revenue and Data Logging Terminals. The terminals are installed in businesses and homes, and record the amount of electric- ity used and the times of usage. These details are stored by the meter and downloaded, via modem, from time to time, to give the electricity provider information that allows customers to be billed and enables the provider to design network capacities and to fix charge out rates for the electricity. Customers are also able to access the information so that they may consider how best to take advantage of off-peak rates etc. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will insert a new asset class “Electricity Revenue and Data Logging Terminals” into the “Power Generation and Electrical Reticulation Systems” industry category, with a depreciation rate of 22% (D.V.) (15.5% S.L.), based on an estimated useful life of 8 years. The Commissioner accepts that there is a much higher rate of technical obsolescence and a higher turn-over when this type of equipment is leased, so the determination sets a separate rate for leased terminals. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rates are based on the estimated useful lives set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP\[X\] This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP\[x\]: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number \[x\]”. 1.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998) 7 Bird netting Draft general depreciation determination We have been advised that there is currently no suitable general depreciation rate for bird netting, used by winegrowers to protect ripening grapes from birds. The netting is removed when the grapes are picked. It is subject to tearing from snagging on the vine as it is put up or taken in, and also deteriorates in sunlight. At the end of each season, netting is patched and repaired before being stored out of the sunlight until the next season’s use. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will insert a new asset class “Bird netting” into the “Brewing, Winemaking and Distilleries” industry category, with a depreciation rate of 33% D.V. (24% S.L.), based on an estimated useful life of 5 years. This determination would be distinguished from the “Questions We’ve Been Asked” item published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Seven, No.6 (December 1995) at page 21. That item advised taxpayers to treat bird netting as an expense, because the netting in question was expected to last for only one season. Taxpayers who use that type of bird netting should continue to treat the expenditure as an expense item. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rates are based on the estimated useful life set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP\[X\] This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP\[x\]: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number \[x\]”. 1.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998) 8 Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. How- ever, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. Available subscribed capital – consequences of deemed reregistration Introduction Under the Income Tax Act 1994, the concept of “avail- able subscribed capital” (ASC) is important in determin- ing whether a distribution by a company to its sharehold- ers is a dividend or a return of capital. The definition of available subscribed capital in section OB 1 is concerned with calculating the amount of available subscribed capital referable to a particular class of share at a point in time. Essentially, it reflects the amounts paid to the company on the issue of shares, less amounts paid out on the repurchase of shares when those amounts are not dividends. Under the Companies Reregistration Act 1993, any company registered under the Companies Act 1955 is deemed reregistered under the Companies Act 1993 as from the close of 30 June 1997 (or some Court-approved extended time). One effect of reregistration is that the previous memorandum and articles of the company cease to have effect, and the company is then governed by the provisions in the Companies Act 1993. Under section 28 of the Companies Act 1993, companies without a constitution have rights, powers, duties and obligations as set out in that Act. Further, section 36 sets out shareholder rights and powers for such companies, and in particular provides that a share in a company confers on the holder: the right to vote, dividends, and an equal share in the distribution of surplus company assets. If a company has more than one share class, those share classes merge into the ordinary share class. We have been asked what effect, if any, the merging of share classes, pursuant to a deemed reregistration under the Companies Reregistration Act 1993, has on ASC. Legislation Available subscribed capital is defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The relevant parts of the definition are: Available subscribed capital, ..., means the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula in respect of all shares of the same class (referred to in this definition as the “specified class”) as the share: a + b - c where - ais - (i)In the case of any company which existed before 1 July 1994, the transitional capital amount; and (ii)In any other case, nil; and bis the aggregate amount of consideration received by the company on or after 1 July 1994 and before the relevant time in respect of the issue of all shares in the company of the specified class, including as consideration - ... cis the aggregate of amounts distributed - (i)Upon the acquisition, redemption, or other cancellation by the company of shares in the company of the specified class; and (ii)On or after 1 July 1994 and before the relevant time; and ... This definition looks at relevant amounts attributable to shares of the same class (referred to as the “specified class”). The formula calculates the total amount the company received on the issue of a particular class of share, less the total amounts distributed by the company following any acquisition, cancellation, or redemption of the shares. Generally, shares remain in their specified class and the calculation of ASC is relatively straightforward. But if shares move from a class to become members of another class (“altered shares”) as a result of deemed reregistration, the ASC calculation becomes a little more complex. Effect of alteration With an alteration of shareholder rights, a number of issues emerge: •Does an alteration have the effect of cancelling shares? •To what class do the altered shares belong? •On what basis is ASC calculated for altered shares? •On rectification of altered shares, what is the value of consideration received? IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998) 9 No share cancellation An alteration of shareholder rights is not a cancellation and reissue of shares. The shareholder still owns the original shares, but certain entitlements attaching to the shares are varied in some way. The appropriate class For ASC purposes, a specified class is a reference to “shares of the same class” as defined in section OB 1. This definition generally classifies shares on the basis of any 2 (or more) shares having similar attributes. For example, shares of the same class have identical rights as to voting, decision making, and distribution entitlements. The effect of deemed reregistration is that all shares become, at the time of deemed reregistration, members of the ordinary share class. ASC following deemed reregistration The ASC definition looks at the balance of the consid- eration received for all shares in the specified class at the time of calculation, less relevant distributions. For shares originally issued in the specified class, paragraph (b) credits amounts received on issue and paragraph (c) debits amounts distributed. The definition is concerned with all shares in the speci- fied class at the relevant time – being the time when ASC is calculated. The altered shares simply become members of the new specified class at the time of alteration, and the ASC amount of the altered shares is included in the calculation of ASC of the new specified class. For “altered” shares, a focus on amounts credited and debited at issue is not appropriate because ASC is calculated in terms of the “new” specified class. Accord- ingly, the altered share component of the ASC of the ordinary share class should reflect the ASC balance as at the time of alteration. This approach avoids the ASC of the altered shares being trapped in its original speci- fied class. The ASC of the altered shares is the balance of the consideration received for all shares in the altered shares class, less relevant distributions. This calculation is made as at the time of the alteration, being the close of 30 June 1997 or such later day if a Court has granted an extended time to reregister. Rectification of shareholder rights If a company decides to alter the rights attaching to a share class, the possibility of varying the relative interests of shareholders arises because of the potential dilution of shareholder rights. The Companies Act 1993 minimises the potential impact of this by ensuring that the company does not take any action that affects the rights attached to shares, unless the action has been approved by a special resolution. With deemed reregistration, the shareholders do not have the option to decide on the variation of their rights. The rights are altered by statute. For ASC purposes the merging of different specified classes, due to deemed reregistration, may dilute the rights and subscribed capital originally received for shares in the original share class and in the altered classes. If the company takes no action to “rectify” the effect of the alteration of share- holder rights (such as creating a new class of share), the amount of ASC for the specified class will include the ASC amounts for the altered shares as at the time of deemed reregistration. However, if a company proposes to rectify the effect of the variation, the question arises as to the value of the consideration received for the shares. •Is it the original issue price? •Is it calculated on the ASC value per share as at the time of deemed reregistration? •Is it found by dividing the ASC for the specified class by the number of shares in the class immediately prior to rectification? In the Commissioner’s view, when enacting the defini- tion of ASC Parliament did not expressly turn its mind to the potential effect of deemed reregistration. However, it is clear that the definition of ASC is concerned with calculating the balance of consideration received less distributions of shares in a share class. Like deemed reregistration, a rectification is not an issue of shares. Accordingly, the relevant consideration should be calculated as at the time the altered shares join the new specified class, i.e. immediately prior to the rectification. On this basis, it is appropriate that, if a company alters the shareholder rights to rectify the effect of deemed reregistration, it is the proportionate amount of ASC, calculated by dividing the ASC for the specified class by the number of shares in the class immediately prior to rectification, that becomes the ASC of the rectified class. Reissue of shares The result outlined above may be contrasted with one where, instead of a reclassification, the shares of the other class (e.g. preference shares) are redeemed by conversion into ordinary shares. Whereas a reclassifica- tion is an alteration of the rights attaching to existing shares, a conversion involves the issue of new shares. For ASC purposes, the consideration received for the ordinary shares is not based on the price of preference shares at the time of issue, but it is the market value at the point of conversion. This reflects the reality that the conversion triggers a tax event in the form of a cancella- tion and new issue, while a reclassification, of itself, does not. continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998) 10 The effect of the alteration of rights is that the preference shares become ordinary shares. The “altered” preference shares (and the ASC amount) simply join the ordinary share class. The ASC amount is $15,500. This amount includes the amount of ASC for the ordinary shares as calculated in Example 1 ($9,000) and the ASC balance of the preference shares when they became ordinary shares as calculated in Example 1 ($6,500). Example 3: rectification In this example the company wishes to re-establish the preference share class, and to this end, on 10 July 1997 it alters the rights of 3,000 ordinary shares. Calculation of ASC Preference share class When shares join another class, the relevant ASC goes with them. In this example 3,000 ordinary shares become preference shares and the ASC for these shares must be calculated as at the time of reclassification. This figure is found by calculating the value of the ASC per ordinary share, multiplied by the number of shares reclassified. ASC for the ordinary shares (at the time of reclassi- fication) = $15,500 (see Example 2). Number of ordinary shares on issue = 16,000 (see Example 1). ASC per ordinary share = ($15,500/16,000) = $0.96875. Accordingly the value of the ASC for the 3,000 preference shares is $2,906. Ordinary share class The ASC for the ordinary share class following reclassification can be found by calculating the ASC for the class (prior to reclassification), less the ASC for the preference shares ($2,906). Prior to reclassification, the consideration received in respect of the issue of the ordinary shares is \[10,000 x $1\] + \[5,000 x $1\] + \[ASC for the “al- tered” preference shares = ($6,500)\] = $21,500. b =$21,500 c =the aggregate amount distributed upon the cancellation by the company of shares in the company of the specified class = $6,000 (4,000 at $1.50 per share). ASC for the ordinary share class is $15,500 ($21,500 - $6000) After reclassification, 3,000 ordinary shares become preference shares and item ‘b’ becomes $21,500 - $2,906 = $18,594. Item ‘c’ = $6,000 ASC for the ordinary share class is $12,594 ($18,594 - $6,000). from page 9 Examples The following examples illustrate the operation of this approach. Example 1: pre-deemed reregistration This example illustrates the calculation of ASC as at 29 June 1997 (prior to deemed reregistration). A company is formed on 1 August 1994, and issues 10,000 ordinary shares at $1 per share. It issues a further 5,000 ordinary shares at $1 per share on 1 December 1994; at the same time issuing 4,000 preference shares at $1.50. A further issue of 3,000 preference shares (at $1.50 per share) is made on 1 March 1996. The company decides to cancel some ordinary shares and redeem some preference shares. On 1 December 1996, 4,000 ordinary shares are can- celled at $1.50 per share. On the same day, the company redeems 2,000 preference shares at $2.00 per share. Calculation of ASC Ordinary share class ASC is defined as:a + b - c a =nil b =all consideration received in respect of the issue of ordinary shares, i.e. $10,000 + $5,000 = $15,000 c =the aggregate amount distributed upon the cancellation by the company of shares in the company of the specified class = $6,000 (4,000 at $1.50 per share) ASC for ordinary share class is $9,000 ($15,000 - $6,000). Preference share class a =nil b =$10,500 (7,000 shares at $1.50 per share) c =$4,000 (2,000 shares at $2.00 per share) ASC for preference share class is $6,500. Example 2: post-deemed reregistration This example illustrates the ASC calculation follow- ing deemed reregistration. This example uses the same facts as Example 1, except that the ASC is measured as at 1 July 1997. Calculation of ASC Due to deemed reregistration, there are no longer any shares in the preference share class and there- fore no ASC to calculate for that class. Ordinary share class Prior to the alteration of rights, the ASC in the ordinary class was $9,000 and in the preference share class, $6,500 (see Example 1). IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998) 11 Interpretation guidelines The items in this section of the TIB discuss the Commissioner’s approach to the interpretation of a general area of law. Interpretation guidelines are intended to clarify general points of interpretation that are causing, or may cause, difficulty for practitioners, taxpayers, and Inland Revenue. An interpretation guideline is Inland Revenue’s opinion as to the better view of the law. That view is developed from an appreciation and assessment of the law on a particular topic, as gathered from leading cases. Computer software – payment to non-resident for use Notice of withdrawal of PIB 168 article The Commissioner gives notice of the withdrawal of the present policy on the income tax treatment of payments made for the use of computer software set out in Public Information Bulletin 168 (January 1988). The Commissioner is reviewing the income tax treat- ment of computer software transactions with non- residents and, in the interim, pending the conclusion of the review, believes it appropriate to withdraw the item. The practical effect of this notice is that all published policy is withdrawn dealing with the income tax implica- tions of computer software transactions with non- residents. Accordingly, pending the completion of the review and publication of a new statement, taxpayers requiring IRD guidance on this matter should contact their local IRD Office or seek a formal binding ruling on the particular transaction from the Rulings Unit in Wellington. This withdrawal takes effect from the date of publication of this Taxation Information Bulletin. continued on page 12 Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Child support - shared custody Section 35, Child Support Act 1991 – Position where liable parent shares custody of child A liable parent has written to the Commissioner con- cerned about the amount of child support that she must pay. She has three children who regularly stay with her, during which time she is responsible for their care. She has asked if her child support liability may be reduced, taking into account the times she has custody of the children. Under section 35, an adjustment may be made to the calculation of child support liability under a formula assessment when there is shared custody. The calcula- tion applies when all the following conditions are met: •A parent has one or more qualifying children. •The parent shares the ongoing daily care of one or more of those children substantially equally with another person. •The parent is liable to pay child support to the other person under a formula assessment. Under section 13(1), when another person has care of a child for at least 40 percent of the nights of the child support year in question, that other person is considered to share the ongoing daily care of a child substantially equally with the principal care provider. As such, he or she is also considered to be a custodial parent for the time the child is in his or her care and may apply for child support on that basis. Under section 13(2), a person may be considered to share the ongoing daily care of a child substantially equally with the principal care provider, even if they do not care for the child for the minimum 40 percent of the nights. In these cases there must be other special features of the way in which the sharing of care of the child is IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998) 12 A liable parent who is also considered to be a custodial parent in terms of shared custody as previously dis- cussed, may be able to make a child support application for the time the child is in his or her care. Furthermore, that liable parent is also entitled to have that child included in his or her living allowance (B). These options may be discussed further with the local Inland Revenue Child Support office. If both parents have applied for child support, and neither receives a benefit, the liabilities are automatically offset against each other so that the parent with the higher assessment will pay only the difference between that assessment and that of the other parent. Example George and Mabel have each applied for child support for their child Fred who is cared for substan- tially equally by each of them. Neither is a benefici- ary. George’s assessment is for $6,000 a year ($500 per month) and Mabel’s is for $4,800 per year ($400 per month). The result of offsetting will be that George will have a liability of $1,200 pa ($100 per month). Mabel will have nothing to pay. Generally, all of the above changes will take effect after Inland Revenue Child Support has been notified, in accordance with the Child Support Act. The liable parent who originally asked this question had the children for more than 40% of the nights in the child support year, so her child support formula assessment was altered to reflect this. Inland Revenue also advised her that based on her circumstances, she was able to apply for child support for the time the children were in her care. managed to amount to that care being regarded as substantially equal with the principal provider of care. In calculating the formula assessed child support liability when there is shared care, the amount is the greater of: •$520; or •An amount calculated in accordance with the follow- ing formula: (A - B) x C In this formula: Ais the liable parent’s child support income for the child support year. Bis the amount of the living allowance to which the liable parent is entitled for the child support year. Cis the child support percentage for the liable parent. In determining the child support percentage (C) in the case of shared custody, every child who is part of the shared custody arrangement as described above, is to be calculated as 0.5 children. In effect, the child support percentage under the formula assessment calculation in such cases is as follows: No ofChild support childrenpercentage 0.5 12% 1 18% 1.5 21% 2 24% 2.525.5% 3 27% 3.528.5% 4 or more 30% from page 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998) 13 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Trust taking over former Government activities – whether limited to “financial transaction” for GST purposes Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust v CIR Decision date: 26 June 1998 Act: Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords: Taxable activity, supply, grant, Crown Summary Justice Heron held that the Trust should pay GST on a sum of money paid by the Government. Facts The Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust came into exist- ence after continuing concern stretching over a number of decades about the responsibility and financial liability for essential services required by Chatham Islands residents. The concept of a local authority trading enterprise (LATE) was contemplated as taking over all of the commercial activities previously undertaken by central or local government on the Chathams. At the heart of the plan was the injection of a capital sum which would ensure the infrastructure was retained and that the commercial operations could be developed from that point forward. It was agreed that $8 million would be paid by the Government in two instalments together with the transfer of the assets previously owned by central government. Decision The High Court held that to treat this transaction, in which two payments of $4 million were made, as a financial transaction would be quite unreal. The Govern- ment wanted to step out of a difficult position which required supervision, expenditure and ultimate responsi- bility and accountability. Into its shoes stepped the Trust, which took over a multitude of responsibilities and obligations and undertook to co-ordinate and effect a replacement structure, quite different from the arrange- ment which proceeded it. To suggest that it was confined to an injection of money only is unrealistic. Hence the payment was made for an implementation of a pro- gramme with many pieces and parts, with a variety of services, some financial but not predominately so. As to Counsel’s respective argument involving section 5(6D) it follows, given that the Court took the view that the trust was conducting a taxable activity, that the Commissioner must succeed under section 5(6D)(a). It held that there was a payment to a Trust not being a public authority in respect of that taxable activity and the subsection therefore applies. In consideration of (b) it was held that the overall purpose of the monies was for the benefit and on behalf of other persons in the form of the trading companies. The words should have their ordinary everyday meaning and plainly the payment served two purposes. The further requirement that such activities be carried on continuously or regularly is met by the multitude of tasks to be performed and sustained by the Trust in return for the monetary consideration. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998) 14 Business transferred from harbour board to port company – deductions disallowed Auckland Harbour Board v CIR Decision date: 30 June 1998 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Legal fees, depreciation on disposal, establishment costs Summary Justice Potter found for the Commissioner with regards to all of the six separate issues involved in this case. Facts Auckland Harbour Board (“AHB”) operated as a statutory corporation for over 100 years. It operated the Auckland Port and associated harbour services. The port trading operations of AHB were sold to Ports of Auckland Limited (“POAL”) under the Port Companies Act 1988. AHB was abolished in 1989 when all of the shares in POAL, assets, liabilities and statutory functions were transferred to the Auckland Regional Council. The Commissioner disallowed deductions for deprecia- tion of assets, transfer of government and local body stock, legal fees, funding an establishment unit and included the proceeds of a land sale in AHB’s assessable income. The six issues of the case are: 1.Legal fees: this was assessed as capital, being associated with the purchase of a tug boat. 2.Establishment costs: these were assessed as capital costs. 3.Kauri Point: this was a valuation issue. 4.Base price adjustment: this was assessed under section 64J with the application of the accrual rules. 5.Ordinary depreciation – opening book value: the objector should have claimed in the first year for purposes of calculating open written down tax book value of assets. 6.Loss on disposal: the Commissioner held that this was not due to fair wear and tear or obsolescence or uselessness. Sufficient information and explanations were not given. Decision Justice Potter found for the Commissioner in all of the issues. With regards to issue 6 her Honour found that the Commissioner could not use the so-called “Pickering” formula to calculate fair wear and tear depreciation under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Farm land subdivided and sold – whether GST taxable activity TRA 96/104, Decision 16/98 Decision date: 25 June 1998 Act: Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords: Taxable activity Summary The principles established in Newman and Wakelin can be applied in this case. Barber J also found that this case follows a similar pattern to Case T40. Facts The Objectors jointly purchased a number of properties between 1984 and 1987, which together made up a farm. The husband was registered for GST and farmed the property with sheep and cattle. He did not pay any rental on the farm. In 1991, the husband claimed an input tax credit on the purchase of the farmland purchased in 1987. Inland Revenue allowed the credit despite the fact the land was in the name of both Objectors. The same year, the husband and wife began charging the husband rent for the use of the farm. They did not register for GST because the rental was under the registration threshold. The farming operation was not a success and the Objec- tors decided to subdivide the property into 6 lots and sell them. All lots were sold by December 1994. The Objectors registered for GST on 1 June 1994, having purchased another farm property. The sale of 2 lots were accounted for in the December 1994 return. The other 4 lots were sold in the GST periods ending 31 October 1993, 30 April 1994 and 30 June 1994. Decision Barber J found on the facts, the Objectors were continu- ously engaged in the activity of land subdivision from August 1992 to December 1994. The same essential steps of subdivision as established in the Newman and Wakelin cases occurred here. His Honour held that the subdivision and its work was extensive and of a continu- ing nature, therefore amounting to a taxable activity. With regard to the input tax credit, the husband had taken an input tax credit in 1991 when the farmland asset was introduced into the partnership business, and the Objectors could not be entitled to a further input credit on that same asset. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998) 15 Employee status of company directors Roma Properties Limited v CIR Decision date: 6 July 1998 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Fringe benefit tax Summary The Taxation Review Authority allowed the objection and the High Court disallowed it. The Taxpayer ap- pealed to the Court of Appeal, where judgment was given in the Commissioner’s favour. Facts The company sold off land and advanced the proceeds as loans to its Directors, just before FBT was put into place. The company loans to the Directors were recorded in their current accounts. The shareholders and directors changed their status in the company and became manag- ers of the newly-configured company. They continued to have the same duties as before. Decision Justice Richardson held that the resolutions to pay directors’ fees should be taken at face value. The fees would then be subject to source deduction payments and therefore the directors were employees to whom FBT would apply. Shares issued as part of purchase – whether payment made TRA 91/134, Decision 17/98 Decision date: 8 July 1998 Act: Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keyword: Shares issued, purchase price paid Summary Barber J found that the Objectors should account for GST on the share component of the sale price as with the rest of the sale price. Facts The Objectors sold a partly completed commercial property. The sale and purchase agreement provided for the purchase price to be paid by deposit and subsequent monetary instalments except for a residual balance. The purchaser company was to pay the residual balance by issuing 400,000 $1 shares in the purchaser company. The agreement provided that the purchaser would issue the shares to the Objector on the basis that the Objectors would enter into a “put” contract with the proprietor of the purchaser, that they would not sell the shares for under $2 before 1 September 1988. After 1 September the Objectors could retain their shares and exercise their option to require the proprietor to purchase them at $2 per share. On 2 September 1988 the Objectors exercised the option but never received payment due to the proprietor going bankrupt. Decision Barber J accepted that the Objectors did not actually recover the residual amount of $800,000 in cash but that this was due to a failure to on-sell the shares by which the Objector had been paid $800,000 as part of the purchase price. His Honour found that the issue of the shares after the signing of the agreement constituted an absolute discharge of the purchaser’s obligation for the payment of $800,000 under the sale and purchase agreement.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.8 (August 1998) 4 Standard practice statements These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. Finalising agreements in tax investigations Standard Practice Statement INV-350 Summary This standard practice statement sets out the principles and parameters for finalising agreements in tax investi- gations. Final agreements must be in accordance with the law. Agreements cannot be finalised based on “splitting the difference” on a global basis. All agreements must be on an issue by issue basis based on the law and the evidence available. Once signed, the agreement precludes the taxpayer from using the disputes process in relation to the issues finalised. This standard practice statement does not cover relief in cases of serious hardship or financial hardship as provided for by sections 176 and 177 of the Tax Admin- istration Act 1994. This standard practice statement applies to all staff who complete tax investigations, e.g. Corporates, BusinessLink, BusinessDirect, Personal Customer Services, RADC, Duties. Background For a number of years the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has had a practice of resolving disputes arising from tax investigations through the process of reaching resolution. It is essential for Inland Revenue, its staff and taxpayers that a code of good practice in relation to final agree- ments be defined. This standard practice statement ensures that taxpayers are uniformly treated when entering into discussions/negotiations with Inland Revenue. These guidelines apply to finalising agreements for disputes in respect of all the Inland Revenue Acts. The principal focus is on the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These comments, with the necessary modification, apply equally to the other Inland Revenue Acts. Legal authority for finalising agreements in tax investigations As already stated all agreements must be on a principled basis. Therefore assessments arising from final agree- ments are no different from tax assessments issued in other circumstances. On many occasions the New Zealand Courts have stated that the Commissioner merely acts in the quantification of tax due, and it is the taxing Acts which charge tax. The Commissioner has a duty to assess the tax properly payable within the terms of the statutory framework, and in carrying out that duty the Commissioner must be completely impartial. All assessments arising from final agreements must conform to the relevant Inland Rev- enue Act. Finalising an agreement The final agreement with a taxpayer represents an agreement on the relevant facts and the application of the law to those facts. The process of finalising an agreement is one that will occur on an issue by issue basis. Finalising an agreement is not to be seen as a process of bargaining between the parties where issues are traded off against each other. The Commissioner will consider representations from the taxpayer, or adviser, on the relevant issues in the dispute and these will be resolved on their individual merit. It must be remembered that not all disputes will result in a final agreement being reached. Where agreement is not reached the disputes resolution process will apply. Fundamentals of the agreement The process of reaching a final agreement through negotiation is one that should occur on an issue by issue basis. It is important to recognise that the final agreement will need to be based on an assessment that conforms to the legislation. As the Commissioner is under a statutory obligation to assess and collect the correct amount of tax, it is inappropriate that the risks of litigation be factored into the final agreement. While litigation risk is an appropriate consideration in terms of commercial agreements, it is not appropriate in the context of finalising an agreement of taxation disputes. If the law is uncertain and there is only a 50/50 chance of the Courts taking one view or the other, it is not possible to simply give a taxpayer one-half of the advantage or disadvan- tage in recognition of the uncertainty. Agreements are based on the same statutory criteria as that for making other assessments. The process of final agreements should not be regarded as an opportunity for issuing an assessment that does not conform to the legislation. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.8 (August 1998) 5 There are circumstances or situations where Inland Revenue will not enter into negotiations. These are: •not assessing an amount which is clearly assessable, or allowing a deduction, rebate or credit that is clearly not allowable. •where Inland Revenue’s view of the law on a particu- lar issue is firm (e.g., as stated through the Courts, or Inland Revenue’s legal opinion is in agreement with the treatment of the issue) and this view is supported by the evidence. •penalties and/or prosecution action. •where an adjustment can be made only on an “all or nothing basis”, that is, either an adjustment would be made for the total amount in question (the quantum of which may or may not be capable of precise computa- tion) or no adjustment is made at all. For example, the assessability of a transaction may depend solely on such concepts as whether the taxpayer is carrying on a business or there was a profit making purpose. Gener- ally speaking, on the facts, the taxpayer either satisfies the criteria for assessability of income or the taxpayer is not liable for tax in respect of that transaction. Circumstances or situations where Inland Revenue may enter into negotiations are: •where the quantum of a disputed amount depends on the facts. For example, a claim at law may be subject to apportionment and there could be doubt as to the correct position to be allowed (e.g., how much is business (deductible) and how much is private (non- deductible)). •when an adjustment may rely on a question of valua- tion for which there are competing bases. For exam- ple, in the determination of an arm’s length transaction for GST purposes. •when an item may not be subject to precise computa- tion. For example in the estimation of living expenses in an asset accretion assessment. •where an issue of quantum or valuation has been resolved for one period and is likely to apply to prior periods. In these cases, where determination of the taxable income will depend on the facts, a factual position must be agreed between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue. Penalties and tax in dispute Penalties, if applicable, must be included in the final agreement. This includes penal tax, shortfall penalties and late payment penalties. In the case of shortfall penalties agreement can be negotiated only to the level of penalty imposed. Shortfall penalties will not be used as leverage to achieve an agreement. Failure to agree on penalties will not preclude an agreement on the substantive issues. Where this occurs the penalties will continue under the disputes resolution process. Ability to pay The ability of the taxpayer to pay the tax is not relevant in determining a taxpayer’s tax liability, but may give rise to other administrative arrangements tailored to the taxpayer’s circumstances. When the facts and law support issuing an assessment but the taxpayer will not be able to pay the tax, the assessment is still to be issued. The taxpayer should apply under the relevant sections of the Tax Administration Act 1994, i.e., sections 176 and 177, for consideration to have the tax remitted or obtain an instalment payment arrangement. Timing of final agreements Agreements should be finalised at the completion of an investigation. Where the attempt to finalise an agreement is unsuccess- ful the disputes resolution process is to be followed. In most cases an agreement should be finalised before an assessment is issued. The final assessment will take into account the issues agreed upon in the agreement. When an investigation extends over several years or relates to a back year assessment, it may sometimes be possible for the investigator to progressively raise with the taxpayer matters which are the focus of potential adjustment. Due to the limitation of time for amendment of assessments contained in section 108 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, it may not be possible to conclude a final agreement for all years under considera- tion. In this situation Inland Revenue may negotiate on a year by year basis. Where this situation arises, any agreement reached will not be a precedent for the treatment of future years. There may be circumstances where an agreement is finalised post assessment. This will occur only in rare circumstances, i.e., where there was no agreement in writing, or the time bar prevented resolution prior to the issue of the assessment. Form of agreement Where the agreement is of a straightforward nature it is considered that the form IR 210D, Agreed Adjustment, will be sufficient. However, in more complex cases a final agreement must contain the following information: (Refer to page XX for an example) •name, address and IRD number of the taxpayer to whom the agreement relates •a statement recording the terms of agreement, includ- ing who proposed the agreement •a statement recording the adjustments covered by the agreement, including the tax type, section of the relevant act and period involved as well as any penal tax and shortfall penalties •a statement that the taxpayer acknowledges that by signing the agreement they forfeit any further right to continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.8 (August 1998) 6 or transfer pricing has occurred. Any re-examination will also be subject to the time bar rules of section 108 and 108A of the TAA. Inland Revenue will not be bound by any final agree- ment where there has been either a failure to disclose relevant facts and/or the making of a false statement. Where a period/year has been adjusted without a full investigation of the taxpayer’s affairs being carried out (e.g., an adjustment in respect of a single issue following a policy ruling) nothing in this standard practice state- ment prevents Inland Revenue later undertaking a full review of that period/year (other than in respect of the particular issue or issues that have been the subject of a final agreement). Once a taxpayer has signed the final agreement or the IR 210D that taxpayer is precluded from using the disputes process relating to the negotiated issues. Failure to negotiate a final agreement Not all taxation disputes that are capable of negotiation will necessarily lead to a final agreement being reached. During the negotiation process, Inland Revenue will enter into correspondence and discussions on a totally “without prejudice” basis. Where a final agreement is not reached, Inland Revenue will not be bound by any factual or legal matters which may have been “agreed” on a without prejudice basis to facilitate the final agreement. Authority to approve final agreements The officer who has undertaken the investigation is not authorised to approve the final agreement. There must be objectivity in the approval of final agreements. It is therefore necessary for an independent officer to review the case. All final agreements must be approved by the person who has authority to decide disputes for that investiga- tor. Generally, this will be the team leader. In cases where approval of an assessment is required at a certain level, such as sections BG 1 (tax avoidance) and GB 1 (general anti-avoidance) of the Income Tax Act 1994, approval of any final agreement is to be given at that level. Tony Bouzaid National Manager Operations Policy from page 5 challenge the adjustments covered by the agreement, and that this right has been explained to them •a statement acknowledging that the taxpayer has made a full and true disclosure of all known facts to the Commissioner •a statement outlining the ramifications of making any false statements •a statement as to the precedential effect of the agree- ment •a statement as to the due date for payment of any deficient tax •if applicable a statement as to any additional tax included in the agreement •the agreement must be signed and dated by both parties. Although the above details must be included in every agreement, additional information may be included if relevant. However, if including additional information it is best to seek legal advice to ensure that it does not detract from the main focus of the agreement. Where there are a lot of issues in dispute it may not be possible to finalise an agreement in respect of them all. Where this situation arises the disputes resolution process would be limited to the unresolved issues. Inland Revenue can make an assessment only when all issues for the periods/years have been finalised. Where issues remain unresolved, the assessment will not be made until such time as all the outstanding issues are finalised. This is because the Commissioner cannot make a partial assessment. In this situation the disputes resolution process is to be used to resolve the remaining issues. All issues are to be taken into account when the assessment is finally made. Where a situation involves a number of taxpayers i.e., partners or shareholders, an agreement reached with one person may not necessarily form the basis of an agreement for all the other parties. This is because it is important to consider the factual background to each person’s involvement and the tax position taken by that person. Inland Revenue will adhere to the terms of the final agreement for the periods/years covered by the investi- gation. Re-examination of the taxpayer’s affairs for the periods/years covered by the final agreement would be undertaken only where, for example, new evidence suggests that tax avoidance, evasion, fraud, manipulation IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.8 (August 1998) 7 Documentary form of the final agreement Appendix to Standard Practice Statement INV-350 This document records the terms of agreement between \[taxpayer\] and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, in relation to an adjustment \[requested by taxpayer/ proposed by the Commissioner\] on \[date\].

Navigator Select Investor Service Product ruling - BR Prd 98/71 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws This Ruling applies in respect of the following sections of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: •Income Tax Act 1994, sections BD 1, BD 2, EH 1- EH 10, HH 1(8), HH 3 to HH 8 and the definitions of “unit trust”, “beneficiary income”, “trustee income”, “core acquisition price”, “financial arrangement” and “unit holders” in section OB 1. •Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, sections 3, 14 and 55(7) and the definition of “insurance” in section 2(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment of Navigator Select Investor Service (“the Service”) by Colonial Services (NZ) Limited (“CSNZL”). CSNZL is the agent of Investors in the Service and the Manager of the Service. CSNZL intends to launch the Service during August 1998. The Service provides access for Investors to a range of investment products and fund managers with all report- ing consolidated. The Administrator of the Service is Jacques Martin New Zealand Limited (“JMNZL”). This Ruling applies only to those activities of the Administrator that are carried on in relation to the Service and are described in this Arrangement. The Custodian and bare trustee of the Service, and the Nominee of the Investors is the Public Trustee acting at all times through its nominee and wholly owned subsidi- ary, Navigator Nominees Limited (“NNL”), who may also act as the trustee of any superannuation scheme made available through the Service. Investors are able to switch between investment options and make lump sum or regular contributions and withdrawals. In addition to the various investment options, Investors may also elect to include supplementary insurance benefits such as life cover, total and permanent disable- ment, trauma cover and income cover. Investors are offered the choice of investing in unit trusts (both New Zealand and Australian domiciled) and/or group investment funds (GIFs) and UK Investment Trusts and possibly in the future a master superannuation fund. The superannuation fund will in turn offer a choice of investment in wholesale superannuation funds, GIFs and unit trusts. Investors in the Service may be supplied with both life and non-life insurance cover through the Service. Investors come to CSNZL to use the Service through their financial advisers. The Manager, the Administrator and the Custodian of the Service act only as directed by Investors and do not give any investment advice or make any investment decisions under delegated authority from the Investors. Jarden Morgan Investment Services Limited under contract to CSNZL selects the product mix of the Service and makes the asset allocation decisions of the premixed selection options. Reporting to Investors under the Service is purely to provide information to Investors on details of their investments and income from their investments as well as to deliver an annual statement for taxation purposes. The reports do not constitute what is regarded in the industry as “monitoring” nor do they contain investment advice. The Investors’ agent and Manager of the Service is CSNZL. The Manager of the Service is appointed as the Investors’ agent pursuant to an investment authority given under the Investor Information Document (“the IID”) to instruct the Custodian to acquire, dispose of and receive the income from investments on behalf of the Investor. The Administrator is charged under the Administration Agreement primarily with making and withdrawing from investments on behalf of Investors as well as collecting and processing the cash flows that arise from them. As an adjunct to that activity it must carry out the conse- quential administration, reporting and record keeping activities that make up the Service. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.8 (August 1998) 9 Investors under the IID appoint the Custodian to act as bare trustee and nominee in subscribing for and holding investments in safe custody in its name on their behalf. Investors undertake to be bound by the terms of the Custodian Agreement, and authorise the Manager to delegate its powers (including those delegated to it by the Custodian) to the Administrator. The Custodian also establishes a trust account under the Cash Holding Account Agreement to facilitate all the cash flows of the Service. The administration and management of that account is delegated to the Manager who in turn delegates it to the Administrator. An Investor who wishes to use the Service will be handed an IID, which will: •Background the structure of the Service. •Explain in general terms the operation of the pertinent Administration, Custodian, Delegation and Cash Holding Account Agreements (together with the IID described as “the Agreements”) by which the Service is implemented. •Contain detachable application forms and an Invest- ment Authority by which Investors can identify their investment selections. An Investor wishing to use the Service will then make application and execute an Investment Authority under which the Investor will: •Provide a declaration pursuant to which Investors will: authorise the Manager and Custodian to act as their agent and bare trustee/nominee respectively, be bound by the Custodian Agreement and consent to the delegation of services to the Administrator. •Confirm the Investor’s receipt of investment state- ments for each option selected. Investors in products other than the superannuation fund first pay their moneys into a Cash Holding Account of the Custodian run by the Administrator who records and identifies by Investor all deposits, investments, income, withdrawals, expenses and tax information. From this account the Administrator as delegate of the Manager disperses funds into Investors’ various investment options. Interest and dividend income as well as sale proceeds and further investment moneys are all received into the Cash Holding Account which acts as a general clearing account for all funds received from or to be disbursed to Investors. There is a requirement on Investors to maintain a minimum credit balance in this account. Investors in the superannuation scheme (if made avail- able) will become direct members of the scheme, and their investment choices are activated as members of the scheme. Investors expressly acknowledge receipt of an invest- ment statement (and at their option a prospectus) from their financial adviser for each product that they select, including the superannuation scheme (if made avail- able). The relevant documentation is: (a)The Administration Agreement, being an agreement between the Manager and the Administrator. (b)The Custodian Agreement, being an agreement between the Manager and the Custodian. (c)The Cash Holding Account Agreement between the Custodian and the Manager. (d)The IID (and the Investment Authority given under the IID by the Investor) between the Manager, the Investor and the Investor’s financial adviser. (e)The Delegation Agreement between the Manager and the Custodian. The Investor in the IID undertakes to be bound by the 3 other agreements relevant to the Investor. Title to investments is held by the Custodian, and the Cash Holding Account is also in the name of the Custo- dian. The Administrator will operate the Cash Holding Account, record and trace all investments made to individual Investors, and report to them at regular intervals on the value of their investments, the income derived and any tax deductions made. The Administrator under the Administration Agreement provides a means of recording each Investor’s interest in the underlying products. The Custodian Agreement at paragraph 2.1(e) expressly describes the pooling as aggregation for “administrative convenience”. The pooling is subject to the proviso that adequate tracing be maintained at all times. Taking into account the effect of delegations, the essence of the Agreements can be summarised as follows: •The Manager provides the entire facility and arranges for investments to be made, changed, or sold by instructing the Custodian as the Investor’s agent. •The Custodian holds title to the investments and the Cash Holding Account as bare trustee for each Inves- tor. •The Administrator makes, changes or sells the invest- ments, pays and collects the resulting cash flows and attends to all consequential administration, processing, record keeping and reporting requirements of the Service. The services rendered in respect of each fee charged in relation to the Service are: •Investment/Contribution fee: •Processing applications by Investors. •Arranging the acquisition of investments. •Providing four switches per annum. •Providing documentation. continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.8 (August 1998) 10 •Trustee fee/statutory supervisor fee •Use of the trustee/statutory supervisor’s name as security holder. (The tasks of subscribing, safe custody and withdrawing from the investments are delegated to the Manager, leaving the trustee/statutory supervisor merely lending his or her name as security holder for the investment.) •Expense reimbursement fee •Maintaining register of Investors. •Accounting and legal fees excluding establishment expenses of the fund. •Preparing and distributing cheques and statements. •Printing stationery. •Cost of holding investor meetings. •Any other miscellaneous cost incurred in managing the funds. •Issuing expenses. •Brokerage fee: •Brokerage paid to broker to arrange entry into listed trusts. •Brokerage paid to broker to arrange exit from listed trusts. •Insurance cover: •The supply of life insurance cover. •The supply of non-life insurance cover. The adviser service fee, the fund manager fee and the brokerage fee are not charged by the Manager, Custo- dian or the Administrator of the Service. Investors through the Service pay these fees for services supplied to them through the Service by their adviser, fund managers and brokers. This Ruling does not consider the goods and services tax treatment of the adviser services fee, the fund manager fee and the brokerage fee paid by Investors. In respect of the fees charged by fund managers, a separate contribution fee is ordinarily charged for set up costs. Due to the size of the investment through the Service, the fund managers have waived this fee for Investors through the Service. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the following assumptions: •The Investors are resident in New Zealand under section OE 1 or OE 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994. •Where an Investor is under a legal disability, the Manager, Administrator and the Custodian will not have or exercise the receipt, control, or disposition of any income derived by that investor, but may act on the instructions of whomsoever the law gives the capacity to act on behalf of that Investor. No addi- tional powers accrue to the Manager, Administrator or •Administration fee: •Keeping records of Investors and their portfolios. •Investor level transaction recording and tracing. •Maintaining a computer system that delivers the service requirements. •Allocating and processing distributions for Investors. •Reporting to Investors and preparation of Inves- tor tax statements. •Executing proxies and voting rights of Custodian. •Reporting to the Custodian. •Maintaining Investors’ Cash Holding Accounts. •Responding to Investor queries about the Service. •Custodian fee: •Use of the Custodian’s name as security holder. (The tasks of subscribing, safe custody and withdrawing from the investments are delegated to the Administrator, leaving the Custodian merely lending his or her name as security holder for the investment.) •Switching fee: •Processing investment switches. •Expense fee: •Printing and distributing Investor information documentation, investment statements and prospectuses, excluding establishment expenses of the Service. •Audit, accounting and legal compliance services, excluding establishment expenses of the Service. •Regular withdrawal fee: •Direct crediting money to accounts for singular/ regular withdrawals. •Withdrawal fee: •Processing withdrawal applications. •Adviser service fee: •Supplying financial planning and portfolio monitoring services. •Fund manager fee: •On-going charging for management (investment and administration) of the following group investment funds: •TEA GAM Multi-Emerging Markets Funds. •Guardian Small Companies Fund. •National Mutual Mortgaged Backed Fund. •Perpetual Trust Mortgage Fund. The fees and related services that make up the fund manager fee charged by these funds are: •Annual Management Fee •On-going monitoring of the investments. •Purchasing and selling investments. •Maintaining computer system to record investments. •Receiving and processing distributions. •Reporting to Investors. •Reporting to trustee. •Responding to customer queries. from page 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.8 (August 1998) 11 the Custodian because of a lack of capacity of an Investor beneficiary so as to change the nature of the bare trust relationship. •Except for the non-life insurance cover supplied to Investors through the Service, the investments and facilities available through the Service are any debt security, equity security, participatory security, credit contract, contract of life insurance, superannuation scheme, or futures contract referred to in section 3(1)(ka) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. •The fees described in this Ruling are charged only for the services listed under each fee in the arrangement. •The final form of the Agreements will not differ materially from the draft Agreements received by Adjudication & Rulings on 17 April 1998. •The fees charged by the Administrator to the Manager under the Administration Agreement will be negoti- ated on an arm’s length basis. •The Manager, Custodian and the Administrator undertake no services that involve planning an Inves- tor’s portfolio or advising on an Investor’s portfolio or making investment decisions for an Investor. •Colonial makes goods and services tax returns as a group under the provisions of section 55 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. •The only activities carried on by the Administrator in relation to the Service are as described in the Arrange- ment to this Ruling. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The Service, to be launched to the public by CSNZL, as the Manager and the Investors’ agent, JMNZL as the Administrator, and NNL as the Custodian of the Service pursuant to a bare trust, is not a “unit trust” as defined in section OB 1 and the Investors are not “unit holders” as also defined in section OB 1. •As a consequence of Investors having direct owner- ship of their investment choices, the income from investments made by the Investors through the Service and held by the Custodian, will be gross income under section BD 1 of the relevant Investor, and not the Manager, the Administrator or the Custodian. •All the fees listed in the Arrangement that are paid by an Investor who is liable to be assessed pursuant to sections CD 3, CD 4, or CD 5 in respect of gross income received from investments through the Service, are deductible to that Investor under section BD 2, except to the extent that the fees (not being either contingent upon implementation of a “financial arrangement” or non-contingent upon implementation of a “financial arrangement” but exceeding 2% of the “core acquisition price” of a “financial arrangement” as those terms are defined in the qualified accrual rules) are incurred in gaining or producing exempt income or an amount that is excluded from being gross income. •The following fees are not deductible to an Investor who is not liable to be assessed pursuant to sections CD 3, CD 4, or CD 5 in respect of gross income received from investments through the Service: •The investment/contribution fee. •The withdrawal fee. •The brokerage fee. •The switching fee. •The adviser service fee to the extent that it relates to planning services. •The following fees paid by an Investor who is not liable to be assessed pursuant to sections CD 3, CD 4, or CD 5 in respect of gross income received from investments through the Service, are deductible to that Investor under section BD 2 except to the extent that the fees (not being either contingent upon implementa- tion of a “financial arrangement” or non-contingent upon implementation of a “financial arrangement” but exceeding 2% of the “core acquisition price” of a “financial arrangement” as those terms are defined in the qualified accrual rules) are incurred in gaining or producing exempt income or an amount that is excluded from being gross income: •The administration fee. •The custodian fee. •The expense fee. •The regular withdrawal fee. •The fund manager fee. •The adviser service fee to the extent that it relates to monitoring services. •The fees paid by the Manager in relation to the Service to the Administrator, or to any broker, agent, or associate of the Administrator, or to any independent research resource, are deductible under section BD 2 by the Manager. •GST is payable in respect of any fees charged for non- life insurance cover to Investors through the Service. •Except for any fees charged for non-life insurance cover to Investors through the Service, the fees listed in the Arrangement in this Ruling that are charged by the Manager, the Custodian and the Administrator in relation to the Service are exempt from GST by reason of the application of section 14 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. •The representative member of the Colonial group is required to make a return of goods and services tax under section 55(7) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 in respect of any fee charged for the Administra- tor’s services supplied in relation to the Service, where Investors are supplied with non-life insurance cover through the Service. continued on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.8 (August 1998) 12 The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 13 August 1998 until 31 March 2002.

Assignment of joint venture rights – assessability of payment Renouf Corporation Limited, Kirkcaldie & Stains Limited and Renouf Industries Limited v CIR Decision date: 28 July 1998 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Assigning over rights to profits Summary The Court of Appeal rejected the Commissioner’s appeal. Facts Renouf Corporation Ltd (“RCL”) had a number of subsidiary companies which included Renouf Industries Ltd (‘RIL”) and Renouf Property Developments Ltd (“RPDL”). RCL was approached by Mainzeal Group Ltd, which was interested in developing a site owned by RCL. The site was transferred to a shelf company, Wellington Tower Ltd (“WTL”) with RCL and Mainzeal each taking half of the $1 shares in WTL. Under an agreement RCL assigned to RPDL “its rights under the Joint Venture Agreement to fifty percent of the future development profits arising from the development of that site” for the consideration of $2.75 million. The Commissioner included the payment of $2.75 million from RPDL to RCL under the agreement as assessable income in the hands of RCL. The Commissioner relied alternatively upon the provisions of section 65(2)(a), the third limb of section 65(2)(e), section 65(2)(1) and section 191(4)(A) of the Income Tax Act 1976 to support his view that the $2.75 million payment was assessable income. Decision On appeal the Commissioner submitted that all that passed to RPDL under the 20 August 1985 agreement was: (a)RCL’s right under the joint venture and (b)a right to the expected dividend corresponding to one half of the distributable development profit earned by WTL. The Court of Appeal rejected this submission and found that the agreement assigned to RPDL the beneficial interest in RCL’s shares in WTL along with all its rights under the joint venture agreement. As the transaction related to the WTL shares it was structural in nature and not a contract in the course of business or revenue earning activities. The Commissioner submitted that the sale of RCL’s interest in the joint venture came within the ambit of sections 65(2)(e) and 191(4A) because the sale of its interest in the joint venture and the WTL shares was derived from the carrying out of a scheme or undertak- ing. The Court of Appeal held that there was nothing in the present case that indicated that RCL and Mainzeal intended, when they formed their joint venture, to quit their WTL shareholdings once the Jervois Quay project was completed and sold. The Court of Appeal concluded that in these circumstances the sale of the WTL shares and the interest in the joint venture did not produce any sum “derived from the carrying on or carrying out” of the alleged scheme. There was no pursuance of the scheme when RCL sold its interests, rather there was a withdrawal from the scheme. The Court of Appeal rejected an argument that section 191(4A) applied in this case.

Two aircraft were pur- chased, insured and registered in the name of the company. The aircraft were left off the company’s balance sheet and depreciation was not claimed. Decision J P Alexander’s application to lead “considerable” further evidence which was not allowed. The Court of Appeal held that the material concerned could have been discovered and led if reasonable diligence had been used in the High Court. That in its self disposed of the appeal. But the Court of Appeal said even if fresh evidence had been adduced, it would have made no difference. J P Alexander argued that money was taken from the company and held on trust by him, and that later the money was returned to the company by the purchase of the said aircraft. The Court of Appeal held that even if he were a trustee for the company he would be assess- able in any event.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 3 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Stamp duty special arrangement – documents that don’t need stamping by Inland Revenue Introduction The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has the authority to grant a Special Arrangement, which allows certain documents to be registered without a stamping impres- sion being placed on them. This currently applies to transactions that are residential property under 4500m², and also bare land under 4500m² which is going to have a residential property built on it. A Special Arrangement applies to classes of instruments, which the Commissioner has declared as exempt under section 70(2) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. Legislation Section 70 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 provides: (1) (Ineligible) No person required or empowered to register or record any instrument on which stamp duty is payable, or any transaction evidenced by such an instrument, shall register or record the instrument or transaction unless the instrument has been stamped in accordance with this Act. (2) (Special Arrangement) Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) of this section, the Commissioner may from time to time, by special arrangement with any person exempt that person or any class of persons from compliance with subsection (1) of this section. Every exemption given by the Commissioner shall be in writing, and may be absolute or conditional or limited to specific classes of instruments or transactions. Application This Special Arrangement applies to the classes of instruments listed below, that are executed on or after 1 August 1998 until such time as the Commissioner varies or revokes this Special Arrangement. The expressions used in this Special Arrangement have the same meaning as in the Stamp and Cheques Duties Act 1971 (unless the context otherwise requires). This Special Arrangement is not intended to replace or alter in any way the Special Arrangement in the Taxa- tion Reform Bill (No.3), which was passed on 17 March 1988. Special Arrangement District Land Registrars and Assistant Land Registrars, or any persons holding those offices, are exempt from compliance with section 70(1) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, when the following instruments are presented for registration: •transfer granting an easement •transfer pursuant to sections 15 and 21 of the Matri- monial Property Act 1976 •transfer containing a land covenant where the same party is both transferor and transferee •transfer pursuant to a will •transfer of undivided shares in residential land that exceeds 4500m² – in this situation use the section 24 certification and clearly state that it is a partial interest being transferred •transfer from joint tenancy to tenants in common – this exemption applies only to joint tenants transferring land to themselves as tenants in common •transfer granting of a forestry right in terms of the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983 •transfer of mortgage •transfers of deferred payment licences under the Land Act 1948 •transfer where the original agreement has been stamped – in such cases a certification is required to be placed on the transfer. The certification must be signed by a solicitor and include the following information; –date agreement stamped –amount of stamp duty paid –certified by solicitor for transferee/transferee (delete inapplicable alternative) This special arrangement is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This Special Arrangement is signed on 6 July 1998. Tony Bouzaid National Manager Operations Policy IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 4 Hi-trim shelter trimmers Depreciation determination DEP40 In Tax Information Bulletin Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998), at page 7, we published a draft general deprecia- tion determination for hi-trim shelter trimmers. These trimmers are attached to tractors and used in the agricul- tural and horticultural industry for trimming and topping shelter belts. Only one submission was received on the draft. It suggested that the trimmer and the tractor to which it is attached be treated as one asset, and depreciated at the rate proposed in the draft determination. We considered this point when preparing the draft determination. Advice received by the Commissioner was that the trimmers are attached to the tractors, using a sub-frame designed to protect the tractor from damage while in use. For depreciation purposes, the sub-frame should be regarded as part of the trimmer, but the tractor is a separate asset to be depreciated using the appropriate depreciation rate for tractors. The Commissioner has now issued the general deprecia- tion determination, which is reproduced below. It may be cited as “Determination DEP40: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 40”. The determi- nation is based on the estimated useful life (EUL) of 10 years as set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP40 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP40: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 40”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1997/98 and subsequent income years. 2. Determination Pursuant to section EG 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 I hereby amend Determination DEP1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1 (as previously amended) by: •Inserting into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category the general asset class, esti- mated useful life, and diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rates listed below: EstimatedDV bandedSL equivalent Agriculture,useful lifedep’n ratebanded dep’n rate Horticulture and Aquaculture(years)(%)(%) Hi-trim shelter trimmer (including sub-frame)101812.5 3. Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1994. This determination is signed by me on the 20th day of August 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Fringe benefit tax - prescribed interest rate decreased to 10.13% The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment-related loans has been decreased to 10.13% for the quarter beginning on 1 July 1998. This rate will continue to apply to subsequent quarters until any further adjustment is made. The prescribed rate, down from 11.23%, is a reflection of the recent fall in market rates. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 5 Electricity revenue and data logging terminals Depreciation Determination DEP41 In TIB Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998) we published a draft general depreciation determination for electricity revenue and data logging terminals. These terminals are installed in businesses and homes to record the amount of electricity used and the times of usage. This informa- tion is stored by the meter and downloaded, via modem, from time to time, to give the electricity provider information that allows customers to be billed, network capacities to be designed, and charge-out rates for the electricity to be fixed. Customers are also able to access the information so that they may consider how best to take advantage of off-peak rates etc. No submissions were received on this draft and the Commissioner has now issued the determination. It is reproduced below and may be cited as “Determination DEP41: Tax Depreciation Rates Determination General Determination No.41”. The determination is based on the estimated useful lives set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP41 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP41: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 41”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1997/98 and subsequent income years. 2. Determination Pursuant to section EG 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 I hereby amend Determination DEP1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1 (as previously amended) by: •Inserting into the “Power Generation and Electrical Reticulation Systems” industry category the general asset classes, estimated useful lives, and diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rates listed below: EstimatedDV bandedSL equivalent Power Generation anduseful lifedep’n ratebanded dep’n rate Electrical Reticulation Systems(years)(%)(%) Electricity Revenue and Data Logging Terminal82215.5 Electricity Revenue and Data Logging Terminal (when leased)44030 3. Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1994. This determination is signed by me on the 2nd day of September 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Norway/New Zealand double tax agreement amended The double tax agreement (DTA) between New Zealand and Norway has been amended to change the manner by which Norway will eliminate double taxation. Paragraph (c) of the Protocol to the DTA allowed an amendment to paragraph 2 of Article 24 of the DTA, which is the manner by which Norway will eliminate double taxation. The Protocol sets out revised wording for paragraph 2 of Article 24 that provides for Norway to eliminate double taxation by tax credit instead of exemption. The amendment comes into force 30 days after New Zealand confirms receipt of Norway’s notice and has effect for the next income year. Norway gave notice under paragraph (c) of the Protocol on 30 April 1998. New Zealand gave the requisite confirmation on 16 June. Consequently, the amendment entered into force on 16 July 1998 and will have effect from next income year. Because the amendment affects continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 6 Where a resident of Norway derives income or owns capital which in accordance with the provisions of this Convention may be taxed in New Zealand, Norway shall allow as a deduction from the income tax or capital tax of that person an amount equal to the tax paid in New Zealand. Such deduction shall not, however, exceed that part of the Norwegian tax, as computed before the deduction is given, which is appropriate to the income derived from or capital owned in New Zealand. Bird netting Depreciation Determination DEP42 In TIB Volume Ten, No.7 (July 1998), at page 7, we published a draft general depreciation determination for bird netting used by winegrowers to protect ripening grapes from birds. The netting is removed when the grapes are picked. It is subject to tearing from snagging on the vine as it is put up or taken in, and also deterio- rates in sunlight. At the end of each season, netting is patched and repaired before being stored out of the sunlight until the next season’s use. No submissions were received on the draft and the Commissioner has now issued the determination. It is reproduced below and may be cited as “Determination DEP42: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination No.42”. The determination is based on the estimated useful lives set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP42 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP42: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 42”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1997/98 and subsequent income years. 2.

As noted above, paragraph (c) of the Protocol contains the revised paragraph 2 of Article 24, which states: 2. In the case of Norway double taxation shall be avoided as follows: IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 7 Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. How- ever, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. Amateur sports promoter exemption – application to non-residents Summary This interpretation statement sets out the Commission- er’s interpretation of whether a non-resident can qualify for the amateur sports promoter exemption from income tax provided by section CB 4(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The item concludes that a non-resident is not excluded from qualifying for the exemption solely by reason of being non-resident. This item does not comment on the particular require- ments in section CB 4(1)(h) for qualification for the exemption available to sports promoters. Only the question of whether a society or association which otherwise meets the requirements of being an amateur sports promoter is prevented from qualifying for the exemption because it is non-resident, is addressed. All legislative references in this item are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Legislation Section CB 4 provides an exemption from income tax for the income of certain non-profit bodies and charities. Section CB 4(1)(h) applies to income derived by ama- teur sports promoters and states that, to the extent that in the absence of the section the following amounts would be gross income, they are exempt income. It states: Any amount derived by any society or association, whether incorporated or not, which is, in the opinion of the Commis- sioner, established substantially or primarily for the purpose of promoting any amateur game or sport if that game or sport is conducted for the recreation or entertainment of the general public, and if no part of the funds of the society or association is used or available to be used for the private pecuniary profit of any proprietor, member, or shareholder of that society or association: Application of the legislation Nothing in the strict wording of the provision itself, or in other sections of the Act, specifically limits the availabil- ity of the exemption in section CB 4(1)(h) to resident taxpayers. However, it is also necessary to ascertain whether such a limitation is to be inferred from statutory construction and/or the relevant case law. These two aspects are discussed below. Statutory construction Under section AA 2, a person who is resident in New Zealand or who has income from New Zealand is subject to the Income Tax Act. Accordingly, a non-resident deriving income from New Zealand is subject to New Zealand income tax unless otherwise exempted. Further- more, a non-resident deriving New Zealand sourced income is also subject to the general application of provisions of the Income Tax Act unless the Act pro- vides otherwise. Examples of provisions which apply to specifically exempt certain New Zealand sourced income derived by non-residents include: •Section CB 2(1)(a) - income derived by non-resident entertainers. •Section CB 2(1)(b) - interest on certain government borrowings from a non-resident. •Section CB 2(1)(c) - personal services income derived by non-residents visiting New Zealand for not more than 92 days. •Section CB 2(1)(d) - income of visiting experts or students in New Zealand under government assistance arrangements. On the other hand, the Act contains other exempt income provisions providing exemptions for certain interest income (sections CB 1(1)(a) and (c)), but which specifically exclude absentees from their application. An “absentee” for the purpose of these provisions is a person who is non-resident throughout the income year. It is possible to infer from this that if it were not for these specific exclusions provided in the legislation (in sections CB 1(1)(a) and (c)), a non-resident in receipt of such New Zealand sourced interest income would be entitled to claim these interest exemptions. Section CB 4(1)(h) requires that the game or sport being promoted “is conducted for the recreation or entertain- ment of the general public”. This condition does not impose any requirement that the promoter itself must be resident in New Zealand, but applies whether the promoter seeking to obtain the benefit of the exemption is resident or not. The Australian Tax Office has issued a taxation ruling (TR 97/22) on the application of the income tax exemp- tion available to sporting organisations under continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 8 indirectly from all sources in Australia which is not exempt income. The territorial basis of taxation is clearly shown by these provisions, ... The liability is in respect of all income, in the case of a resident, which is not exempt income and, in the case of a non-resident, of all Australian income which is not exempt income. ... The scope of the exemptions might well be expected to be commensurate with the application of the provisions imposing liability. ... An examination of the various paragraphs of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, which deal with many exemptions, shows that in some an express limitation is included based on territorial grounds. In section 78(1)(a) \[section KC 5\], which allows a deduction \[rebate\] to taxpayers in respect of gifts made to institutions of a specified charitable nature, there is an express qualification confining it to institutions in Australia. In view of these matters I think that to imply in section 23(e) \[section CB 4(1)(c)\] a restriction which has not been expressed would be to amend and not to interpret the language of the enactment. Although the decision in University of Birmingham and Epsom College is not from the New Zealand jurisdiction, and the statutory provision to which it relates (section 23(e) of Australia’s Income Tax Assessment Act 1936) is different from section CB 4(1)(h), the decision can be treated as relevant and authoritative because: •Section 23(e) is, like section CB 4(1)(h), a provision establishing a category of exempt income. •Section 23(e) is, like section CB 4(1)(h), a provision relating to institutions, and those institutions are capable of being either residents or non-residents. •The same statutory scheme which influenced the Court in reaching its decision is present in the New Zealand statute, i.e. a scheme which imposes liability on income derived within the relevant jurisdiction by non-residents. •Other sections and subsections in subpart CB of the Income Tax Act 1994, like other paragraphs in section 23 of the Australian statute, impose territorial limitations on aspects of other exemptions, for exam- ple: •CB 2(1)(c) - Income from personal services by visiting non-residents; •CB 2(1)(d) - Income from expert advice, etc., by visiting non-resident; •CB 4(1)(e) - Charitable purposes limited to those within New Zealand; •CB 4(1)(f) - Promotion of veterinary services within New Zealand only; •CB 4(1)(g) - Promotion of the standard of dairy cattle within New Zealand only; •CB 8(1)(b) - “Niue dividends” derived by a non- resident; •CB 9(f) - Life policies entered into within or outside New Zealand treated differently. •Section KC 5(1) of the New Zealand statute, like the then section 78(1)(a) of the Australian statute, limits relief for “charitable donations” to donations to institutions within the jurisdiction. paragraph (c) of item 9.1 of the table in section 50-45 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (formerly con- tained in subparagraph 23(g)(iii) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936). However, that ruling does not address the issue considered in this interpretation statement. Summary: The statutory construction of the Act does not establish clearly whether the exemption provisions of section CB 4(1)(h) apply to non-residents. However, to the extent that the section’s application can be inferred from the above analysis, statutory construction points to non-residents not being prevented from obtaining the exemption. It indicates that if a non-resident derives New Zealand sourced income which otherwise meets the criteria laid down for an exemption, the non-resident will not be excluded from the application of the exemp- tion by reason only of being a non-resident, unless a specific exclusion for non-residents exists. Case law There are no reported cases on section CB 4(1)(h) and the question of its application to non-residents, or on similar residence questions relating to the application of other subsections of section CB 4(1) which exempt the income of specific societies or institutions (section CB 4(1)(b), (f), (g), (j), and (k)). However, the issue was considered directly by the High Court of Australia in University of Birmingham v Commissioner of Taxation and Epsom College v Com- missioner of Taxation (1938) 1 AITR 383, a case concerning section 23(e) of Australia’s Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. Section 23(e) was a provision exempting the income of charitable institutions and was similar to section CB 4(1)(c) of New Zealand’s Income Tax Act 1994. The facts were that the university and the college were both institutions established in Britain and carrying on no activities in Australia. However, they both derived income in Australia. Section 23(e) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 provided: The following income shall be exempt from income tax – ... (e) the income of a religious, scientific, charitable or public educational institution The Court found that there was no reason to restrict the availability of the exemption to institutions based in Australia. This quote from Dixon J (with references to sections of Australia’s Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 given their NZ Income Tax Act 1994 equivalents in square brackets): By section 17 \[section BB 1\] income tax is imposed upon the taxable income of any person whether a resident or a non- resident. Taxable income means the amount remaining after deducting from the assessable income all allowable deductions (s.6). Section 25(1) \[section BB 3\] provides that the assessable income of a taxpayer shall include:- (a) where the taxpayer is a resident - the gross income derived directly or indirectly from all resources whether in or out of Australia: and (b) where the taxpayer is a non-resident - gross income derived directly or from page 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 9 Further case law in support of the view that non-resi- dents are not excluded from the exemption in section CB 4(1)(h), is the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in CIR v Alcan New Zealand Limited \[1994\] 3 NZLR 439. In that case the Commissioner had con- tended that the taxpayer and Alcan Australia Ltd were not within a group of companies for the purposes of section 191(3) of the Income Tax Act 1976. His grounds were that Alcan Australia was not a New Zealand taxpayer in the sense that it had assessable income or losses in New Zealand or been engaged in a business activity which produced assessable income or losses in New Zealand. The Court held that it was not implicit in section 191(3) that each of the companies in the group was to be a New Zealand taxpayer. The following comments from the judgment of the Court delivered by McKay J, are relevant: None of the arguments advanced provide sufficient basis for departing from the plain meaning of the words of the section. It is not necessary to read into those words some implied limitation. To do so would require speculation as to the legislative intent, as is illustrated by the changing stance adopted by the Commissioner as to the qualification for which he has contended. ... In our view there is no justification for reading any of these qualifications into the definition. The words are plain, and should be given their plain meaning. A UK charity case that provides additional support for this position is Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation Inc. v IR Commrs \[1954\] 2 All ER 466. In one of the judgments in this case, Jenkins LJ commented (at page 483): I agree that the general principle deducible from (for example) Colquhoun v Heddon (1890), 25 QBD 129; 2 Tax Cas. 621, cannot of itself provide any sufficient ground for limiting the exemption afforded by s.37 in the way contended for by the Crown. Where an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament imposes a tax on income arising in the United Kingdom, makes the tax equally exigible whether the person entitled to the income is British or foreign, resident or non-resident, and affords an exemption from the tax to persons fulfilling specified conditions which do not expressly include citizenship of or residence in the United Kingdom, there can, in my view, be no justification for the implied exclusion from the benefit of the exemption of a foreign non-resident who has suffered, or apart from the exemption would suffer, the tax, and who satisfies all the express requirements of the exempting provision, merely on the grounds that he is a non-resident foreigner. \[Emphasis added\] Summary: The decision in the University of Birmingham and Epsom College case and comments in the Alcan and Dreyfus Foundation cases support the view that, unless specifically excluded, the income exemption provisions in subpart CB will apply to non-residents. Conclusion Non-residents are not excluded from the application of the amateur sports promoter income exemption in section CB 4(1)(h) by virtue of their status as non- residents. Accordingly, provided a non-resident satisfies the other particular requirements in section CB 4(1)(h), that person will qualify for the exemption. Inland Revenue plans to issue a draft interpretation statement on the general application of the section CB 4(1)(h) amateur sports promoter exemption in the New Zealand context at a future date. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 10 General interest items Inland Revenue Technical Rulings – now limited to historic value As part of Inland Revenue’s desire to improve technical quality, and to provide the best tools to assist staff in this quest, the Department has reviewed the role of Technical Rulings Manuals (“Technical Rulings”). Inland Revenue Technical Rulings have operated for many years and were designed to assist IRD staff who work in the technical areas. Official versions have been released upon request under the Official Information Act. The review confirmed what had been recognised for some years. With the introduction of various external publications and electronic software packages, depart- mental officers were reliant less on Technical Rulings. With the external literature being up to date, and the authors of those using Inland Revenue publications e.g. commentary on the legislation at the time of the enactment, the need to keep revising the chapters had not been treated as a priority. As a result, many of the Technical Rulings chapters had not been updated since 1992 and had become inaccurate. The review showed that when updating of chapters had occurred, in many respects, it had become a replica of the external publica- tions, which had included commentary from the publica- tions issued by IRD. This duplication resulted in the unwise use of resources. The exception to the updating programme has been the chapter on Charities and Donee Organisations where the list has been regularly updated. For many years now the Department has been publishing Tax Information Bulletins. They target people with an interest in taxation, including IRD staff. The bulletins include: legislative comments, determinations, binding rulings, interpretation statements, standard practice statements, questions IRD has been asked, legal deci- sions and items of general interest. Given the above, the decision has been made by IRD to formally and totally discontinue the updating of what was known as Technical Rulings. This raises the issue as to the status of Technical Rul- ings. Technical Rulings were written for the benefit of Inland Revenue staff and were not subjected to the degree of analysis and consultation prior to issue that occurs with current tax publications. Further Technical Rulings have not been updated in many areas so can best be described as historical guidelines for staff. Inland Revenue staff, in examining technical issues, will apply the principles of statutory interpretation. Technical Rulings may, in some instances, be useful as background material, but the contents should not be relied upon as representing Inland Revenue’s present views or practice on any of the issues covered in Technical Rulings. Inland Revenue will continue to update the donee list. This list can be obtained electronically or in hard copy by contacting the TRACE Data Co-ordinator at National Office, PO Box 2198, Wellington. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations Policy 2 September 1998 Tax Education Office – end of one era; start of another The Tax Education Office (TEO) has been an important resource to tax professionals throughout New Zealand. Recently the TEO has changed from a state-subsidised organisation to a privately owned entity. TEO services will now be provided by CPD Tax Education Ltd of Lower Hutt Background The Government established the TEO in 1988 as a training and education resource. Its purpose was to assist tax professionals and businesses understand changes in the tax system quickly and to raise issues to do with implementation of new tax legislation and policy. Many readers will be familiar with the TEO newsletters and annual seminar series. The TEO was a significant resource to the tax profession during the tax reforms of the late 80s and it continued to provide high quality training to tax professionals, and feedback to Inland Revenue, through the 90s. Changing times More recently with the introduction of simpler tax systems and the proliferation of training and education resources, the Government decided that state funding of such a service was no longer necessary and so funding of the TEO was withdrawn. However, there was interest from a number of organisa- tions in carrying on similar services so the Government decided to sell the assets of the TEO in a fair, contest- able, and transparent way. Inland Revenue was given the task of managing the sale. The new TEO The sale is now complete and the new owner of the TEO is CPD Tax Education Ltd. The parent company, CPD Training is an established provider of training for the accountant profession throughout New Zealand. The owner/director, Frank Owen, has an extensive back- ground in tax from both a corporate and small business perspective. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 11 CPD Tax Education have come up with a number ideas for continuing and extending the services offered by the TEO. The new owner will soon be meeting the relevant senior managers in Inland Revenue to plan cooperation for mutual benefit and for the benefit of New Zealand tax professionals. Inland Revenue, on behalf of the Crown, will be writing to former customers of the TEO to tell them about the change and enable them to be involved with the new TEO. Otherwise, CPD Tax Education can be contacted as follows: Freepost 114371 PO Box 31 548 LOWER HUTT 119 Queens Drive LOWER HUTT Telephone \[Temporary\] (04) 566 8818 Fax \[Temporary\] (04) 566 8807 Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Library books and periodicals – clarification of depreciation determination DEP32 Section EG 4, Income Tax Act 1994 - Basic economic depreciation rate A taxpayer has asked for clarification of depreciation determination DEP32, published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Ten, No.3 (March 1998) at page 3. She has asked for the correct depreciation rate applying to those publications that provide an updating service and an annual consolidated version of the publication at the end of each year. An example is an annual tax cases service, where a bound volume is provided free of charge at the end of the year. Under section BD 2(1), taxpayers are allowed a deduc- tion for expenditure incurred in deriving their gross income. That includes expenditure on newspapers, journals, periodical and books relevant to their business. Subscriptions for newspapers, journals, etc, are generally treated as an expense item, and a full deduction is claimed in the year the expenditure is incurred. How- ever, books are generally depreciated over their useful life. Determination DEP32: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 32 sets out the deprecia- tion rates to be used for library books and periodicals. The commentary on that determination distinguishes between books provided as part of a subscription to an updating service, and those books for which a charge is made in addition to the subscription fee. To clarify the correct position on this issue: •If the annual consolidated version is provided as part of the subscription fee, the full subscription fee may be written off in the year of purchase. •If the subscription fee provides only the updating service, and the annual consolidated version must be purchased separately, or if additional copies of the annual consolidated version are purchased (or only the annual consolidated version is required), the annual consolidated version should be treated as “other books”, with an estimated useful life of 10 years. Taxpayers should also be aware of the provisions of section EG 16, which allow a full deduction for assets costing $200 or less. In these cases DEP32 cannot require those assets to be depreciated. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 12 Prints and original paintings – depreciation Section OB 1, Income Tax Act 1994 – Definition of “depreciable property” A taxpayer has bought an original oil painting and a print to hang in her café. She wants to know whether she can depreciate the items. Under section OB 1, “depreciable property” in relation to any taxpayer, means any property of that taxpayer which might reasonably be expected in normal circum- stances to decline in value while used or available for use in deriving gross income or in carrying on a business for that purpose. “Prints” qualify as depreciable property, and are listed under the “Hotels, motels, restaurants, cafes, taverns and takeaway bars” industry category on pages 34 and 35 of Inland Revenue’s 1994 depreciation guide (IR 260). They are depreciated at 18% DV or 12.5% SL (based on a 10-year estimated useful life), and provided they are used in the derivation of gross income or in the carrying on of a business for the purpose of deriving gross income, the taxpayer is entitled to depreciate them. An original painting is not considered to meet the test of being reasonably expected, in normal circumstances, to decline in value. Accordingly, under the section OB 1 definition it would not be depreciable property, even if the taxpayer is deriving gross income or in the business of deriving gross income. However, in limited circumstances the taxpayer may be able to depreciate an original oil painting, i.e. if it can be shown that the circumstances are such that a particular painting can reasonably be expected to decline in value. The test of whether a particular painting is likely to decline in value will always be question of fact, but clearly a painting by an unknown artist bought in a garage sale might be contrasted with a painting by a famous artist (such as Monet). In most instances, it should be clear whether or not a particular item is likely to decline in value. This must however be objectively correct. If it is not clear, a valuation opinion may be sought to independently and objectively satisfy the test of whether an item is depreciable property or not under section OB 1. Inland Revenue is in the process of preparing two more depreciation categories covering: •prints in offices and similar business premises •original paintings when the works are reasonably expected to decline in value. At this time we expect that these categories are likely to have the same depreciation rate as the category for prints listed under the “Hotels, motels, restaurants, cafes, taverns and takeaway bars” industry category discussed above. Note that a taxpayer may be able to apply for a specific depreciation determination for depreciable property (other than fixed life intangible or excluded depreciable property) under section EG 4 or section EG 10, if the asset is reasonably expected to decline in value and there is no published depreciation rate, or such a rate is considered inappropriate for the asset in question. In this particular case, the café owner can depreciate the print at the rate of 18% DV or 12.5% SL. The original painting can be depreciated only if it can be established that it is reasonably expected to decline in value.

We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Assets acquired at no cost – GST input deduction Elizabeth Zele Wilke v CIR Decision date: 14 August 1998 Act: Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords: Input tax credits disallowed Facts 144 hectares of land had been leased to a farming partnership, which consisted of Elizabeth Wilke and her late husband. Elizabeth Wilke then inherited the land from her late husband when he passed away in 1995. Mrs Wilke applied this land to her own farming activity and claimed an input tax credit for the open market value of the land she inherited. The Commissioner disallowed the claim for an input tax credit on the basis that the cost of the land to Mrs Wilke was “nil”. The Commissioner intended to obtain a ruling on the same point by way of appeal against the judgment of the taxation Review Authority in Case S66 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,412. Through an administrative oversight the appeal did not proceed. This case was intended to test the result in Case S66. Decision Justice Panckhurst disagreed with Barber J in Case S66. Panckhurst J found that when goods have been acquired at no cost and are subsequently applied to making taxable supplies, no input tax deduction should be allowed. His Honour held that section 21(5) must be read against the background of section 20 (‘the parent section’). His Honour also agreed that with the Commissioner that the words “the lesser of” in section 21(5) are of particular significance and that their meaning is plain. Crown business taken over – deductibility of accrued staff leave liabilities New Zealand Forest Research Institute Ltd v CIR The Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand Ltd v CIR Decision date: 3 September 1998 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Capital expenditure or revenue expenditure Facts The issues to be resolved in both cases were substan- tially the same. New Zealand Forest Research Institute Ltd (“NZFRI”) was the representative Objector. On 1 July 1992 NZFRI acquired certain Crown assets and the Crown’s business related to forest research. Under the transfer agreement NZFRI assumed certain liabilities from the Crown, effective from the transfer date. Those liabilities included ones related to the business or activity carried on by the Ministry of For- estry before the transfer date or to the transfer or em- ployment of any employee of the Ministry, or on the terms on which any employee was previously employed. continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 14 The Commissioner disallowed the deduction on the basis that it was a capital item and non deductible. Decision The Court found that the deductions claimed in respect of payments of accrued leave to employees who trans- ferred to the objectors on the transfer of assets and liabilities from the Crown on 30 June 1992 represent capital expenditure and therefore cannot be deductible for tax purposes. The Crown was obliged to adjust the purchase price for the assets transferred to NZFRI by an amount deter- mined having regard to “accrued staff liabilities”. These liabilities included different types of leave pay which employees of the Crown had become entitled to before the business and assets were transferred to NZFRI. Under the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992 NZFRI recognised transferring employees as being entitled to certain paid leave with effect from 1 July 1992 and paid $836,978 in the succeeding year to employees. from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 15 Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Ten, No.9 (September 1998) 18 Depreciation determinations issued since last update of IR 260 Depreciation booklet This list shows all depreciation determinations we’ve issued since the last update of our Depreciation booklet (IR 260). It will enable you to check quickly whether you need to review any determinations when calculating depreciation for tax purposes. Some determinations cover a large number of assets which will concern relatively few taxpayers. For these determinations we’ve simply listed a cross-reference to the original TIB article rather than reproduce several pages of figures here. This list is essentially a summary; if you’re claiming depreciation on any of these assets we recommend that you refer to the original TIB article to make sure you get the full context of the determination, including the relevant industry categories. We publish this list in the TIB every March, June, September and December. Updates are available at other times from TIBs on our website at: http://www.ird.govt.nz.

If you find that you prefer the TIB from our website and no longer need a paper copy, please let us know so we can take you off our mailing list. You can e-mail us from our website. Online TIB (HTML format) •This is the better format if you want to read the TIB on-screen (single column layout). •Any references to related TIB articles or other material on our website are hyperlinked, allowing you to jump straight to the related article. This is particularly useful when there are subsequent updates to an article you’re reading, because we’ll retrospectively add links to the earlier article. •Individual TIB articles will print satisfactorily, but this is not the better format if you want to print out a whole TIB. •All TIBs from January 1997 onwards (Volume Nine, No.1) are available in this format.

The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. Trading stock – tax treatment of disposals Public ruling BR Pub 98/8 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 3, FB 3, and OB 1 (definition of “trading stock”) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies This Ruling applies to sales and dispositions of property (including contracts of sale of, and agreements to sell property) that is part of the trading stock of a business owned or carried on by the vendor. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •When stock is sold in the ordinary course of business, section CD 3 applies to include within gross income, amounts that are “derived” from that sale. For these purposes, such derivation occurs when the income is earned, being when a legally enforceable debt arises, or the right to be paid otherwise crystallises. •If trading stock is sold outside the ordinary course of business, and/or together with any other assets of the business (whether the whole of the business or only a part of the business), section FB 3 applies to include within gross income for that year, all amounts received from the sale or disposition of that trading stock, or as the case may be, the price at which the Act deems the trading stock to have been realised. The date of sale or disposition differs, depending on whether a clearly expressed intention of the parties exists as to when property in the goods is to pass: •If a clearly expressed intention of the parties as to the time of passing of property is evident from the terms of the contract, the conduct of the parties and the circumstances of the case, the date of sale or disposition will be the date the parties intended property in the goods to pass. •If no clearly expressed intention as to the time of passing of property can be determined, the date of sale or disposition will be determined according to the appropriate statutory presumption contained in section 20 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908. In short: •If there is an unconditional contract for goods that are specific and in a deliverable state – the date the contract becomes unconditional. •If the vendor must do something to make such goods deliverable – the date such action is com- pleted, and the buyer is notified. •If the vendor must weigh, measure, or test such goods in order to ascertain the selling price – the date such action is completed and the buyer is notified. •If goods are delivered to a buyer on “sale or return” or similar terms – the time at which the buyer signifies his or her approval or retains the goods without notifying rejection within an agreed or reasonable timeframe. •If unascertained or future goods are sold by description – when the goods are in a deliverable state and unconditionally appropriated to the contract by either party with the assent of the other. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from 1 February 1999 to the end of the 2002 income year. This Ruling is signed by me on the 16th day of Decem- ber 1998. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 4 Commentary on public ruling BR Pub 98/8 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 98/8. Background Where the trading stock of a business is being sold or disposed of, there has been some confusion about the point in time when the consideration is to be included in gross income. The confusion centres on whether the proceeds from the sale or disposal of trading stock should be included in gross income when delivery and payment occurs, or upon the sale and purchase agree- ment becoming unconditional. Inland Revenue became aware of this issue in the context of livestock sales, but the legal principles which determine this issue are applicable to trading stock per se and this public ruling applies to all trading stock. Further confusion arose in terms of the question of whether section CD 3 or FB 3 applied to sales of trading stock made in the ordinary course of business. In order to address the question, it has been necessary to look at the history of the sections, case law, and general principles of contract law as well as the effect of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 on contracts of sale of property. Legislation Part EE of the Act ensures that the value of trading stock at the beginning and end of the income year is taken into account when calculating the income of a business for tax purposes. Section CD 3 states: The gross income of any person includes any amount derived from any business. Section FB 3 states: Where in any income year the whole or any part of the assets of a business owned or carried on by any taxpayer is sold or otherwise disposed of (whether by way of exchange, or gift, or distribution in terms of a will or on an intestacy, or otherwise, and whether or not in the ordinary course of the business of the taxpayer or for the purpose of putting an end to that business or any part of it), and the assets sold or otherwise disposed of consist of or include any trading stock, the consideration received or receivable for the trading stock or, as the case may be, the price which under this Act the trading stock is deemed to have realised shall be taken into account in determining the taxpayer’s gross income for that year, and the person acquiring the trading stock shall, for the purpose of calculating the person’s taxable income for that year or for any subsequent income year, be deemed to have purchased it at the amount of that consideration or price. This section shall, with any necessary modifications, apply in any case where a share or interest in any trading stock is sold or otherwise disposed of by any taxpayer. “Trading stock” is defined in section OB 1. It is defined slightly differently for the purposes of different sections of the Act, and over time. However, for the purposes of this discussion, it is sufficient to state that it includes anything produced or manufactured, anything held for sale or exchange, and livestock, but that it does not include land or financial arrangements to which the qualified accruals rules apply. Application of the legislation and case law Which section applies? Section CD 3 includes within gross income amounts derived from any business. If sales of trading stock occurred in the ordinary course of business, it would be expected that section CD 3 would apply to include such amounts within gross income. However, a broad and literal interpretation of section FB 3 would include amounts received from the sale of trading stock, whether or not the sale occurred in the ordinary course of busi- ness. In order to resolve this apparent inconsistency, it is necessary to examine the history and interpretation of the sections and their overseas equivalents. History of section FB 3 Section FB 3 was introduced in 1939 as part of a whole stock sub-code. It was acknowledged by the Hon. Mr Nash (recorded in NZ Parliamentary Debates Vol 256, 1939: 537) that the whole of the sub-code followed, to a large extent, the procedure adopted in Australia. However, the equivalent Australian subsection was explicit that it applied only to sales that were not made in the ordinary course of business. By expressly including the extra words in the New Zealand subsec- tion, it must be presumed that Parliament had intended to address every possible existing and future mischief. Prior to 1939, there was no stock sub-code in the Act, and the forerunner to section CD 3 operated to tax proceeds from the sale of trading stock. The case of Commissioner of Taxes v Doughty \[1926\] NZLR 279 dealt with a single sale of stock (soft goods and drapery) when assets were moved from a partner- ship into a company vehicle. The Court of Appeal held that a profit derived from the sale of trading stock was assessable to tax, regardless of whether the stock was sold in the ordinary course of business or in a wind-up of the business, relying for support on Anson v Commis- sioner of Taxes \[1922\] NZLR 330. The Privy Council reversed the decision and said the sale was a result of a “slump market” and this was the sale of the whole business unit, which must be distinguished and certainly was not a sale made in the course of the taxpayer’s business. Accordingly, the increase in the value of stock sold was not subject to tax. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 5 In 1924 (after the Doughty case had been brought to the Commissioner’s attention, but before the Court of Appeal decision had been given), an amendment was made to (then) section 79(1)(a) of the Land and Income Tax Act 1923, which included within assessable income “all profits or gains derived from any business”. The words added to the precursor to the current section CD 3 were “including any increase in the value of stock in hand at the time of transfer or sale of the business...”. The additional sentence remained in place long after the enactment of the precursor to section FB 3 in 1939. It appears that the words “whether or not in the ordinary course of business” included within section FB 3 had been included to prevent the section being circumvented, and to ensure that income from the sale of trading stock was always taxed, regardless of how it was effected. No consideration appears to have been given to the overlap between the application of the two sections. Interpretation of section FB 3 In Hansen and Ors v CIR \[1972\] NZLR 193, it was held by the Court of Appeal that the precursor to section FB 4 (which deals with apportioning the consideration attributable to trading stock where such trading stock is sold together with other assets) could be used to permit the Commissioner to calculate the value of stock sold along with any other assets of the business, whether or not the overall purchase price agreed to by the parties specifically attributed an amount to the stock value. Haslam J discussed the history of the introduction of the “stock sub-code” and also subsequent changes to what are now sections FB 3 and FB 4. At page 205, he stated that: ... the Legislature intended that sections 98 to 102 inclusive should constitute a sub code for dealing with liability for taxation when trading stock (including livestock) is disposed of with other assets. (emphasis added). Whilst the conclusion reached by Haslam J is practically workable, and would clarify the inter-relationship between sections CD 3 and FB 3, it does not necessarily reconcile with a literal interpretation of section FB 3. Even if the words “whether or not in the ordinary course of business” are read down, the section applies even where “...the whole or any part of the assets of the business ... \[that are\] sold or otherwise disposed of consist of or include trading stock”. Therefore, the section will apply where the assets consist solely of trading stock, and there is no requirement that they be sold along with different assets. What is required, however, is that the “whole or any part of the assets of a business” have been sold or disposed of. This appears to require more than merely the sale of individual items of trading stock in the ordinary course of business. It suggests that the section applies to larger transactions involving other assets, and/or multiple items of trading stock where the sale is more akin to the sale or disposal of a group of business assets. Whilst trading stock is technically an asset of the business, ordinary English language usage would not normally see the ordinary sale of an individual item of trading stock described as a disposal of “part of the assets of a busi- ness”. In addition, it is relevant to note that the current structure of the Act clearly indicates that Part F deals with appor- tionment and re-characterisation of transactions. Such heading and structure of the Act imply that the section should not operate for sales of stock made in the ordi- nary course of business, but rather in more involved fact situations or where the Act treats transactions in a special way. Section AA 3(1) states that the meaning of a provision is to be found by reading the words in context and in light of the way that the Act is organised. The better view is that section FB 3 does not apply to normal sales of trading stock made in the ordinary course of business, and applies only where the whole, or part, of the assets of a business are sold (whether the trading stock is sold along with other assets, or a group of trading stock items are the only items sold). It is inherent in such a view that the words “whether or not in the ordinary course of business” are included in the section to effect the intent of Parliament that the section should not be rendered inapplicable by means of a taxpayer seeking to argue that it is in the ordinary course of their business to effect such compound sales. Such a conclusion arguably requires a degree of reading down of those words, but results in a workable operation of the Act, and seems to reflect the Parliament’s intention. The result is that section CD 3 should apply to include within gross income all amounts derived from the sale of trading stock in the ordinary course of business, unless the trading stock is sold together with other items of trading stock, or assets of the business itself, in a way that suggests that (the whole or) a part of the business is being disposed of. Section FB 3 will apply to include within gross income the value of trading stock sold or disposed of outside of the ordinary course of the business operations, or along with other assets of the business in such a way. Specific instances when section FB 3 will operate will include instances where large blocks of different types of stock are sold to a purchaser, a part of the business is sold, or the entire business is sold by the owner. When determining the timing of gross income from stock sales, it will be important to ascertain which section applies. Section CD 3 includes proceeds from the sale of trading stock at the point in time they are “de- rived”. Section FB 3 includes such proceeds at the point in time the trading stock is “sold or otherwise disposed of”. This distinction can arguably be explained by the fact that ordinary derivation rules are to apply if usual trading stock sales occur in the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business. If the circumstances are otherwise, however, the Act may be seen to be “tightening” the test of the time of assessability. continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 6 The real question in this case is when trading profits are derived. Where a sale is made in the course of trade during the year any profit on sale must be recognised. That involves having regard to the debt arising in favour of the vendor and bringing it into account if it is practicable to do so. ... On sale of trading stock a debt arises in favour of the vendor. The stock leaves his account and prima facie the debt for which it was exchanged should be brought into account in its place. It is implicit in the legislation that trading debts cannot be ignored in the calculation of business profits and must be brought into account on a proper basis if that is feasible. ... \[T\]here may be no realistic way to reflect the debts in the trader’s account. But in principle debts arising from sale of trading stock during an income year must be recognised in arriving at the profits derived in that year. The Australian case of J Rowe and Son Pty. Ltd v FCT 71 ATC 4157 is consistent with the principles expressed in Farmers Trading. In this case the Full Court of the High Court considered when income was derived from the sale of stock by a retailer of household goods, in circumstances where the goods were purchased by customers but to be paid for by periodic instalments over an agreed term of 12 months or more. The sum to be paid was equal to the cash price plus 11% interest per annum, and the taxpayer included in assessable income returned for each year only the instalments received or receivable in that year. The Court held that for tax purposes a trader’s income is derived when it is earned, even though not received. The “profit emerging” method was considered inappropriate and the full cash price of the stock was considered earned and therefore derived during the year of the sale contract. Gibbs J stated at page 4,160: I agree that for taxation, as well as for business purposes, income of a trading business is derived when it is earned and the receipt of what is earned is not necessary to bring the proceeds of sale into account ... The method adopted should be that which is “calculated to give a substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer’s true income: Carden’s case.” In delivering the majority judgment, Menzies J stated, at pages 4,158 and 4,159: It is implicit in the foregoing provisions that the proceeds of any sale of stock in the ordinary course of business will be brought into account in the year in which it is sold ... In a system of annual accounting, ordinary business considerations would indicate that what becomes owing to a company for trading stock sold during a year should, in some way, be brought into account to balance the reduction of trading stock which the transaction affects. Any other method of accounting would lead to a misrepresentation of the trader’s financial position. ... Acceptance of the taxpayer’s contention \[that income was derived only when instalments were due and receivable\] would, of course, largely destroy the accepted basis for the taxation of most trading and business concerns. When amounts from the sale of trading stock are “derived” Section CD 3 operates to include within gross income amounts from the sale of trading stock sold in the ordinary course of business. It is settled law that the timing of derivation and the method of accounting “should be that which is calculated to give a substan- tially correct reflex of the taxpayer’s true income”. (C of T (SA) v The Executor Trustee and Agency Com- pany of South Australia Limited (Carden’s Case) (1938) 63 CLR 108; CIR v Philips (NV) Gloeilampenfabrieken \[1955\] NZLR 868; CIR v Farmers Trading Company Limited (1982) 5 NZTC 61,200). It is also settled law that the word “derived” means more than merely received. It connotes the source or origin rather than the fund or place from which the income was taken, and means flowing, springing, or emanating from, or accru- ing (Philips). There are also established principles that business taxpayers should use the accrual method of calculating income in order to give a correct reflex of income. This means income could be derived even if payment has not yet been received, or a bill even rendered. The general principle is that income is “derived” when it is earned, and has “come home” to the taxpayer. This will be the point at which a legally enforceable debt arises, or the right to be paid otherwise crystallises. In looking at whether a debt has been created, case law tends to show that this is in effect a two-stage enquiry. The first stage is to ascertain whether the parties have agreed, or a statute has imposed a requirement, as to when a debt is created. When this is clear, for the purposes of income tax, the income in question is considered to have been derived at that time. If there is no such agreement between the parties or statutory imposition, it is necessary to look at the general law to determine when a debt is created and thus when the income is derived. The leading New Zealand case on derivation is CIR v Farmers Trading Company Ltd (1982) 5 NZTC 61,200. This case dealt with the question of when business profits were derived from trading stock sold when the company made “budget” sales (where the customer paid the purchase price over a period of five months by way of monthly instalments). It was held that such sales were fundamentally different to hire purchase sales because the title and the property passed with the possession of the goods, and the vendor could only sue for outstanding instalments. It was held that the business profits were derived when the stock was sold and a debt in favour of the vendor was created. Richardson J (as he then was), cited Carden’s Case with approval and, in particular, he restated that “the founda- tion of the accruals system is the view that the accounts should show at once the liabilities incurred and the revenue earned, independently of the date when payment is made or becomes due.” At page 61,208, his Honour stated: from page 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 7 The general principle that income is derived when it is earned, and that such time will be when there is an entitlement to payment or a legally enforceable debt, was also recently applied in Hawkes Bay Power Distri- bution Ltd v CIR (1998) 18 NZTC 13,685. In that case, Goddard J held that the taxpayer’s income was derived at the contemporaneous point in time the electricity was supplied by the taxpayer and consumed by its customers. This was because (on the facts) her Honour found that the income had been earned, and the taxpayer had a legal entitlement to payment – regardless of the fact that no invoice had been rendered. Sales of land Although land is not trading stock as defined (or subject to the Sale of Goods Act) it is worth noting that the same general principles in relation to derivation apply to the sale of land, or where the contract is otherwise an executory contract. However, although the applicable derivation principles are the same for land as for other property, the exact timing of when income is earned and a legally enforceable debt arises may be different. The difference will arise where the contract has an executory nature, and the vendor is not legally entitled to sue for the purchase price until after settlement. Cases that discuss the date of “sale” indicate that a sale of land occurs when a contract becomes unconditional (assuming there is no express intention of the parties that can be ascertained) – the same as for any other property or goods. However, the case of Gasparin v FCT (1994) 94 ATC 4,280 specifically addressed the question of when income from the sale of the land was “derived”. In delivering the judgment of the Full Federal Court, von Doussa J concluded that ordinary derivation principles applied, but a legally enforceable debt did not arise until the date of settlement and conveyance (when the execu- tory contract was executed). Before this date, the vendor merely had a right to sue for specific performance of the contract, but not for the debt itself. His Honour stated that there was no difference between the sale of land or other executory contracts, and the sale of retail goods, in terms of the principles that apply to the question of derivation for tax purposes. He was satisfied that income is derived when it is earned and a debt is due, according to ordinary principles. The difference in the timing of derivation that occurred for the land in that case, compared to a sale of other goods, was caused by the fact that title did not pass to the purchaser, and there was no legal right for the vendor to sue for a debt prior to the settlement/conveyance. Because that was the only point at which a legal debt arose, derivation did not occur until that time. In delivering the decision of the Court, von Doussa J stated: I am unable to agree that there is no difference in the present case from a department store sale of articles on 30 day terms. In that example there has been a delivery of the articles sold. The contract of sale is no longer executory. A debt has accrued due; the debtor has become subject to an obligation to pay a sum certain in money even though the debt may not be payable forthwith: c.f. Carden. ... In the present case such a matching will occur if it is held that that trading stock is not disposed of for the purposes of the Act until there is under a transaction for the sale of land both a loss of “dispositive power” and the accrual to the trader of debt due by the purchaser. ... The allotments in question remain registered in the name of the vendors until settlement. Until then the vendors have not lost all dispositive power and had not ceased to have any propri- etary interest in the land. ... Prior to settlement, under the contracts of sale the purchasers undoubtedly acquired interests in equity and rights to specific performance but the vendors did not become bare trustees for the purchasers. ... In my opinion it should be held that the joint venturers derived income from the sale of the allotments of land which com- prised the trading stock not when the contracts became unconditional but at settlement when a debt accrued due from each purchaser to the joint venturers. The critical consideration is for the time when the debt arose. It should also be held that each allotment remained trading stock on hand until settlement, that being the point in time in a transaction for the sale of land under a contract of sale in the terms of those before the court when the vendor finally uses all dispositive power, and the contingency that the sale will not proceed to completion disappears. Von Doussa J also pointed out that his conclusions were consistent with judicial “sign posts” on derivation principles, such as Barratt v FCT (1992) 92 ATC 4,275, Farnsworth v FCT (1949) 78 CLR 504, Henderson v FCT (1970) 70 ATC 4,016 and FCT v Australian Gas Light Co (1983) 83 ATC 4,800. It must be remembered however, that the facts of each case need to be examined, rather than assuming all executory contracts will automatically result in deriva- tion occurring on settlement. This is because the key differences identified by von Doussa J between ordinary goods and land sales, were the facts that property/title did not pass until settlement, and a legally enforceable debt did not occur until settlement. If the facts of a case clearly show an earlier debt (rather than being able to sue for specific performance) and/or passing of property, the time of derivation will be earlier. This possible distinction is well expressed by Salmon J in Ruddenklau v Charlesworth (1925) NZLR 161 where he stated: The general rule, however, that in an executory contract for the sale of land the vendor cannot sue for the price is excluded whenever a contrary intention is shown by the express terms of the contract. And it seems established by authority that a contrary intention is sufficiently shown in all cases in which by the express terms of the contract the purchase money or any part thereof is made payable on a fixed day, not being the day for completion of the contract by conveyance. In all such cases the purchase money or any part thereof becomes, on the day so fixed for its payment, a debt immediately recoverable by the vendor irrespective of the question whether a conveyance has been executed and notwithstanding the fact that the purchaser continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 8 the contract, the conduct of the parties, and the circum- stances of the case. Accordingly, any explicit intention of the parties as to when property in the goods passes will be recognised as the date the sale occurs. (b) The timing when the parties’ agreement is not evident However, in situations where the parties have either not formed an intention as to when property shall pass, or have not clearly expressed their intention, section 20 of the SGA sets out five rules for determining the moment when the property in the goods will be deemed to have passed from a seller to the buyer. Which rule applies depends upon such factors as whether the contract is for the sale of specific or unascertained goods, or the seller is bound to do something to the goods. For the purposes of this discussion, rule 1 in section 20 is considered the most relevant (and common). Section 20 states: Unless a different intention appears, the following are rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties as to the time at which the property in the goods is to pass to the buyer: Rule 1. Where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods, in a deliverable state, the property in the goods passes to the buyer when the contract is made, and it is immaterial whether the time of payment or the time of delivery, or both, is postponed. Rule 2. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods, and the seller is bound to do something to the goods for the purpose of putting them into a deliverable state, the property does not pass until such thing is done, and the buyer has notice thereof. Rule 3. Where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state, but the seller is bound to weigh, measure, test, or do some other act or thing with reference to the goods for the purpose of ascertaining the price, the property does not pass until such act or thing is done, and the buyer has notice thereof. Rule 4. Where goods are delivered to the buyer on approval, or “on sale or return” or other similar terms, the property therein passes to the buyer – (a)When he signifies his approval or acceptance to the seller, or does any other act adopting the transaction: (b)If he does not signify his approval or acceptance to the seller, but retains the goods without giving notice of rejection then, if a time has been fixed for the return of the goods, on the expiration of such time, and if no time has been fixed, on the expiration of a reasonable time. What is a reasonable time is a question of fact. Rule 5. (1) Where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description, and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract, either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller, the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer. Such assent may be expressed or implied, and may be given either before or after the appropriation is made. (2) Where, in pursuance of the contract, the seller delivers the goods to the buyer, or to a carrier or other bailee (whether named by the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to the buyer, and does not reserve the right of disposal, he is deemed to have unconditionally appropriated the goods to the contract. may have repudiated his contract. Notwithstanding such repudiation the vendor is not bound to sue for damages or specific performance, but may recover the agreed purchase money. When stock is “sold or otherwise disposed of” The question of when stock is “sold or otherwise disposed of” becomes important when considering section FB 3, where stock is sold along with other assets of the business. This is a different question to when income is “derived”. Sale of Goods Act 1908 The phrase “sold or otherwise disposed of”, as used in section FB 3, is not specifically defined for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994, but some guidance is provided by case law and the Sale of Goods Act 1908 (“SGA”), which indicate that a sale of goods occurs when property in those goods passes to the purchaser. Although section 2 of the SGA states that “‘contract of sale’ includes an agreement to sell as well as a sale”, section 3 of that Act recognises a distinction between a “contract of sale of goods” and an “agreement to sell”. There is a “contract of sale of goods” when a seller agrees to transfer property in the goods for a considera- tion called the “price”. A sale is effected once the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer. In contrast, there is an “agreement to sell” when the transfer of property in the goods is to take place either at some future time or is subject to the fulfilment of some condition. A sale is effected either when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled. When property passes depends on whether the goods are specific or unascertained. The term “unascertained goods” is not defined in the SGA, but Butterworths Commercial Law in New Zealand (Borrowdale 3 ed, Butterworths) states at Chapter 12.3: ...it is clear that unascertained goods are goods which are not identified and agreed on at all. Unascertained goods become ascertained goods once they are identified and agreed on in accordance with the contract. Under section 18 of the SGA, no property is transferred in unascertained goods unless and until the goods are ascertained. Goods may be unascertained because they are generic goods sold by description (Re Gold Corp Exchange Ltd \[1994\] 3 NZLR 385) or because they are not yet severed from part of a larger bulk (Re Wait \[1927\] 1 Ch 606). Specific goods are defined in section 2(1) of the SGA as “goods identified and agreed on at the time a contract of sale is made”. (a) The timing when the parties agree Section 19(1) and (2) of the SGA provide that property in specific goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer at such time as the parties to the contract intended to be transferred, and that when ascertaining the inten- tion of the parties regard should be had to the terms of from page 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 9 Date of sale for section FB 3 The general principle is therefore that the date of sale occurs when property in the goods passes. When an express intention of the parties can be ascertained as to when property passes, that will be the date of sale. If no intention is expressed or can be ascertained, the date of sale will be ascertained according to the statutory rules/presumptions contained in section 20 of the SGA, (commonly the date an unconditional contract exists). This general approach has also been upheld in tax cases. Case law While there is no New Zealand case law on the effect of the SGA on section FB 3, the Australian Commonwealth Taxation Board of Review referred to the Australian Sale of Goods Act when deciding in Case 18 (1946) 12 CTBR 120 that property had been disposed of by way of sale when the contract became unconditional. The issue in Case 18 was whether the taxpayer’s property had for the purposes of section 36(1) of the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 been “disposed of by sale or otherwise howsoever...”. The Chairman of the Board of Review noted in relation to the sale of goods at page 125: The ownership of the goods will be transferred by the contract itself (in which case, the contract is the sale) if the parties express that intention but where the parties form no intention as to the time when the property is to pass, or fail to express their intention, the time when the property passes is determined by certain statutory presumptions. Of these presumptions the only one which deems the property in the goods to pass when the contract is made arises where there is an unconditional contract for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable state. In view of these principles (...and most which are embodied in the Sale of Goods Act) it appears to me to be quite clear that the property in the goods which were included in the assets which where the subject of the contract under consideration did not pass from the taxpayer to the purchasers until 25 August 1943, when the last of the three necessary consents was given. The similarity of the SGA legislation in Australia and New Zealand (reflecting their common UK origins), coupled with the fact that the trading stock provisions in the Australian Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 are very similar both in their treatment of trading stock and the wording in section 36(1), are factors which make Case 18 strong authority in New Zealand on this particu- lar issue. A similar result was arrived at in the context of when a sale of land had taken place, in Mills v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,025 when the High Court held that for a sale of land to take place there must be an unconditional agreement for the sale of the land. This principle was also upheld in Case K60 (1988) 10 NZTC 487. In Hansen v CIR \[1972\] NZLR 193, the Court consid- ered the precursor to section FB 4 and whether the Commissioner could calculate the value of stock sold along with the other assets of the business, regardless of an overall price having been agreed to by the parties in relation to the stock value. Of interest to this discussion, the Court gave effect to the intentions of the parties in relation to when property in the livestock passed. In that case, prior to settlement the purchaser was not permitted to shear the sheep which were the stock of the business, and as such there was an implied lack of property in the sheep until that date. The Court concluded that settle- ment date was the appropriate date to value the sheep for the purposes of calculating their sale price, as that was clearly the date the parties intended property in the sheep to pass to the purchaser, and so that was the date on which they were sold. Whilst the SGA determines when there is a sale of personal property in New Zealand, the same principles have been applied to real property in the above cases. Accordingly, for the purposes of section FB 3 trading stock is “sold or otherwise disposed of” when property in the goods passes. This will occur when the parties intend property to pass, where an express intention can be ascertained. If no intention can be ascertained, the statutory presumptions contained in Rules 1 to 5 of section 20 of the Sale of Goods Act will determine when property passes, and therefore when a sale or other disposition occurs. When a contract is unconditional As Rule 1 will often be relevant, it is important to understand when a contract becomes unconditional. An unconditional contract is a contract that is not subject to a condition precedent. The contract may still be subject to a condition subsequent, but this will not prevent the contract from being unconditional. “Condi- tion precedent” is a legal term for those conditions in a contract which suspend a contract until a specified event has occurred. A common example of a condition precedent is a contract that is subject to finance. In other words, the contract will be suspended until the buyer has advised the seller that he or she has obtained the neces- sary finance. A “condition precedent” is to be contrasted with a “condition subsequent”, which is a condition which can either bring a binding contract to an end (either totally or only partially) or entitle a party to damages. A common example of a condition subsequent is a contract that entitles a buyer to return dairy cattle if they prove not to be eczema free or sound on delivery. An unconditional contract can still be subject to conditions subsequent. Qualified accruals rules The ruling does not consider any potential operation of the qualified accruals rules where the arrangement attracts the operation of those provisions. This may occur when settlement is scheduled to take place more than 63 days from the date an agreement for sale and purchase is entered into, or if there is a trade credit debt permitting payment more than 63 days after the supply of the trading stock or date of a periodic invoice. In either case the arrangement will not be a “excepted financial arrangement”. continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 10 Section CD 3 applies, as the sale is made in the ordinary course of business, and for the purposes of section CD 3 the income is derived on 20 June. That is when the income is earned, the contract is no longer executory, and a legally enforceable debt first arises. This example illustrates the difference that is possible between the date of “derivation” and the date of “sale”. If this had not been a sale made in the ordinary course of business, the fact that the agreement explicitly stated that property in the goods passes on settlement would have resulted in the same date of 20 June being the date of sale. However, if there had been no express intention of the parties evident as to when property in the cattle passed (either by virtue of the agreement itself or the circumstances of the case/conduct of the parties), the date of sale for the purposes of section FB 3 would have been 3 June, when the contract became unconditional. (Unless Rule 4 or 5 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 applied, due to a delivery on an approval basis, or the goods being unascertained and sold by description.) Example 4 Vendor and Purchaser enter into an agreement for the sale and purchase of a plot of land and a herd of cattle on 15 April. The sale is subject to the buyer confirming finance on or before 20 May, with payment of the balance and possession being given on 19 June. Finance is confirmed on 20 May. The contract became uncondi- tional on 20 May and payment is made and possession given and taken on 19 June. Both parties have a 31 May balance date. There is no clear indication in the contract as to when property in the goods passes. For the purposes of section FB 3, the cattle were sold on 20 May, when the contract became unconditional, as there is no express intention of the parties as to when property in the goods is to pass, and Rule 1 of the Sale of Goods Act applies. If the contract also stated that the cattle could be re- turned within 7 days if they were not eczema-free on delivery, and the purchaser signified later that same day that the cattle were pronounced eczema-free and would not be returned, the date of sale will differ. The existence of such a condition in the contract is a condition subse- quent (rather than a condition precedent), and accord- ingly the contract is not conditional upon the cattle being eczema-free, and there is no alteration of the date the contract became unconditional. However, it does mean that the cattle are delivered on “sale or return” (or similar) terms, as envisaged by Rule 4 of the Sale of Goods Act. This means the date of sale will be 19 June, when the purchaser signifies his approval and retention of the cattle. If the parties had included an explicit clause in the original contract described above (without the “sale or return” terms) that delivery did not occur and property did not pass until payment was made in full, this intent would be recognised, and the sale would be considered to have been made, for the purposes of section FB 3, on 19 June. If the qualified accruals rules do apply, the approach in the ruling will apply in relation to the consideration that is effectively attributed by the Act to the property sold (as distinct from any deemed financial arrangement income or expenditure that arises by virtue of section EH 1). Examples Example 1 A customer enters a sporting goods store and purchases a tennis racquet, which comes with a 30 day money- back guarantee if not completely satisfied. The customer pays by cheque. The income from the sale is derived by the store in terms of section CD 3 on the day the customer enters the store and purchases the tennis racquet. The tennis racquet is sold in the ordinary course of business, and at that point the income has been earned (and therefore derived), regardless of whether the cheque is subsequently dishonoured or the customer returns at a later date seeking a refund under the guarantee. Example 2 A motor vehicle dealer and purchaser sign a sale and purchase agreement for the sale of a motor vehicle on 12 March, which permits the customer to take delivery of the car that day, on payment of a 25% deposit. The contract provides that risk passes to the purchaser on delivery of the car, but property does not pass until payment of the balance of the purchase price, which occurs one month later. The income from the sale is derived in terms of section CD 3 on 12 March, as it is a sale of trading stock in the ordinary course of business, and on that day the income has been earned and a legally enforceable debt has arisen when the purchaser took delivery of the car. Example 3 On 20 May, Vendor and Purchaser enter into an agree- ment for the sale and purchase of a herd of dairy cattle, and a deposit is paid. The agreement states that the balance of the purchase price shall be paid on the day of delivery/settlement, and that property in the cattle passes on that day. The agreement is subject to the buyer confirming finance on or before 15 June. The vendor is entitled to continue milking the herd (and retain any proceeds) until the stock is delivered. Both parties have a 31 May balance date. The vendor culls 20% of her herd each year, so it is the within the vendor’s usual business to sell individual herds of cattle, and she is left with other herds to con- tinue her business operations. The purchaser confirms on 3 June that finance has been arranged. The contract becomes unconditional on 3 June. Payment is made and possession given and taken on 20 June. from page 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 11 Example 5 A customer orders a photocopier from his regular office equipment supplier, by way of mail order from a cata- logue description. The order is posted on 12 September, and received by the vendor on 15 September. A photo- copier is taken from the stock warehouse and shipped on 20 September, with delivery to the customer taking place the next day. The standard terms of sale are that goods are sent FOB (which, for the purposes of this example, are taken to mean that risk, title, and property in the goods pass when the goods are put onto the delivery truck), and the photocopier is delivered with an invoice indicating the terms of payment. As this sale is made in the ordinary course of operating an office equipment business, the gross income from the sale is subject to tax under section CD 3. The income is “derived” on 20 September, when the stock is shipped, and it can be said that the income has been earned and a debt become due and enforceable under the terms of the sale. If the sale contract conditions were that the goods are delivered COD (and clearly indicated that risk, title, and property in the goods did not pass until delivery), the income would be “derived” on 21 September. In such a situation, no debt is enforceable until delivery occurs. If the order was for a bulk supply of photocopiers and facsimile machines sold by a vendor who was ceasing trade in electrical office appliances, section FB 3 would apply and the time of “sale” is what is relevant. Such an order is for generic items which are unascertained goods at the time the order is made. The goods do not become specific goods until such time as the particular photo- copiers are identified, and it is possible to say that such items are the customer’s. In the absence of any differing clear contractual intention, this would occur on 20 Sep- tember, which is when the items are appropriated to the contract, property passes and the sale occurs. Tertiary student association fees Public ruling BR Pub 99/1 Note (not part of ruling): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 95/8 which was published in TIB Volume Seven, No.6, December 1995, but its period of application is from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2002 and some formatting changes have been made. BR Pub 95/8 applies up until 31 March 1999. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section KC 5 of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the payment by a student at a tertiary institution, of a single tertiary student association fee as a membership fee to that tertiary student associa- tion. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: •The payment of a single fee to the tertiary student association to become a member of the student association is not a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4). The student is not entitled to a rebate under section KC 5. The period for which this ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 11th day of January 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Commentary on public ruling BR Pub 99/1 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 99/1 (“the Ruling”). Background If the recipient has charitable status, section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (“the Act”) provides a rebate for the donor of a gift of money in certain circumstances. If a student pays a single fee to a student association to become a member of that association, the association has charitable status, and the fee as a whole confers some rights on members, the issue is whether the fee is a “gift”. The subject matter was previously dealt with in public ruling BR Pub 95/8 that expires on 31 March 1999. This public ruling replaces BR Pub 95/8 on 1 April 1999. The previous ruling concluded that if a student pays a single continued on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 12 fee to the student association to become a member of the student association, and the fee as a whole confers some rights on members, the payment is not a gift for the purposes of section KC 5(4). As the payment of the fee is not a gift, the student is not entitled to a rebate under section KC 5. Legislation Section KC 5 states: (1)In the assessment of every taxpayer, other than an absentee or a company or a public authority or a Maori authority or an unincorporated body, or a trustee assessable and liable for income tax under sections HH 3 to HH 6, HK 14, and HZ 2, there shall be allowed as a rebate of income tax the amount of any gift (not being a testamentary gift) of money of $5 or more made by the taxpayer in the income year to any of the following societies, institutions, associations, organisations, trusts, or funds (being in each case a society, an institution, an association, an organisation, a trust, or a fund in New Zealand), namely: (aa)A society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual and the funds of which are, in the opinion of the Commissioner, applied wholly or principally to any charitable, benevolent, philan- thropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand: (ab)A public institution maintained exclusively for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ac)A fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa), by a society, institution, association, organisation, or trust which is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any individual: (ad)A public fund established and maintained exclusively for the purpose of providing money for any one or more of the purposes within New Zealand specified in paragraph (aa): (ae) - (bt) \[A list of organisations\] (2)The rebates provided for in this section shall not, in the case of any taxpayer, in any income year exceed in the aggregate the smaller of - (a)33 1/3% of the aggregate of all gifts described in subsection (1): (b)$500. (3)No rebate shall be allowed under this section in respect of any gift unless the taxpayer furnishes to the Commissioner in support of the taxpayer’s claim for the rebate a receipt evidencing to the satisfaction of the Commissioner the making of the gift by the taxpayer. (4)In this section, “gift” includes a subscription paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund, only if the Commissioner is satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund. Application of legislation Under section KC 5, a taxpayer other than an absentee, company, public authority, Maori authority, unincorporated body, or trustee liable for income tax (sections HH 3 to HH 6, HK 14, HZ 2), can claim a rebate if that person: •makes a gift (not being a testamentary gift) of money of $5 or more; •to any of the organisations listed in s KC 5(1) or any special appeal fund allowed by the Commissioner; and •the recipient in the opinion of the Commissioner applies the funds for a charitable purpose; and •the taxpayer furnishes to the Commissioner a receipt evidencing the making of the gift by the taxpayer to the recipient. Furthermore, if a subscription is paid by the taxpayer to any organisation listed in section KC 5(4), the Commis- sioner must be satisfied that the subscription does not confer any rights arising from membership in that or any other society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund. The payment of a single fee to a student association to become a member of the student association is not a “gift” under section KC 5, as the fee as a whole confers some rights on members. As the payment of the fee is not a gift, the student is not entitled to a rebate under section KC 5. There are two reasons for this view: 1.Payments of student association fees are not “gifts” in the ordinary meaning of that word, as payment is not voluntary, and benefits may arise from the payment. 2.Section KC 5(4) expands the meaning of “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5. A subscription will only qualify as a “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5 if the payer receives no rights to do anything, receive anything, or to have access to anything in return for the payment of the subscription. If any rights are conferred by any part of the subscription, section KC 5 does not apply, and no rebate is available. The meaning of the term “gift” In Mills v Dowdall \[1983\] NZLR 154, (in the Court of Appeal) the nature of a gift was referred to by Cooke J who said: in general a gift is something truly gratuitous, although it is possible that nominal or very small considerations may not prevent transactions from being classed as gifts for some purposes: see 20 Halsbury’s Laws of England. In the same case, Richardson J said that at common law, the term “gift” refers to: a transaction where the owner of property conveys the ownership of that property to another without consideration. from page 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 13 Similar views were expressed in Federal Commissioner of Taxation v McPhail \[1966\] 117 CLR 111, (known as “the McPhail rule”) where the Court held that a “gift” has the following attributes: •The property transferred was transferred voluntarily and not as the result of a contractual obligation to transfer it; and •The transferor by way of return received no advantage of a material nature. A similar view was taken by the Federal Court of Australia in Klopper & Anor v FC of T \[1997\] ATC 4186, which applied Cyprus Mines Corporation v FC of T 78 ATC 4468, and made reference to the McPhail rule. In Klopper & Anor v FC of T the taxpay- ers made donations to the Australian Sports Aid Founda- tion (ASAF). The Oceanic Racing Club of Australia received funds from ASAF that it credited to an account belonging to the taxpayers. The Court held that the donations made by the taxpayers were not gifts. It could not be said that the payments were free from contractual obligation and voluntary. It could not be said that the taxpayers received no advantage of a material character as a result of making the donations. The Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal also referred to the McPhail rule in Hodges v FC of T \[1997\] ATC 2158 and Australian Dairy Corporation v FC of T \[1998\] ATC 2059. In both cases, as there was an element of benefaction, it could not be said that a “gift” was made. Payments of student association fees are not “gifts” in the ordinary meaning of that word, as payment is not voluntary and benefits may arise from the payment. The definition of gift in section KC 5(4) Section KC 5(4) expands the meaning of “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5, to include subscriptions paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust, or fund, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the sub- scription does not confer any rights arising from mem- bership in that or any other society, institution, associa- tion, organisation, trust, or fund. It is arguable whether student association fees are subscriptions. There are many definitions of “subscrip- tion”, some of which are wide enough to include student association fees. In Case M128 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,825 payments to a school for camp fees, a school trip, stationery, and a manual were not gifts. They conferred rights on the pupil. The Taxation Review Authority (“Authority”) noted that the Commissioner had allowed school activity fees as a deduction because they came within the expanded definition of “gift”. Other fees that conferred a right were not allowed as a deduction. The Authority did not comment on what the definition of a subscription was. However, assuming that the fees paid are a subscription, the fees will only be a “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5(4), and will only qualify for a rebate, if the Commissioner is satisfied that the payment does not confer any rights on the payer. A subscription will only qualify as a “gift” for the purposes of section KC 5 if the payer receives no rights to do anything, receive any- thing, or to have access to anything in return for the payment of the subscription. Thus, the payment of a subscription is in the nature of a donation because the payer does not get any direct rights in return for the payment. The requirement that the subscription confers no rights does not contain any words of apportionment (such as “to the extent to which”). It is absolute in its terms. Accordingly, if any rights are conferred by any part of the subscription, section KC 5 does not apply and no rebate is available. The provision refers only to rights being conferred: the rights do not have to be exercised or enjoyed by the taxpayer. In Case J76 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,451, a taxpayer paid the fees of a number of disadvantaged children at a school which qualified as a charitable institution. The Authority held that the payments were not gifts, as the payment of the fees meant that the school had a contractual duty to educate the children. The Authority quoted the expanded definition of gift, but did not discuss either the definition of “subscription”, or whether the payments were a subscription (and thus covered by the extended defini- tion of gift). The case was decided in terms of whether the fees paid were a “gift” in the ordinary meaning of the word. Students attending tertiary institutions pay a sum for membership of a student association or union. Being a member commonly gives rights to benefits from the student association and other organisations, such as: •Access to advice, welfare, and counselling services. •Liaison services between students and teaching staff. •Access to newsletters and other information. •Facilities on campus, such as the library, health facilities, sports and recreation facilities. •Student discounts on various goods and services. In addition, it could also be argued that the payment of the student association fee is one of a number of pay- ments a student must make, and things a student must do, in order to qualify for enrolment at a tertiary institu- tion. If the student association fee (or a substitute payment to a charity of the student’s choice) is not paid, the student does not qualify for enrolment. The payment of the student association fee, therefore, confers a further right on students – the right to enrolment if the other conditions of enrolment are met. Similarly, payments to the student association (together with payment of other fees and meeting terms) give students the right to attend university and sit examinations. continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 14 The student makes his or her payment to the student association, not to any other body which may later be allotted funds by the student association (for example, trust funds, hardship funds). The payment to the student association is a payment that confers rights on the student. Compulsory student membership is incorporated into statute in section 229 of the Education Act 1989. Under this section a University Council has the power to impose and collect student association membership fees from its students. This section remains unchanged at present. However, section 3 of the Voluntary Student Membership Bill 1997 intends to repeal section 229 and introduce voluntary student association membership. If the Bill is enacted it will not change the tax treatment of student association membership fees under section KC 5. A voluntary payment of student membership fees to a student association would fail to meet the require- ments of section KC 5(4). That is, the payment would give rise to rights that the student could claim. At a minimum this would include the right to vote at an AGM and receive an annual newsletter. If the student receives any rights from the payment of that fee, section KC 5 does not apply, and no rebate is available. Any legisla- tive change that makes tertiary student membership voluntary would therefore not alter the tax treatment of student association fees under section KC 5. For the reasons outlined above, section KC 5 does not apply if the payment of a student association fee confers any rights. In these circumstances, no rebate is available. Example A student enrols at a Polytech. He pays the student association fees, and is able to use the gym facilities, counselling services, and the subsidised health care programme. The student association has charitable status. As the payment of the student association fees confers certain rights on the student, the payment does not qualify for a rebate as a donation to the student associa- tion. However, if a person who is not a student makes a donation to the student association at the Polytech and no rights are conferred because of the payment, a gift is made and a rebate is allowed.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 15 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Accident Insurance Act 1998 – tax implications Features of new accident insurance cover The Accident Insurance Act 1998, which opens the accident compensation scheme to competition, became law on 19 December 1998. Accident insurance cover remains compulsory, comprehensive, 24 hour and no fault, but employers, self-employed people and private domestic workers are now able to choose their insurance provider. Minimum compensation entitlements are set in law and are similar to those available now. By 1 July 1999, all employers must have purchased a single accident insurance contract from a private insur- ance provider to cover their employees’ work accidents. Self-employed people can purchase work and non-work accident cover privately, or choose to remain with the ACC. Private domestic workers can purchase work accident cover privately or choose to remain with the ACC; their non-work accidents continue to be covered by the ACC. Employees’ non-work accidents continue to be covered by the ACC, and they will continue to pay earner premium to Inland Revenue. The ACC will continue to manage the non-competitive accounts. These include the earners’, non-earners’, motor vehicle and medical misadventure accounts. A state owned enterprise is being established to compete with private insurers on a commercial basis. It will be subject to the same entry requirements and regulations as other competing insurers, and will be subject to income tax. A Regulator will be established within the Department of Labour to ensure that employers purchase insurance. The Regulator will have access to information from insurers and Inland Revenue. To fund the “tail” of outstanding claims, a residual claims levy will be paid annually by employers, private domestic workers and those self-employed people with liable earnings. Self-employed people will also pay an earners’ account levy. Inland Revenue will collect these levies on behalf of the ACC, beginning in the 1999 tax returns. The levies will use the same administrative procedure and due dates as currently apply to the collection of the ACC premiums. The legislation provides that the ACC is responsible for collecting any ACC premiums owed by employers, self- employed people and private domestic workers for the period 1 April 1998 to 30 June 1999. Consequential tax legislation changes A number of changes to tax legislation result from changes enacted in the Accident Insurance Act 1998. They are contained in Schedule 6A of the Accident Insurance Act 1998, and explained in this article. The major changes relate to: •the tax treatment of insurers who provide cover for work-related accidents •the tax treatment of these insurers’ reserves •the fringe benefit tax consequences of premiums paid by employers •the taxation of compensation payments. The amendments to tax legislation apply from 19 De- cember 1998. People can currently purchase insurance cover in excess of that provided under the ACC scheme. If this cover provided compensation for loss of earnings and was not calculated by reference to those earnings, the proceeds were exempt from tax and the premium was not deduct- ible for tax purposes. Compensation for loss of earnings as a result of acci- dents that occur after 1 July 1999 which are covered by the Accident Insurance Act 1998 will be subject to tax. Premiums for this cover will be deductible. Premiums and levies imposed under the Act Levies to fund the “tail” Until recently, the ACC was funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, meaning only enough premium was collected each year to pay the costs of claims in that particular year. As a result, there is a “tail” of past claims, amounting to $3.9 billion in the employers’ account. Employers, private domestic workers and the self-employed will remain responsible for this cost. Starting with the 1999 returns, Inland Revenue will collect two new levies to fund the tail: (a) Residual claims levy With effect from the 1998-99 income year, all employ- ers, private domestic workers and those self-employed with liable earnings will pay a “residual claims levy”. This will fund the ongoing cost of work injury claims made before 1 July 1999 and non-work claims made before 1 July 1992. continued on page 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 16 Employers will calculate their levy annually in their IR 68A return and pay it by 31 May. Self-employed people will calculate the levy in their IR 3 return and pay it by their terminal tax date (either 7 February or 7 April). For companies with shareholder employees who receive non-deducted salaries, the levy will be calculated on the company’s IR 4 return and payable by the company’s terminal tax date. The levy: •will be risk-rated using the same industry classifica- tions as at present •will not be experience-rated •will be liable for GST (Employers or self-employed people who are registered for GST will be able to claim the GST as an input tax credit on their GST return.) •will be tax deductible for income tax purposes •will be subject to the generic income tax compliance and penalties legislation •will be payable annually for up to 15 years, although the legislation does allow for the levies to be collected over a shorter time frame •will be payable by new employers, new private domestic workers and newly self-employed people. (b) Earners’ Account Levy Self-employed people and employees will also pay an earners’ account levy from the 1998-99 income year. This funds the ongoing cost of non-work accidents that occurred between 1 July 1992 and 1 July 1999. Self-employed people will calculate the levy in their IR 3 tax return and pay it on their terminal tax date (either 7 February or 7 April). For self-employed people, the levy: •will not be risk-rated or experience-rated •will be liable for GST (Self-employed people who are registered for GST will be able to claim the GST as an input tax credit on their GST return.) •will be tax deductible for income tax purposes •will be subject to the generic income tax compliance and penalties legislation •will be payable annually for up to 15 years, although the legislation does allow for the levies to be collected over a shorter time frame •will be payable by newly self-employed people. For employees, the levy is included in the earner pre- mium which is deducted from their salary or wages at the same time as tax is deducted. Inland Revenue will continue to collect earner premium from employees and IR 56 taxpayers as part of PAYE deductions, from overseas income earners in the IR 3 return, and from shareholder employees via PAYE deductions or in the IR 4 return. Employees will pay the levy for up to 15 years, although legislation does allow for the levy to be collected over a shorter timeframe. ACC premiums owed for period 1 April 1998 to 30 June 1999 The legislation provides that the ACC is responsible for collecting: •employer premium from employers, self-employed taxpayers and private domestic workers for the 1998-99 income year and the period 1 April 1999 to 30 June 1999; and/or •earner premium for self-employed people for the 1998-99 income year and the period 1 April 1999 to 30 June 1999.

At present, the income derived by a friendly society (except so far as it is derived from business carried on beyond the circle of its membership) or a trustee in trust for a sick, accident, or death benefit fund has been exempt income for income tax purposes. To provide consistency of tax treatment for all entities competing in the accident insurance business, income derived by a friendly society or a trustee from a company which is registered under the Accident Insurance Act 1998 to provide insurance cover is not considered exempt income under the Income Tax Act. To provide for this outcome, section CB 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act (non-profit bodies and charities exempt income) has been amended to exclude the income of a company registered under the Accident Insurance Act 1998 from being exempt income of a friendly society. Section CB 5(1)(i) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (certain pensions, benefits and other compensation exempt) has been amended to ensure that amounts derived by a trustee in trust for any sick, accident, or death benefit fund from any company registered under section 166 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 and under the control of that trustee is not exempt income. The exemption for dividends in section CB 10(2) has also been amended to provide that dividends derived by a friendly society or a sick, accident, or death benefit fund are not exempt income if they are derived from a company registered under section 201 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 which is under the control of the society or trustee of the from page 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 17 fund. Whether a friendly society or sick, accident, or death benefit fund is under the control of the society or trustee is determined in accordance with section OD 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The ACC is required to set up a wholly owned subsidi- ary company to provide claims management and net- work services to the ACC and possibly to other insurers. To ensure that the subsidiary competes on the same footing as other claims management companies, it will be subject to the same tax rules that apply to other companies. However, an amendment has been made to section ME 1(2) of the Income Tax Act 1994 to ensure that it does not establish an imputation credit account. Taxation of compensation payments Currently, income-related compensation for loss of earnings or loss of potential earnings capacity paid to an injured person or their spouse or dependants is subject to income tax. Other forms of compensation that are a reimbursement of costs or compensation not related to earnings are not subject to income tax. The Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended to extend this treatment to compensation paid under the Accident Insurance Act 1998. Compensation paid under the new Accident Insurance Act A new paragraph (ba) has been inserted into section CC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. It provides that the following forms of compensation, provided under the Accident Insurance Act 1998, are included in gross income: •weekly compensation paid to earners, self-employed people, shareholder employees and employees who have ceased employment but have continued their cover under the Accident Insurance Act 1998 •weekly compensation for loss of potential earnings capacity •weekly compensation paid to the surviving spouse •weekly compensation paid to a child or other depend- ants •compensation for loss of earnings under a top-up insurance policy for work-related accidents as pro- vided for in section 188 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998. To ensure these forms of compensation are taxable, amendments have also been made to sections CB 5(1)(g) and (h) of the Income Tax Act. These amendments ensure that any compensation payments for work-related accidents paid under the Accident Insurance Act 1998 are not exempt income if they are paid by a friendly society, sick, accident, or death benefit fund or from a personal sickness or accident policy of insurance. Currently, compensation paid to employees or a self- employed person for loss of earnings owing to an accident is taxable if calculated by reference to those earnings. Compensation that is not calculated by refer- ence to those earnings is exempt from tax. Compensa- tion paid under the Accident Insurance Act 1998 to employees or self-employed people for loss of earnings will be subject to tax regardless of whether the compen- sation is calculated by reference to those earnings. This includes payments made in excess of the statutory minimum set out in that Act. The definition of salary or wages in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 has been amended to include these forms of compensation. They will be subject to PAYE deductions at source. The employer will continue to pay the first week’s compensation when an employee suffers a work-related accident. This payment will be salary or wages for tax purposes and will be subject to PAYE deductions. If the ACC or an insurer recovers any compensation that has been paid in error or has been overpaid, the recov- ered compensation is not included in gross income. Exempt income A number of forms of compensation are provided under the Accident Insurance Act 1998 that are exempt from income tax. Section CB 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (exempt pensions, benefits and other compensa- tion) has been amended to insert a new paragraph (q) that provides the following forms of compensation are exempt income: •funeral grant •survivor’s grant •child care payments •an independence allowance •payments for treatment or rehabilitation. Fringe benefit tax Currently, premiums paid by an employer to the ACC for work-related cover are not subject to fringe benefit tax (FBT). This treatment will continue for premiums paid to purchase insurance under the Accident Insurance Act 1998. To provide for this the meaning of “fringe benefit” in section CI 1 has been amended by inserting a new paragraph (ja). At present, if an employer takes out an insurance policy for work-related accidents to “top up” the compensation provided by the ACC, the premiums are exempt from FBT provided the compensation payable under the policy is monetary remuneration. A new paragraph (ja) has been inserted into section CI 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 to ensure that premiums paid for cover from 1 July 1999 for work-related accidents under contracts to “top up” compensation (in excess of the minimum payable under the Accident Insurance Act 1998) will be exempt from FBT. If an employer purchases insurance cover for employ- ees’ non-work accidents, the insurance premium will continue to be liable for FBT. continued on page 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 18 Goods and services tax Two minor amendments have been made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) to extend the current GST treatment for indemnity payments paid by the ACC to indemnity payments paid under the Accident Insurance Act 1998. Sections 5(13) and 20(3)(d)(v) of the GST Act, which deal with the meaning of the term “supply” in relation to indemnity payments and the deductions from output tax respectively, have been consequentially amended. They now include a reference to the Accident Insurance Act 1998 after the references to the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992. Insurers’ outstanding claims reserves Section DK 5 has been inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994 and applies to the outstanding claims reserve of insurers for insurance business written under the Acci- dent Insurance Act 1998. This section provides for a present value approach to valuing the reserve. If the reserves for financial reporting purposes meet certain requirements, the same basis can be used for tax pur- poses. The net income or loss of the insurer must take into account the value of the outstanding claims reserve at the beginning of the income year as an allowable deduction and the value at the end of the income year as gross income. The value of the opening reserve must also be the same as the prior year’s closing reserve. The value of the reserve at the end of the income year is to be the amount calculated by an actuary and adopted by the insurer for financial reporting purposes. If the reserve has not been determined on this basis, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can seek the advice of the Government Actuary or any other actuary to deter- mine the amount of the reserve. The amount of the reserve must have regard to generally accepted accounting practice, generally accepted actuarial practice and the present value of expected future payments. The result is that in calculating the outstanding claims reserve, future costs of administering and settling claims incurred and other factors, such as prudential margins, can be taken into account, where this is consistent with accounting and actuarial practice. A present-value approach to valuing the reserve is considered to result in a more accurate measure of an insurer’s income in relation to accident insurance. The relevant professional bodies are currently developing accounting and actuarial standards. “Outstanding claims” has been defined for the purpose of this section as the claims made or expected to be made with the insurer in respect of insured events that have occurred on or before the end of that income year and have not yet been settled. It also includes an esti- mate of claims that have been incurred but not reported to the insurer before the end of that income year. Timing of deductions for premiums and levies Section ED 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (year in which ACC levies and premiums are deductible) cur- rently provides that earner premium and employer premium imposed under the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 are deductible when they become due and payable by the taxpayer. The Accident Insurance Act 1998 inserts a new section ED 1A. The new section provides that the levies col- lected by Inland Revenue and premiums collected by the ACC under the Accident Insurance Act are deductible in the year in which they become due and payable by the taxpayer. The levies and premium are: •earners’ account levy •residual claims levy •premium payable to the ACC for the 1998-99 income year and for the three months April to June 1999 •contributions to the insolvent insurers fund •levies to meet the costs of the Regulator •levies or penalties paid to the non-compliers fund. At present, premiums paid by self-employed taxpayers and private domestic workers to the ACC for work- related accident cover are deductible when they became due and payable by the taxpayer. Premiums paid to the ACC for cover for work-related accidents from 1 July 1999 onwards will be “accrual expenditure” and dealt with under section EF 1. Information matching Sections 370 and 371 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 provide for the transfer of information from Inland Revenue to the Regulator to enable the Regulator to: •issue insurance numbers to employers •identify those employers who are not complying with their obligation to purchase insurance cover for their employees’ work-related accidents •calculate the penalty to be imposed on non-complying employers. Inland Revenue will supply the Regulator with a list of all employers, stating each employer’s name, address, Inland Revenue number and the date they started or ceased employing. This transfer will occur on an on- going basis. The Regulator will compare the information with information provided by insurers on who has an accident insurance contract. If satisfied that an employer has not complied with the requirements to insure, the Regulator will request that Inland Revenue supply the non-complying employer’s earnings level and industry classification. The Regulator will use this information to calculate the penalty for failure to insure. These matching provisions comply with the require- ments of Part X of the Privacy Act 1993. from page 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 19 Maintaining secrecy Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been amended to ensure that officers of the Inland Revenue Department maintain secrecy of all matters in relation to the Accident Insurance Act 1998 and disclose informa- tion only for the purpose of implementing the Accident Insurance Act 1998. A new paragraph (fa) has been inserted into sec- tion 81(4) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It enables the Commissioner to disclose to employees or agents of the Regulator any information they are author- ised by the Regulator to receive and which is provided for the purposes of sections 370 and 371 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998. Section 86 (other persons to maintain secrecy) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires employees or agents of the Regulator to maintain secrecy in relation to information received by them from Inland Revenue. Before they gain access to that information they must certify that they have read and understood the secrecy requirements of section 86. The Regulator will retain the certificates that are signed by their employees or other persons appointed by them. Anyone who fails to maintain secrecy commits an offence under the Tax Administration Act 1994, and if convicted could be liable to either a term of imprison- ment of up to six months, a maximum fine of $15,000, or both. Definition of full-time earner The transitional tax allowance provides a rebate for people whose income is under $9,880 and who are in full-time employment. Section KC 3(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 defines “full-time earner” as a person who: •engages in remunerative work for at least 20 hours per week; or •would have been engaged in remunerative work for that number of hours but for being incapacitated owing to sickness or an accident for which earnings related compensation is payable. The definition of “full-time earner” has been amended to provide that it is met if the Commissioner considers that a person would have been in full-time employment but for suffering personal injury within the meaning of section 13 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 for which compensation is payable under that Act. Application of Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 316(4) of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 provides that, if the Commissioner is acting as agent for the ACC for the collection of premiums, the provisions of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will apply to the collection of premiums under the Accident Insurance Act 1998. Section 309 of the Accident Insurance Act 1998 pro- vides that the residual claims levy, earners’ account levy and the motor vehicle account levy are, for the purposes of the Accident Insurance Act 1998, treated as if they were premiums. The combination of sections 316 and 309 ensures that the provisions of the Tax Administra- tion Act 1998 (interest and penalty provisions) apply to the collection of the earners’ account levy and the residual claims levy – but not to the motor vehicle account levy. Other amendments A number of other amendments have been made to sections of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 to include: •after references to the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992, references to the Accident Insurance Act 1998; and •after references to the Corporation, references to the Manager. Transitional process From the 1998-99 income year, Inland Revenue will collect the residual claims levy and the earners’ account levy. It will continue to collect the premium arrears for all years before 1998-99. The legislation provides that the ACC is responsible for collecting any ACC premiums owed by employers, self- employed persons and private domestic workers for the period 1 April 1998 to 30 June 1999. Taxpayers who have a balance date between 1 October and 31 March (inclusive) and file their IR 3 or IR 4 tax return before 1 April 1999 will calculate their ACC liability for the 1998-99 income year based on premi- ums, instead of levies. Inland Revenue will use the liable earnings figure and classification code on the return to calculate the levies payable, and then advise the taxpayer of the reassessment. ACC is responsible for the collec- tion of any premium owed.

Tax policy QWill current tax-exempt entities continue to be exempt under the new regime? AFriendly societies that provide accident compensa- tion under the Accident Insurance Act 1998 will be subject to the same tax treatment on this business as other insurers. QWill accident insurance premiums be deductible for income tax purposes? ACurrent income tax treatment remains. Employers and self-employed people will be able to deduct their insurance premium and levies for income tax purposes. Employers – residual claims levy QWill my residual claims levy be liable for GST? AYes. If you are registered for GST you will be able to claim the GST as an input tax credit on your GST return. QWill my residual claims levy be deductible for income tax purposes? AYes. QHow will I calculate and pay my residual claims levy? AYour levy will be calculated annually on your IR 68A return and payable to Inland Revenue on 31 May.

QWill there be a penalty for late filing or late pay- ment? AYes. The residual claims levy is subject to the same interest and penalties provisions as those that apply to income tax. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 21 QWill the residual claims levy be risk-rated? AYes. It will use the same industry classifications as at present. QHow long will I be paying the residual claims levy for? AThe residual claims levy will be payable annually for up to 15 years. QOn what income will I pay the residual claims levy? AOn your liable earnings, as is currently used to calculate the ACC premiums. QI’m a new employer. Will I have to pay the residual claims levy? AYes. QWill I be paying my insurance premium to Inland Revenue? ANo. You will make this payment directly to the insurer of your choice. Self-employed – residual claims levy and earners’ account levy QHow will I calculate and pay my levies? AYour levies will be calculated annually using the liable earnings on your IR 3 and will be payable to Inland Revenue on your terminal tax date. QWill there be a penalty for late filing or late payment? AYes. You are subject to the same interest and penal- ties provisions as those that apply to income tax. QWill my levies be liable for GST? AYes. If you are registered for GST you will be able to claim the GST as an input tax credit in your GST return. QWill my levies be deductible for income tax purposes? AYes. QWill the residual claims levy be risk-rated? AYes. It will use the same industry classifications as at present. QWill the earners’ account levy be risk-rated? ANo. Non-work accidents are not risk-rated. QHow long will I be paying the levies for? AThe levies will be payable annually for up to 15 years. QOn what income will I calculate the levies? AOn your liable earnings, as is currently used to calculate the ACC premiums. QI’m newly self-employed. Will I have to pay the levies? AYes. QWill I be paying my insurance premium to Inland Revenue? ANo. You will make this payment directly to the insurer of your choice. QIf I choose to stay with the ACC for my accident insurance cover, will I pay my insurance premiums to Inland Revenue? ANo, the ACC will collect premiums for their insur- ance cover. Inland Revenue will collect only the residual claims levy and the earners’ account levy. Employees QI’m an employee. What do I have to pay? AYou won’t need to do anything different. Your non- work accidents will continue to be covered by the ACC, so your earner premium will still be deducted from your salary and wages as part of your PAYE deductions. Your employer will be purchasing cover for your work-related accidents. Shareholder-employees QI’m a shareholder-employee. Do I have to pay a levy or levies? ANo, the company as your employer will pay the residual claims levy on the company’s IR 4 return. You will continue to pay earner premium (including the earners’ account levy) on your shareholder- employee income and be covered by the ACC for non-work accidents, as at present. IR 56 taxpayers (Part-time private domestic worker, embassy staff, Deep Freeze personnel, overseas company representatives) QAs a private domestic worker, what am I liable for under the new regime? AYou will pay a premium to the insurer of your choice (including the ACC) to cover your work accidents and a residual claims levy to Inland Revenue as agent for the ACC. Your non-work accidents will continue to be covered by the ACC, so you will continue to deduct earner premium (including earners’ account levy) from your salary and wages as part of your PAYE deductions. QAs an overseas company representative, embassy staff member or Deep Freeze worker, what am I liable for under the new regime? AYour non-work accidents will continue to be covered by the ACC, so your earner premium will still be deducted with your PAYE tax from your wages. You are not liable for the residual claims levy. Your work accidents will be covered by the ACC.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 22 Student loan scheme – interest rates and repayment threshold for 1999-2000 On 16 December 1998 the Ministers of Education and Revenue announced the interest rates and the repayment threshold for the student loan scheme for the year commencing 1 April 1999. The total interest rate will be 7.0 percent. This is made up of the base interest rate of 5.3 percent and the interest adjustment rate of 1.7 percent. The repayment threshold for the 1999-2000 income year will remain at $14,716. Disputes procedures: TRA regulations and High Court rules New Taxation Review Authorities regulations New Taxation Review Authorities Regulations were notified in the NZ Gazette of 22 December 1998. The new regulations replace the Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1994 (S.R. 1994/41). They introduce procedural and associated measures required to implement in the jurisdiction of Taxation Review Authorities the tax disputes procedures enacted in 1996. The new regulations contain procedural requirements associated with: •the existing objection proceedings •the Authorities’ small claims jurisdiction for chal- lenges involving tax in dispute not exceeding $15,000 •the procedures for commencing and conducting challenges. They also provide for: •Authorities’ holding of directions hearings in chal- lenge proceedings in both the small claims and general jurisdictions •the manner in which objections proceedings and challenges may be set down for hearing •the manner in which reports of proceedings may be published •the non-precedential nature of decisions in the small claims jurisdiction •filing fees of $50 for challenges begun in the small claims jurisdiction and $100 for those in the general jurisdiction. The regulations came into force on 19 January 1999. Challenges to tax assessments and the High Court rules The Government’s 1994 consultative document Resolv- ing tax disputes: proposed procedures invited submis- sions on the most appropriate procedure to be followed in taxpayer-initiated litigation brought to challenge tax assessments. The consultative document indicated that an amendment to the High Court Rules would be sought in order to introduce to those rules a separate part containing all rules associated with the commencement and conduct of taxpayer-initiated challenges to assess- ments. Because the Rules Committee prefers to see the one general procedure used where possible in all proceed- ings, Inland Revenue has decided not to proceed with the proposal at this time. The Committee will review the situation if it appears the existing procedure creates difficulties in the tax context. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 23 Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. How- ever, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. Lease renewals and extensions Section 29, Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Summary This interpretation statement sets out the Commission- er’s view on the application of section 29 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. In particular, it focuses on the application of section 29 to instruments of extension and renewal of lease, as it is in this area that difficulties in interpreting the section have arisen. This interpreta- tion statement replaces the relevant parts of the Commis- sioner’s statement published in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Six, No.2 (August 1994), at pages 2 and 3. Under section 29, if an instrument increases the rental payable under any lease, stamp duty will be computed on that instrument only to the extent of the increase. In order for an instrument to be dutiable under sec- tion 29, a particular lease must already exist at the time an instrument increasing or agreeing to increase the rental is executed, and the instrument must be executed “during the term of the lease”. Therefore, if an instru- ment is executed after the term of a lease has expired, section 29 will not apply and any such instrument will be dutiable under section 26 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. If an instrument is executed to vary the term of a lease so that the lease is extended to cover a further period, effectively a new lease is created and the instrument will be dutiable under section 26. This will be the case whether or not there is a corresponding increase in rental. If the term of a lease is renewed, effectively a new lease is granted following the termination of the earlier lease. This means that when a lease is renewed and the rental payable under the lease is increased, section 29 will not apply and the instrument evidencing the renewal will be dutiable under section 26. If the term of a lease is varied by way of a memorandum of extension in Form L of the Second Schedule to the Land Transfer Act 1952, effectively a new lease is created and consequently the instrument will be dutiable under section 26 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. If an option to extend the term of an unregistered lease is exercised unilaterally and the rental payable under the lease is increased, the instrument will be dutiable under section 29. Where on the other hand an option to extend the term of an unregistered lease is exercised bilaterally and the rental payable under the lease is increased, effectively the parties are varying the term of the lease and accordingly the instrument will be dutiable under section 26. Legislation All legislative references in this item are to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 unless otherwise stated. Section 26 states: (1)Stamp duty payable on a lease shall be a lease duty computed - (a)At the rate of 40c for each $100, and for such amount as may be less than $100, of - (i)The maximum rent that is or may become payable under the lease in any year; or (ii)If the lease is for a term of less than 1 year, the maximum rent that is or may become payable for that term; and (b)At the rate of $1 for each $100 and for such amount as may be less than $100, of any premium, fine, or other consideration whatsoever other than rent, payable under the lease. (2)If any lease is granted without consideration, or for a consideration that in the opinion of the Commissioner is inadequate, lease duty shall be computed on the value of the lessee’s interest under the lease, determined in accord- ance with Part III of this Act, at the rate of $1 for each $100, and for such amount as may be less than $100, of that value, to the extent that the lease is without considera- tion or the consideration for the lease is inadequate. Section 29 states: Notwithstanding anything in section 26 of this Act, lease duty shall be computed on every instrument whereby the rent or other consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest, under any lease is increased or agreed to be increased during the term of the lease as if the instrument were a new lease for a consid- eration equivalent to the increase in rent or other consideration, or the increase in the value of the lessee’s interest. continued on page 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 24 Provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in section 66 hereof, a memorial of a memorandum of extension or memorandum of variation of any lease in respect of which a certificate of title has been issued under that section shall be entered on all relevant instruments and on that certificate of title, which shall have full validity and effect during the extended term. (6)If the land affected by the memorandum of extension or memorandum of variation is at the time of the registration of the memorandum subject to any mortgage, the memo- randum shall not be binding on the mortgagee unless he has consented thereto in writing on the memorandum. Application of the legislation Section 26(1) imposes stamp duty on leases of commer- cial land and buildings. Stamp duty is payable at the rate of 40 cents per $100 (or part thereof) on the maximum rent that is payable or may become payable under the terms of the lease in any year. If the lease is for a term that is less than a year, stamp duty is payable on the maximum rent that is payable or may become payable over the term of the lease. Prima facie, every instrument that falls within the section 8 definition of lease is dutiable pursuant to section 26 at the specified rate. Under section 29, if an instrument increases the rent or other consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest, under any lease stamp duty will only be computed on that instrument to the extent that there is an increase in rent or other consideration or there is an increase in the value of the lessee’s interest. Example 1 – rental increased at some point during the term of the lease C Ltd leases a commercial building from D Ltd for a ten-year period from 1 December 1998 at an annual rental of $50,000 per annum. Lease duty of $200 is paid. Under the lease, the rental is to be reviewed after five years by agreement, and if no agreement can be reached, by arbitration. By way of an instru- ment dated 24 December 2003, the rental is in- creased to $75,000 per annum. The lease provides that the rental payable is to be increased at a specified date in the future, and an instrument effecting this increase has been executed. In this situation section 29 will apply and stamp duty of $100 will be payable on the instrument. The use of the words “under any lease” in section 29 indicate that in order for an instrument to be dutiable under the section, a particular lease must already be in existence at the time an instrument increasing or agree- ing to increase the rent or other consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest is executed. This indicates that instruments will not be dutiable under section 29 if: •a lease is entered into for the first time; or •during the term of a lease a new lease is agreed upon and entered into (including occasions where by operation of law an instrument effects a new demise). Section 8 states: For the purposes of this Act, the term “lease” means any instrument whereby at law or in equity - (a)Any leasehold interest in land; or (b)Any easement over land - is created or agreed to be created; and includes any instrument by which the rent, consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest in any lease is increased or agreed to be increased. Section 3 states: For the purposes of this Act, the term “instrument” includes every writing, whether executed in New Zealand or elsewhere, affecting - (a)Any property situated in New Zealand; or (b)Any property situated or to be situated on the continental shelf beyond the territorial limits of New Zealand, but that pursuant to the Continental Shelf Act 1964 would or will be deemed to have taken place in New Zealand, - but does not include a will or other instrument operating only by way of a testamentary disposition, or a bill of exchange. Section 116 of the Land Transfer Act 1952 states: (1)The term of any lease may from time to time be extended by a memorandum of extension in Form L in the Second Schedule to this Act signed by the lessor and lessee for the time being and registered before the expiry of the then current term of the lease. (2)Subject to the provisions of this section, the memorandum of extension shall have the same effect as if it were a memorandum of lease for the extended term subject to the same covenants, conditions, and restrictions, with the necessary modification, as are contained or implied in the lease. Upon the registration of the memorandum of extension the estate of the lessee thereunder shall be deemed to be subject to all encumbrances, liens, and interests to which the lease is subject at the time of registration of the memorandum of extension. For the purposes of this subsection all references in any Act or in any agreement, deed, instrument, notice, or other document whatsoever to the lease or to the estate of the lessee thereunder shall, unless inconsistent with the context or with the provisions of this section, be deemed to be references to the lease as varied by the memorandum of extension or to the estate of the lessee thereunder, as the case may be. (3)The covenants, conditions, and restrictions contained or implied in the lease may be expressly varied, negatived, or added to by the memorandum of extension. ... (4)Notwithstanding that the term of the lease is not extended, the covenants, conditions, and restrictions contained or implied in any lease may be expressly varied, negatived, or added to by a memorandum of variation in the said Form L (with the necessary modifications) signed by the lessor and the lessee for the time being and registered before the expiry of the then current term of the lease. (5)The memorandum of extension or memorandum of variation may be registered in the same manner as the original lease: from page 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 25 In these situations it cannot be said that the instrument is entered into under “any lease” (meaning the specific lease in question), as a new lease is, in effect, created. Any such lease will be a fresh demise, dutiable under section 26. The wording of section 29 also indicates that in order for the provision to apply, the instrument increasing or agreeing to increase the rent or other consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest, under any lease must be executed “during the term of the lease”. Therefore, if an instrument is executed after the term of a lease has expired, section 29 will not apply and any such instru- ment will be dutiable under section 26. Example 2 - entering into a lease F Ltd enters into an agreement to lease a commercial building from S Ltd for a four-year period from 1 December 1998, at an annual rental of $50,000 per annum. Stamp duty of $200 is paid under section 26(1). A new lease has been entered into between the parties, there is no existing lease and therefore section 29 has no application. Example 3 - lease expires, new lease agreed H Ltd enters into an agreement to lease a commer- cial building from L Ltd for a four-year period from 1 December 1998 at an annual rental of $50,000 per annum. Lease duty of $200 is paid under sec- tion 26(1). On 31 March 2003 the parties agree to enter into a new lease for a further four-year term, and further lease duty of $200 is paid under section 26(1). The existing lease entered into on 1 December 1998 expired on 1 December 2002. Therefore, section 29 does not apply – it applies only if an instrument is entered into under an existing lease. In this instance the lease has expired and the parties have entered into a new lease. Varying the terms of a lease The parties to a lease may wish to vary their existing rights under the lease so as to extend or renew its term, or alternatively to introduce an option to renew or extend the term of the lease at some time in the future. In Re Savile Settled Estates, Savile v Savile \[1931\] All ER 556, the plaintiff granted two leases, both for a period of 60 years. The plaintiff later sought to vary both leases by substituting a term of 100 years from the date when the leases took effect. Maugham J stated at page 557: I think there is no doubt that the law, as stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England, 2nd Ed., vol. 20, p.271, para. 303, is that any arrangement between the landlord and tenant which operates as a fresh demise will work as a surrender of the old tenancy... ... I should add that, in my opinion, an alteration of an existing lease, so that it will operate for a term extending beyond the original term, can only operate in law as a surrender of the old lease and a grant of a new one... In Baker v Merckel \[1960\] 1 QB 657, by a lease under seal in 1947, the lessor demised premises to the lessee for a term of seven years from 1 November 1946, at a yearly rent of £150. A supplemental deed made between the lessor and the lessee in March 1949, and endorsed on the lease provided that: “if the tenant shall give notice ... to the landlord before Nov 1, 1952, of such his desire the within written lease thereupon shall read, construed and take effect as though the term thereby granted was for a period of eleven years from Nov 1, 1946...”. In 1951 the lessee assigned the lease and option to the first assignee, who in turn assigned it in the same year. In 1952 the second assignee exercised the option to extend the term of the lease, and subsequently in that year assigned it to the last assignee, who in 1957 gave up possession owing rent and being in default on the repairing covenant. The lessor brought an action against the original lessee claiming rent and damages for breach of covenant. Sellers LJ at pages 669-670 said: \[T\]he supplemental deed of March, 1949, had the effect in law of supplanting the original lease by a new one, the terms of which were derived from reading the two documents together. The effect is to include the option as if it had been in the original lease. There was therefore, whilst the lessor and lessee were in direct contractual relationship, a contractual right by unilateral action of the lessee to enlarge the term from seven to eleven years and to vary by the same action the provisions as to painting of the outside of the premises. ...what was done in 1949 was not a mere agreement for the future; it was the granting and obtaining by mutual agreement of a right which the lessee could at his option exercise and which at once became an enforceable part of the contract. The agreement itself did not enlarge the original term, but it provided that it might be extended without any further consent of the lessor and was therefore a substantial alteration of a character to which the rule applies. Whilst the agreement for the option was consensual and in law effected a new lease, the exercise of the option ... was unilat- eral ... Here the notice had the effect of enlarging the demise, of its own force. It was in fulfilment of and in accordance with the agreement and not inconsistent with it or a variation of it. No new bargain was struck in 1952. That which had been agreed as permissible became effective. Pearce LJ at pages 671-672 said: I think it would be wrong to hold that the demise was unaf- fected by the option until its exercise in 1952. ... It is not easy on the authorities to avoid the implication of a surrender and fresh grant where such a change is made in the term, viz., a variation of a term of seven years with an option for a further four years. In O F Gamble Pty Ltd v Whitemore Pty Ltd (1990) 2 WAR 327, Commissioner Anderson QC made the following relevant comments at pages 332-334: Any variation having the effect of extending the term of a lease is, as I have observed, held to work a surrender and fresh grant. continued on page 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 26 •Some terms of a lease can only be varied by an instrument which operates as a surrender and regrant, e.g. the lengthening of the term of a lease. On this basis it is evident that if an instrument is ex- ecuted varying the term of a lease so that the lease is extended to cover a further term, the lease will be dutiable under section 26. This will be the case whether or not there is a corresponding increase in the rental or other consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest in the lease. Example 4 – parties agree to vary the terms of the lease so as to extend its term K Ltd leases a commercial building from B Ltd on 1 December 1993 for a term of three years at a rental of $100,000 per year. Lease duty of $400 is payable. On 30 October 1996 the parties enter into negotia- tions and decide to vary the lease and extend its term for another 3 years, increasing the rent payable to $150,000. The variation of a lease so that its term is lengthened operates as a surrender and regrant by operation of law. On this basis lease duty is assessable pursuant to section 26, and stamp duty of $600 is payable on the new lease. Renewals and extensions of lease generally Many leases include a provision granting the lessee a right to extend the term of a lease or to renew the lease for a further term or terms at the end of the current term. This right may be presented as a covenant on the part of the lessor to grant a further term or terms, or as an option to renew or extend the lease in favour of the lessee. Alternatively, the parties to a lease may wish to renew or extend a lease by varying their existing rights under a lease during the term of the lease or after the lease has expired. A distinction between an “extension” of a lease and a “renewal” of a lease is generally accepted, albeit that it is sometimes difficult to determine. In Brooke v Clarke, 1B & Ald. 399, the Court consid- ered the term “extension” at page 399: “Extension”, is a term properly used for the purposes of enlarging, or giving further duration to, any existing right, but does not import the re-vesting of an expired right; that would not be an ‘extension’ but a ‘re-creation”. In Muller v Trafford \[1901\] 1 Ch. 62, the Court found that a covenant by an under-lessee with his sub-lessee to grant an “extension” of the latter’s term on the under- lessee obtaining a further term from the freeholder, “is not a covenant to renew”. In Regor Estates v Wright \[1951\] 1 KB 689, the Court found that a “renewal of a tenancy” meant an agreement for a fresh tenancy following on the termination of the earlier one. In Baker v Merckel \[1960\] 1 QB 657, it was held that the insertion into a lease by supplemental deed of an option to extend the demise from seven years to eleven years had the same effect. It had the effect of supplanting the existing lease by a new one. It was not necessary for the option actually to be exercised. The mere insertion, by variation, of an option to extend, sufficiently changed the estate to bring the doctrine of surrender and fresh grant into operation. Counsel for the defendant pointed out the distinction between the facts of Baker v Merckel and the facts of the instant case. In the instant case, the option does not provide for the enlarge- ment of the existing term; but, instead provides that the lessee can “require the lessor ... to grant to the lessee a new lease of the property for a further term of eight years ... on the same terms and conditions...”. The point of distinction is that in Baker v Merckel the option was to extend the existing demise, whereas in the instant case the option is for the grant of a new lease. This seems to be a very fine distinction. ... In my opinion, a demise with a covenant of renewal is an estate or interest in the land that is different from a demise containing no covenant of renewal, and this is so regardless of whether the covenant of renewal is in a form which provides for the enlargement of the existing term, or is in a form which provides for the grant of a new lease. I would therefore hold that the introduction into a lease by deed of variation of an option of renewal works a surrender of the old lease by operation of law and a grant of a new lease. ... It is true that, when an option of renewal is exercised, the position is that there is a new lease, a new demise. Plainly, that new lease or new demise does not come into existence until the option is exercised; but that is not to say that if the option of renewal is introduced by variation, the variation is not also effective to create a new lease. In Jenkin R Lewis & Son Ltd v Kerman \[1971\] Ch 477, the question to be decided was whether a document between the lessee and the landlord in 1961 increasing the rent, and/or a similar deed between the two parties in 1968 had the effect of creating a new contract of tenancy between those persons, and consequently a surrender and cesser of the 1941 contract of tenancy. The Court found that a mere agreement between land- lord and tenant for an increase in rent did not necessarily result in a surrender of the existing tenancy and the creation of a new one. Delivering the judgment of the court, Russell LJ stated at page 496: It is not possible simply to convert the existing estate in land into a different estate by adding more years to it, and even if the parties use words which indicate that this is what they wished to achieve the law will achieve the result at which they are aiming in the only way in which it can, namely by imply- ing a fresh lease for the longer period and a surrender of the old lease: see In re Savile Settled Estates \[1931\] 2 Ch 210; Baker v Merckel \[1960\] 1 QB 657. On the basis of the above discussion it is evident that: •Any arrangement between the lessee and lessor which operates as a fresh demise will work as a surrender of the old tenancy. from page 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 27 In Green v Wilson & Horton (1983) 2 NZCPR 94, Savage J at page 102 said: I think it is clear that a renewal of a lease for more than three years, which in effect is the grant of a new lease, is required to be in writing and thus comes within s.2(1)(b) Contracts Enforcement Act 1956. And later at page 103: A further difficulty that would lie in the way of the plaintiff is that for a lessee to take advantage of a right of renewal, which is in effect an option to a new lease... Halsbury’s Laws of England (4th ed. reissue (1994) vol 27(1), para 467) states: Where a lease contains an option to renew the lease the exercise of the option will ordinarily involve the creation of a new lease, and as regards the new lease there will be no privity of contract between the landlord and the original lessee under the old lease which contained the option to renew: however, the right given to a tenant may be simply to extend the term, in which case privity of the contract will endure between the parties, even during the extended term. Halsbury’s indicates that where a lease contains a renewal option, the exercise of the option will not ordinarily constitute the extension of the original lease’s term. In Brooker’s Land Law Volume 2, Ch 11, Leases, at 11-125: A preliminary question, which may be of importance, is the construction of the lease provision to determine whether the lessee has been granted an option to renew the lease, meaning to be granted a new lease on the same or substantially the same terms as the expiring term, or alternatively, an option to extend the present lease term for a further period. Woodfall, Landlord and Tenant, Release 38 at page 18/3 states that: Sometimes a lease contains an option to extend the term rather than an option to renew it. The grant of a lease pursuant to an option to renew creates a new interest, whereas the extension of the term keeps the old term in being, with the consequence that the original tenant is bound by the extension, even where the option is exercised by an assignee. Baker v Merckel \[1960\] 1 QB 657. The following points can be taken from the above discussion: •The “renewal” of a lease, in its ordinary sense, implies the granting of a new lease following on from the termination of an earlier lease. •The “extension” of a lease, in its ordinary sense, implies a continuation of the old lease for a further period, but does not import the re-vesting of an expired right. If it is unclear as to the nature of a further term contem- plated, it will be necessary to look at “the true construc- tion of the respective rights and obligations as expressed in the relevant documentation - Per Henry J in Sina Holdings Ltd v Westpac Banking Corporation \[1996\] 1 NZLR 1 at page 5. Renewals of lease – application to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 The “renewal” of a lease, in its ordinary sense, implies the granting of a new lease following on the termination of an earlier lease. On this basis, if a lease is renewed as well as the rental being increased, section 29 will not apply and the instrument evidencing the renewal will be dutiable under section 26. Example 5 – option to renew a lease M Ltd leases a commercial building from G Ltd on 1 December 1993 for a term of ten years at a rental of $50,000 per year. The lease contains an option to renew the lease for a period of 5 years. Lease duty of $200 is payable. In June 2003, M Ltd exercises its right to renew the lease for a further five years and the rental is increased to $70,000 per year. In this situation stamp duty of $280 is payable under section 26(1). The renewal of a lease constitutes the surrender of the lease followed by the regrant of a new lease. Therefore, section 29 will not apply. Extensions of lease – application to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 The word “extension”, when used in its proper and usual sense in connection with a lease, means a prolongation of the previous leasehold estate. This could be seen as supporting the view that when an option to extend a lease is exercised it is merely a continuation of the existing lease, and therefore stamp duty on the instru- ment evidencing the extension is assessable under section 29. However, there are a number of ways the terms of a lease could potentially be extended which could influ- ence the application of section 29, dependent on whether the lease is registered or unregistered. Registered leases If a lease is registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952 (LTA), the parties may agree to extend the term of the lease by way of memorandum of extension under section 116 of that Act. Under section 116 of the LTA, the term of a registered lease may be extended by the registration of a memoran- dum of extension in Form L in the Second Schedule to the Act. The use of Form L is mandatory, and the memorandum of extension must be signed by the lessee and lessor. The memorandum of extension must be filed before the expiry of the current term of the lease. Section 116(2) of the LTA stipulates that upon registra- tion of the memorandum of extension the memorandum shall have the same effect as if it were a memorandum of lease for the extended term subject to the same terms and conditions contained or implied in the lease. Under this section, all references in any Act or in any agreement, continued on page 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 28 may be effected by deed or written agreement. The parties may agree before the end of the term to the extension, or alternatively the lease may not contain an option to extend the term of the lease and the parties may agree before the end of the term to vary the terms of the lease so as to extend its term. The application of section 29 to the situation where an instrument merely realising a right that is already available under an existing lease is executed is not clear. It is apparent, for example, that there will be situations when a lessee may have an option, to be exercised bilaterally or unilaterally, to extend the term of a lease. If such an option is taken up, is a new leasehold interest created or is the term of the old lease merely increased? This is relevant in so far as section 29 relates to instru- ments whereby the rent or other consideration, or the value of the lessee’s interest, under any lease is in- creased or agreed to be increased during the term of the lease. In Baker v Merckel an option to extend the term of a lease was exercised unilaterally. The Court in that case found that the original variation of the lease was consen- sual and in law effected a new lease. The new lease which was to be gathered from reading the original lease and the supplemental deed, required nothing more than the option to be exercised by way of a unilateral act, and therefore the exercise of the option was merely an extension of the current lease rather than the creation of a new lease: that creation took place when the earlier lease was created. The Court drew a distinction between a consensual act varying the terms of a lease and a unilateral act arising out of and in accordance with the terms of a lease. Sellers LJ at page 670: Whilst the agreement for the option was consensual and in law effected a new lease, the exercise of the option ... was unilat- eral ... Here the notice had the effect of enlarging the demise, of its own force. It was in fulfilment of and in accordance with the agreement and not inconsistent with it or a variation of it. No new bargain was struck in 1952. That which had been agreed as permissible became effective. Baker v Merckel supports the view that a distinction can be drawn between a consensual act varying the terms of a lease which amounts to the surrender and regrant of a lease, and a unilateral act arising out of and in accord- ance with the terms of a lease which has the effect of extending the existing lease’s term. On this basis, if an option to extend the term of an unregistered lease is exercised unilaterally, section 29 is of potential application in assessing duty on any increase in rental. Until an option is exercised, it can only be said to offer a future possibility that the lease will be extended. If the parties to a lease decide to exercise the option, they are in effect agreeing to a consensual variation of the terms of the lease and accordingly a fresh demise is created. This situation is to be distinguished from that where a lease contains an option to extend the term of the lease by virtue of a party’s unilateral act without any element of bargain. As a result of the unilateral act there is an enlarging of the existing demise. deed, instrument, notice, or other document are deemed to refer to the lease as varied by the memorandum of extension. The wording of section 116 of the LTA is clear that a memorandum of extension must stand on its own terms and conditions rather than on those of the previous lease. The memorandum of extension is treated as having the same effect as a memorandum of lease, and references to the lease are deemed to refer to the lease as varied by the memorandum of extension. As discussed previously, some terms of a lease can be varied only by an instrument which operates as a surrender and regrant, e.g. when the term of a lease is lengthened. Under section 116 of the LTA, the length of term of the premises demised is clearly being altered: the parties are entering into a bilateral arrangement whereby the terms of their lease are materially varied. On this basis, if the term of a lease is varied by way of a memorandum of extension in Form L of the Second Schedule to the LTA, the effect is that a new lease is created and accordingly the instrument will be dutiable under section 26 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act. Section 29 will not apply, as the extension (by way of variation) constitutes a new lease and section 29 applies only to instruments increasing the rental payable under an existing lease. This view is supported by comments made in Law of Stamp Duty in New Zealand, 3rd ed., where Adams states at page 186 that: Stamp duty on extension of leases – An extension of a lease – e.g., one executed in the form prescribed by s.116 of the Land Transfer Act 1952 – is liable to the same duty as a lease, for it is in fact a fresh demise... Example 6 – parties agree to vary the terms of the lease so as to extend its term A Ltd leases a commercial building from B Ltd on 1 December 1993 for a term of three years at a rental of $100,000 per year. A condition of the lease provides that the parties may agree to extend the term of the lease for a further 3 years at some time in the future. Lease duty of $400 is payable. On 30 October 1996 the parties enter into negotia- tions and decide to extend the term of the lease for another 3 years and increase the rent payable to $150,000 under section 116 of the LTA. Lease duty of $600 is payable on the new lease. The extension of the term of a lease under section 116 of the LTA operates as a surrender and regrant by operation of law. On this basis lease duty is assess- able under section 26 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. Unregistered leases If a lease is not registered for the purposes of the LTA, the lease may be extended or varied by deed executed by both landlord and tenant. Extensions of equitable leases from page 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 29 Example 7 – option to extend the term of lease By deed dated 1 December 1993, K Ltd leases a commercial building from J Ltd for a term of two years at a rental of $100,000 per year. Lease duty of $400 is payable. Under a condition of the lease, the lessee may extend the term of the lease for a further year, before its expiry, by notifying the lessor of that intention. In that event the rent for that year will be increased to $150,000. Before the expiry of the lease, the lessee exercises the option to extend the lease for a further year. The exercise of an option to extend the term of a lease implies the continuation of the existing lease, and accordingly duty is assessable under section 29. Duty of $200 is payable. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 30 Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Advertising agencies: placement and creative services supplied to non-residents Section 11(2)(e), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 – Services provided for and to persons not resident in New Zealand In November 1996 Inland Revenue published public ruling BR Pub 96/10 – GST: advertising space and advertising time sold to non-residents – (TIB Volume Eight, No.8, pages 13-17). That ruling and its commen- tary discussed the supply of advertising space and advertising time on radio and television, by a GST registered person to a non-resident person who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. A taxpayer has asked whether zero-rating would apply to: •services that are required to create an advertisement for a non-resident •placement services provided to a non-resident. The ruling itself says that the supply of advertising space or advertising time means the service of communicating an advertising message, including all steps involved in providing the service by the supplier of the advertising space or time. However, the ruling does not mention advertising agencies that supply creative and placement services, and deals only with the supplier of the advertis- ing media. This item explains Inland Revenue’s view of how section 11(2)(e) applies and, in particular, whether the “directly in connection with” test is satisfied in the case of creative and placement services when these advertis- ing services are supplied to non-residents. Section 11(2)(e) states: (2)Where, but for this section, a supply of services would be charged with tax under section 8 of this Act, any such supply shall be charged at the rate of zero percent where - ... (e)The services are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are supplied directly in connec- tion with- (i)Land or any improvement thereto situated inside New Zealand; or (ii)Moveable personal property (other than choses in action, and other than goods to which paragraph (ca) of this subsection applies) situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed; - and not being services which are the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on any taxable activity, to the extent that the conduct of that activity would have occurred within New Zealand;... Creative services are simply services supplied that create the advertisement itself. The creation of an advertise- ment involves ascertaining the client’s general aspira- tions, defining the required product image, identifying potential market targets, identifying suitable advertising media and formats, and focusing more specifically on the generation of ideas, themes and concepts which best link these. After evaluation and discussion with clients, a specific advertising product is finally developed and submitted to the client for approval. Placement services cover the “where and when” of advertising, and are services provided by agents in giving their advice on placing advertisements with the appropriate media. This may involve the detailed planning of an advertising campaign, and negotiating and arranging the placement of advertisements with broadcasters and mass circulation publishers. The Commissioner’s view is that placement services may be zero-rated, provided the other requirements of section 11(2)(e) are satisfied, i.e. the services are supplied contractually for and to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are per- formed. It is considered that placement services are in the same category as other services such as the provision of advertising space which, according to Hillyer J in his decision in Wilson & Horton v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,221 at 11,224, are supplied directly in connection with an advertisement but not directly in connection with whatever goods or services are advertised. Placement services will always satisfy the requirement of section 11(2)(e) that the services are not to be supplied directly in connection with land or moveable personal property situated in New Zealand. With creative services the situation is more complicated. Since the finished advertisement does not yet exist while creative services are being performed, it arguably follows from the reasoning in Wilson & Horton that creative services should be considered to be directly connected with the subject matter of the advertisement. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 31 However, the Commissioner’s view is that although the finished advertisement may not exist, it will nevertheless exist in a conceptual or embryonic form while the creative services are being performed. Although the developing advertisement may be said to have an imaginary or intellectual existence, it would not be so elusive or insubstantial as to be said to have no existence at all for the purposes of the Act. Accordingly, there will always be something intervening between the creative services and the subject matter of the advertisement. On the basis of the “one step removed” test applied in Wilson & Horton, creative services and the advertise- ment’s subject matter (i.e. the goods and/or services being advertised) may truly be said not to be directly connected with one another. In summary, creative services and placement services supplied to non-residents who are outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed will qualify for zero-rating, regardless of whether or not the goods to be advertised are situated inside New Zealand. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 32 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Costs awards in tax court cases Case: Auckland Gas Company Limited v CIR – costs decision Decision date: 15 December 1998 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Costs to the respondent Facts The costs appeal was argued before the result of the substantive appeal was know. The Commissioner succeeded in the substantive appeal and therefore the case is to be remitted to the High Court for finalisation of costs. Gas pipe replacement – whether capital or revenue expenditure Case: CIR v Auckland Gas Company Limited Decision date: 15 December 1998 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 – section 104 & 108 Keywords: capital v revenue expenditure Summary This was an appeal by the Commissioner from the High Court. The Court of Appeal allowed the Commissioner’s appeal, finding that AGC’s expenditure was of a capital nature. Facts Auckland Gas Company Limited (“AGC”) is in the business of gas distribution. Since mid 1980s AGC has been inserting polyethelene pipe into its existing cast iron and steel mains and services. AGC claimed deduc- tions for the expenditure incurred on the basis that the expenditure constitutes a “repair” under section 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976 Decision The Court of Appeal found that the PE insertion in its nature and scale could not realistically be regarded as a mere repair, but held that the High Court had rightly proceeded on the basis that the asset was the whole of the AGC network. The Court of Appeal held that if the taxpayer was faced with a costly maintenance bill but elects to rebuild the asset in question in a different way which results in a substantial change in its character, the cost cannot be written off for tax purposes as if it were merely an expenditure or maintenance work which was not actually done – even if what was spent may have been less than the cost of maintenance. Their Honours held that the pipe substitution programme was from its inception projected beyond the income years in question. Furthermore the Court held that the taxpayer could not, by artificially treating portions of an overall program done in separate income years as separate works, deny the reality or minimise the extent of what had been effected The Court of Appeal held that under section 108 the changes effected to AGC’s network were fairly catego- rised as alterations. They were modifications to the network and did not amount to a replacement of substan- tially the whole even if the Commissioner’s figure of 70% was accepted. However their Honours held that AGC’s valuation evidence failed to establish that what was done had not increased that capital value (market of economic value) of the network or had done so by less than the cost. AGC failed because it had not produced the requisite before of after valuations. In any event the Court held that AGC’s valuation evidence failed to establish AGC’s case. Auckland Gas Company Limited has appealed the Court of Appeal ruling to the Privy Council. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 33 Decision The Court of Appeal held that in relation to appeals, the High Court may award such costs to or against either party as it thinks just. In relation to the first instance hearings in the High Court the same costs jurisdiction and rules (s 51G of the Judicature Act and r 436) apply to tax cases as they do to civil cases generally. Their Honours stated that although the right to challenge assessments for tax is central to the functioning of the tax system, so too, are the principles underlying ss 6 and 6A. Those principles are designed to protect the integrity of the tax system in an environment where the Commis- sioner is required to operate within limited resources in the care and management of all the functions committed to the Commissioner’s charge. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal held that it does not follow that there is a special and different approach to costs awards in High Court tax litigation than applies generally in civil cases. In that regard both the taxpayer and the Commissioner operating under the care and management responsibili- ties imposed by ss 6 and 6A are entitled to make sensible litigation, including settlement, decisions. The Court of Appeal held that although the Commissioner’s functions as spelt out in the 1995 amendment, based on the Report of the Organisational Review, must be taken into account and place the Commissioner in a somewhat different category from a private person, for litigation purposes there is no cause to read the legislation as placing any substantial or undue inhibition on his or her powers in this regard. The Court of Appeal held that the general principles governing the discretionary award of costs in civil cases including the relevance of the scale (r 48) are equally applicable to tax cases and can readily accommodate any special factors that may be present in a particular case, e.g. test case implication, particularly small or large sums at stake, and any particular circumstances of the taxpayer or of the litigation itself. Power cable undergrounding – revenue or capital Case: Poverty Bay Electric Power Board v CIR Decision date: 15 December 1998 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 – section 108 Keywords: Capital expenditure or revenue expendi- ture, repairs, alterations Summary This was an appeal by the Objector from the High Court. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Objector’s appeal, finding that the expenditure was of a capital nature. Facts Poverty Bay Electric Power Board (“PBEPB”) is an electricity supplier. They supply electricity from the East Coast to south of Gisborne. PBEPB replaced urban overhead power lines in its area with underground cables and claimed a deduction for revenue expenditure of $422,658 in respect of 14 of the sites. The Commissioner disagreed and assessments were issued on the basis that the expenditure was capital in nature. Issues 1.Whether the expenditure was a revenue expenditure qualifying for deductibility as a “repair” or whether it was capital expenditure. If capital expenditure: 2.Whether the second proviso to s 108(1) of the Act was a “ stand-alone ” provision permitting the deduction of certain capital expenditure within the limits therein prescribed. 3.Whether the expenditure was on “ alterations ” to the system, and if so: 4.Whether those alterations increased the “ capital value” of the asset so altered, or did so by an amount less than the cost of the alterations. Decision The Court of Appeal found that the work overall on the undergrounding programme was so substantial and was intended to produce such a different and operationally superior asset for the board that it is impossible to regard it as anything but a capital improvement. On the second and third issues, the Court of Appeal found that the second proviso allows a deduction of the cost of alterations of a capital nature, and on the facts, the changes made to sections of the cable is fairly described as “alterations”. On the fourth issue, the Court was satisfied on the evidence that there was an appropriate basis for the High Court’s decision that the capital value of the urban reticulation had been increased by at least the cost of the works. As that view was open on the evidence, the Court was not prepared to disturb it. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.1 (January 1999) 34 Farm land supplied by trusts – whether taxable activity for GST Case: CIR v John Humphry Bayly & Ors Decision date: 9 December 1998 Act: Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords: taxable activity, farm land, lease Summary The trusts were found to be liable to GST in this instance and the Commissioner’s appeal was allowed. Facts This case involved five land-owning trusts. Three sets of trustees owned the Tangihau Station. Two further sets of trustees owned the Cricklewood and Tahanui Stations. Approximately thirty years ago the owners of the stations entered into separate partnership deeds. Under those deeds the stations were placed at the use and occupation of the partnership for the term of the partner- ship (approximately 30 years). The deeds provided that the interests in the land were not partnership assets. The partnerships were required to pay all rates and taxes and the landowners were to receive a share of partner- ship profits. One of the five trusts, which engaged in an unrelated activity, was registered for GST purposes; otherwise the trusts were not registered persons. On 6 May 1992 the trusts which owned the Tangihau Station sold it to a family company. On 30 October 1992 the trusts which owned the Cricklewood and Tahanui Stations sold them to a family partnership. The purchasers of the land registered for GST and claimed an input tax credit on the transactions. The Commissioner assessed the vendor trusts for GST on the land sales. The trusts objected. The Taxation Review Authority upheld the Commission- er’s assessments, deeming the trusts to be registered persons who were engaged in the taxable activity of supplying the use and occupation of farmland to the relevant farming partnership and also concluding that they had met the necessary registration threshold. Tompkins J in the High Court overturned the Taxation Review Authority’s decision. His Honour found that the deeds in each case were contractual licences as opposed to leases. His Honour held that once the trustees ex- ecuted the deed they were not involved in any activity and were not required to do anything as owners. Accord- ingly, the trustees were not carrying on a taxable activity and were not liable for GST on the sale of their lands. Decision The Court of Appeal addressed first the question of whether the trustees were engaged in a taxable activity. The Court of Appeal stated that the character and incidents of the legal arrangements in question could be ascertained only by their surrounding circumstances. The label which should be attached (lease or licence) was not decisive in determining whether or not the provider of land and livestock was carrying on a taxable activity. Rather it was a matter of examining the clauses of the deeds in question in their context. The Court of Appeal examined the rights and responsi- bilities of each of the trusts to the partnerships in return for the supply of land. The different deeds relating to the separate stations gave differing rights and the Court of Appeal noted these. For the sake of brevity a brief sample of those rights are recorded here. The trustees were entitled to monitor the performance of the continuing obligations of the farming partnership to maintain and farm the property. They were entitled to monitor the partnership’s obligations to pay rates and taxes. They had continuing obligations to give the partnership quiet enjoyment of the property. The Court of Appeal concluded that Tompkins J’s view that the trustees’ role was entirely passive was incorrect. The Court of Appeal affirmed Judge Barber’s view that the trustees were carrying on a taxable activity. In relation to the consideration issue the Court of Appeal stated that where the supplier and the recipient are associated persons the consideration in money for the supply is deemed to be the open market value of that supply (section 10(3) of the GST Act 1985). The Court of Appeal found that in the present case it was common ground that in each instance the provision of interest in the land by the trusts was worth well over $30,000 per annum.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 3 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Livestock values - 1999 national standard costs for specified livestock The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has released a determination, reproduced below, setting the national standard costs for specified livestock for the 1998-99 income year. These costs are used by livestock owners to value livestock on hand at the end of the income year where they have adopted the national standard cost (NSC) scheme to value any class of livestock. The NSC scheme reflects the national average costs of production of various types and classes of livestock. Farmers using the scheme apply national standard costs to stock bred on the farm during the year and to imma- ture animals on hand at the beginning of the year. Livestock they buy are valued at their purchase price. The average of these costs is used to find the closing value of livestock on hand. Livestock – 1999 national standard costs This determination may be cited as “The National Standard Costs for Specified Livestock Determination, 1999”. This determination is made in terms of section EL 3A of the Income Tax Act 1994. It shall apply to any specified livestock on hand at the end of the 1998-99 income year, where the taxpayer has elected to value that livestock under the national standard cost scheme for that income year. For the purposes of section EL 3A of the Income Tax Act 1994, the national standard costs for specified livestock for the 1998-99 income year are as set out in the following table.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 4 Use of money interest rates from 8 March 1999 From 8 March 1999 the use of money interest rates on revenues and duties will decrease from 12.48% to 10.59% for underpayments and from 4.79% to 3.38% for overpayments. Use of money interest rate compensate taxpayers or the Government when tax is over or underpaid. The rates are reviewed regularly to ensure they are consistent with market interest rates. Laser cutting machines General Depreciation Determination DEP43 In Tax Information Bulletin Volume Ten, No.11 (November 1998) at page 25, we published a draft general deprecia- tion determination for laser cutting machines used in the engineering industry. No submissions were received on the draft determination, and the Commissioner has now issued the determination. It is reproduced below and may be cited as “Determination DEP43: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 43”. The determination is based on the estimated useful life set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP43 This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP43: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 43”. 1.

Interpretation guidelines are intended to clarify general points of interpretation that are causing, or may cause, difficulty for practitioners, taxpayers, and Inland Revenue. An interpretation guideline is Inland Revenue’s opinion as to the better view of the law. That view is developed from an appreciation and assessment of the law on a particular topic, as gathered from leading cases. Employee or independent contractor? Background This interpretation guideline will help taxpayers to determine correctly their employment status for tax purposes. It describes the common law tests developed by the courts for determining whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor. This interpretation guideline replaces the policy state- ment entitled “Employee or independent contractor?” in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) at pages 2-4 which outlined the tests for determin- ing whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor. That policy statement was published before the Court of Appeal overruling the Employment Court decision in Cunningham v TNT Worldwide Express (NZ) Ltd \[1992\] 3 ERNZ 1030. On the whole the previous statement contained the correct factors to consider, but it did not fully reflect the approach to this question currently taken by the courts. This interpretation guideline is consistent with, and should be read in conjunction with, the policy statement in TIB Volume Five, No.1 (July 1993) at page 5 which discusses the implications of the Court of Appeal decision in TNT Worldwide Express (NZ) Ltd v Cunningham (1993) 15 NZTC 10,234 in relation to the employment status of courier drivers. Relevance of employment status A taxpayer’s tax obligations differ according to his or her employment status, so it is important to know if he or she is an employee or not. The employment status of a person has the following consequences for tax purposes: •Payments to employees from their employer are salary or wages, which must have PAYE deducted at source. •Employees cannot register for or charge GST for services they supply as employees. •Independent contractors: •may deduct certain expenses incurred in deriving assessable income; •must account to Inland Revenue for tax and ACC earner and employee premiums for themselves and any employees; and •must meet all the requirements of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 if the services they supply are in the course of a taxable activity, and they are registered (or liable to register) for GST. It is not possible for taxpayers to alter their employment status (or the resulting tax implications) merely by calling themselves independent contractors when they are essentially still employees. Types of employment arrangement A person’s employment status depends on whether his or her employment contract is a “contract of service” or a “contract for services”. In New Zealand Educational Institute v Director-General of Education \[1981\] 1 NZLR 538, Somers J in giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal said at page 539: On many occasions over the years the Courts have had to decide whether the relationship between two persons was that of employer and employee or, as it used to be called, master and servant. The inquiry normally involved the distinction between a contract of service in which the relation was that of employer and employee and a contract for services in which the relation was that between employer and independent contractor. A decision in any particular case required an examination of the contract between the two – it might be expressed in words or it might be implicit from the circum- stances. Employees have a “contract of service” with their employer. Contracts of service evolved from the earlier concept of a master-servant relationship. Such a relation- ship required an employee to be continuously available for service and to accept a high degree of control by the employer. A “contract for services” applies to the relationship between an independent contractor and a principal. It emphasises the nature of the services to be provided by a person rather than his or her availability to work as directed. Either form of contract may include an unwritten agreement. A written contract is not necessary in determining the existence of any particular type of employment relationship. However, if there is a detailed written contract, it will form the basis for analysing the nature of the relationship the parties intended to have. Employment contracts often change as the relationship continued on page 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 6 •supervised him closely, •restricted him from carrying freight for anyone else, •had all ownership rights over the business and good- will, and •could regulate his income (by controlling where and how much he worked). The Court of Appeal’s decision reversed that finding, holding that the written contract entered into by the parties created a genuine independent contractor rela- tionship. The Court accepted that an owner-driver courier was an independent contractor rather than an employee where his or her contract with TNT: •required him to provide his own vehicle, uniform, approved radio telephone, goods service licence under the Transport Act 1962, and insurance, •paid him mainly on a per trip basis, •made him responsible for employing any relief driver, •referred to the courier as an independent contractor, and •gave TNT very extensive control over his operations. The Court acknowledged the extensive control exercised by TNT over the owner-driver, but concluded that the owner-driver accepted only that degree of control and supervision necessary for the efficient and profitable conduct of the business he was running on his own account as an independent contractor. Casey J cited (at page 697) the following statement of MacKenna J in Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance \[1968\] 1 All ER 433 at page 447: A man does not cease to run a business on his own account because he agrees to run it efficiently or to accept another’s superintendence. The Court of Appeal said that when the contract is wholly in writing and it is not a sham, then the nature of the relationship intended by the parties is determined from the terms of that contract in the light of all the surrounding circumstances at the time it was made. Cooke P (as he then was) noted at page 10,235 that “it is necessary to consider all the terms of the agreement”, and made the following observations at page 10,238: When the terms of a contract are fully set out in writing which is not a sham (and there is no suggestion of a sham in this case) the answer to the question of the nature of the contract must depend on an analysis of the rights and obligations so defined. ... In the end, when the contract is wholly in writing, it is the true interpretation and effect of the written terms on which the case must turn. Tests of the employment relationship In cases where the nature of the relationship is unclear the courts have developed various tests to determine the type of contract that exists. Cases may not be clear-cut evolves (e.g. a person takes on more duties). Changes in regulations and work practices may also cause the employment status of some workers to change. The courts will consider how the parties actually work together when they determine the type of employment relationship the parties have. Employment status and revenue law Tax law relies on the terms “contract of service” and “contract for services”, but does not define them. Therefore, their meanings depend on the contract law developed by the courts and any statutes that apply to a particular kind of work. A person will have the same employment status for tax purposes as he or she has under the general law. Some- times it is not easy to tell if a taxpayer is an employee or an independent contractor. Inland Revenue will use the current common law tests to determine a worker’s status. TNT Worldwide Express v Cunningham A leading New Zealand case on the question of whether the relationship between two parties is one of employee and employer, or independent contractor and principal is the Court of Appeal decision in TNT Worldwide Express. In that case the Court gives guidance as to the appropri- ate focus of inquiry in deciding this question. In TNT Worldwide Express the respondent was engaged by the appellant company, TNT, as an owner-driver to conduct a courier service for the company. The owner- driver: •provided his own vehicle and was responsible for its maintenance and upkeep, •was responsible for all his own tax and ACC payments, •claimed deductions as if he were self-employed, and •had a contract with TNT that said he was an independ- ent contractor. The company terminated the respondent’s contract, and the respondent sought to invoke the personal grievance procedure under the Employment Contracts Act 1991. The Employment Court held that an owner-driver courier for TNT was an employee and not self-em- ployed. In reaching that conclusion, considerable emphasis was placed on the rigorous control which the company exercised over its owner-drivers. The Employ- ment Court found that the company’s actions showed that it treated the owner-driver as its employee. In particular, the Court found it significant that the com- pany: •imposed an obligation on the owner-driver to provide a licence, wear a uniform, and have the company’s logo painted on the vehicle, •exercised strong control over the volume, type, quality, and location of his work, from page 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 7 and the tests may overlap. Therefore, the results of the various tests must be carefully weighed to find the predominant factors that will determine the relationship. In TNT Worldwide Express, the Court of Appeal cited (at page 10,248) a statement from page 382 of the judgment of the Privy Council in Lee Ting Sang v Chung Chi- Keung \[1990\] 2 AC 374: What then is the standard to apply? This has proved to be a most elusive question and despite a plethora of authorities the courts have not been able to devise a single test that will conclusively point to the distinction in all cases. The Privy Council in Lee Ting Sang quoted with ap- proval from the judgment of the English Cooke J in Market Investigations Ltd v Minister of Social Security \[1968\] 3 All ER 732, at page 185: No exhaustive list has been compiled and perhaps no exhaus- tive list can be compiled of considerations which are relevant in determining the question, nor can strict rules be laid down as to the relative weight which the various considerations should carry in particular cases. Although there are no single tests or exhaustive lists that are appropriate, there are five broad factors or tests which are useful in determining this question. These are not alternative tests but are simply relevant factors to be considered. A discussion of the tests follows. 1. The control test The control test looks at the degree of control the employer or principal exerts over the work an employee or contractor is to do and the manner in which it is to be done. The greater the extent to which the principal or employer specifies work content, hours and methods, and can supervise, regulate and/or dismiss a person, the more likely it is that the person will be an employee. This test used to be considered as the deciding factor, but this is no longer the case. The Court of Appeal in TNT Worldwide Express emphasised that control is only one of several factors relevant to the interpretation of the contract. The Court endorsed the statement of Cooke J in Market Investigations (at page 185) that while control will always have to be considered, it can no longer be regarded as the sole factor in determining the relation- ship between the parties. The Court of Appeal in TNT Worldwide Express considered that this factor had been given too much weight by the Employment Court. 2. The independence test This is the inverse of the control test. A high level of independence on the part of an employee or contractor is inconsistent with a high level of control by an employer or principal. The following factors may indicate that a person has a high level of independence: •work for other people or clients •work from his or her own premises •supply his or her own (specialised) tools or equipment •have direct responsibility for the profits and risks of the business •hire or fire whoever he or she wishes to help do the job •advertise and invoice for the work •supply the equipment, premises, and materials used •pay or account for taxes and government and profes- sional levies. On the other hand, when some independent contractors perform work for a principal, they may agree not to work for a competitor or give away trade secrets. This alone will not make the worker an employee (it actually emphasises that the worker is usually entitled to work for others). Also, the fact that a person is contracted to one party only does not, of itself, necessarily dictate a conclusion that their legal relationship is one of employment. 3. The organisation or integration test In Enterprise Cars Ltd v CIR (1988) 10 NZTC 5,126, Sinclair J said that this test is really whether the person is part and parcel of the organisation and not whether the work itself is necessary for the running of the business. According to this test, a job is likely to be done by an employee if it is: •integral to the business organisation •the type of work commonly done by “employees” •continuous (not a “one-off” or accessory operation) •for the benefit of the business rather than the worker. 4. Intention of the parties This test looks at the intentions of each party to the agreement regarding the nature of the relationship. The description given to a relationship by the parties to the contract is a strong, but not conclusive indication of the type of relationship that exists. The fact that a written contract states that a person is an employee or an independent contractor may indicate the intention of the parties, but is not determinative. Holland J in the High Court in Challenge Realty Limited and Ors v CIR \[1990\] 3 NZLR 42 stated at pages 55-56: Obviously the Court’s function in interpreting a contract is to determine the intentions of the parties. When, however, the question for determination is the legal relationship between the parties created by the contract, the expressed intention of the parties will not be determinative of the question. It is nevertheless an important factor, and if after considering all factors the exact state of the relationship is a matter of some ambiguity, may be decisive. In the present cases before me Harcourts is the only one with a written agreement. Nevertheless I would conclude that in all cases it was the intention of the parties to create an agency relationship rather than an employer/employee relationship. The question remains as to whether that result has been achieved. (emphasis added) Thus, if the actual circumstances point to an employ- ment relationship, then simply labelling it an independ- ent contract will not alter the actuality. continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 8 favour that suggested by Adrian Merritt, Lecturer in Industrial Law, University of New South Wales in his article “‘Control’ v ‘Economic Reality’: Defining the Contract of Employment” in (1982) 10 Australian Business Law Review 105 at p.118: The issue that must be settled in today’s cases is whether the worker is genuinely in business on his own account or whether he is “part and parcel of” - or “integrated into”- the enterprise of the person or organisation for whom work is performed. The test is, therefore, one of “economic reality”. This test looks at factors such as: •whether the type of business or the nature of the job justifies or requires using an independent contractor •the behaviour of the parties before and after entering into the contract •if there is a time limit for completing a specific project •whether the worker can be dismissed •who is responsible for correcting sub-standard work •who is legally liable if the job goes wrong. Usually, an independent contractor agrees to be respon- sible for his or her work. He or she cannot usually be “dismissed”, although the contract can be terminated if it is broken. Summary It must be emphasised that the “tests” outlined above are merely factors to be considered, rather than distinct tests, and it is important in each case to consider this question by balancing all the circumstances of the relationship between the parties. Often there will be competing factors that indicate differing conclusions as to whether someone is an employee or an independent contractor. In these circumstances, each of the tests described above should be applied to the facts of the case, and the resulting factors carefully and objectively weighed to determine the true nature of the relationship. In TNT Worldwide Express, a clause in the written contract which purported to override all other aspects of the agreement stated that the courier was an independent contractor. The Employment Court found that the actual conduct of the relationship showed that TNT imposed a high level of control and supervision of its staff that was inconsistent with any independence or initiative on their part. However, the Court of Appeal in reversing this decision concluded, after weighing all the circumstances, that the TNT standard form contract created a genuine independent contractor relationship. If an employment contract treats a person as an em- ployee, for example by paying him or her at regular intervals, at a set rate, and deducting PAYE, this may indicate that there is an employment relationship. 5. The fundamental test In Market Investigations, the English Cooke J said that the fundamental test for distinguishing an employee and an independent contractor was as follows: Is the person who has engaged himself to perform these services performing them as a person in business on his own account? If the answer to that question is “yes”, then the contract is a contract for services. If the answer is “no”, then the contract is a contract of service. ... factors which may be of importance are such matters as whether the man performing the services provides his own equipment, whether he hires his own helpers, what degree of financial risk he takes, what degree of responsibility for investment and management he has, and whether and how far he has an opportunity of profiting from sound management in the performance of his task. This test was approved by the Privy Council in Lee Ting Sang and subsequently cited by four of the five judges in the Court of Appeal in TNT Worldwide Express. The fundamental test is also sometimes described as the “business test” or the “economic reality test”. In Chal- lenge, the Court of Appeal stated at page 65: If it is helpful to look for a test or application in this case, apart from that of control, which is a key feature of the Act, we from page 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 9 Standard practice statements These statements describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. Shortfall penalties - application where returns are amended before due date Standard practice statement INV-570 Introduction This Standard Practice Statement (SPS) outlines the Commissioner’s practice when a taxpayer files a return taking an incorrect tax position and then seeks to amend the return before the due date for filing the return. Application This SPS applies for the period from 1 March 1999 to 31 March 2001. It applies to all amendments made to a return before due date, including amendments requested by phone call, letter, NOPA or by filing an amended return. It does not apply to income tax returns. Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 imposes shortfall penalties in all cases when a taxpayer breaches the standards defined in sections 141A to E and takes an incorrect tax position creating a tax shortfall. This applies even if the return is amended before the due date for filing the return. If the incorrect tax position was not caused by a breach of the taxpayers’ statutory obligations, shortfall penalties cannot be imposed. Except for income tax, taxpayers take their tax position at the date when they file the return. This is the assess- ment date regardless of whether it is before the due date for filing the return. Therefore when taxpayers file an incorrect return they have taken an incorrect tax position at that date. The definition of taxpayer’s tax position is different for income tax. If a taxpayer alters the tax position taken in an income tax return before the earlier of the due date or when the assessment is issued, the amended return will be accepted as the taxpayer’s tax position. To date, in accordance with the legislation, Inland Revenue has been proposing shortfall penalties in some cases when the taxpayer has amended a return before the due date, with a 75% reduction for voluntary disclosure before notification of a pending tax audit or investiga- tion. However, we are concerned that imposing shortfall penalties in these situations may discourage taxpayers from voluntarily disclosing an incorrect tax position. This would not be in keeping with the purpose of the penalty regime, which is to encourage taxpayers to voluntarily co-operate with Inland Revenue. To encourage voluntary disclosure Inland Revenue will take a liberal approach. We will not impose shortfall penalties if a taxpayer independently and voluntarily files an amended return before due date. However, we reserve the right to impose shortfall penalties in all situations if we believe that the taxpayer’s original tax position was not a genuine mistake or if the taxpayer repeatedly makes the same or similar mistake and files amendments to the returns before due date. Practice Inland Revenue will adopt the following approach: If taxpayer amends return before due date and before IRD advises taxpayer of acceptance or non-acceptance of original tax position In this situation the taxpayer has realised the mistake and has voluntarily notified IRD of the incorrect tax position. To impose shortfall penalties would discourage taxpay- ers from making such voluntarily disclosures in the future. The taxpayer has independently found and corrected the mistake before due date so Inland Revenue will not impose shortfall penalties. Notification that the tax position has or has not been processed or accepted for processing will be the date the taxpayer or agent receives written advice or a statement of account, or the time of a telephone call advising of a pending tax audit or investigation. If the exact time of the written advice/statement of account becomes crucial, it will be ascertained from the expected time for the mail to reach its destination as prescribed by section 14(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This is in accordance with the Standard Practice Statement INV-250 on Voluntary Disclosure. If taxpayer amends return before due date but after IRD advises taxpayer of acceptance of original tax position In this situation the taxpayer has independently realised the mistake and chooses to file an amended return before the due date. Again to impose shortfall penalties in this situation would discourage this type of voluntary disclosure. Generally Inland Revenue would not impose shortfall penalties because the taxpayer has independ- ently found and corrected the mistake before due date. continued on page 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 10 the shortfall was the result of a breach of sections 141A to E we will need to request details of how the shortfall occurred. If a penalty is warranted it will be reduced by 40% as a post-notification voluntary disclosure or 75% as a temporary shortfall. If penalties were not imposed in these situations taxpay- ers would have an incentive to file early returns, over- stating their benefit or understating their tax. If IRD does not accept the tax position taken the taxpayer could send in an amendment before the due date to avoid penalties. This does not encourage voluntary compliance first time. Consideration of a penalty in this instance prevents taxpayers abusing the opportunity to take a tax position beneficial to themselves before the due date. If taxpayer repeatedly makes same/similar mistake then amends return before due date Inland Revenue wants to continue to encourage taxpay- ers to take the correct tax position when filing their returns. Therefore in situations like this we may consider imposing a shortfall penalty. This Standard Practice Statement was signed by me on 2 February 1999. Tony Bouzaid National Manager, Operations policy GST returns – correcting minor errors Clarification to Standard Practice Statement INV-490 In TIB Volume Ten, No.6 (June 1998) we published Standard Practice Statement INV-490 about correcting minor errors in GST returns. Briefly this statement set a maximum error amount (either $200 or $500 depending on whether the registered person’s annual turnover is over $250,000) which could be corrected by the regis- tered person in a later GST return without entering into the formal disputes resolution process. Since then readers have asked whether this $200/$500 limit applies to the original return in which the error was made, or to the later return in which the error is cor- rected. This question becomes significant if errors are found in several earlier returns, and the registered person wants to correct them all in one later return. The $200/$500 limit applies to the initial error(s) made in one return; it does not limit the value of error(s) that can be corrected in a later return. The following exam- ples demonstrate how the limit applies and situations which are acceptable and not acceptable. Example 1: One common error in several past returns - within threshold Mrs Jones operates a large clothing warehouse. She permits staff to take supplies for private use in lieu of wages payable. She omitted to make adjustments for GST on fringe benefits when filing her two- monthly GST returns, but her accountant identified the oversight when preparing the end of year accounts. Mrs Jones’ staff take approximately $1,800 of goods per return period, so the GST adjustment for fringe benefits is approximately $200 per return period. This qualifies as a minor error because Mrs Jones’ annual turnover exceeds $250,000 and the return errors are less than $500 per period. She can make a $1,200 catch-up adjustment in the next GST return. She must keep details of the error with the current GST return work papers. Example 2: One error exceeds threshold ABC Limited operates a hotel/reception centre. ABC overlooked including $4,920 goods and services supplied and invoiced to a local club for a recent convention held at the centre. The company didn’t identify the error until it received payment the following month, and asked if it could make an adjustment to the current return. Although ABC Limited’s annual turnover exceeds $250,000, the initial error is greater than $500 (1/9 of $4,920 = $546). The correction must be made to the original return as the value of the GST ABC Limited’s error falls outside the concession in the Standard Practice Statement. If a refund is issued or the tax becomes due before the taxpayer files an amended return interest will be charged in accordance with Section 120. Inland Revenue reserves the right to impose penalties if the amended return filed before due date is not correct- ing a genuine mistake. That is, the shortfall may be considered for penalties if we believe that the taxpayer intentionally attempted to overstate a benefit or under- state tax by filing an incorrect first return. If we believe this may be the case we will need to request details as to why the shortfall occurred. An example of the above would be if a vendor who has entered into a property transaction (for which an early return has been filed) omits to return the sale and then finds out that Inland Revenue is auditing the purchaser of the property. In this situation the vendor might quickly put in an amended return because they consider that IRD would check up on whether the vendor has returned the sale. If taxpayer amends return before due date but after IRD advises taxpayer of pending audit/investigation In this case the taxpayer did not amend the return until after Inland Revenue gave notice that the tax position was to be examined. Inland Revenue will consider shortfall penalties in this situation. To establish whether from page 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 11 The company should notify the Commissioner, explaining the background leading to the error. The question of shortfall penalty will be considered as with any other voluntary disclosure. Interest will apply from return period the original liability arose. Example 3: Various errors, test against return threshold A registered person’s accountant completing the income tax return identifies various return errors which result in GST short-paid in three return periods. The turnover is $200,000 per annum. They ask if an adjustment can be made in the current GST return period to correct these errors: Dec 1997$125 Feb 1998$305 Jun 1998$ 80 $510 The December 1997 and June 1998 GST returns can be corrected by an adjustment in the current return period. The February 1998 error exceeds $200 so the registered person should notify the Commis- sioner, explaining the background leading to the error. The question of shortfall penalty will be considered as with any other voluntary disclosure. Interest will apply from the return period the original liability arose. Averaging not permissible Errors in different return periods cannot be averaged to fit within the policy concession. If the error in a single return period exceeds the $200 or $500 threshold (as applicable to $250,000 turnover) the registered person should notify the Commissioner, explaining the back- ground leading to the error. The question of shortfall penalty will be considered as with any other voluntary disclosure. Interest will apply from return period the original liability arose. Different limit from voluntary disclosures Some readers have asked why Standard Practice State- ment INV-490 does not allow registered persons to make adjustments to the value of $4,000, equivalent to the effective treatment of voluntary disclosures under the compliance and penalties rules. Example of voluntary disclosure Shortfall of tax$3,999 Shortfall penalty at rate of 20% $799 Less 75% reduction for disclosure $199 Inland Revenue will generally not impose a shortfall penalty of less than $200. Reduction of a shortfall penalty for disclosure is considered on case by case basis. The shortfall penalty can be greater than 20% e.g. evasion 150%. However, this is a separate issue from the threshold for adjustment and consequential use of money interest. Standard practice statement INV-490 allows registered persons to correct GST return errors without the need to notify the Commissioner or incur compliance costs (including use of money interest). It provides an admin- istratively expedient way of solving minor errors without the encumbrances that follow the making of voluntary disclosures i.e. paperwork, consultation, examination of records and interest. For these reasons we do not plan to align the standard practice statement with the voluntary disclosure process, because the current concession is already reasonable. In effect, standard practice statement INV-490 allows an adjustment up to $1,800 in taxable supplies per return period for small businesses and $4,500 for larger businesses. Standard practice statement INV-490 will continue to apply until it is revoked or legislation change terminates its application. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 12 General interest items Interest, withholding taxes and approved issuer levy In 1998 Inland Revenue’s Banking and Finance Portfo- lio, Corporates, issued a questionnaire to selected financial institutions that pay interest to a significant number of depositors. We also reviewed the interest payment records of a number of corporates. The purpose of the questionnaire and reviews was to identify and correct common errors in applying resident withholding tax (RWT), non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) and approved issuer levy (AIL). This article summarises the issues arising from the questionnaire responses and the review of records. We’ve published it to help interest payers correctly apply RWT, NRWT or AIL. It will also help recipients of interest to understand issues dealt with by interest payers which have a taxation impact on those recipients. In this article payer means a person paying interest from which RWT or NRWT is deducted or AIL applied; depositor or recipient is the person who has invested with the payer and who is entitled to the interest being paid. General Resident and non-resident status Part N of the Income Tax Act 1994 (the Act) sets out two separate sets of rules for NRWT and RWT. A payer’s systems and procedures must be able to distin- guish between New Zealand resident depositors and non-resident depositors, and then deduct the appropriate withholding taxes. Obtaining customers’ IRD numbers Under section 27(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), a recipient of resident withholding income which must have RWT deducted is required to supply his/her tax file number (IRD number) to the payer within 10 working days of receiving a written request from the payer. If the payer does not obtain the IRD number then the payer must deduct tax at the no-declaration rate. (This rate is 33 cents in the dollar until 31 March 2000; from 1 April 2000 it will be 45 cents in the dollar.) Sections 52-54 of the TAA require the payer to provide the recipient’s details, including IRD number, to the Commissioner. For the purposes of those sections only, the payer doesn’t have to provide the IRD number if “having made reasonable efforts to obtain the tax file number, is unable to do so” (section 55, TAA). The payer’s procedures for obtaining the depositor’s IRD number should amount to a “reasonable effort” to obtain the IRD number. The request on, say, a term deposit application form for the depositor’s IRD number, may not amount to a reasonable effort if there is no follow up action with those depositors who did not provide their IRD numbers. IRD number verification by modulus 11 check A modulus 11 check is a mathematical calculation that any payer can run against the eight-digit IRD number supplied by a depositor to ensure the number is valid. Running this check will prevent invalid IRD numbers being loaded into the payer’s systems and not being detected. Invalid IRD numbers may result in inappropri- ate RWT rates being applied and incorrect withholding taxes being deducted and accounted for to the Commis- sioner. All payers should run the modulus 11 check regularly and ensure they have adequate controls to confirm that all IRD numbers supplied by depositors are valid. For details of this check see our booklet E-File IR Electronic filing Payroll Specification Document April 1 1999 to March 31 2000 (also available from our website at http://www.ird.govt.nz/software/index.htm). If an IRD number is not valid, payers must deduct RWT at the no-declaration rate. An additional safeguard to ensure the correct IRD number is recorded in a payer’s records is for the payer to confirm the IRD number by sighting, say, the deposi- tor’s Inland Revenue information card or other IRD documentation bearing the depositor’s name and number. Joint accounts Section 25(9) of the TAA deals with tax deduction certificates when two or more people jointly derive resident withholding income. Basically, the joint account holders who receive resident withholding income can elect which account holder’s name and IRD number will appear on the certificate. However, there are two points to note: •If a person with a valid certificate of exemption holds a joint account with someone who does not have a valid certificate of exemption the payer must deduct RWT from all the interest paid. The person with the valid exemption certificate may then claim a tax refund when filing the annual tax return. •If a non-resident and a resident have a joint account and the payer knows the proportions that relate to each person, NRWT and RWT can be deducted accord- ingly. If the proportions are not known, the payer should deduct RWT from all interest paid on that account. The non-resident may then claim a refund from Inland Revenue by filing an IR 3NR tax return (if they have an IRD number), or by filing an IR 15F (for RWT refund) if they do not have an IRD number. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 13 All payers should ensure that their systems and proce- dures for joint accounts correctly record the RWT/NRWT deducted. Payment of RWT or NRWT to Inland Revenue each month Generally, the payment date for RWT or NRWT is on a monthly basis by the 20th of the month following the month the interest was paid. The respective payments must include all amounts due from all the payer’s systems, sub-systems etc. Because of the possible late payment penalties it is important that payers have adequate systems and procedures in place for paying RWT and NRWT to Inland Revenue by the due date. Information provided to Inland Revenue each year Payers must provide to Inland Revenue, both through the year and annually, the correct withholding tax details on the appropriate forms or in a format agreed by the Commissioner. All payers’ procedures and systems should reconcile the monthly information sent to Inland Revenue with the end of year reconciliation. If the monthly and annual figures cannot be reconciled the payer will need to provide an explanation to Inland Revenue. We view seriously failure to reconcile these records – it could lead to a review or audit of the payer’s withholding tax records. Payer instructions for RWT/NRWT/AIL Inland Revenue expects all payers to maintain adequate records and (if appropriate) instruction manuals in respect of RWT/NRWT/AIL. This is good business practice as it will help payers to comply with the appro- priate legislative requirements (e.g. section 26 of the TAA) and would be a factor in any consideration of a shortfall penalty e.g. for lack of reasonable care. Resident withholding tax (RWT) Expiry of certificate of exemption Section NF 9(1) and (12) of the Act are very specific as to the various classes of persons that may apply for a certificate of exemption (COE). A COE applies only to the person named on the COE, not to, say, subsidiaries of or unit trusts related to that person. To apply for a COE complete form IR 15E. It is impor- tant to complete the application under the correct category so it is processed as quickly as possible. The COE is issued with a start date and an expiry date (if any) as well as the individual’s IRD number. For example, an application under section NF 9(12) is usually limited to one year. If the criteria on which the COE was issued are adhered to, the COE is valid up to the expiry date specified unless it is cancelled earlier by the Commissioner. All payers must deduct RWT at the appropriate rate once the expiry date of a COE has passed unless the depositor presents a new valid COE. Cancellation of COE A cancellation of a COE does not include the expiry of a COE merely because its term has expired. Section NF 11 of the Act provides for the cancellation of a COE either when a person ceases to meet the criteria for exemption as specified or when the Commissioner cancels it in the circumstances listed in section NF 11(2) of the Act. The Commissioner is required by section NF 11(5) of the Act to publish quarterly in the NZ Gazette a list of all COEs that have been cancelled in the preceding three- month period. (This does not include expired certifi- cates.) A COE ceases to be valid on the fifth working day after notice of its cancellation is published in the NZ Gazette (section NF 11(7) of the Act). COE compliance Before paying interest it is important that the payer checks that the COE has not expired. The payer must also check the NZ Gazette and update their database for COEs that have been cancelled. If a payer doesn’t record expiry dates or check the NZ Gazette for cancelled COEs, RWT would not be deducted when due. This would result in a deficiency of RWT payable to Inland Revenue, and the depositor would receive full interest income without deduction of RWT when that depositor no longer holds a valid COE. Failure to deduct the correct RWT means the payer must make up the RWT shortfall, any late payment penalties, and possibly a shortfall penalty under the compliance and penalties rules (e.g. for lack of reasonable care). For details of the compliance and penalties rules see our guide, Taxpayer obligations, interest and penalties (IR 240) – available from the Inland Revenue website at http://www.ird.govt.nz/resource/publicat/index.htm or from IRD offices. All payers should ensure that their systems and proce- dures properly record the expiry dates/cancellation of COEs against depositors’ accounts and, that on expiry/ cancellation of a COE, the correct RWT is deducted. Netting off debit and credit interest Some payers offer revolving credit type accounts that are basically current accounts with an approved over- draft limit. The general conditions of the account are: •interest is paid by the payer on credit balances •interest is paid by the depositor on debit balances •the respective credit and debit interest amounts are calculated on a daily basis •at the end of an agreed period (e.g. monthly, quarterly) the net amount of the two accruals is credited or debited to the depositor’s account. continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 14 RWT applies to the total credit interest before any offsetting of debit interest. The same applies when debit and credit balances from different accounts are offset. All payers should ensure that their system is applying RWT in this manner. Negative interest on broken term deposits Under section NF 2(1) of the Act when a payer pays resident withholding income “...that person shall, at the time of making the payment, make a deduction of tax...” (i.e. RWT) from the resident withholding income. In practice the RWT deduction is made at the same time as the interest is credited to the depositor’s account. Generally, when a depositor breaks a term deposit the payer recalculates interest on the deposit at a lower rate than would have applied if the deposit had run its full term. This change in interest rate can give rise to nega- tive interest. Negative interest arises when, at the time of the break of a term deposit, there is insufficient interest payable to the depositor to offset any interest repayable by the depositor to the payer as a result of the depositor now earning a lower interest rate. For RWT purposes the payer should not offset any negative interest paid by the depositor against gross interest previously paid/credited to the depositor’s account. Section NF 6(2) allows for the refund of any excess RWT deducted due to an error on the part of the payer. In those circumstances the payer “...may pay the excess to the recipient of the payment at any time on or before 31 March in the year the deduction was made...”. However, the recalculation of interest on the breaking of a term deposit by a depositor is not an error on the part of the payer and so this provision does not apply. This is an area that has caused confusion for some payers of interest. The following examples show the correct amounts subject to RWT and to be recorded on the RWT certificate given to the depositor and the Commissioner. Example 1 A $10,000 term deposit is made with a bank on 1/1/X1 for three years at interest of 8% p.a., which will reduce to 6% p.a. if the term is broken. Interest is payable six-monthly on 30/6 and 31/12 of each year. RWT is deducted at 33%. Income year refers to year ending 31 March with 365 days per year. The term deposit is fully broken after some interest is paid; but sufficient interest is payable at time of break to absorb interest to be recovered. Interest payable on 30/6/X1 from start date 1/1/X1: Interest payable$400 RWT @ 33%$132 Net deposit in the bank statement$268 Break on 30/12/X1 Interest due (1/1/X1-30/12/X1) 364 / 365 x .06% x 10,000$598.35 Less interest paid to date$400.00 Net interest payable to 30/12/X1$198.35 Less RWT @33%$ 65.45 Net deposit in the bank statement$132.90 RWT certificate for year ended 31/3/X2 shows: Gross interest$598.35 RWT$197.45 In this situation there is no negative interest paid by the depositor. Example 2 Facts the same as in example 1, except that when the deposit is broken there is insufficient interest payable to absorb the interest to be recovered. This results in negative interest to be recovered by the bank from the depositor. On 30/06/X1 Interest payable$400 Less RWT$132 Net deposit in bank statement$268 On 31/12/X1 Interest payable$400 Less RWT$132 Net deposit in bank statement$268 Break on 30/1/X2 Interest due (1/1/X1-30/1/X2) 395 / 365 x .06% x 10,000$649.32 Less gross interest paid$800.00 Negative interest to be recovered($150.68) RWT Certificate for year ended 31/3/X2 shows: Gross interest$800 RWT$264 The payer will need to advise the depositor sepa- rately of negative interest of $150.68. The depositor should consider this negative interest under the financial arrangement base price adjustment provi- sions in the accrual rules. In this example there is an interest deductibility issue. The RWT certificate shows $800 gross interest for the year, and the depositor must show that gross income in his/her tax return for the year. In addition, the depositor must claim a deduction in his/her tax return for the interest recovered of $150.68. See Public Ruling BR Pub 97/9 in TIB Volume Nine, No.9, for details. Section NF 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994 does not apply as the correct RWT was deducted from interest payments when made. from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 15 Example 3 A term deposit of $10,000 is made with a bank on 1/1/X1 for three years at 8% p.a. Interest is payable six-monthly on 30/6 and 31/12 of each year. On a partial break, interest reduces to 6% on the amount withdrawn from the start date to the date of break. The balance of the deposit continues at 8%. RWT is deducted at 33%. Income year refers to year ending 31 March with 365 days per year. The deposit is partially broken after some interest is paid, but there is sufficient interest payable at the time of the break to absorb interest to be recovered. On 30/06/X1 Interest payable$400 Less RWT @33%$132 Net deposit in bank statement$268 Partial break on 1/12/X1 – $6,000 is withdrawn. On 1/12/X1 interest on the amount withdrawn is: Interest payable (1/1/X1-1/12/X1) 335 / 365 x 0.06% x 6,000$330.41 Less Interest paid (1/1/X1-30/6/X1) 181 / 365 x 0.08% x 6,000($238.03) $ 92.38 Less RWT$ 30.49 Net deposit in bank statement$ 61.89 As at 31/12/X1 Interest payable (1/7/X1-31/12/X1) 184 / 365 x 0.08% x 4,000$161.32 RWT @33%$ 53.23 Net deposit in bank statement$108.09 RWT certificate for the year ended 31/3/X2 shows: Gross Interest (400+92.38+161.32)$653.71 RWT$215.72 In this situation there is no negative interest paid by the depositor. Example 4 Facts the same as in example 3, except that at the time of the partial break there is insufficient interest payable to absorb interest to be recovered, and no further interest will be payable in the income year. On 30/06/X1 Interest payable$400 Less RWT$132 Net deposit in bank statement$268 On 31/12/X1 Interest payable$400 Less RWT$132 Net deposit in bank statement$268 Break on 30/1/X2 Interest payable (1/1/X1-30/1/X2) 395 / 365 x 0.06% x 6,000$389.59 Less interest paid (1/1/X1-31/12/X1) 365 / 365 x 0.08% x 6,000($480.00) Negative interest to be recovered($90.41) RWT certificate for the year ended 31/3/X2 shows: Gross interest$800 RWT$264 The payer will need to advise the depositor sepa- rately of $90.41 negative interest for the year ended 31/3/X2. Although there is no requirement for the depositor to perform a financial arrangement base price adjustment until full maturity of the term deposit, deductibility of this $90.41 may need to be considered separately under section BD 2(1)(b). There is an interest deductibility issue. The RWT certificate shows $800 gross interest, and the depositor must show that $800 interest in his/her tax return for the year ended 31/3/X2. The depositor may claim a deduction for the interest recovered of $90.41. However, the year the deduction can be claimed will depend on the particular circumstances – see Public Ruling BR Pub 97/9 in TIB Volume Nine, No.9. Section NF 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994 does not apply as the correct RWT was deducted from interest payments when made. Example 5 Facts the same as in example 4, except that the partial break occurs in a later income year. Insuffi- cient interest is payable at the time of the break to absorb interest to be recovered, but further interest is payable in that income year. On 30/06/X1 Interest payable$400 Less RWT$132 Net deposit in bank statement$268 On 31/12/X1 Interest payable$400 Less RWT$132 Net deposit in bank statement$268 RWT Certificate for year ended 31/3/X2 shows: Gross interest$800 RWT$264 Break on 4/4/X2 Interest payable (1/1/X1- 4/04/X2) 459 / 365 x 0.06% x 6,000$452.71 Less interest paid (1/1/X1-31/12/X1) 365 / 365 x 0.08% x 6,000($480.00) Negative interest to recover ($ 27.29) continued on page 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 16 On 30/06/X2 Interest payable 181 / 365 x 0.08% x 4,000$158.68 Less RWT$ 52.36 Net deposit in bank statement$106.32 On 31/12/X2 Interest payable 184 / 365 x 0.08% x 4,000$161.32 Less RWT$ 53.24 Net deposit in bank statement$108.08 RWT certificate for year ended 31/3/X3 shows: Gross interest $320.00 RWT $105.60 The payer will need to advise the depositor sepa- rately of negative interest of $27.29 arising in the year ended 31/3/X3. Although there is no require- ment for the depositor to perform a financial arrangement base price adjustment until full matu- rity of the term deposit, deductibility of this $27.29 may need to be considered separately under section BD 2(1)(b). The depositor must show the $800 gross interest in his/her tax return for the year ended 31/3/X2. There is an interest deductibility issue in the year ended 31/3/X3. The RWT certificate must show $320 gross interest, and the depositor must show that $320 gross interest in his/her tax return for the year. The depositor may claim a deduction for the $27.29 interest repaid, but the year in which that deduction is to be claimed will depend on the circumstances – see Public Ruling BR Pub 97/9 in TIB Volume Nine, No.9 for details. Section NF 6 of the ITA 1994 does not apply as the correct RWT was deducted from interest payable when made. All payers should ensure that they are recording the correct term deposit interest information on all tax deduction certificates. Non-compliance could result in a deficiency in RWT being paid to Inland Revenue, which could incur a shortfall penalty under the compliance and penalties rules. Prize draws in lieu of interest Some payers have deposit accounts that not only pay interest on the deposit but also give the depositor a chance to win a prize draw (i.e. cash, goods or services). RWT cannot be deducted from the prize won by a depositor or from any interest foregone by depositors who invest in such accounts. However, depending on the contract/conditions under which the deposit is made the depositor may be liable to return for tax purposes the value of any benefit from money advanced – section CE (1)(b). This would be in addition to the tax liability on any interest received. See Tax Information Bulletin Volume Two. No.3 for details. Purchases of securities from residents Resident withholding income includes interest paid on money lent, including redemption payments. Interest includes any return on money lent, excluding the repayment of the original capital. RWT should be deducted from the interest element of all redemption payments made by payers to New Zealand residents on the purchase or maturity of securities issued by the payer e.g., certificates of deposits and commercial bills. Conversion of RWT deducted in foreign currencies When converting any RWT deducted in foreign currency section NF 2(3)(b) of the Act states that, ...the amount of resident withholding tax deduction made by the first person \[i.e. the payer\] shall be converted into New Zealand currency at the close of trading spot exchange rate on the first working day of the month succeeding the month in which the resident withholding tax deduction is made. (emphasis added) Payers should ensure that they are correctly converting RWT deductions made in a foreign currency. Tax deduction certificates should show the resident withhold- ing income and the RWT in New Zealand dollars. RWT tax deduction certificates Section 25 of the TAA requires all payers who deduct RWT to issue tax deduction certificates in the prescribed form. These certificates must be issued to the recipients by 20 May following the end of the relevant year. Section 25(3) allows a recipient to request a tax deduc- tion certificate from the payer at any time during the relevant year. All certificates issued must contain all the necessary information as specified in section 25(6). Note that for interest paid on or after 1 April 1999 additional information must be shown on the certificate. Section 54 of the TAA requires all payers to provide to Inland Revenue details of all recipients of resident withholding income. This is generally done by filing the appropriate IR 15 forms or by an approved electronic format, by 31 May in the year after the RWT was deducted – section 51 TAA. It is in the payer’s interest to have adequate procedures and systems that ensure that: •tax deduction certificates issued to recipients include all interest paid from all the payer’s products, e.g. term deposits, saver accounts, etc •total resident withholding income and RWT on the individual IR 15 certificates reconcile with the amounts shown on the annual reconciliation statement (IR 15S). Further RWT information For further RWT information please see our guide RWT on Interest – Payer’s Guide (IR 283) – available from Inland Revenue offices or our website at http://www.ird.govt.nz/resource/publicat/index.htm. from page 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 17 Non-resident withholding tax Calculation Section NG 2 details the non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rates to apply when a person derives non- resident withholding income that is liable for NRWT. However, those rates can be varied by double tax agreements that New Zealand has with various countries. Payers’ systems and procedures must be able to calculate and deduct NRWT at the correct rates set out in section NG 2 or the appropriate double tax agreement. Purchases of securities from non-residents Non-resident withholding income includes interest derived by a non-resident on money lent. NRWT at the appropriate rate should be deducted from the interest element of all redemption payments paid to non-resi- dents on the purchase or maturity of securities issued by the payer. Conversion of NRWT deducted in foreign currency When NRWT is deducted in a foreign currency, the deduction should be converted into New Zealand dollars before payment to Inland Revenue. The legislation is silent on how/when the conversion should be made to New Zealand currency, but Inland Revenue’s policy on this matter is that the conversion should be at the exchange rate which applied on the day the NRWT was deducted. The NRWT legislation calls for the NRWT deduction to be made at the time the non-resident withholding income is paid, and to be paid to Inland Revenue by the 20th of the following month. Any payers who are not already complying with this method should seek advice from the Non-Resident Centre, Dunedin, phone 03 467 7020. Interest payments to related parties overseas If a payer conducts its business in New Zealand through a NZ resident company and pays interest to an overseas parent company (or to an overseas related party com- pany), NRWT should be deducted from the interest payment. Approved issuer levy is not an option if the interest is paid to an associated person – section NG 2(1)(b)(i). Further NRWT information For further NRWT information see our guide Non- Resident Withholding Tax – Payer’s Guide (IR 291) – available from IRD offices or our website at http://www.ird.govt.nz/resource/publicat/index.htm. Approved issuer levy Application Two steps must take place before a payer pays approved issuer levy (AIL): •Inland Revenue must have approved the payer as an approved issuer (Section NG 6 of the Act) •The payer must have registered with Inland Revenue all the securities on which the zero rate of NRWT is to be applied (Section 86H, Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971). To apply for registration contact the Inland Revenue Non-Residents Centre in Dunedin. Payers should ensure that the appropriate registration has been made for each security or class(es) of security. Payment of AIL Before the payment of interest, the payer and the non- resident deriving the interest must agree whether AIL applies. The agreement should be in writing to prevent later disputes, and cannot be made after the event. AIL is a charge on the payer and so should not be deducted from the interest paid to the recipient. If the cost of the AIL is to be recovered from the recipient, it should be shown as a fee or a charge. If there is no agreement before payment that AIL will apply then NRWT should be deducted. AIL cannot apply to the interest that is derived by a person who is an associated person of the payer. In such cases the NRWT rules apply. Section 86K of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act (SCD Act) 1971 requires the AIL to be paid monthly to Inland Revenue by the 20th of the month following the month interest was paid. If a payer fails to account for AIL by the due date to Inland Revenue, NRWT must be de- ducted by the payer in all cases (section 86I of the SCD Act and section NG 2(1) of the Income Tax Act). However, section 86M of the SCD Act provides for relief in cases when the payment was not made by due date due to circumstances beyond the payer’s control. It is important that all payers correctly calculate AIL and pay it to Inland Revenue by the due date. If NRWT has to be applied to interest payments on which AIL has not been accounted for by the due date, it may involve a significant increase in the payments required by the payer to Inland Revenue, including late payment penal- ties, shortfall penalties and use of money interest.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 18 Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding public ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. How- ever, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. Available subscribed capital – energy companies Calculation for successors to electric power boards and municipal electricity departments Summary Under the Energy Companies Act 1992 (“the ECA”) and establishment plans approved under that Act, the energy undertakings of: •Electric power boards (“EPBs”) were vested in successor energy companies, the successor energy companies issued shares, and the EPBs were dis- solved. •Municipal electricity departments (“MEDs”) were transferred to successor energy companies and those successor energy companies issued shares. For the purposes of determining the amount of available subscribed capital (“ASC”) of the successor energy companies, this statement concludes that ASC arises from the issue of shares on the corporatisation of the successor energy companies to the EPBs or MEDs. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Background ASC is generally the amount of capital contributed by shareholders to a company. In certain circumstances a distribution of ASC on the acquisition, redemption, or other cancellation of shares, or on the liquidation of a company, is excluded from the definition of “dividends” and may therefore be distributed tax-free to the share- holders. The energy companies were generally corporatised because of the requirements of the ECA. There were a number of ways that new energy companies were formed. This interpretation statement applies to energy companies formed in any of the following ways: •the corporatisation of an MED or MEDs •the corporatisation of an EPB or EPBs •the combined corporatisation of an EPB or EPBs and an MED or MEDs. Because the effect of corporatisation on the level of ASC for shares issued on corporatisation was not clearly identified or specified, doubt has arisen as to whether such shares have given rise to any ASC. This interpreta- tion statement concludes that in respect of the shares issued on corporatisation, ASC arises from their issue. There are three different fact situations discussed in this item regarding the issue of shares by the new energy companies. These are: •The recipient of the shares was the transferor of the energy undertaking. That is, a local authority trans- ferred an MED to a new energy company in return for an issue of shares to the local authority. •The recipient of the shares was not the transferor in circumstances where a local authority transferred an MED to a new energy company in return for an issue of shares to third party recipients. •The recipient of the shares was not the transferor in circumstances where an EPB’s undertaking was vested in a new energy company and an issue of shares was made to third party recipients. Legislation Section OB 1 defines ASC. The relevant portion of the definition states: “Available subscribed capital”, in relation to a share in a company at any relevant time, means the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula in respect of all shares of the same class (referred to in this definition as the “specified class”) as the share: a + b – c where – ais – (i)In the case of any company which existed before 1 July 1994, the transitional capital amount; and ... bis the aggregate amount of consideration received by the company on or after 1 July 1994 and before the relevant time in respect of the issue of all shares in the company of the specified class, including as consideration – (i)In the case of any bonus issue in lieu made on or after 1 July 1994, the amount of money or money’s worth offered as an alternative to such bonus issue; and IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 19 (ii)In the case of any taxable bonus issue (other than a bonus issue in lieu) made on or after 1 July 1994, the amount of the dividend arising in respect of the taxable bonus issue; and ... but not including – (v)Any amount in respect of a bonus issue other than a bonus issue to which paragraph (i) or paragraph (ii) of this item b applies; or ... cis the aggregate of amounts distributed – ... The “transitional capital amount” (“TCA”) is defined in section OB 1 as: “Transitional capital amount”, in relation to a share in a company at any relevant time, means the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: j + k x m l where – jis the aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 in respect of shares of the same class as the share (whenever issued and including the share), not being – (i)An amount paid up by a bonus issue made after 31 March 1982 and before 1 October 1988, except where – (A) The date of the acquisition, redemption, other cancellation, or liquidation falls more than 10 years after the date of the bonus issue; or (B) The amount was paid up by way of application of any amount of qualifying share premium; or (C) The relevant time is the time of liquidation of the company; or (ii)An amount paid up by a bonus issue (other than a taxable bonus issue) made on or after 1 October 1988, except where the amount was paid up by way of application of any amount of qualifying share pre- mium; and kis the aggregate of qualifying share premium paid to the company before 1 July 1994 in respect of shares of that class (whenever issued and including the share), not being an amount subsequently (but before 1 July 1994) applied to pay up capital on shares in the company; and lis the number of shares of that class (including the share) ever issued before the close of 30 June 1994; and mis the number of shares of that class (including the share) on issue at the close of 30 June 1994: “Bonus issue” is defined in section OB 1 as: “Bonus issue”, in relation to a company, means – (a)The issue of shares in the company; or (b)The giving of credit in respect of or forgiveness of the whole or part of the amount unpaid on any shares in the company – where the company receives no consideration (other than an election by the shareholder not to receive money or money’s worth as an alternative to the issue) for the issue, crediting, or forgiveness, except to the extent to which, in respect of any issue or crediting on or before 20 August 1985, such issue or crediting was excluded from the meaning of the term “bonus issue” in accordance with subsection (3) or subsection (4) of section 3 of the Income Tax Act 1976 as those subsections applied from time to time before their repeal by section 31(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.5) 1988: The former definition of “bonus issue” in section 3(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 read: “Bonus issue” means a capitalisation of any amount available for capitalisation, being a capitalisation by way of – (a)The allotment of fully paid-up or partly paid-up shares in the company; or (b)The giving of credit in respect of the whole or part of the amount unpaid on any shares in the company, – except to the extent to which, in respect of any such capitalisation completed on or before the 20th day of August 1985, such capitalisation was excluded from the meaning of the term “bonus issue” in accordance with subsection (3) or subsection (4) of this section as those subsections applied from time to time before their repeal by section 31(1) of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.5) 1988: “Qualifying share premium” (“QSP”) is defined in section OB 1 as: “Qualifying share premium” in relation to any company, means any premium paid (whether in money or money’s worth) by any shareholder or former shareholder to the company in respect of the issue of share capital by the company at a premium, being a premium that – (a)Was credited to a share premium account in the books of the company or, where the company has been taken over by another company or merged with another company, in the books of that other company; and (b)Did not arise with respect to the issue of shares in one company as consideration for the acquisition of shares in any other company, whether by one transaction or a series of transactions: Application of the legislation ASC is calculated “in relation to a share in a company ... in respect of all shares ... of the same class as the share”, and is generally a summation of consideration received and paid out in respect of those shares. The calculation therefore requires: 1.the share and class of shares to be determined. 2.the consideration received or paid out in respect of those shares to be ascertained. Determining the “share” and the “class of shares” at issue “Share” is defined in section OB 1 as including “any interest in the capital of a company”. In relation to the calculation of ASC for the energy companies the concern is with the shares in the new energy companies. Because ASC is calculated “in relation to” a share, it is important to determine the point at which the shares in the energy companies are created. Before this point there can be no transactions “in relation to” the share. continued on page 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 20 “Shares of the same class”, in sections CF 3 to CF 5, section FC 4, and this section, in relation to shares of a company, means any 2 or more shares of the company where – (a)The shares carry the same right to exercise voting power... The definition is concerned with any “2 or more shares \[interests in the capital\] of the company”. Its purpose is to designate which shares can be considered together for the purpose of calculating the relevant ASC. Shares “of” the company means that the shares to be compared must be currently existing shares in the company. We are concerned with comparing any shares in the ETOs with the shares in their successor energy companies. Even assuming that the ETOs had shares, the EPBs were deemed to be dissolved by operation of section 47(2)(a) of the ECA. Therefore, shares in the EPBs do not coexist with shares in their successor energy companies, and thus cannot be shares of the same class as shares in the successor energy company for these purposes. The MEDs were entities created by statute and with perpetual existence. They were not owned by anyone and no one had any interest in their capital in the ordinary sense. However, section OC 2(5)(a) did deem the “elected members of the energy trading operator, in their collective capacity as such, ... to hold shares in the energy trading operator”. Therefore, while there may still be deemed shares in the MEDs, those shares cannot be shares of the same class as the shares in their successor energy companies because they do not carry the “same rights”. The deemed shares in the MEDs carry no particular rights, while the shares in the successor energy companies carry very specific rights. None of the rights, if they exist, attached to deemed shares in the MEDs can therefore be called the “same rights” as those attaching to the shares in the energy companies (it is noted that this conclusion applies equally to all ETOs). It follows that the class of shares relevant to the calcula- tion of ASC in relation to a share issued by an energy company on its corporatisation, under the ECA and an approved establishment plan, is confined to shares of the same class issued on or after incorporation. The class of shares having been determined to this extent, it is possible to turn to ascertaining the relevant amounts of “consideration” received or paid out for them. Ascertaining the relevant amounts of TCA and “consideration” received in respect of the shares issued by the energy companies on their corporatisation To ascertain the relevant amounts received or paid out in respect of the shares issued by the energy companies during the corporatisation process, being the “specified class” for purposes of the definition of ASC, it is necessary to apply the definition’s calculation formula “a + b – c”. As this interpretation statement is concerned solely with any amounts arising on the issue of the The shares in the energy companies were issued on corporatisation under sections 32 and 33 of the ECA and under terms contained in an approved establishment plan. These shares were new shares. They were not a modified re-issue of shares in the energy trading opera- tors (“ETOs”). (“ETOs” is a convenient way of describ- ing both EPBs and MEDs.) Therefore, any transactions in relation to shares in the ETOs are not transactions in relation to shares issued on the corporatisation of the energy companies. The calculation of ASC in relation to a share issued on the corporatisation of the energy companies is, therefore, confined to transactions arising on or after a share’s issue under the ECA and the approved establishment plan. Furthermore, a “share” must be a share in “a company”. The energy companies are clearly companies and their predecessor ETOs were also companies: in terms of the broad definition of that term contained in section OB 1 and/or because they were deemed to be companies by operation of section OC 2(5) (section OC 2 was the tax regime for ETOs). However, for the purposes of the definition of ASC the reference is to “a company”. “A company” is clearly a reference to a single company, and this is reinforced by the references to “the company” in relation to each of parts “a”, “b” and “c” of the calculation of ASC. Since “a company” means a single company, the ETOs and their successor energy companies are clearly not “a company”. They are separate companies. Accordingly, in the absence of legislative intervention, the calcula- tion of ASC for the energy companies ordinarily would take no account of any matters relating to the ETOs. However, there are two possible sources of legislative intervention that may be argued to cause the ETOs and their successor energy companies to be treated as a single company when calculating ASC: 1.The amalgamation provisions in the Act. However, these do not apply because there is no “amalgama- tion” as that term is defined in section OB 1. Conse- quently, the amalgamation provisions do not affect the analysis outlined above. 2.Sections 54 and 62 of the ECA deem the EPBs and the MEDs respectively to be “the same person” as their successor companies for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts. Since the ETOs and their successor energy companies are deemed to be the same person, the ETOs and their successor energy companies constitute “a company” for purposes of the ASC definition. It follows that transactions involving shares in an ETO may be relevant to the calculation of ASC in respect of a share in an energy company, if the shares in the ETO and the shares in the energy company are “shares of the same class ... as the share”. “Shares of the same class ... as the share” The section OB 1 definition of “Shares of the same class” commences: from page 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 21 shares, variable “c” (amounts distributed by the com- pany) may be ignored for present purposes and this leaves variables “a” and “b” to be considered and determined. Variable “a” of the ASC amount Variable “a” of the formula is the TCA or nil, depending on whether the company existed before 1 July 1994. Most of the energy companies were established before 1 July 1994. It is therefore necessary to calculate the TCA for those energy companies that were so estab- lished. For those energy companies not established before 1 July 1994, “a” has a nil value. The TCA is calculated according to the formula “j + k x m” l Variable “j” is the aggregate of capital paid up before 1 July 1994. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether the shares in the energy companies were “paid up” when they were issued. “Paid up” and “capital paid up” are not defined in the Act. However, the courts have considered the meaning of “fully paid up” in the context of shares. In Bloomenthal v Ford \[1897\] AC 156; \[1895-9\] All ER Rep 1845 (HL) Lord Halsbury LC stated (at page 1849 of the All ER Rep report): People who know anything about limited liability companies know that there is a certain liability upon their shares, and that from time to time the company calls up such and such a proportion of the money due upon those shares, and I should have thought that without being a lawyer, or discussing questions which have been raised in the courts, a person would ordinarily understand that fully paid-up shares mean shares upon which the whole amount that could be called had been called up. That is the meaning of “fully paid-up shares”, and in strictness it is the only meaning. The question is whether consideration was given, in money or money’s worth, for the shares issued by the energy companies on their corporatisation such that they are “paid up”. Share recipient was the transferor of the ETO: Local authority transfer of an MED in return for shares issued to the local authority In some cases the recipients of the shares issued by the energy companies on their corporatisation gave “money or money’s worth” for those shares. In particular, for some local authority transferors of MEDs to new energy companies, the transfer was carried out pursuant to an agreement for sale and purchase, by which the transferor agreed to sell the ETO to the new energy company in consideration for an issue of shares to that transferor. In such cases the consideration given (the ETO) led to the issue of shares, and meant that the new company had an amount of paid up capital for the purposes of the defini- tion of TCA. Share recipients were not the transferors of the ETO: EPB’s undertaking being vested in the new energy company, and shares being issued to third parties In other circumstances the recipients of the shares did not themselves give money or money’s worth for the issue of shares to them, but consideration was still given for the shares by the transferor of the ETO. There is no requirement in the definitions of ASC or TCA that consideration for the shares be given by the recipient. If a local authority transferred an ETO to an energy company and the shares issued by the energy company were received by third parties, and when an EPB transferred an ETO to an energy company and the shares issued by the energy company were received by third parties, there is still consideration provided to the new energy company sufficient to cause capital to be “paid up” for the purposes of the ASC and TCA definitions. This is discussed in more detail in the following para- graphs. Sections 18, 22, 47, 48 and 56 of the ECA establish that the ETO transferred to the new energy company was consideration for the shares consequently issued by that particular company. Section 18 dealt with establishment plans. Section 18(2) set out the required details to be included in an establish- ment plan. Amongst other things, such an establishment plan had to: •identify with reasonable precision the energy under- taking that was to be vested •value that energy undertaking •contain a share allocation plan •indicate whether or not any equity securities should be issued by the relevant energy company to any person consequent upon the vesting in the company of the relevant energy undertaking. Section 22 of the ECA provided for the formation of a share allocation plan. Under section 22(1), the establish- ment plan should set out the recommendations as to the persons to whom the voting equity securities in the relevant energy company should be allocated conse- quent upon the vesting in that company of the relevant energy undertaking. In both these sections of the ECA the use of the words consequent upon demonstrates that the issue of shares results from the receipt of the energy undertaking. The ordinary meaning of “consequent” supports this conclu- sion. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines “consequent” as •consequence •following as an effect or result •following as a logical conclusion; and •the second part of a conditional proposition. The word “consequence” is defined by the same diction- ary to mean: •a thing or circumstance which follows as an effect or result from something preceding; •the action, or condition of so following; the relation of a result to its antecedent. continued on page 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 22 Summary of situations where the share recipients were not the transferors of the ETO The sections discussed above mean that the transfer of an energy undertaking to a new energy company leads to the issue of the shares pursuant to the share allocation plan. That is, the transfer of the undertaking is consid- eration for the shares, sufficient to mean that paid up capital arises on the transfer. Those energy undertakings that were transferred were transferred as consideration for the issue of the shares to the subscribers. In respect of EPBs this is also brought out under section 48(3)(a) which provides that the company shall, on the date specified in the Order in Council that vests the undertaking in the new company, issue to the person specified in the Order in that behalf, and as fully paid up, the shares specified. Although the use of the word “as” could suggest that the shares are not really paid up, in this context this is not the appropriate interpretation. That is, in the interpreta- tion of the ECA, the word “as” does not mean “as if something was that which it was not”, which is the way the word “as” was interpreted in the statute in issue in Styles v Treasurer of Middle Temple (1899) 4 TC 123; 68 LJQB 1046 (CA). If this had been the intention of Parliament, it could have used the words “as if they were”. Examples of recent legislation using such a formulation include section 42(3) of the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (“as if it were a caveat”) and section 176(4) of the Employment Contracts Act 1991 (“as if it were a collective employment contract”). Although the word “as” has a number of meanings (see The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary for examples), in this situa- tion it most probably means “in the manner that” or “in the way that”. It may be that the word is even superflu- ous and should be interpreted as having no meaning other than to make the legislation read better. Section 48(3)(a) envisages that the shares issued to the subscribers are fully paid up, the consideration for paying up the shares being the provision of the energy undertaking. Section 48(1)’s use of the word “conse- quent” underlines the point. In the context of shares issued under the Companies Act 1955 (which had a par value) and taken together with the requirement in an establishment plan to value the undertaking, the require- ment that shares be issued as fully paid up means that at the very least the par value of the shares issued must equal the value of the undertaking. The valuation sets the consideration given by the EPB to the new energy company for the paying up and issue of the shares. It would be possible for the value of the undertaking to exceed the par value of the shares issued. In such a case the shares would be being issued at a premium. How- ever, it is clearly envisaged in the Act that the amount of share capital issued will not be greater than the value of the undertaking. In those circumstances the shares would only be partly paid up, and shareholders would poten- tially be liable to further calls by the company. Therefore, the use of the word “consequent” supports the conclusion that the issue of shares followed from, and as a result of, the vesting of the EPB’s undertaking in the new energy company. That is, the statute provided that the vesting was the consideration for the issue of shares. Sections 47 and 48 of the ECA provided certain rules for the transfer of EPBs to successor energy companies. Section 47(1) provided that on a date appointed by the Governor General by Order in Council, the undertaking of the EPB named in the Order was to vest in the EPB’s successor company and all of the shares held by that EPB in the EPB’s successor should vest in such persons as were specified in the Order, which should give effect to the provisions of the establishment plan. Under section 48(1), every Order in Council made under section 47(1) would specify the kind, number, nominal value, and terms of any equity securities that were to be issued by the successor company consequent upon the vesting in it of the undertaking of the Board and the names of the persons to whom those equity securities were to be issued. Again, both sections link the undertaking being vested in the new energy company and the shares being issued to those persons specified in the establishment plan and share allocation plan. Share recipients were not the transferors of the ETO: Local authority transfer of a MED to a new energy company in return for shares being issued to third parties Even for the transfer of MEDs to new energy compa- nies, which do not have the same detailed rules as for EPBs, section 56 of the ECA still provided a link between the transfer of the undertaking and the issue of shares when those shares were issued to a third party. Under section 56(1), the local authority would transfer its energy undertaking no later than 1 April 1993 to one or more energy companies. Under section 56(2), this transfer must be pursuant to an approved establishment plan. An approved establishment plan had to include a share allocation plan. The share allocation plan was to explain who was going to receive shares after the energy undertaking was transferred to the new energy company. In this context section 18(2)(b), that required a valuation of the energy undertaking prior to transfer, is relevant. If there was no connection between the transfer of the undertaking and the issue of shares, it is difficult to see why any valuation would be necessary. However, if one considers that the transfer of the undertaking led to the issue of shares pursuant to a share allocation plan, then the use of a valuation becomes very relevant. The value of the undertaking would set the value of the share capital, and the amount of consideration provided for shares issued to subscribers, and would determine how many shares of a particular nominal value are to be issued, or whether shares are issued at a premium. from page 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 23 Turning to variable “k” of the TCA, the exclusion cannot apply because any capital raised on the incorpo- ration of the energy companies would be the only capital available at the time the original shares in the energy companies were issued. That capital could not have been “subsequently applied” at that time, and this interpreta- tion statement is only concerned with ASC arising from the initial issue of shares by the energy companies on their corporatisation. The question is, therefore, whether any QSP was paid to the energy companies before 1 July 1994 in respect of their issues of shares on corporatisation. The definition of QSP refers to any “premium paid ... in respect of the issue of share capital ... at a premium”. Some energy company share issues were, according to the terms of issue, made at a premium. Accordingly, where such an issue was made at a premium there will be an amount for item “k” of TCA. Conclusions in relation to the TCA The better view is that ETOs were provided as consid- eration for the issue of the shares on the basis of the scheme of the ECA, the Vesting Orders, and for local authorities and MEDs the terms of the relevant Agree- ments for Sale and Purchase. This means that the shares issued by energy companies established before 1 July 1994 on their corporatisation were issued “paid up”, and in some circumstances a premium was “paid” in respect of them. As a result, a TCA arises from the initial issues of shares by energy companies established before 1 July 1994. Variable “b” of the ASC amount for those energy companies established on or after 1 July 1994 This interpretation statement is only concerned with ASC arising in relation to the initial issues of shares by the energy companies. Therefore, this part of the discus- sion is only relevant to initial issues of energy company shares made on corporatisation on or after 1 July 1994. Variable “b” is concerned with the aggregate “considera- tion” received for shares of the specified class. “Consid- eration” is not defined for this purpose and thus it is necessary to consider the common law meaning. Lord Dunedin said of consideration in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co Ltd v Selfridge & Co Ltd \[1915\] AC 847 at 855: I am content to adopt from a work of Sir Frederick Pollock ... the following words as to consideration: “An act or forbear- ance of one party, or the promise thereof, is the price for which the promise of the other is bought, and the promise thus given for value is enforceable.” The common law meaning of “consideration” may be seen as having a contract law focus and be referring only to the consideration passing between contracting parties. This would not cover all the circumstances surrounding the creation of the energy companies, where some shareholders were not contracting parties with the energy companies but were gratuitous recipients of shares. However, there is case law that suggests that consideration can have a wider meaning where the context so requires, such that the focus is on the receipt of consideration by the energy company, rather than on the provision of consideration by shareholders; Central and District Properties Ltd v IRC \[1966\] 2 All ER 433 (HL) and Shop and Store Developments Ltd v IRC \[1967\] 1 All ER 42; \[1966\] TR 357 (HL). This is consistent with variable “b” which refers to “considera- tion received” by the company, the focus being on the company’s receipt of consideration not the shareholders’ provision of consideration. The context surrounding the creation of the energy companies (discussed above in respect of variable “a”) also supports a wider interpreta- tion of “consideration” in variable “b” consistent with this case law. It is then a factual question whether consideration is received as the price for shares and, as with ascertaining whether shares are paid up, this is generally to be determined from the terms on which the shares were issued. Apart from reflecting differences of terminology arising from the enactment of the Companies Act 1993, the terms of issue of the initial share issues made by energy companies established on or after 1 July 1994 were no different from those for energy companies established before that date. Accordingly, for the same reasons as discussed above for pre-1 July 1994 energy companies, consideration was provided either by the share recipients or by third parties, and hence the energy companies did receive consideration for the issue of shares. It follows that the initial share issues made by energy companies established on or after 1 July 1994 were issued for consideration, giving rise to an amount for item “b” of ASC. Bonus issues Amounts in respect of bonus issues are generally excluded from variables “a” (TCA) and “b” of ASC. “Bonus issue” is defined in section OB 1, and before that it was defined in section 3(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Whichever definition is applied to energy compa- nies established before 1 July 1994, the issue of shares on corporatisation of those companies did not amount to bonus issues. In terms of the Income Tax Act 1976 definition, there is no bonus issue because there were no capitalisations of amounts available for capitalisation. As a new company, there were no such amounts available (for example, there were no retained earnings or capital revaluation reserves to capitalise). In terms of the section OB 1 definition, there is no bonus issue because the energy companies received consideration for the issue of shares, as discussed earlier in this statement. For post-1 July 1994 energy companies, the section OB 1 definition does not apply because, as discussed above, the energy companies received consideration for the issue of shares. continued on page 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 24 For a local authority transferor of an MED to a new energy company, where third parties were the recipients of the shares in the new energy company, the MED was given as the consideration for the issue of the shares. Although the point is not so clear as in the case where the MED was the recipient of the shares, the terms of the relevant provisions of the ECA support this conclusion. If an EPB’s undertaking was vested in a new energy company, where third parties were the recipients of the shares in the new energy company, the vesting of the undertaking was consideration for the issue of the shares. Although the point is not as clear as transfers involving MEDs, the terms of the relevant provisions of the ECA support this conclusion. In no case did the share issues amount to bonus issues. Conclusions Consideration was provided to energy companies for the issue of shares in those companies, sufficient to mean there was “capital paid up” or “consideration received” for the purposes of the ASC definition. Accordingly, items “a” or “b” of the ASC definition are positive amounts reflecting the value of the energy undertaking transferred to, or vested in, the new energy companies. For a local authority transferor of an MED to a new energy company, where that local authority was also the recipient of the shares in the new energy company, the MED was clearly given as consideration for the issue of the shares. from page 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 25 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

PAYE refund to payer or insurance agent TRA 98/10 Decision date: 29 January 1999 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: PAYE refund, right to funds Summary Judge Barber held that the Department had acted correctly in refunding the $24,626.86 to a company rather than crediting it to the taxpayer’s 1997 income tax account, or paying or crediting it to the taxpayer in any way. Facts The taxpayer entered into an agreement with a life insurance company (“the company”) in July 1996, by which he became a life agent of the company. By means of a Special Agreement the company agreed to advance to the taxpayer the sum of $74,626.86 as compensation for loss of income and client base associated with the taxpayer joining the company. In the Special Agreement the company was described as the “Lender” and the taxpayer was described as the “Borrower”. Consistent with the terms of the Special Agreement referring to the advance as “taxable earnings”, the company deducted a sum of $24,626.86 which it paid to Inland Revenue as PAYE. As such, the taxpayer re- ceived a net amount of $50,000 from the company. Later the relationship between the taxpayer and the company began to sour. The company attempted to terminate the Special Agreement and seek repayment of the advance of $74,626.86. In the end the advance between the company and the taxpayer was restructured by virtue of a Loan Agree- ment dated 17 January 1997; the effect being that the company agreed to loan the taxpayer the amount of $74,626.86. The company purported to terminate the Loan Agreement about two weeks later and sought to recover the full amount of $74,626.86 from the taxpayer. The PAYE of $24,626.86 was received by Inland Revenue before the end of the 1997 income year as it was paid by the company as part of its routine PAYE and withholding payments. There was some confusion within the company as to whether or not the amount had been paid to Inland Revenue. In spite of this uncertainty the company issued a PAYE deduction certificate to the taxpayer on 26 March 1997, which included the $24,626.86 in the total PAYE deductions and the $74,626.86 in the total gross earnings. When his contract with the company was terminated the taxpayer was in early and constant communication with Inland Revenue seeking to have the $24,626.86 forth- with repaid to him. The company also wanted the money back because on further consideration it felt that its payment to the taxpayer was capital in character or, if not, the $24,626.86 had been paid before it became due as tax because, as at July 1996, the $50,000 paid by the company to the taxpayer was a loan. After considering the options Inland Revenue refunded the $24,626.86 to the company. Subsequently the taxpayer went through the disputes resolution process and issued a notice of claim in the TRA seeking to recover the $24,626.86 from Inland Revenue. He claimed that the money belonged to him and so should have been credited to him and not refunded to the company. Decision His Honour found that the payment in issue should never have been made to Inland Revenue and, when that was understood, Inland Revenue was obliged to return it to the payer (the company); and that Inland Revenue never had any authority to credit the disputed payment to the taxpayer’s account or anything of that kind and it never did so. His Honour stated at page 5 of the decision: “There can be no doubt from the documentation that, at all material times, there was nothing more than a loan of $50,000 continued on page 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 26 Judge Barber also found that the company did not link the payment to the taxpayer but simply added it in to a global payment to Inland Revenue representing source deductions for all its employees. As the payment was made in this way it did not create any obligation on Inland Revenue to pay the money to the taxpayer. There was no transferring by Inland Revenue of funds from one taxpayer’s account to another. Inland Revenue received an excessive payment from the company and, when it had ascertained the amount of the excess, it repaid that excess to the payer. There was a simple overpayment by the company so that Inland Revenue was required to return it to the payer. The money was never in the taxpayer’s “account” with Inland Revenue. between \[the company\] and the taxpayer. In due course that loan was to change its character to net income and the conse- quential tax liability was, by agreement between the claimant and the life company, to be payable by the life company. In fact the life company had anticipated that liability and made the potential tax payment of $24,626.86 in July 1996. This was well ahead of any need to do so and, in fact, due to subsequent facts whereby the loan never converted to income, it was unnecessary to have ever done so. It is self-evident that a loan cannot be income of any kind, so that the advance by the life company of a loan to the claimant could not be or require a source deduction payment.” from page 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.2 (February 1999) 27 Due dates reminder March 1999 5Large employers: PAYE deductions and deduction schedules for period ended 28 February 1999 due. 7Provisional tax and/or Student Loan interim repay- ments: first 2000 instalment due for taxpayers with November balance dates.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.3 (March 1999) 3 General interest items Proposed GST changes – discussion document The Government’s latest tax policy discussion docu- ment, GST: A Review, sets out proposed changes to the law arising from a recent review of GST legislation. The discussion document was released earlier this month by Treasurer Bill Birch and Revenue Minister Bill English. The review has highlighted several areas where change may be needed – to reduce compliance costs, bring the law up to date with developments in the commercial world, ensure that it does what it was intended to do, and close loopholes that lead to loss of revenue. Proposed changes include: •Raising the GST registration threshold from $30,000 to $40,000 a year. This would allow 25,000 entities – both individuals and small businesses – to stop accounting for GST if they so wish. Other GST thresholds would also be raised. •Improving the rules for adjusting GST to reflect private use of business assets. •Strengthening anti-avoidance legislation to stop people structuring transactions in such a way as to gain tax advantages. •Tightening the rules on GST refunds, especially in relation to secondhand goods. •Preventing zero-rating of services consumed in New Zealand but contracted for overseas. An example would be educational courses provided here but paid for by non-resident parents. •Introducing numerous clarifications of the law in key areas such as financial transactions and software. The closing date for submissions is 30 April, except for the proposal concerning zero-rating of services con- sumed in New Zealand but contracted for overseas. Its deadline is 26 March, since the Government has said it wants to introduce the necessary legislation into Parlia- ment as soon as possible. The proposed changes are described in detail in the discussion document. It is available from Bennetts Government Bookshops and on the Inland Revenue Website at www.ird.govt.nz. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.3 (March 1999) 4 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Notice of proposed adjustment – new coversheet Sections 3 and 89F, Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction Notices of proposed adjustment (NOPAs) must be accompanied by an IR 210 coversheet when filed. This is to allow Inland Revenue to identify them more readily and deal with them in a timely manner. Background A new process for resolving tax disputes has applied since 1 October 1996. The role of the NOPA within this process is to notify that an adjustment to an assessment is required. It formally initiates the disputes resolution process. The Tax Administration Act currently prescribes what must be included in a NOPA. There is no requirement for a particular form to be completed, but a form (IR 210) is available from Inland Revenue for this purpose. However, the information required can vary considerably depending upon the nature of the adjust- ment required, so taxpayers and their agents often prefer to file the NOPA in the form of a letter. These letters have not always been correctly identified as NOPAs when they arrived at Inland Revenue, causing problems with the disputes resolution time limits. New requirement The definitions of NOPA in section 3 and section 89F have been amended to require that NOPAs be accompa- nied by the IR 210 coversheet. This amendment applies from 1 April 1999. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.3 (March 1999) 5 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council.

Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming.

These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Judicial review – reassessment without prior notice immediately before statute bar New Zealand Wool Board v CIR- Judicial Review Decision date: 9 March 1999 Act: Judicature Amendment Act 1972 Keywords: Judicial review, abuse of power, notification Summary The NZ Wool Board’s judicial review application against the Commissioner concerning its 1990 assess- ment was upheld. Facts The New Zealand Wool Board (“the Board”) invested $100 million in redeemable preference shares (RPS) which were part of a larger mandatory convertible note (MCN) tax avoidance scheme, included in the Winebox documents. Inland Revenue reassessed the Board's 1990 return just before the statute bar in March 1995, to include its income from this investment. The Board applied for judicial review of the assessment, claiming that the process constituted an abuse of power on three grounds: •The assessment was made without notice or dialogue, to which the Board had a legitimate expectation in the circumstances. •The assessment was made without adequate inquiry of the Board’s position, especially in relation to its knowledge of the larger tax avoidance arrangement. •The assessment was made for the improper purpose of countering highly publicised criticism of the IRD in Parliament and in the Winebox Inquiry. Decision Adequacy - Durie J said the test is whether in the circumstances of a particular case the Commissioner has acted fairly towards the taxpayer and made an honest judgement. In this case the questions were, first, whether the Commissioner had before him sufficient information for an honest judgement, and second, whether, in the circumstances, he ought to have inquired further. Durie J found that the Commissioner should have sought the Board’s view on its understanding of the alleged indicators of avoidance in the investment proposal document, and by not doing so, he exposed himself to bringing into account matters extraneous to the Board when reassessing it. Therefore there was not an honest judgement in the administrative law sense and an abuse of power in the administration of process. Legitimate expectation - His Honour found that the combination of circumstances gave rise to a legitimate expectation of notice and discussion in this case – the prior settlement of the Board’s tax liability at the conclusion of an audit, the open process adopted in that audit, and the Board’s ostensible lack of knowledge of the use to which its investment would be put and the commonality of discussion in avoidance and reconstruc- tion cases. Improper purpose - His Honour said that the essential question is not whether there was an improper motive in assessing, but whether an improper motive influenced the process when effecting an assessment and whether as a result that process was unfair to the taxpayer. He suggested that the Commissioner’s submission to the Winebox Inquiry that investors in MCN transactions might be reassessed, in combination with a failure to notify the taxpayer, was designed to assist in alleviating public criticism for failure to recover without challenge from the Board. He found that the Commissioner’s failure to notify the Board was “explicable only in terms of the winebox pressure” and that, in considering the proper course to take, “the Commissioner’s mind was directed more to the inquiry and less to the taxpayer who ought to have been his primary consideration”. As a consequence he upheld the claim of improper purpose. The Department and counsel are considering whether to appeal the decision IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.3 (March 1999) 6 Sole trustee – whether licensed gaming machine operator Dick v CIR: Vocation Education Foundation Decision date: 11 February 1999 Act: Gaming Duty Act 1971 Keywords: Gaming licence, society Summary The sole trustee of a trust was found not to be a “soci- ety” for gaming licence purposes, and therefore to be an unlicensed gaming machine operator. Facts This was an appeal from a decision in the Commission- er’s favour at the TRA (reported as Case S28 (1995) NZTC 7,194). The issue was whether the sole trustee of a trust came within the definition of “gaming machine operator” for the purposes of section 12B of the Gaming Duties Act 1971. The taxpayer argued that as a sole trustee she could not be “a society” but as a licensed holder (on the basis she was a “society” for the purposes of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977) she was not a person conducting dutiable games without a licence. Decision The Judge accepted the TRA conclusion that the trustee of herself was not an association of persons such as to constitute a society. But the Judge also accepted that, as the trustee was not a society, the licence the trust held was invalid as the Minister had no statutory authority to issue licences to persons other than societies. At page 7 of the judgment: “I do not consider it inappropriate in the present context to interpret “licence” in terms of the second limb of the definition as meaning valid licence. However I am of the view that a similar result can be achieved without reading any words into the statute. In terms of section 8 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, the only form of licence the Minister is authorised to grant is a licence to a “society” which has applied for it. It follows that the only possible licence which could be contemplated in the definition of gaming machine operator is a licence issued to a society. As it is now conceded that the appellant is not a society, then the licence issued to the appellant was not a licence to a society as contemplated in the definition.” The Judge concluded, from this, that the trustee was unlicensed and caught by the second limb of section 12B. Judicial review – money seized under section 400 Moti Singh v CIR – judicial review Decision date: 17 February 1999 Act: Income Tax Act 1976/Judicature Amendment Act 1972 Keywords: money seized, improper purpose Summary The Commissioner seized funds under a section 400 compulsory deduction notice, and retained them pending the outcome of a TRA case that was likely to have penal tax consequences. The Court held that this was not an improper purpose for retaining the funds. Facts The applicant prepared and filed income tax returns for others. He claimed false refunds in his own returns and also in his client’s returns. He kept all of the false refunds. On 4 November 1992 the Commissioner issued default assessments in relation to the false refunds and also imposed additional tax. The applicant objected to the assessment and requested that a case be stated for hearing before the Taxation Review Authority. On 4 November 1994 the Commissioner served a section 400 compulsory deduction notice on the appli- cant and seized $86,894.04 from the applicant’s bank accounts. On 12 December 1994 the Commissioner amended the applicant’s tax assessment and this reduced the tax owing by the applicant. The applicant objected to this assessment also and requested that a case be stated for hearing by the Taxation Review Authority. The applicant requested that the Commissioner refund him the difference between the amount of the second assess- ment and the amount seized as a result of the section 400 notice. The Commissioner refused to do so. This decision was communicated to the applicant by letter dated 28 February 1995. On 8 June 1995 the applicant was convicted on 66 charges of filing false returns of income. On 6 July 1995 the applicant was convicted on six charges of theft in respect of refunds of tax made to others who were entitled to receive refunds. The Commissioner then assessed the applicant for a substantial sum of penal tax, to which the taxpayer also objected. The Commissioner also commenced civil proceedings in the High Court to recover the false refunds made to the applicant. The applicant made the present judicial review application in relation to the Commissioner’s decision not to refund the balance of the monies held. Decision Justice Laurenson prefaced his decision by observing IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.3 (March 1999) 7 Motel purchase – whether going concern TRA 95/26, Decision 002/99 that if the applicant was unsuccessful in his objection to the Taxation Review Authority then any question of a refund sought under section 400 would be effectively disposed of. Conversely, if the applicant was successful in his objection then he would be entitled to whatever refund that the Taxation Review Authority decided was appropriate. Either way, (and this point was conceded by the applicant) the outcome of the present judicial review application, in terms of any order leading to a refund, would be futile. Justice Laurenson rejected a submission by the applicant that the Commissioner’s decision of 28 February 1995 was for an improper purpose. The anticipated penal tax (contingent on the outcome of the Court decisions regarding the filing of false returns) would increase the tax owed by the applicant to a figure larger than the monies seized from the taxpayer’s bank account. The Commissioner was correct to take this into account. Justice Laurenson also found that the Commissioner had not seized the monies alleged to provide security for his civil claim. Finally, Justice Laurenson found that the Commissioner genuinely believed that the section 400 deduction constituted an actual or potential tax liability. Justice Laurenson rejected a submission by the applicant that the Commissioner had failed to take into account relevant considerations or had taken into account irrelevant considerations. His Honour found that the Commissioner had two reasons for retaining the money. Firstly, the Commissioner was of the view that the applicant’s potential tax liability would be equivalent to the amount of the monies seized when the penal tax was finally assessed. Secondly, the Commissioner wanted to have the question of the ownership of the monies determined by the Courts. Justice Laurenson stated that if the secondary reason had been the sole reason for the Commissioner’s decision to retain the seized money then it would be difficult to see such an objective providing a proper basis for retaining the monies. However, in terms of Poananga v State Services Commissioner \[1985\] 2 NZLR 385 (CA) there was a duality of purpose here and the intention to retain the monies to have the Courts determine the ownership was a secondary consideration. The decision was made and could be properly justified in terms of revenue collection principles. The Commis- sioner would have been obliged to make the decision he did without any reference to a wish to preserve the monies pending the outcome of the prosecutions. This was the dominant purpose and the secondary considera- tion was simply an incidental advantage. Justice Laurenson made some obiter comments about the needs of public administration and the exercise of a duty of care to third parties by the Commissioner at this point. The third issue was whether the Commissioner had breached any legitimate expectation by his actions. Justice Laurenson held that there had been no conduct by the respondent which could have created a legitimate expectation in the mind of the applicant in the present case. The fourth issue was whether the Commissioner had acted unreasonably in making his decision. Justice Laurenson stated that the Commissioner’s decision was property formed within the statutory framework avail- able to the Commissioner and accordingly the decision was not unreasonable. Justice Laurenson concluded that there was no basis for interfering with the Commission- er’s decision. Decision date: 9 March 1999 Act: Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords: Going concern, prior agreement with Commissioner, estoppel Summary A motel purchased by the objectors was found to be a going concern, because at time of sale all the elements of a going concern were present, and the objectors ex- pressed nothing to the contrary at that time. Further, the objectors’ claim for estoppel on the basis of prior agreement with the Commissioner was not held, due to a lack of evidence of such an agreement. Facts The objector partnership claimed an input tax credit of $33,333.34 in the period ending February 1993, relating to the purchase of a motel by the objector partnership. The vendors issued a tax invoice marked “going con- cern” and have not returned any GST on the sale. The objector partnership has argued that the sale was not of a going concern. Initially the Commissioner rejected this contention and took the view that the sale was of a going concern. He subsequently changed his mind made a refund. Follow- ing further investigations he again changed his position and reassessed the objectors on the basis that the sale was of a going concern and that no input refund was payable. Decision Judge Willy found in favour of the Commissioner on both issues. In regards to the estoppel point His Honour found that, on the facts of this case, the objector partner- ship had not made out any agreement with the Commis- sioner which compromised their claim or estoppel. Should those facts have existed, however, jurisdiction continued on page 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.3 (March 1999) 8 buildings and the items set out in the Agreement for Sale and Purchase of a Business, all of the structure necessary to the running of a motel were present at the point of transfer of the assets. His Honour was satisfied that the vendors intended to sell this business as a going concern and the purchasers did not stipulate to the contrary. It was capable of being operated as a motel at the point of sale and it was in fact operated as such by the purchas- ers. Finally there is no express agreement to the contrary to be found in either of the written documents entered into between the parties. Funds injected by Government – whether payment for services provided by trust Chatham Island Enterprise Trust v CIR Decision date: 10 March 1999 Act: Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords: Consideration for supply Summary The Court held that funds paid by Government to set up a trust to administer former Crown activities in the Chatham Islands were nor consideration for a supply, because the Trust made no supplies to the Crown. Facts The Chatham Islands Enterprise Trust came into exist- ence after concern over a number of decades regarding the responsibility and financial liability for essential services required by Chatham Islands residents. The Crown wished to remove itself from the role of provider and consequently established an Interim Board to look at possible solutions. It was decided that the Crown would establish a trust, the appellant. At the heart of the plan was the injection of money which would ensure the infrastructure was retained and that the commercial operations could be developed from that point forward. The Government agreed to pay $8 million in two instalments and the transfer the Crown assets. In anticipation of this transfer, work was ongoing in setting up companies which were to take over the Crown assets, facilities and rights relating to the meat works, electricity system, airport facilities and likewise from the Chatham Islands County Council, plus the wharf facilities. Five companies were established. The Commissioner charged GST on the payment by the Government of $8 million, on the basis that this was consideration for the supply of services by the Trust. The Commissioner was successful in the High Court. Heron J held that the payments totalling $8 million were for a host of services to be supplied by the Trust. The Government wanted to step out of a difficult position, which required supervision, expenditure and ultimate responsibility and accountability. Into its shoes stepped the Trust, which took over a multitude of responsibilities and obligations and undertook to co-ordinate and effect a replacement structure, quite different from the arrange- ment which proceeded it. Hence the payments were made for a variety of services and were received in consideration for the Trust providing those services. As to Counsel’s respective argument involving section 5(6D) Heron J held that given his earlier conclusion that the Trust was conducting a taxable activity, the Commis- sioner must succeed under section 5(6D)(a) or (b). The further requirement that such activities be carried on continuously or regularly was met by the multitude of tasks to be performed and sustained by the Trust in return for the monetary consideration. Decision Held by Keith J and Blanchard J: The Trust did not make a supply of anything to the settlor in exchange for, or induced by, the payments; it was the recipient of an endowment to be held upon the terms of the deed. Nor can it be said that the Trust performed services for the benefici- aries in return for a consideration by the settlor. It acts on their behalf and in their interests. They are benefited by its activi- ties. In the broadest sense, therefore, it may be said that because it serves their interests it is performing services for them. But there is no consideration passing to the Trust since the payments were not properly to be seen as inducement. Held by Tipping J: The money was not paid for any particular purpose and cannot be said to be in respect of or for the inducement of any services. The payments were not in response to the supply of any services. With the use of the money not in any way related to any particular purpose and not in any way circumscribed or mandated, I do not consider the relationship between the payments and the (assumed) services fulfils the definition of consideration. As a consequence, the trustees did not make the (assumed) supply of services in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. exists to enforce an agreement between the Commis- sioner and the taxpayer quantifying the taxpayer’s liability at an agreed sum – see IRD v Nullall, Auckland Gas Company v CIR, dicta in Miller v CIR, National Bank of New Zealand Limited v CIR, Golden Bay Cement Co. Limited v CIR. In regards to the going concern issue His Honour stated that in the end it comes down to a question of fact. He found that at the date of the transfer of the land and from page 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.3 (March 1999) 9 Film loss – whether a tax avoidance arrangement TRA 98/5, Decision 003/99 Decision date: 12 March 1999 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Film loss claim, sham, tax avoidance arrangement Summary Willy DCJ concluded that there was not a sham, nor was there a tax avoidance arrangement. Facts The Objector was a member of a film syndicate (“the Partnership”) and in the year ended 31 March 1985 he claimed the sum of $19,550 being his purported share of the losses incurred by the Partnership in the making of a film. The film was a pre-1998 budget film. Under the Com- missioner’s policy then in place the film’s cost of production was not allowed as a deduction, but was to be capitalised and then depreciated. The partnership claimed to capitalise as production costs the sum of $2,647,000. It then sought to depreciate that sum at the rate of 50% in the 1985 and 1986 tax years respectively. A proportionate share of the loss was claimed as a deduction by each contributing special partner. The Commissioner investigated the affairs of the Partnership, and reached the view that the film produc- tion costs were not in fact $2,647,000, but $933,000. In particular, the Commissioner considered that $1,560,000 related to the purported limited recourse loan, which he considered was not genuinely spent and that $267,000 really consisted of a circular and self-cancelling transac- tion, which, in his view, did not represent a part of the true cost of production. The Commissioner considered the above-mentioned sums to constitute shams. Alternatively the Commis- sioner considered that section 99 of the Income Tax Act 1976 applied. He also considered that insufficient evidence had been provided to substantiate the sums as being “production costs” and hence he exercised his discretion not to allow a depreciation deduction under section 108 of the Income Tax Act 1976. However, the Commissioner allowed the Objector to set off the sum of $6,840 (being part of the share of his losses in the making of the film) against other income. Decision Willy DCJ was satisfied on the evidence that the loan advanced to the Partnership was spent on its behalf in paying a creative company for services which they provided to the Partnership towards making the film. He concluded that “this is plainly no more than a straight forward commercial transaction...”. The second sham argument related to the purported contribution by a production company of $267,000 to the Partnership capital. If the Commissioner was correct then the Objector, the accountant and the parties to the deed of accession were involved in either an act of gross negligence or a fraud on the investors. Willy DCJ did not find any evidence which supported this conclusion. Having held that the liability of the investors on the loan was real and subsisting and that the transaction was not a sham, his Honour considered that the section 99 argu- ment had lost all force. Finally, Willy DCJ held that there was no factual basis to support the Commissioner’s belief that the cost of the film was only $933,000. Accordingly the Commissioner did not exercise his discretion lawfully when he disal- lowed the depreciation claims.

If you find that you prefer the TIB from our website and no longer need a paper copy, please let us know so we can take you off our mailing list. You can e-mail us from our website. Online TIB (HTML format) •This is the better format if you want to read the TIB on-screen (single column layout). •Any references to related TIB articles or other material on our website are hyperlinked, allowing you to jump straight to the related article. This is particularly useful when there are subsequent updates to an article you’re reading, because we’ll retrospectively add links to the earlier article. •Individual TIB articles will print satisfactorily, but this is not the better format if you want to print out a whole TIB. •All TIBs from January 1997 onwards (Volume Nine, No.1) are available in this format. Online TIB articles appear on our website as soon as they’re finalised – even before the whole TIB for the month is finalised at mid-month. This means you can read the first of any month’s TIB articles on our website in the last two weeks of the previous month. Printable TIB (PDF format) •This is the better format if you want to print out the whole TIB to use as a paper copy – the printout looks the same as this paper version. •You’ll need Adobe’s Acrobat Reader to use this format – available free from their website at http://www.adobe.com •Double-column layout means this version is better as a printed copy – not as easy to read on-screen. •All TIBs from July 1989 (the start of the TIB) are available in this format. The printable TIB appears on our website at mid-month, at the same time as we send the paper copy to the printers. This means you can get a printable TIB from our website about two weeks before we can post you a paper copy. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 3 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Foreign currency amounts – conversion to NZ currency The tables in this item list exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency under the controlled foreign company (CFC) and foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for the 12 months ending 31 March 1999. The conversion rates for the first six months of each income year are published in the Tax Information Bulletin following the end of the September quarter, and the rates for the full 12 months rates at the end of each income year. To convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for any country listed, divide the foreign cur- rency amount by the exchange rate shown. Table A Use this table to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •branch equivalent income or loss under the CFC or FIF rules under section CG 11(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •foreign tax credits calculated under the branch equiva- lent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994 •FIF income or loss calculated under the accounting profits, comparative value (except if Table B applies) or deemed rate of return methods under section CG 16(11) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Key x y xis the exchange rate on the 15th day of the month, or if no exchange rates were quoted on that day, on the next day on which they were quoted. yis the average of the mid-month exchange rates for that month and the previous 11 months. Example 1 A CFC resident in Hong Kong has an accounting period ending on 31 December 1998. Branch equivalent income for the period 1 January 1998 to 31 December 1998 is 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (HKD). HKD 200,000 ÷ 4.1717 = NZ$47,942.09 A similar calculation would be needed for a FIF using the branch equivalent or accounting profits methods. Example 2 A taxpayer with a 31 March balance date purchases shares in a Philippines company (which is a FIF) for 350,000 pesos on 7 December 1998. Using the comparative value or deemed rate of return methods, the cost is converted as follows: PHP 350,000 ÷ 21.2667 = NZ$16,457.65 Alternatively, the exchange rate can be calculated by averaging the exchange rates “x” which apply to each complete month in the foreign company’s accounting period. Example 3 A CFC resident in Singapore was formed on 21 April 1998 and has a balance date of 30 Novem- ber 1998. During this period, branch equivalent income of 500,000 Singapore dollars was derived. (i)Calculating the average monthly exchange rate for the complete months May-November 1998: (0.8839 + 0.8696 + 0.8842 + 0.8777 + 0.8908 + 0.8666 + 0.8885) ÷ 7 = 0.8802 (ii)Conversion to New Zealand currency: SGD 500,000 ÷ 0.8802 = NZ$511,613.63 Table B Table B lists the end of month exchange rates acceptable to Inland Revenue for the 12 month period ending 31 March 1999. Use this table for converting foreign currency amounts to New Zealand dollars for: •items “a” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the income year) and “c” (market value of the FIF interest on the last day of the previous income year) of the comparative value formula •foreign tax credits paid on the last day of any month calculated under the branch equivalent method for a CFC or FIF under section LC 4(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Example 4 A New Zealand resident with a balance date of 31 December 1998 held an interest in an FIF resident in Thailand. The market value of the FIF interest at 31 December 1998 (item “a” of the comparative value formula) was 500,000 Thailand baht (THB). THB 500,000 ÷ 19.2550 = NZ$25,697.28 Note: If you need an exchange rate for a country or a day not listed in these tables, contact one of New Zealand’s major trading banks. Round the exchange rate calculations to four decimal places wherever possible.

tax disclosure exemption ITR10 Introduction Section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) requires people to disclose interests they hold in foreign entities. Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). Under section 61(2), the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption which applies for the income year ended 31 March 1999. This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR10”, and the full text appears at the end of this item. Scope of exemption The scope of the 1999 disclosure exemption is the same as the 1998 exemption. Interests held by residents Disclosure is required by residents for these interests: •an interest held in a FIF •an “income interest of 10% or greater” held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. An “income interest of 10% or greater” is defined in section OB 1 of the ITA. For the purposes of determin- ing exemption from disclosure it includes these interests: 1.an income interest held directly in a foreign company 2.an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company 3.an income interest held by an associated person (which is not a controlled foreign company) as defined by section OD 8(3) of the ITA. Example If a husband and wife each hold an income interest of 5% in a Cayman Islands company, the interests would not be exempt from disclosure because the husband and wife are associated persons under section OD 8(3)(d). Under the associated persons test they are each deemed to hold the other’s interests, so they each hold an “income interest of 10% or greater” which must be disclosed. They are not required to account for attributed foreign income or loss under the controlled foreign company rules. However, they would have to account for FIF income or loss under the FIF rules. In this example the husband and wife must disclose their interests as interests in a foreign company and as interests in a FIF. However, only the FIF interests should be disclosed on an IR 4H series form (see “Overlap of interests” below). Foreign company interests A resident who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the company’s country of residence. The 1999 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence, and any interest in a foreign company which is an “income interest of 10% or greater” must be disclosed. Disclosure is to be made on form Interest in a Foreign Company Disclosure Sched- ule (IR 4G). The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company for these reasons: •attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFC’s country of residence. •to identify tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign com- pany which is resident in a Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction (i.e., Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Norway, United King- dom and the United States of America). •the requirement for a CFC which is resident in a country not listed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1993. Foreign investment fund interests An interest in a foreign entity must be disclosed if it constitutes an “interest in a foreign investment fund” specified within section CG 15(1) of the ITA. These types of interest must be disclosed: •rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (e.g., a unit trust) •an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannua- tion scheme •an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy •an interest in an entity specified in Schedule 4, Part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press). However, any interest that does not fall within the above types or which is specifically excluded as an interest in a IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 11 FIF under section CG 15(2) does not have to be dis- closed. The following are listed in section CG 15(2) as exemptions from what constitutes an interest in a FIF: •an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a CFC •an interest in a foreign company that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specified in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA (i.e., Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, Nor- way, United Kingdom and the United States of America). •an interest in an employment-related foreign superan- nuation scheme •a qualifying foreign private annuity, unless an election has been made to remain within the FIF regime, by the due date for filing the person’s 1999 tax return. See Inland Revenue’s booklet Overseas Private Pensions (IR 258A) for more information. •interests in foreign entities held by a natural person, if the aggregate cost or expenditure incurred in acquiring the interests remains under $20,000 at all times during the income year •an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible to New Zealand currency •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme acquired by a natural person before he or she became a New Zealand resident for the first time, for a period of up to four years. There is more information on exemptions from the FIF rules in Inland Revenue’s booklet Foreign Investment Funds (IR 275B). A resident who holds an interest in a FIF at any time during the 1999 income year must disclose the interest and calculate FIF income or loss on the form Interest in Foreign Investment Fund Disclosure Schedule and Worksheet (IR 4H). The FIF rules allow a person four options to calculate FIF income or loss (accounting profits method, branch equivalent method, comparative value method and deemed rate of return method), so the Commissioner has prescribed five forms under the IR 4H series to disclose and calculate FIF income or loss from an interest in a FIF using one of the methods. Overlap of interests A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an interest held in a FIF. However, to meet the disclosure obligations only one disclosure return (either form IR 4G or the appropriate IR 4H series form) is required for each interest a person holds in a foreign entity. Here are the general rules for determining which disclo- sure return to file: 1.Use the appropriate IR 4H series form to disclose all FIF interests, and in particular: •an interest in a foreign company which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country and is not a CFC (regardless of the level of interest held) •an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme, regardless of the country or territory in which the entity was resident. 2.Use the IR 4G or IR 4GS form to disclose an “in- come interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign com- pany (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on the appropriate IR 4H series form. Disclosure is not required on either forms IR 4G or IR 4H for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not a FIF interest. An example is an interest which is excluded under the Schedule 3, Part A exemption of the FIF rules. Interests held by non-residents The 1999 disclosure exemption excludes the need for interests held by non-residents in foreign companies and FIFs to be disclosed. This would apply for example to an overseas company operating in New Zealand (through a branch) in respect of its interests in foreign companies and FIFs. The purpose of the international tax rules is to make sure that New Zealand residents are taxed on their share of the income of any overseas interests they hold. However, under the international tax rules non-residents are not required to calculate or attribute income under the CFC regime (section CG 6(1) of the ITA 1994). In addition, under section CG 16(4) of the ITA 1994 a non-resident is not to be treated as deriving or incurring any FIF income or loss. The disclosure of non-residents’ hold- ings in foreign companies or FIFs is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules. Summary The 1999 international tax disclosure exemption re- moves the requirement of a resident to disclose an interest held in a foreign company (if the interest is not also an interest in a FIF) that does not constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater” (i.e., it is less than 10%). The disclosure exemption is not affected by the foreign company’s country of residence. Further, an interest in a FIF must be disclosed. The 1999 disclosure exemption also removes the requirement for a non-resident to disclose interests held in foreign companies and FIFs. Text of determination on page 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 12 Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR10” 1. Reference This exemption is made under section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies in relation to which any person is not re- quired to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 1999. This exemption does not apply to interests in foreign companies which are interests in foreign invest- ment funds, unless that interest is held by a non-resident of New Zealand. 2. Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 3. Exemption (i)Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company (not being an interest in a foreign investment fund), in the income year ending 31 March 1999, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year, unless the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater”, as defined by section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company. (ii)Any non-resident person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund in the income year ending 31 March 1999, is not required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that interest and that income year if either or both of the following apply: •No attributed foreign income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign company by virtue of section CG 6(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, and/or •No foreign investment fund income or loss arises in respect of that interest in that foreign invest- ment fund by virtue of section CG 16(4) of the Income Tax Act 1994. This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This exemption is signed on the 1st day of April 1999. Max Carr National Manager, Corporates Local authority trading enterprise definition Introduction The Local Government Amendment Act 1999 amends the definition of local authority trading enterprise (LATE) to remove non-business charitable organisations from the definition of LATE. The Act also simplifies the definition of LATE for both accountability and tax purposes. Background In 1989 the Local Government Act 1974 was amended to permit councils to establish LATEs. It was intended that these council-controlled businesses would face the same commercial pressures as any other firm – including the requirement to pay tax. However, it became apparent that, because of the very broad legal meaning of ‘char- ity’, most activities carried out by LATEs could be structured to obtain tax-exempt status. Section 3 of the Taxation Remedial Provisions Act 1998 was thus enacted to prevent LATEs from obtaining income tax exemptions under section CB 4(1)(c), (e) and (j). However, it became clear that because of the broad definition of LATE, a number of non-business charities would lose their tax-exempt status. This was an unin- tended effect. As a result, the application date for section 3 of the Taxation Remedial Provisions Act 1998 was deferred until 1999-2000 income years so that the definition of LATE could be reviewed. Key features •The definition of LATE in the Local Government Act 1974 has been amended to include only (i)a company that is directly or indirectly controlled by one or more local authorities; or (ii)an organisation that is directly or indirectly controlled by one or more local authorities where the organisation carries out a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit. •Local authorities will need to control 50% or more voting rights to obtain control of a company or an organisation. In addition, local authorities may obtain control of an organisation by obtaining the right to appoint half or more of the trustees, directors or managers of the organisation. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 13 •The definition of LATE in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 has also been amended to include, in addition to LATEs as defined in the Local Govern- ment Act 1974, council-controlled holding organisa- tions that control a LATE. Application dates The amendments to the Local Government Act apply from 1 April 1999 and the amendments to the Income Tax Act apply from the 1999-2000 income year. Detailed analysis The Local Government Amendment Act 1999 amends the current definition of LATE in the Local Government Act 1974, which provide that LATEs must satisfy certain accountability requirements. For these accountability purposes a LATE means: (i)A company in which equity securities carrying 50% or more of the voting rights at a meeting of the shareholders of the company are – (A)held by 1 or more local authorities; or (B)controlled, directly or indirectly, by 1 or more local authorities; or (ii)An organisation that – (A)operates a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit; and (B)is subject to significant control, directly or indirectly, by 1 or more local authorities;... The definition of ‘significant control’ applicable to the definition of LATE has also been amended so that it now reads: “Significant controls” means, in relation to an organisation, – (a)control of 50 percent or more of the votes at any meeting of the members or controlling body of the organisation; or (b)the right to appoint half or more of the trustees, directors, or managers (howsoever described) of the organisation, – whether or not jointly with other local authorities or persons. (emphasis added) The Act also amends the definition of LATE in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. This is the definition applicable for tax purposes and it states that: Local authority trading enterprise means – (a)A local authority trading enterprise (as defined in section 594B of the Local Government Act 1974): (b)An organisation (as defined in section 594B(2) of the Local Government Act 1974) that – (i)is subject to significant control (as defined in section 594B (2) of that Act), directly or indirectly, by 1 or more local authorities; and (ii)has significant control (as so defined), directly or indirectly, of a local authority trading enterprise within the meaning of paragraph (a):... The tests for identifying a LATE vary depending on whether the entity is a company or an organisation. Company Under the amended definition of LATE in the Local Government Act 1974, a company is a LATE if one or more local authorities hold or control, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of the voting rights at a meeting of the company. There is no requirement that a company must carry out a trading undertaking. This requirement is subsumed under the company structure. It is assumed that if local authorities set up a company, their intention must be to use that company to carry out a trading undertaking for the purpose of making a profit. This assumption is largely consistent with the other provisions of the Local Government Act 1974. Under that Act, local authorities are often required to carry out certain trading undertak- ings (such as providing transport services) using a company structure. A company that is not a LATE under the Local Govern- ment Act 1974 will not be a LATE for tax purposes. Non-company organisation Under the amended definition of LATE in the Local Government Act 1974, a non-company organisation (other than a committee of local authorities) is a LATE if: •one or more local authorities have control of 50% or more votes at a meeting of the members or controlling body of the organisation; or •one or more local authorities have the right to appoint half or more of the trustees, directors, or managers of the organisation, whether or not jointly with other local authorities or persons; and •it operates a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit. Control The definition of LATE envisages two ways that local authorities may obtain control of an organisation. In addition to obtaining control by obtaining 50% or more voting rights at any meeting of the organisation, local authorities may control an organisation (such as a joint venture) by obtaining the right to appoint half or more of the trustees, directors or managers of the organisation. Trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit The amended definition clarifies that a local authority controlled organisation is a LATE only if it operates a ‘trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit’. From a policy perspective, the term ‘operates a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit’ is analogous to ‘running a business’. Support for this interpretation can be found in the definition of continued on page 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 14 However, a holding organisation may be a LATE for tax purposes. The definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides that an organisation will be a LATE if: (a)it is controlled by one or more local authorities; and (b)it controls a LATE as defined in the Local Govern- ment Act 1974. The definition in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 contemplates that a holding organisation that controls a business entity is effectively a LATE even though it does not carry out a business directly. The revenue risk of not recognising the holding organisation as a LATE is significant, as income derived by the holding organisation from the business entity could then be directed back to the local authorities without being taxed. This outcome would have been inconsistent with the intention of taxing local authorities on all income they derive from their LATEs, regardless of the form it is returned to them. LATEs and income tax exemptions The amended definition of LATE for tax purposes will apply from the 1999-2000 income year to coincide with the application date of section 3 of the Taxation Reme- dial Provisions Act 1998. Together these provisions ensure that a LATE will not be able to obtain the charitable and district improvement income tax exemp- tions under sections CB 4(1)(c), (e) and (j) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Under the amended definition of LATE, a non-business charitable organisation will not be a LATE. The organi- sation may continue as a tax-exempt entity as long as it continues to satisfy the statutory criteria of a charity. However, charitable companies and charitable business organisations that are controlled by the local authorities will remain as LATEs and, hence, lose their charitable income tax exemptions under sections CB 4(1)(c), (e) and (j). Fabric samples and fabric display stock Depreciation determination not to be issued In Tax Information Bulletin Volume Nine, No.5 (May 1997), we published a draft general depreciation deter- mination on fabric samples and fabric display stock. It proposed a general depreciation rate of 100%, based on an estimated useful life of one year, under both the “Shops” and “Textile, Garment and Carpet Manufactur- ing” industry categories. We received a number of submissions on the draft determination. As a result of those submissions, the Commissioner has decided not to issue the determination because of the variable life of each sample. Taxpayers have advised that these samples are only useful for as long as they have stock of the particular fabric. On that basis, the life of a sample may be as short as one month, or, occasionally, as long as two years. In most situations, it would seem that a sample has a useful life of less than twelve months. Any general depreciation rate must be one of the banded rates set out in Schedule 11 to the Income Tax Act 1994. Under that schedule, the maximum deprecation rate that can be set is 100%, which translates to an estimated useful life of one year. For the reasons outlined above this rate is not appropriate, and so the Commissioner has decided not to issue the determination. The circumstances of each case must dictate whether such samples can be fully deducted in the year the cost is incurred, or depreciated over a longer period. ‘business’ under the Income Tax Act 1994 and the ordinary meaning of business. Under section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, business is defined to include ‘any profession, trade, manufacture, or undertaking carried on for pecuniary profit’. However, as the term ‘trading undertaking’ is used throughout the Local Government Act 1974, it would not have been appropri- ate to substitute the phrase with a business test. At the practical level, whether an activity amounts to a business is an issue that has been widely tested at the court of law. To constitute a business, the activity must exhibit a number of characteristics. The leading case law in this area is Grieve v CIR (1984) 6 NZTC 61,682. The factors to be taken into account when considering whether the activity carried out by an organisation is a business are: •whether the actions of the organisation exhibits an intention to make a profit; •the nature of the activity; •the period over which the organisation engaged in the activity; •the scale of operations and the volume of transactions; •the commitment of time, money and effort; •the pattern of activity; and •the financial results. These factors, taken together, will determine whether an organisation carries out a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit. Holding organisation The definition in the Local Government Act 1974 precludes holding organisations (organisations that hold investment assets) from becoming a LATE, as they do not operate a trading undertaking with the intention or purpose of making a profit. Examples of organisations like these are community trusts that were set up by local authorities solely to hold strategic or investment assets. from page 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 15 Plastic growing trays Draft general depreciation determination We have been advised that there is no suitable general depreciation rate for plastic growing trays, used in the Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture industries for growing forestry seedlings. The trays are fed into a machine, and each cell is filled with the growing me- dium plus a seed. The trays are then placed into a controlled environment until the seedlings are mature enough to be transferred outside. The seedlings (and the trays) are constantly irrigated, and when kept outside are subject to UV radiation. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will insert a new asset class “Plastic growing trays, for producing forestry seedlings” into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category, with a depreciation rate of 33% D.V. (24% S.L.), based on an estimated useful life of 5 years. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rates are based on the estimated useful life set out in the determination and a residual value of 13.5%. General Depreciation Determination DEP\[X\] This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP\[x\]: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number \[x\]”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1998/1999 and subsequent income years. 2. Determination Pursuant to section EG 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 I hereby amend Determination DEP1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1 (as previously amended) by: •Inserting into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category the general asset class, esti- mated useful life, and diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rates listed below: EstimatedDV bandedSL equivalent useful lifedep’n ratebanded dep’n rate Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture(years)(%)(%) Plastic growing trays, for producing forestry seedlings53324 3. Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1994. If you wish to make a submission on the proposed changes, please write to: Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Adjudication & Rulings National Office Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON We need to receive your submission by 31 May 1999 if we are to take it into account in finalising the determination. FBT prescribed rate of interest for quarter starting 1 January 1999 The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low-interest employment related loans has been reduced. The new rate of 6.5% will apply for the quarter commencing on 1 January 1999 and subse- quent quarters. The prescribed rate, down from 6.94%, is a reflection of the fall in market rates. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 16 General interest items Trading stock: nursery plants The new legislation requires nursery plants that are trading stock to be valued at market selling value or using a cost valuation method. Difficulties in determin- ing market values or cost values meant that previously Inland Revenue accepted that immature plants that were not for sale could be valued at nil. Inland Revenue also accepted that mature plants which were grown by a nursery and which were valued under the cost option could be valued at 50% of the listed selling price. At this stage this remains the best available information for valuing these items on a cost or market basis and will continue to be accepted by Inland Revenue up to the end of the 1999-00 income year. Our administrative practice will be to accept the follow- ing valuations under the new trading stock regime for the 1998-99 and 1999-00 income years: •the market selling value of immature plants that are not for sale is nil; and •mature plants that are grown by the nursery and that are valued using a cost valuation method can be valued at 50% of the listed selling price. This administrative practice will ensure that compliance costs for growers are minimised until they have an opportunity to work through valuation issues with Inland Revenue. If taxpayers think that there are better methods to value their nursery plants using a cost valuation method or market selling value, they may use them. The consultation on calculating market selling value and cost will take place in this income year. Officials will work through the following details with the nursery industry: •how the market selling value of immature plants that are not for sale can be established •how immature and mature plants that are grown by the nursery can be valued at cost, or another cost valuation method such as discounted selling price. Growers or other interested parties who want to be involved with consultation on valuation issues for nursery plants may contact Jane Tait in the Policy Advice Division (ph 04 474 7182; fax 04 474 7217), PO Box 2198, Wellington, jane.tait@ird.govt.nz. Inland Revenue has received enquiries about the valua- tion of certain nursery plants that are trading stock. This item sets out our response. Background The new trading stock legislation enacted in November takes effect from the 1998-99 income year. The legisla- tion was enacted following extensive consultation with taxpayers, both on the proposals outlined in the Govern- ment discussion document on the proposed reforms and during the Parliamentary process. The discussion document indicated that the issue of whether trading stock should include trees and crops grown in the land would be considered at a later stage. It was envisaged that this review of the trading stock treatment of trees and crops would encompass a range of issues, including the valuation of plants that were trading stock. Such a review would, of course, involve consulta- tion with affected taxpayers under the generic tax policy process. The reference to crops in the discussion document prompted queries to Inland Revenue’s Policy Advice Division from nursery industry representatives. We told them there would be consultation with the nursery industry on any industry-specific changes to the tax treatment of trading stock. More recently, tax advisers and nursery plant growers have asked how nursery plants that are trading stock are to be valued for the 1998-99 year. Interpretation This item outlines Inland Revenue’s view as to how nursery plants should be valued under the trading stock rules for the 1998-99 and 1999-00 income years. This interpretation may be altered for the 2000-01 and future years as a result of consultation with the nursery plants industry this year. Trees and crops grown in the ground are considered to be part of the land and are therefore excluded from the definition of trading stock. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 17 Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Temporary shortfall: definition of later return period Section 141 I(3)(b), Tax Administration Act 1994: Temporary shortfall – reduction A tax practitioner has asked about the meaning of “later return period” as used in the definition of Temporary tax shortfall. Section 141 I states: 141I(3) \[Temporary tax shortfall\] A tax shortfall is a temporary tax shortfall for a return period if the Commissioner is satisfied that – (a)The tax shortfall has been permanently reversed or corrected in an earlier or later return period, so that (disregarding penalties or interest) the taxpayer pays the correct amount of tax or calculates and returns the correct tax liability in respect of the item or matter that gave rise to the tax shortfall; and (b)No tax shortfall will arise in a later return period in respect of a similar item or matter; and (c)No arrangement exists in any return period which has the purpose or effect of creating a further related tax deferral or advantage; and (d)The tax shortfall was permanently reversed or corrected before the taxpayer is first notified of a pending tax audit or investigation. If “later return period” in subsection (b) has the same meaning as in subsection (a) a taxpayer who makes a mistake in two consecutive periods before correcting the mistake would not be eligible for a temporary shortfall reduction because the same or similar shortfall has arisen in a later return period. This would mean that if a taxpayer makes the same or similar mistake twice before permanently correcting or reversing them, the shortfalls will not qualify as temporary and penalties will not be reduced. Inland Revenue considers that “later return period” in paragraph (b) refers to a return period arising after the review by the Commissioner. It is not intended to mean any return period arising after the period in which the shortfall first occurred. The Commissioner’s review is when he examines the temporary shortfall to satisfy himself of the various requirements prescribed in section 141I. Section 141I(3)(b) says that for the correction to be a temporary shortfall the Commissioner must be satisfied that no similar tax shortfall will arise in a later return period. The word “will” indicates that this subsection is referring only to future similar shortfalls – those occur- ring in a return period after the Commissioner’s review. We advised the practitioner that provided the mistake was permanently reversed or corrected before the Commissioner detected it and the Commissioner is satisfied that the same or similar tax shortfall will not arise after his review, the shortfall will be a temporary shortfall. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 18 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Insurance company’s share profits: revenue or capital CIR v National Insurance Company of New Zealand Limited Decision date: 22 March 1999 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Share purchase, diversification Summary The Court of Appeal did not overturn an earlier High Court decision that profits on a share sale by an insur- ance company were not assessable. Facts National Insurance Company of New Zealand Limited (“National Insurance”) is a fire and general insurer, carrying on business in New Zealand, Australia, and the Pacific Islands. In the early 1970s it began to look for opportunities to diversify into other businesses comple- mentary to its insurance business. It acquired 15% of the shares in Chase NZ in May 1972. These shares were swapped in 1982 for a 30% share in Southpac following the merger and reorganisation of NZI and South British. In late 1987-88 National Insurance sold its 30% share- holding of the issued capital of South Pacific Merchant Finance Ltd (Southpac) for $80m. Of this amount $40m was paid to National Insurance by way of two equal dividends. The profit on sale was $67,151,671.40. The shares had been acquired in December 1982. The Commissioner included the amount of the profit in National Insurance’s assessable income on the basis that the purchase and subsequent sale of the Southpac shares was part of the ordinary business of National Insurance. Alternatively the Commissioner considered that the profit was assessable under section 65(2)(e) second limb. A further alternative argument was that the Commis- sioner considered that the way in which National Insurance sold the shares was in contravention of section 99 of the Act. Decision Essentially the judgment of the Court is based on the findings of fact made by Williams J in the High Court. The Court was not convinced that the findings made by Williams were not open to be made by the Judge on the evidence before his Honour. •“\[54\] For the above reasons we are not taken to the point where it could be said that this Court should interfere with what ultimately were essentially find- ings of fact.” In respect of the first issue (section 65(2)(a)) •“\[42\] The Judge has not been shown to be wrong in his final conclusions under this head.” In respect of the second issue (section 65(2)(e)) In relation to the application of section 65(2)(a) (‘busi- ness profits’), the Court appeared to accept the applica- tion of the principles of law normally applying to this area (i.e Californian Copper Syndicate; Punjab Co- operative Bank Ltd; Auckland Savings Bank; Union Bank of Australia; Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Co; London Australia Investment Co), though with an important qualification. The qualification was that business of a bank or insurance company involves the investment in ‘readily realisable securities’. This is a significant departure from the banking and insurance cases which have held on more than one occasion, that profits derived from the sale of property (land and buildings) intended to be held long term or indefinitely, and held for more than 10 years, were assessable. The general principle was stated by the Court in para- graph 9 of the judgment as being ‘Whether the gains produced in a business are revenue or capital depends on the nature of the business and the relationship of the transactions producing the gain to the conduct of the business.’ This general principle is contained in the Court of Appeal decision in AA Finance Ltd v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,383 at 11,391. A major issue put to the court was the distinction between the phrases ‘diversification of business’ and ‘diversification of investment’. Williams J had not made a distinction between the two phrases in the High Court judgment. Williams J had in fact used the two phrases interchangeably. Despite direct submissions on the point, the Court of Appeal has provided no comment. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 19 In the course of the judgment, the Court reviewed the fac- tors relied on by Williams J and those put forward by the Commissioner. The Court found that the factors listed by Williams J were not compelling support for the question at issue. But despite this finding the Court considered that the judgment overall supported the conclusions arrived at by Williams J. As a key authority and for a discussion of the principles of law applicable, the Court referred to the National Distributors case with regards to section 65(2)(e) second limb. Under this head the Commissioner had argued that Williams J had not considered the different acquisitions of the Southpac shares individually. This was accepted by the Court, which found that Williams J had not been shown to be wrong. The various factors put forward by Williams J in the High Court judgment were considered by the Court. The one factor that appears to have been given greatest weight was the oral evidence of the witnesses that was ‘unshaken in cross-examination’. In respect of the cross-appeal, which the Court did not allow, their Honours stated that in their view all that needed to be said on this issue is that when a Court decides to take into account the amount of a party’s solicitor and client costs, the appropriate figure to use for that purpose is the amount actually payable by that party, including any GST component of that liability. The amount of the actual award will remain in the discretion of the Court in the usual way, and in exercis- ing that the Court can take into account all other relevant considerations. Timber cost: establishing deductible amount Tasman Forestry Limited v CIR Decision date: 24 March 1999 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Cost of “timber”, exchange, sale Summary The Court of Appeal held partially for the Commis- sioner. Their Honours held that “cost” equated to the amount paid for the shares which gave access to the forestry assets, the “cost of timber” is the proportion of the price paid for the shares allocated to the timber and exchange can be a “sale” for the purposes of section 74(5). Facts Tasman Forestry Limited (“Tasman”) is part of the Fletcher Challenge Group. In the income years ending 30 June 1986-90 it claimed a deduction for the cost of timber against income from the sale of that timber. The nature of the acquisitions varied. Firstly there were acquisitions by way of in specie distributions from companies liquidated by the objector in 1986. Tasman sought to include as the cost of timber for deduction against income received from subsequent sales of felled timber, an amount corresponding to the fair market value of the timber at the time of the in specie distributions. The value of the forests claimed was equal to the value of the shares in the companies which were liquidated. Secondly, there were acquisitions following exchanges with Elders Resources NZFP Ltd (“Elders”) in 1988. Tasman exchanged certain forests and preference shares held in another Fletcher company for forests owned by Elders. Tasman then sought to claim as the “cost” of forests the market value of the acquired forests. Thirdly, there was an in specie distribution in 1990 of the assets of Crista Holdings Ltd (“Crista”). Tasman had acquired the shareholding of Crista in 1988 for $105 million. Tasman then caused the assets of Crista to be revalued up to $169 million on the basis of fair market value. In 1989 Crista was liquidated and the assets distributed in specie to Tasman. Tasman then claimed as the “cost” of the Matahina Forest the amount of $169 million. Decision The Judgment of the Court of Appeal was delivered by Gault J. The Court held that section 74(2)(b) had two limbs and the first called for the identification of profits and gains from the sale of timber in the relevant year. Its focus is quite distinct from that giving rise to the cost of that timber for the purpose of reduction of the profit or gain in accordance with the second limb. The first limb has nothing to do with the means by which the timber was acquired and the cost to be ascertained under the second limb. Accordingly there is nothing in section 74(2)(b) that requires a sale transaction to enable a cost to be isolated. The Court agreed with Justice Laurenson in the High Court that section 74(5) is merely a machinery provision which is not the only means by which cost of timber can be identified. The Commissioner submitted that “cost” in section 74(2)(b) equated with expenditure and the appellant submitted that “cost” is to be equated with economic sacrifice and that the cost of acquisition was the eco- nomic value sacrificed to acquire the timber. The Commissioner’s submission was rejected. The Court stated that “profits or gains” in section 74(2)(b) is to be given its ordinary business meaning (CIR v Mitsubishi Motors New Zealand Limited \[1995\] 3 NZLR 513 at 515) and accordingly the word “cost” in the same sentence should also not be construed narrowly. continued on page 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 20 Loans acquired in business takeover: whether capital or revenue CIR v Wrightson Limited money’s worth, which Tasman had to give to acquire the timber. The cost to Tasman was the loss of the propor- tion of the assets transferred by it which represented the value of the timber acquired. The Court went on to state that they were not persuaded that the exchange was not a sale for the purposes of section 74(5). The Court therefore did not apply that aspect of the decision in V H Farnsworth v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,259. As obiter comment the Court stated that they were not convinced that the exchange transaction in question could properly be described as an exchange within the technical meaning of that term so as to distinguish it from the separate concepts of sale and barter. Decision date: 15 March 1999 Act: Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords: Acquisition of book debts, capital v revenue, assessable income Summary This was the Commissioner’s appeal from the High Court decision of Heron J. The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of Heron J and found in favour of the Commissioner. Facts Wrightson Limited (“Wrightson”) was part of the Fletcher Challenge group of companies. It provided a wide range of services to the rural community and operated through 40 rural service centres. The services it provided through these centres included the sale of goods (e.g. seeds, fertilisers, fencing materials), services as real estate agents/stock agents/auctioneers and credit and loan facilities to its customers. The credit and loan facilities related to both short-term credit on the purchase of goods and medium-long term loans to customers with security taken over assets owned by the borrowing customer. Wrightson also took money on call and term deposits, paying interest accordingly. Therefore, in many respects part of Wrightson’s activi- ties were similar to that of any ordinary lending institu- tion. In 1986 Wrightson acquired all of the rural services business of Dalgety Crown. At the time, Dalgety Crown was carrying on a business which was substantially the same as Wrightson, including the provision of credit and loan facilities to its customers. As part of the deal to acquire the rural services business of Dalgety Crown, Wrightson acquired debts with a face value of $117m at a cost of $104.3m. The High Court found that the accounts were purchased for the purpose of adding to the profit-making structure of Wrightson’s stock and station agency business and therefore the amounts subsequently recovered in excess of the cost of the debts were capital receipts. For the purposes of the appeal the Commissioner abandoned his argument under section 65(2)(e), third limb, and concentrated on section 65(2)(a). On its part, Wrightson conceded the point that they were in the business of money lending. Decision The Court of Appeal accepted Wrightson’s submission that, in the absence of a provision like section 85 dealing with a particular kind of asset, when an asset like stock in trade or a book debt is acquired as part of a capital transaction it is ordinarily to be treated as a capital item. Basically, it would appear to make no difference whether the acquirer is starting up a new business or supplementing an existing business. As long as the acquirer continues to operate the acquired business separately from its existing business, the gains or losses made on the trading stock are capital in nature. How- ever, if the retailer on acquiring the competitor’s new business immediately integrates it into its existing business and the purchase was made with that objective a different view can be taken. The Court was prepared to accept that if Wrightson had done no more than collect the debts on a separate ledger The Court held that in respect of the in specie distribu- tions the “cost” to Tasman in acquiring the forests was the amount paid for the company shares which gave access to the forestry assets. The appropriate proportion of that cost is to be treated as the cost of timber. The Court held that with regard to the Matahina forest the cost of the timber was that proportion of the price paid for the shares allocated to the standing timber. This differs from what Tasman claimed and the subsequent revaluation from $105 million to $169 million cannot be taken into account in the cost of timber for Tasman. The Court had no difficulty in holding that in the exchange transaction Tasman incurred a cost in the acquisition of the forests received. The transfer of forests and the allocation of shares was something of value, from page 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.4 (April 1999) 21 and applied the proceeds elsewhere in its business then the transaction would have retained a capital character in relation to the debts. The Court in Crompton v Reynolds & Gibson makes that clear. However, Wrightson in this case did not acquire the book debts without material change. They were revolving accounts and thus had fluctuating balances. They were intended to be turned into cash by collection in the ordinary operation of Wrightson’s business. Further advances were also made to meet the seasonal requirements of the former Dalgety clients. At page 10 of the decision Justice Blanchard stated: “When so appropriated to that business, which happened immediately, the debts became part of the taxpayer’s circulat- ing capital and repayments were then revenue receipts. They became part of the taxpayer’s money dealing activity. In the language of the President in AA Finance Limited ... the debts then “were part of the revenue earning process rather than additions to the profit-making structure.” As the appropriation was immediate the value adopted was that attributed for the purpose of calculating the price paid to Dalgety.” Thus the case of Crompton, so heavily relied upon by Wrightson, was distinguished and the appeal allowed.

IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 3 Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Parental Tax Credit – introduced as part of “Family Plus” tax assistance package TAXATION (PARENTAL TAX CREDIT) ACT 1999 The Taxation (Parental Tax Credit) Act introduced the concept of “Family Plus”, which incorporates the Family Tax Credit (formerly the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income), the Child Tax Credit (formerly the Independent Family Tax Credit), and a new Parental Tax Credit. The Parental Tax Credit will entitle low to middle- income working families to financial support of up to $1200 after the birth of a child. An estimated 26,000 families will be eligible to receive the Parental Tax Credit. Of these, about 90 percent are expected to receive the full $1200. Family Support will continue unchanged. Background The new Parental Tax Credit is designed to provide additional financial support to working families for the eight-week period following the birth of a child. It is the third element of the new, “Family Plus” package, which also comprises the Family Tax Credit (formerly the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income) and the Child Tax Credit (formerly the Independent Family Tax Credit). These tax credits are designed to give income support to low and middle-income working families. The new names of the tax credits will appear on Inland Revenue forms after 1 April 2000. The Independent Family Tax Credit first became available on 1 July 1996. It is directed at low and middle-income families who are not significantly dependent on the state for financial support. The Guaranteed Minimum Family Income tax credit has been available since 1986. Its purpose is to ensure that full-time earners with one or more dependent children receive a minimum family income. Key features of the legislation The main legislative amendments are to Part KD of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Parental Tax Credit will apply to births that occur on or after 1 October 1999. Entitlement begins from the date of birth and will be a maximum annual entitlement of up to $1200 for each newborn child. It is payable at the rate of up to $150 per week, per child for up to eight weeks (payments made fortnightly) paid directly into a bank account from the date the application is processed, or at the end of the income year. The Parental Tax Credit will raise the maximum family assistance income threshold, and so increase the number of families receiving assistance. It will be the last tax credit to be abated, after Family Support and the Child Tax Credit, so will be abated at 30 cents in the dollar. The current threshold level of income of a family with one newborn child at which family assistance is fully abated away is $33,547; the new level will be $37,547. Families that receive Family Support and the Child Tax Credit will receive the full amount of the new Parental Tax Credit. It will be paid to the principal caregiver or shared between two principal caregivers in shared custody cases. Entitlement to the Parental Tax Credit ceases if the family receives a social welfare benefit, weekly accident compensation payments for more than three months, a student allowance, New Zealand Superannuation or the veteran’s pension within the eight weeks after birth. If the child dies in the eight-week entitlement period following birth payment will continue for the full eight weeks. For multiple births a family will receive multiple entitlements to the new tax credit. Application date The parental tax credit will apply to births that occur on or after 1 October 1999. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 4 Stamp Duty Abolished STAMP DUTY ABOLITION ACT 1999 Introduction The Stamp Duty Abolition Act 1999 abolished stamp duty on the sale and lease of commercial land and buildings, including farms. Background Introduced in 1867, stamp duty originally applied to most residential and commercial property and to financial instruments. This scope was significantly narrowed in 1988, leaving two main types of stamp duty: conveyance duty and lease duty. Conveyance duty applied to sales of commercial land and buildings and shares in a flat or office-owning company. Lease duty applied to leases of commercial land and buildings. The abolition of conveyance duty and lease duty completes the progressive phasing out over recent years of stamp duties and similar duties. As part of this process, conveyance and lease duty on residential property were repealed in 1988, stamp duty on the creation of forestry rights in 1994, and credit card transaction duty from last year. Conveyance duty was charged as follows: at 1% on the first $50,000 of the sale price; then at 1.5% on the amount between $50,000 and $100,000; and at 2% plus $1,250 on the amount over $100,000. Lease duty was generally charged at 40 cents per $100 of the maximum annual rental payable under a lease, and $1 per $100 of any premium payable under the lease. Key features The Stamp Duty Abolition Act 1999 abolished the two types of stamp duty - conveyance duty and lease duty - imposed under the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. The abolition of stamp duty involved the repeal of significant parts of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 and making a large number of consequential amendments to other Acts. The repeal of the various stamp duty provisions and the other amendments apply to: instruments executed after 20 May 1999; and More about the Parental Tax Credit Who receives the payment? The new credit will be paid to the principal caregiver. In the case of adoptions, it will be paid to the person who is the principal caregiver of the child in the first eight weeks from the date of birth. If the adoption occurs at birth, the new credit will go to the family adopting the child. If the birth mother keeps the baby for the eight-week period, she will receive the new credit. When the custody of a child is shared during the eight- week period, with each parent having custody of the child for at least one-third of the entitlement period, entitlement will be shared between both parents. When is it paid? The Parental Tax Credit can be paid during the year in fortnightly instalments from the date the application is processed, or at the end of the income year when a family assistance declaration is filed. Families who want to receive the parental tax credit in fortnightly instalments must apply within three months of the date of birth of the child. Instalments will be paid directly into the principal caregiver’s bank account. Families who do not apply within three months will receive their entitlement as part of the end-of-year square-up in the income year in which the birth occurred. If the payment period spans income years payment will continue into the new income year. The amount of the payment may vary between income years, depending on the level of the family’s income. Families in this situation can choose whether to delay receiving their Parental Tax Credit until the new income year, provided they apply for it within three months of the date of the birth. If a family is entitled to the credit but applies for it later while receiving a social welfare benefit, weekly accident compensation payments for more than three months, a student allowance, New Zealand Superannuation or the veteran’s pension, it will receive the Parental Tax Credit at the end of the year. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 5 instruments executed between 20 May 1991 and 20 May 1999 (both dates inclusive) if the related transactions were not completed or, in the case of leases were not carried into effect, on or before 20 May 1999. Whether or not a transaction has been “completed” very much depends on the nature of the particular transaction in question. A conveyance of land under the Land Transfer Act is generally completed on registration at the Land Registry Office. Authority for this proposition can be found in Hinde McMorland & Sim (Vol 2) paragraph 10.094, which in turn cites Montgomery and Rennie v Continental Bags (NZ) Limited \[1972\] NZLR 884 at 893, where Speight J said: “I conclude that title of the land remains with the vendor until registration, that the commonly described practice of ‘settlement’ viz., the exchange of memorandum to enable registration to be effected does not amount to a completion of the transaction or conveyance and the contract of sale still governs the relationship of the parties until registration.” If registration of a transfer at the Land Registry Office is not required to convey legal title to the transferee, the transaction is normally completed on settlement. An example of such a transaction would be an assignment of a lease. With a declaration of trust, where persons declare that they now hold land registered in their names in trust, the transaction is completed on the date of execution of the deed. The “carried into effect” requirement in relation to leases applies only to instruments creating leases or instruments varying existing leases. (The “completed” test applies to instruments transferring existing leases, such as deeds of assignment.) A lease is “carried into effect” when it becomes operative. The relevant test in this case is whether possession was given and taken on or before 20 May 1999. Likewise, an instrument providing for a rent increase is “carried into effect” on the date the rent payable under the lease increased. Therefore the relevant test in this case is whether the rent payable under the lease increased on or before 20 May 1999. A person may apply for a refund of stamp duty that has been paid on an instrument executed between 20 May 1991 and 20 May 1999 (both dates inclusive) if the related transaction was not completed or, in the case of a lease was not carried into effect, on or before 20 May 1999. The application provision in the Act ensures that unpaid stamp duty on transactions completed (or leases carried into effect) on or before 20 May 1999 can continue to be collected. Cheque duty and the approved issuer levy for non- resident debt holders, both provided for in the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, will continue unchanged. Application date Stamp duty is abolished on: instruments executed after 20 May 1999; and instruments executed between 20 May 1991 and 20 May 1999 (both dates inclusive) if the related transactions were not completed or, in the case of leases were not carried into effect, on or before 20 May 1999. Estate Duty LegislatIon Repealed ESTATE DUTY REPEAL ACT 1999 The Estate Duty Repeal Act 1999 repealed the legislative provisions relating to estate duty. No estate duty has been payable on the estate of any person who has died on or after 17 December 1992. This was achieved by the Estate Duty Abolition Act 1993 amending section 3 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968, the section which imposed liability for estate duty. However, the estate duty provisions themselves, which are mainly contained in Parts I, II and III of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968, were not repealed. The main legislative amendments made by the Estate Duty Repeal Act 1999 are the repeal of significant parts of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Consequential amendments to remove references to estate duty in other Acts and a regulation have also been made. The gift duty provisions in the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 incorporate certain estate duty provisions. Amendments to re-enact the substance of those estate duty provisions in the gift duty provisions have been made. The repealed estate duty provisions continue to apply to the estates of people who died before 17 December 1992. Application date The repeal of the estate duty provisions applies from 24 May 1999, the date of enactment.

Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 8 Creation of Work and Income New Zealand SCHEDULE TO THE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES AND INCOME SUPPORT (INTEGRATED ADMINISTRATION) ACT 1998. The Employment Services and Income Support (Integrated Administration) Act 1998 provided for the transfer of payment of benefits from Income Support (Department of Social Welfare) to Work and Income New Zealand (WINZ). As a result of this change, a number of consequential changes have been made to the following Revenue Acts to replace the Director-General of Social Welfare with the Chief Executive of the department responsible for the administration of the Social Security Act 1964, WINZ, and to replace the Department of Social Welfare with WINZ: Child Support Act 1991 Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Income Tax Act 1994 Tax Administration Act 1994. The changes do no more than reflect the change in the delivery agency of benefit payments, there are no changes of a technical nature. The changes came into force on 1 October 1998. Community wage and child support information SECTION 80 AND SCHEDULE 1 OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENT ACT 1998 From 1 October 1998, various benefits, such as the unemployment and sickness benefits, were replaced by the community wage. As a result of this change, a number of consequential changes have been made by Schedule 1 to the following Revenue Acts: Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 \* Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Child Support Act 1991 Income Tax Act 1994. In addition to changes of a purely consequential nature, an amendment was made to section CB 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994 to exempt from income tax any participation allowance paid to people who are in receipt of the community wage and are engaged in community work. In addition to the allowance, which is $21 a week, a further $20 may be payable for extra expenses. Both amounts are exempt from income tax. The changes came into force on 1 October 1998. Section 80 of the Social Security Amendment Act 1998 amended the Child Support Act 1991 to allow the Commissioner to advise custodians of child support payment details. This change, which came into force on 1 February 1999, is designed to help beneficiaries planning to return to the workforce by providing them with information on the amount of child support that they can expect to receive. \* The amendment was to one of the estate duty provisions. This legislation has since been repealed by the Estate Duty Repeal Act 1999. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 9 Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Inducement fee - whether monetary remuneration Case:TRA Number 94/015. Decision Number 005/99 Decision date:7 April 1999 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Inducement fee, monetary remuneration Summary Willy J held that the payment received by the Objector was capital and not within the definition of monetary remuneration under section 65(2)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Facts The Objector was employed as an Investment Analyst at Company A. In the course of his employment he became involved with Company B (“the company”) who offered the Objector a job. The Objector was invited to name his terms of employment with the company. An oral agreement was made between the company and the Objector on 2 July 1986 and a written offer followed on 3 July 1986. The written offer enclosed two cheques for $200,000, one drawn on the company account and the other on the personal account of the two company principals. The Objector contacted the company to say that the terms set out in the letter of 3 July 1986 were not acceptable. By letter of 8 July 1986, the Objector set out his terms of employment, which were accepted by the company. The Objector then banked the two cheques. Inland Revenue issued the assessment on the basis that the letter of 8 July 186 was backdated, in reliance on an allegation to that effect in some company documents. Decision Willy J found that the parties acknowledged and intended this non-refundable payment of $400,000 to be an inducement demanded by the Objector to leave Company A. It didn’t form part of the employment contract he was entering and it was not conditional upon the Objectors performance of the employment contract. Tax liability - whether relief taxi drivers independent contractors or employees Case:TRA Number 97/75. Decision 006/99 Decision date:14 April 1999 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Independent contractors or employees Summary Barber J found in favour of the Objector but stated that this was a “somewhat borderline” case. He said that if such a case was borderline then the outcome should be particularly influenced by the genuine intentions of parties. Facts The Objector is a holder of a passenger licence under the Transport Services Licencing Act 1989 and owned during the period 1 April 1993 to 31 December 1995 between 3 and 5 taxis at any one time. The Objector is a registered person for the purposes of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 10 The Objector engaged a number of relief drivers to drive the taxis owned by him. In 1992 the Objector approached Inland Revenue to clarify the tax liability of his drivers as far as PAYE deductions and GST liability went. His drivers proceeded to calculate and deduct PAYE acting as independent contractors. None of the drivers were required to register for GST purposes, as they did not meet the $30,000 GST registration threshold. In May 1993 the Commissioner conducted a review of the Objector’s relationship with his drivers and concluded that the drivers were the Objector’s employees and were not independent contractors. The Commissioner then assessed the Objector for GST on the percentage of gross takings retained by the drivers, as a taxable supply made by the Objector and chargeable with GST output tax. Decision Barber J found that in this case he could not doubt that the intentions of the parties were to create the status of independent contractors for the drivers of the Objector. His Honour reiterated his views expressed in a similar case, Case T13. His Honour found therefore the Objector does not have to account for GST on the percentage of gross takings retained by the drivers. Taxable Activity - Business or hobby? Case:TRA Number 98/24. Decision Number 007/99 Decision date:16 April 1999 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Taxable activity, apportionment, hobby or pastime Summary Barber J found for the Commissioner but with a few adjustments. Facts The Objector was a company engaged in cleaning and catering operations which contracted solely with an airline to provide services at a major New Zealand airport. The shareholders were husband and wife who used their private residence as the administrative centre of operations. The husband had also been involved in a horse racing and breeding activities for more than 20 years. The Objector claimed input tax credits on horse racing and breeding activities, claiming that they were part and parcel of the Objector’s business. The Objector also claimed input credits on all domestic expenses and expenses relating to gifts and tokens of goodwill made in the course of doing business with it client. The Commissioner contended that only 36% of the household outgoings were attributable to the Objectors taxable activity, that none of the improvements were so attributable and nor the gifts. The Commissioner also maintained that the stud activity was not part of the Objector’s business, rather it was in the nature of a hobby conducted by one the Objectors shareholders. Decision The bulk of the dispute rested on the Objector’s stud activity. Barber J held that though it may have reached the ‘taxable activity’ threshold, the evidence showed that the activity was in the nature of a personal, recreational pursuit and as such the Objector was unable to claim any input credit on stud expenses. His Honour adjusted the household expenses from 36% to 50% saying that it was difficult to be precise when making an apportionment regarding the business and private use of house and it helped to look at areas allocated to either or both purposes and the extent of their use for such purposes. His Honour also held that a special relationship existed between the Objector and its employees and clients and the goods in question were acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supply. Part XA Income Tax Act - whether valid in terms of Magna Carta Case:Reginald Stevens Shaw v CIR Decision date:19 April 199 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Validity of Part XA Summary The Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant’s appeal and stated that the legislation must stand. Facts The appellant is a New Zealand superannuitant. In the 1994 and 1995 income years the appellant derived income from sources other than New Zealand IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 11 superannuation that exceeded the specified exemption and he therefore became liable for tax under section 336C of the Income Tax Act 1976 (“ITA”). The appellant challenged the validity of Part XA of the ITA. Part XA (now repealed) imposed an additional rate of tax on New Zealand superannuitants where their income from other sources exceeded a specified exemption. The appellant argued that the Court was empowered under section 3 of the Declaratory Judgments Act 1908 to determine the validity of Part XA; that Part XA breached the Magna Carta; and that there are limits to parliamentary sovereignty and that those limits are to be determined by the judiciary. Decision The Court of Appeal held that a court’s power under section 3 of the Declaratory Judgments Act 1908 is limited to ensuring that a statute was properly enacted. The Court of Appeal also held that although chapter 29 of the 1297 Magna Carta forms part of New Zealand’s law it does not constitute supreme law, in the sense of a limit on New Zealand Parliaments’ sovereignty. The Court of Appeal said that “those who object to such a tax \[the superannuation surcharge\]... have their remedy in the legislative, or ultimately in the electoral process”. Tax Avoidance - interest deduction on loan to purchase associated company shares Case:TRA Number 97/114. Decision Number 008/99 Decision date:4 May 1999 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Tax avoidance Summary Willy J found in favour of the Objector. Facts The Objector was involved in a “raro route” arrangement in the 1986 income tax year. It purchased new issued shares in an associated company borrowing from a financial company to do so. The Objector also paid interest on the advance up front. By a series of mutual loans and repayments through a number of corporate entities, the Objector received back the interest payment (less fees) as a non taxable inter-corporate dividend. The Commissioner relied on section 99 and disallowed the interest deduction. The Objector argued that there were numerous procedural failures by the Commissioner that made the assessment invalid: Decision There was a tax avoidance arrangement therefore the Commissioners reconstruction in terms of section 99 was correct. However the procedural defects invalidated the assessment. Remuneration paid in respect of leave owed - whether capital or revenue expenditure Case:New Zealand Forest Research Institute Limited v CIR Decision date:18 May 1999 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:Capital expenditure or Revenue expenditure Summary The Court of Appeal found in favour of the taxpayer and reversed the finding of the High Court. Facts This was an appeal by the taxpayer from the High Court decision of Salmond J issued on 3 September 1998. On 1 July 1992 New Zealand Forest Research Institute Limited (“NZFRI”) acquired certain Crown assets and the Crown’s business related to forest research. Under the transfer agreement NZFRI assumed certain liabilities from the Crown, effective from the transfer date. Those liabilities included ones related to the business or activity carried on by the Ministry of Forestry before the transfer date or to the transfer or employment of any employee of the Ministry, or on the terms on which any employee was previously employed. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 12 The Crown was obliged to adjust the purchase price for the assets transferred to NZFRI by an amount determined having regard to “accrued staff liabilities”. These liabilities included different types of leave pay which employees of the Crown had become entitled to before the business and assets were transferred to NZFRI. Pursuant to the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992 and to the Transfer Agreement between the Crown and NFRI, NZFRI recognised transferring employees as being entitled to certain paid leave with effect from 1 July 1992 and paid $836,978 in the succeeding year to employees on account of that leave. The Commissioner disallowed the deduction on the basis that it was a capital item and non deductible. Decision The Court of Appeal found that, firstly, the payments were made as remuneration paid by the taxpayer to its employees in respect of leave taken during the first income year of the company ending 30 June 1993. Second, remuneration for leave has all the attributes of revenue character payments. Third, the payments in question were not made in the discharge of a liability to pay a quantified sum as at the commencement of the year 1 July 1992. The employees’ rights and the taxpayer’s obligations to them were as provided for in the collective employment contract and section 41 of the CRI Act. Fourth, in terms of section 41, the employment contract of every transferring employee is “deemed to have been unbroken” and the employee’s period of service with the Crown is “deemed to have been a period of service with the Crown Research Institute”. Therefore, any payment in respect of leave paid by the taxpayer is not in respect of service to another employer, i.e. the Crown. Fifth, the $836,978 payment was not paid by the taxpayer in discharge of the Crown’s accrued liability to the employees. The payment was made pursuant to the contract of employment as affected by section 41 and not pursuant to the transfer agreement. In this regard, the case is clearly distinguishable from Royal Insurance Company, Tata Hydro-Electric Agencies Limited (Bombay), Bombay Presidency and Eden and Nicholls and Others. Sixth, by statute the pre- 1 July 1992 service of the transferring employees is deemed to have been unbroken service with the company. The contract of employment must be accorded that status and given that effect for all purposes including tax purposes. On this point, the Court stated that given the purpose, scheme and scope of the income tax legislation and the significance to the Revenue and to the economy and the tax treatment of employment as a source of income, deductions in arriving at business profits, collection responsibilities (e.g. PAYE) and special arrangements (e.g. fringe benefit tax) there is much force in the argument that the Income Tax Act is “an enactment ... relating to the employment of each such employee”. Finally, the Court found that the expenditure was incurred and paid in carrying on a business for the purposes of gaining and producing assessable income for the taxpayer. It was paid pursuant to the employment contract because the employees are deemed to have worked for the taxpayer for the pre-1 July 1992 periods involved. Input tax credits on purchase of land for residential care Case:Wairakei Court Limited v CIR Decision date:13 May 1999 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Input tax credit claims Summary The High Court found in favour of the taxpayer in respect of the claims for the studio units and for the CIR in respect of the claim for the villas. Facts In 1994 Wairakei Court Limited (“WCL”) decided to expand its rest home facilities. Additional land was acquired by WCL to update and extend the rest home, construct studio units and villas. The residents of the studio units took occupation by way of a licence to occupy, which contained a clause making it mandatory for the resident to accept and pay for either full or partial care. The residents of the villas also took occupation under licences to occupy but did not have the contractual obligation to accept any level of care at all. WCL claimed an input tax credit on the purchase of land and for the construction of studios and villas as part of the rest home complex. The Commissioner contended that the expenditure was for the principal purpose of making exempt supply of accommodation. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 13 Decision Chilsolm J considered the villas and studios separately. Chilsolm J found that in relation to the villas, any rest home care component was ancillary or incidental and the absence of a mandatory care clause in the licence to occupy did not enable WCL to make taxable supplies of residential care on the villas. In relation to the studios, His Honour found that regardless of whether looked factually or legally at the situation, the licences to occupy were tied to the provision of care for the elderly. He held that it was simply unrealistic to say that the principal purpose of acquiring land was to make exempt supplies of accommodation, as this was merely incidental. Whether property was sold as a going concern Case:TRA Number 98/11. Decision Number 009/99 Decision date:26 May 1999 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Keywords:Sale of a going concern Summary Judge Willy held that both parties understood that they were selling and buying a going concern which was zero rated for GST and found in favour of the Objector. Facts The Objector husband and wife were in partnership in a horticultural business. The Objectors sold their horticultural property in August 1994 for $350,000.00. At the time of the sale of their business they concentrated their efforts solely on carnation growing. The sale included land, glasshouses, two oil tanks and heaters. The purchaser took possession in early December 1994 and agreed to the vendor’s use of the property for three weeks to enable them to harvest their carnation crop. As the vendors vacated the glass houses the purchaser worked in behind them and planted his crop of tomatoes. He also upgraded the irrigation system and other facilities. The agreement for sale and purchase contained a clause, pursuant to which, the parties agreed that the property was being purchased as a going concern. The purchaser gave evidence that this clause was inserted at the time of his original offer for the property plus chattels and carnations. He claimed that, had he been fully aware of the effect of this clause, he would have asked for it to have been removed when it become clear ultimately that there was not going to be the sale of a going concern. The Objectors claimed a GST input of $16,666.67. The Commissioner disallowed this input on the basis that the sale of the property was not the sale of a going concern. Decision Judge Willy cited the following extract from Belton v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,403: “The test is not what the parties’ intention was, but what objectively happened and within what time frame which must be determinative of the issue.” Judge Willy stated that such comments were made in cases where the parties had not stated unequivocally in their written document of agreement that they were buying and selling a going concern. Rather the Courts were left to determine the intentions of the parties from an objective review of the facts. His Honour stated that different considerations arose where there was an express agreement between the affected parties. His Honour concluded that the Objectors met their requirement of proof that at the point of sale there existed on the land all of the structure and chattels of the concern of market gardening. That concern was going at the date of possession and together with the land and other improvements was what the purchaser bought. The fact that he changed the style and emphasis of the concern from carnations to tomatoes did not detract from the existence of the nature of the concern which was that of a horticultural business. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 14 Subsidised Transport provided by employers to employees – value for fringe benefit tax purposes PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 99/2 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CI 2(1), CI 3(6), CI 4(1), and the definition of “subsidised transport” in OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of: Transportation to an employee by the employer of that employee, where that employer carries on a business that consists of or includes transportation of the public; or Transportation to an employee by a person with whom the employer of that employee has entered into an arrangement for the provision of that transportation, where that employer carries on a business that consists of or includes transportation of the public. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: Where transportation is provided by the employer to an employee, the value of the benefit for fringe benefit purposes is 25% of the highest amount charged by the employer to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion. Where transportation is provided to an employee by a third party with whom the employer has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided or granted to the employee, the value of the benefit for fringe benefit purposes is the greater of: 25% of the highest amount charged by the third party to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; or The amount that the employer is so liable to pay or has so paid to the third party for the benefit being provided by the third party. In the definition of “subsidised transport” in section OB 1, “class” refers to the classes of transportation available, such as first, business, or economy class; “extent” refers to transportation with the same departure and destination points; and “occasion” refers to the time of carriage. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2002. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18th day of May 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR␣ 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 15 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/2 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in Public Ruling BR Pub 99/2 (“the Ruling”). The subject matter covered in the Ruling was previously dealt with in Public Information Bulletin 136 (May 1985) at pages 28 and 29 under the heading “Subsidised Transport”. This Ruling supersedes that earlier statement. Background Employers who are in the business of providing transportation to the public may provide transportation to their staff, either free or at a price lower than that paid by the public. These employers may also enter into arrangements with third parties to provide the employers’ staff with either free transportation or transportation at a price lower than that paid by the public. If the provision of this transportation falls within the definition of “subsidised transport”, it is a fringe benefit. The employer will be liable to pay fringe benefit tax in accordance with the FBT rules. This Ruling applies where an employer, who carries on a business that consists of or includes transportation of the public, provides transportation to an employee of that employer, or enters into an arrangement with another person for transportation to be provided or granted by that person to an employee of the employer. Legislation Section CI 1 states: In the FBT rules, “fringe benefit”, in relation to an employee and to any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, means any benefit that consists of- ... (d)Any subsidised transport: “Subsidised transport” is defined in section OB 1: “Subsidised transport”, in the FBT rules, means the provision, in any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, by an employer, being a person who carries on a business that consists of or includes the transportation, for hire or reward, of persons who are members of the general public, to an employee of the employer of carriage or entitlement to carriage in the course of the transportation (not being transportation in a motor vehicle) where the amount (if any) paid by the employee of the employer in respect of the carriage or entitlement to carriage is less than the amount that is the highest amount charged, in the quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year in which the provision occurs, by the employer of the employee for the provision by that employer, to persons who are members of the general public, of carriage or, as the case may be, entitlement to carriage that is of the same class and extent and on or for the same occasion or occasions as the class and extent and occasion or occasions of the carriage or the entitlement to carriage first mentioned in the definition. The main valuation provision for subsidised transport is section CI 3(6), which states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, the value of any fringe benefit, being a benefit that consists of subsidised transport provided in any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year, by an employer, shall be the greater of- (a)25% of the amount that, in relation to the subsidised transport so provided is, within the meaning of the definition of “subsidised transport”, the highest amount charged by the employer: (b)The amount that the employer is so liable to pay or has so paid for the benefit being provided. Section CI 4(1) further states: Subject to this section, for the purposes of the FBT rules the taxable value of any fringe benefit provided by the employer of the employee in any quarter or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) in any income year shall be the value of that fringe benefit, reduced by- (a)The amount (if any) paid by the employee (or, where section GC 15(1) applies, by the associated person) in relation to the quarter or the income year for the receipt or enjoyment of that fringe benefit (not being an amount paid for the acquisition or improvement by the employee or associated person of an asset the receipt or enjoyment of which does not constitute the fringe benefit), except where the fringe benefit is an employment related loan: In relation to benefits provided by third parties, section CI 2(1) states: For the purposes of the FBT rules, where a benefit is provided for or granted to an employee by a person with whom the employer of the employee has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be so provided or granted, that benefit shall be deemed to be a benefit provided for or granted to the employee by the employer of the employee. The definition of an “arrangement” is provided in section OB 1: “Arrangement” means any contract, agreement, plan or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), including all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 16 Application of the Legislation The legislative provisions concerning the valuation of subsidised transport provided to employees are uncertain in their application. This Ruling sets out how the Commissioner will interpret these provisions. Subsidised transport may be provided to an employee by the employee’s employer or by a third party that has an arrangement with the employer to provide the employee with a benefit. These two situations are discussed separately below. Subsidised transport provided by the employer The valuation of subsidised transport provided by an employer to an employee of that employer is provided for in section CI 3(6). This requires the value to be the greater of: 25% of the highest amount charged by the employer to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; and the amount that the employer is liable to pay or has so paid for the benefit being provided. Some commentaries on the value of subsidised transport refer to the cost to the employer of providing the transportation. This has caused confusion about whether costs incurred by an employer itself in providing transportation to an employee, such as the cost of food and fuel on an airline, should be taken into account in the second limb of section CI 3(6). It is the Commissioner’s view that section CI 3(6)(b) was inserted into the valuation provision to provide for the situation where the transport is provided by a third party and the employer pays more to the third party for the transport than 25% of the highest fare. Previously, the valuation provision referred only to 25% of the highest fare. The words “liable to pay or has so paid” in section CI 3(6)(b) do not refer to the cost to the employer. Paragraph (b) of section CI 3(6) only applies when an employer actually pays a third party to provide transportation for its employees. This situation is discussed below. If an employer provides transportation itself, there will generally be no amount that the employer is liable to pay, as the employer does not charge itself for the employee’s transportation. While the employer may incur costs in providing the transportation, these are not to be taken into account in determining the value of the benefit. In summary, it is the Commissioner’s view that, where the transportation is provided by an employer to an employee of that employer, the value of the benefit is 25% of the highest fare charged to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion. The meaning to be given to the “highest fare”, “class”, “extent”, and “occasion” is discussed below. Subsidised transport provided by a third party that has an arrangement with the employer The valuation of subsidised transport provided by a third party that has an arrangement with the employer to provide transport to an employee of that employer is also provided for in section CI 3(6). The interpretation of this section is problematic. This is in part due to the effect of section CI 2(1). Under section CI 2(1), if an employer has entered into an arrangement with another to provide a benefit to an employee of that employer, the benefit is deemed to be provided by the employer. Interpreting section CI 3(6) without reference to section CI 2(1), the benefit is valued as the greater of: 25% of the highest amount charged by the employer to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; and the amount that the employer is liable to pay or has so paid for the benefit being provided. If the employer offers the same transportation to the public that was arranged to be provided to the employee by the third party, an amount will be charged by the employer to the public for the same transportation. In this instance, the benefit will be the greater of the two options. However, in the majority of cases, the employer will not provide the same transportation to the public as that arranged with the third party to be provided for the benefit of the employee. In this instance, there is no amount charged by the employer to the public for that transportation. The value of the benefit depends on the amount paid by the employer for the third party to provide the benefit. That is, it is only paragraph (b) of section CI 3(6) that is relevant. However, section CI 2(1) affects this interpretation. This section deems a benefit provided to an employee by a person with whom the employer has an arrangement to be provided by the employer. Reading section CI 3(6) in conjunction with section CI 2(1) may require ascertaining the highest amount charged by the third party to the public and the amount that the third party is liable to pay or has so paid. That is, reading the word “employer” in section CI 3(6) as the third party. In other words, the highest amount charged by the employer refers IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 17 to the highest amount charged by the third person, and the amount the employer is liable to pay or has so paid is a reference to the amount that the third party is liable to pay or has so paid. On the same reasoning that an employer does not charge itself for providing transportation to its employees, the third party does not charge itself for providing transportation to employees of the employer. Accordingly, the value of the benefit depends on the amount charged by the third party to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion. That is, only paragraph (a) of section CI 3(6) is relevant here. Alternatively, section CI 2(1) may not require reading the word “employer” in section CI 3(6) as the third party. If this approach is taken, section CI 3(6) would be interpreted in the same manner as above where no account was taken of section CI 2(1). Therefore, only paragraph (b) of section CI 3(6) is relevant here. The above interpretations, with and without reference to section CI 2(1), with the exception of the limited instance where the employer provides the same transportation service to the public as that provided to the employee by the third party, deny the requirement that the benefit be valued at the greater of two options of any meaning. However, combining the results from the two interpretations would give this requirement meaning in all circumstances. For example, the value of the benefit is the greater of: 25% of the highest amount charged by the third party to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; and the amount that the employer is liable to pay or has so paid for the benefit being provided by the third party. It is acknowledged that this approach, which interprets the word “employer” in a different manner under each limb of section CI 3(6), is inconsistent with a strict literal interpretation of the section. However, it is the Commissioner’s view that, as the wording used in the legislation is less than ideal, this is the better approach where a benefit is provided by a third party. In summary, it is the Commissioner’s view that if transportation is provided to an employee by a third party with whom the employer has entered into an arrangement for that benefit to be provided or granted to the employee, the value of the benefit is the greater of: 25% of the highest fare charged by the third party with whom the employer has an arrangement to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion; and the price the employer paid or is liable to pay to the third party with whom the employer has an arrangement for the benefit being provided. If the employer is not required to pay the third party with whom the employer has an arrangement, i.e. there is no price paid or payable by the employer for the benefit, the benefit is valued at 25% of the highest fare charged to the public for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion. That is, only paragraph (a) of section CI 3(6) has relevance in this situation. Other issues Carriage and entitlement to carriage A benefit arises on the provision to an employee of carriage or an entitlement to carriage. “Carriage” refers to the actual carriage on the particular transport, whereas “entitlement to carriage” refers to a specific right to carriage in the future. For example, a bus pass and an airline ticket are both entitlements to carriage. They both provide the employee with a future right to carriage. If the employee is not entitled to claim a specific right to carriage, e.g. because certain conditions must be met before the entitlement to carriage arises, there is no entitlement to carriage unless those requirements are fulfilled. For example, if an employee is provided with a standby ticket which is subject to the limitation that carriage will only be provided if special loading requirements are met, no entitlement to carriage arises until these requirements have been fulfilled and the employee is entitled to the future right to carriage. The employee may then choose whether or not to use the entitlement to carriage. No benefit to the employee will arise if the special conditions that the ticket is subject to are not fulfilled as no entitlement to carriage or carriage will have arisen. Special conditions that employees may be subject to can be distinguished from intrinsic limitations that everyone is subject to, such as there being available seats on a bus when utilising a bus pass, for example. An employee with a bus pass has an entitlement to carriage, even though he or she may IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 18 not gain carriage on the first bus that comes along because it happens to be full. In other words, the availability of seats is not a special condition that must be fulfilled before the entitlement to carriage arises, but a limitation inherent in bus travel that everyone is subject to. This situation can be contrasted with a standby fare, where carriage is subject to certain conditions being fulfilled before the entitlement to carriage arises at all. That is, where an employee is told that he or she will receive an entitlement to carriage or carriage provided certain conditions are first met. A further issue that arises in relation to entitlement to carriage is the suggestion that entitlement to carriage refers to carriage with restrictions attached. The example was given of standby type restrictions. The Commissioner does not agree with this interpretation. As discussed in the preceding paragraphs, no entitlement to carriage will arise where the employee does not become entitled to the carriage. Special conditions or restrictions attached to a ticket are taken into account in the legislation by the use of a 25% basis for calculating the value of the benefit. This percentage reflects that employees may be subject to special standby type conditions, and therefore the value of the benefit should not be based on the full fare paid by the public. The benefit to the employee arises on the provision of the carriage or entitlement to carriage. It is irrelevant if the entitlement to carriage is not subsequently used by the employee. A benefit does not arise when a carriage is taken pursuant to an entitlement to carriage. For example, say an employee has been provided with a bus pass that entitles her to “free” carriage. A member of the public who has purchased a similar pass will also be provided with carriage without having to pay any more. No benefit arises to the employee in this situation. As neither the employee nor the member of the public is charged for the actual carriage, the employee does not receive the carriage for an amount less that the amount charged to the public. The legislation does not tax the one benefit as a “carriage” and then subsequently as an “entitlement to carriage”. A transportation benefit will not come within the “subsidised transport” definition if the same transportation is not sold to the public. This is because the employee would not be getting transportation at a lesser amount than is charged to the public. If the service is not sold to the public, there can be no charge to the public. However, such a benefit could come within section CI 1(h) as “any benefit of any other kind”. Highest fare charged The definition of “subsidised transport” in section OB 1 refers to the provision of carriage or entitlement to carriage where: ... the amount (if any) paid by the employee ...is less than the amount that is the highest amount charged ... by the employer ... to ... the general public, of carriage or ... entitlement to carriage that is of the same class and extent and on or for the same occasion or occasions as the class and extent and occasion or occasions of the carriage or the entitlement to carriage ... In determining the value of the subsidised transport, section CI 3(6) then refers in paragraph (a) to: ... 25% of the amount that, in relation to the subsidised transport so provided is, within the meaning of the definition of “subsidised transport”, the highest amount charged by the employer ... Accordingly, section CI 3(6) requires that the value of the benefit be determined according to the highest amount charged to the public for carriage or entitlement to carriage that is of the same class, extent, and occasion. It is the Commissioner’s view that “class” refers to the classes of travel available, such as first, business, or economy class, as that term is used in the travel industry. The Commissioner does not accept that standby is a class of travel. To include standby fares as a class is to confuse “class” with fares. The special conditions attached to a standby fare have been compensated for by valuing the benefit at only 25% of the amount charged to the public. It was stated in the second reading of the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No 2) (NZPD Vol 461, 1985: 3722) that “The exemption effectively recognises that the true benefit enjoyed by the employee is somewhat less than the full value of the fare”. Further, “extent” refers to travel with the same departure and destination points, and “occasion” refers to the time of carriage. It is arguable that the relevant fare is the highest fare charged during the quarter for travel of the same class and extent. However, this interpretation denies the word “occasion” in the definition of “subsidised transport” of any meaning. Both “quarter” and “occasion” need to be given meaning. It is arguable that the inclusion of the reference to “quarter” means the highest fare charged in the quarter as it was the intention of the legislation that the fare be the highest fare charged in the quarter. However, such an intent is not made clear in the legislation and this interpretation deprives “occasion or occasions” of any meaning. It is submitted that the words “in the quarter” are a reference to the fact that FBT is charged on a quarterly basis. This view is supported by the fact that the words “in the quarter” are followed by “or (where fringe benefit tax is payable on an income year basis under section ND 4) income year”. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 19 This appears to be a reference to the time that FBT is determined. The words “quarter or income year” are repeated throughout the legislation. Apart from the legislative intent, there is no evidence that “quarter or income year” have any greater meaning in this part than they do in any other part. There are differing views on what “occasion” means. The ordinary meaning of “occasion” is the time of occurrence of a particular event or happening. In this situation the particular event or happening is the carriage. Therefore, it would be consistent with this meaning to use the highest fare charged on the actual transportation as that is the time that the carriage occurs. It would not be consistent with the ordinary meaning of “occasion” to define it as the day that the actual travel takes place or as the time or season that the employee is allowed to travel. The better meaning to be given to “occasion or occasions” is the actual time of carriage. This is consistent with the ordinary meaning of “occasion”. In relation to an entitlement to carriage, the relevant occasion is the period of time for which the entitlement to carriage is valid. For example, if the provision is of a bus pass that entitles the employee to carriage on a bus for a period of a month, the relevant value of the benefit is the highest fare charged to the public for that bus pass in that month period. If the entitlement to carriage is a ticket for carriage in the future, such as an airline ticket, the relevant value is the highest fare charged to the public for that particular transportation. The Commissioner is of the view that the legislation requires the highest fare charged for the actual transportation to be used in valuing the benefit. However, it has been submitted that in some circumstances it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to determine this figure. Accordingly, the Commissioner will accept the highest published market fare that the employer or third party, with whom the employer has entered into an arrangement for the provision of the benefit, ever charges for the service as evidence of the highest fare charged for transportation of the same class, extent, and occasion by the employer or third party. For example, this could be by reference to the Air Tariff Worldwide Fares published by the Air Tariff Publishing Company. However, it is acknowledged that at times there are fares that are published but never charged to the public. Such fares would not satisfy this criterion. The highest actual fare charged is to be used where available in preference to the highest published market fare. Further, the Commissioner acknowledges the compliance costs involved in complying with the valuation provisions in relation to the occasion of the transportation. Accordingly, the Commissioner will allow the use of the highest publicised market fare charged, in the particular day, week, or month in which the occasion occurs, for transportation of the same class and extent as the value to be attributed to the benefit. Arrangement Section CI 2(1) refers to an employer that “has entered into an arrangement” with a third party concerning the provision of benefits by the third party to employees of the employer. An “arrangement” is defined in broad terms in the Act to mean “any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable) ...”. Case law indicates that an “arrangement” includes an understanding between two or more persons in relation to an agreed course of action that may not be enforceable in law. However, it must be an arrangement “for that benefit to be so provided or granted”. An employer that merely allows a third party to place promotional materials offering travel in the staff- room, for example, would probably have entered into an arrangement with that third party, but it would not be an arrangement for the provision of a benefit to the employee. It is necessarily a question of fact and degree in any given situation. Any understanding between an employer and a third party to provide a benefit to employees of the employer could constitute an arrangement to which section CI 2(1) applies. If the arrangement provides for the third party to provide numerous and ongoing benefits to employees of the employer, the employer would need a system in place to ensure that it is aware of exactly what benefits are being provided to its employees. Employee contributions Under section CI 4(1), if an employee pays an amount for the receipt or enjoyment of subsidised transport provided by that employee’s employer, the value of the benefit provided is reduced by that amount. That is, once the benefit is valued according to section CI 3(6), any amount paid by the employee for that benefit is to be deducted from that amount. This is illustrated in the examples below. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 20 Example 1 An airline employee takes an overseas holiday on his employer’s airline. He travels economy class. The highest price charged to the public for a ticket on that flight in economy class, with the same departure and destination points, is $650. The employee pays $200. Highest fare charged to the public for the same flight$650 25% of this highest fare$162.50 As the employee pays more than the value of the benefit ($200 compared to $162.50), the taxable value of the benefit is nil and no FBT is payable by the employer. Example 2 An airline employee takes a holiday overseas on an airline that has an agreement with her employer. The highest price charged to the public for travel of the same class, extent, and occasion is $650. Under the agreement the employee’s airline pays $325 to the airline that carries the employee. Highest fare charged to the public for the same flight$650 25% of this highest fare$162.50 Price paid or payable by the employer$325 The price paid by the employer is greater than 25% of the highest fare charged for the flight. As the employee does not make any contribution, the taxable value of the benefit is $325. If the employee pays the employer $200, that amount would be deducted from $325 and the taxable value of the benefit would be $125. Comments on technical submissions received The comments received in relation to this Ruling concerned five main areas. Specifically: 1.The valuation of a benefit provided by a third party and the relationship between sections CI 2(1) and CI 3(6). 2.Standby fares are a separate class of travel. 3.The difficulties in obtaining information as to the highest fare charged where a third party provides the transport. 4.With an entitlement to carriage, the benefit arises when the transport is taken. 5.Not all relationships between employers will constitute an “arrangement” for the provision of a benefit. Point 1 highlights that section CI 2(1) only deems the benefit to be provided by the employer; it does not deem the highest price charged by the third party to be the highest price charged by the employer for the purposes of section CI 3(6). The Ruling acknowledges the difficulties with the legislation and attempts to provide a workable solution to the valuing of transport provided by a third party. Point 2 has previously been raised during the consultation process. It is not accepted that standby is a “class” of travel. Point 3 concerns compliance with the Ruling and has been discussed in the commentary. Point 4 has been considered, but is not agreed with. To conclude otherwise would mean that an entitlement to carriage that is not subsequently utilised by the employee would not be subject to FBT. There is no requirement that the entitlement actually be used by the employee. However, this submission led us to question what constitutes an “entitlement to carriage”, as discussed in the commentary. Point 5 concerns the definition of an “arrangement”, and has been further discussed in the commentary. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 21 Licensed premises’ operators and entertainment expenditure PUBLIC RULING - BR Pub 99/3 NOTE (NOT PART OF RULING): This ruling is essentially the same as public ruling BR Pub 96/5 which was published in TIB Volume Seven, No.12, April 1996, but its period of application is from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2004 and some minor wording and formatting changes have been made. BR Pub 96/5 applied up until 31 March 1999. This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section DG 1 and Schedule 6A of the Act. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the incurring of expenditure by any person who carries on business as a licensed premises’ operator (“licensee”) and who, in the ordinary course of that business: Incurs that expenditure on food or beverages and makes special offers of that food or beverage in arm’s length transactions with members of the general public. The special offers of food or beverages to which this Ruling applies include: Happy hours where a licensee offers drinks to customers at reduced prices during a particular time period: Offers of free drinks on certain days or at certain times to customers or categories of customers selected from the general public: Two meals offered to customers for the price of one: “Toss the boss” competitions where for every drink purchased, the customer can toss a coin and has the chance to win a free drink; or Pays an allowance to an employee (such as a bar manager) to cover the costs of the employee providing in the ordinary course of business, free drinks to customers on the licensee’s business premises but not at a party or similar social function or in a reserved area, or where there is other than an arm’s length relationship with the customer. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: The deduction available for expenditure on the special offers of food or beverages is not limited to 50% under section DG 1. The deduction available for expenditure on the allowance paid to an employee is not limited to 50% under section DG 1. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2004. This Ruling is signed by me on the 17th day of May 1999. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 22 COMMENTARY ON PUBLIC RULING BR Pub 99/3 This commentary is not a legally binding statement, but is intended to provide assistance in understanding and applying the conclusions reached in public ruling BR Pub 99/3 (“the Ruling”). All references to a “licensee” are to any person who carries on business as a licensed premises’ operator. Background Under section DG 1, the deduction allowed for expenditure or loss on “specified types of entertainment” set out in Part A of Schedule 6A is limited to 50% of that expenditure, unless the entertainment or benefit is “excluded entertainment” under Part B of the Schedule. If the entertainment or benefit is excluded entertainment under Part B, the expenditure or loss is fully deductible, provided it is incurred in deriving the taxpayer’s gross income or is necessarily incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer’s gross income. Section DG 1 also treats an allowance paid to reimburse expenditure by an employee on specified types of entertainment that fall within Part A, as being expenditure by the taxpayer on the particular specified type of entertainment. Legislation Section DG 1 states: (1)This section and Schedule 6A are intended to limit the amount of the deduction allowed for expenditure or loss incurred on certain types of entertainment, being entertainment that generally involves a significant element of private benefit, to 50% of that expenditure or loss (but subject always to the express provisions of this section and Schedule 6A). (2)If a taxpayer incurs expenditure or loss on a type of entertainment or benefit (whether consumed or enjoyed by the taxpayer or anyone else) specified in Part A of Schedule 6A then, unless and to the extent that the entertainment or benefit is specified as excluded entertainment in Part B of that Schedule, the deduction allowed for that expenditure or loss will be limited to 50% of the amount that would be allowed as a deduction but for this section. (3)For the purposes of this section - (a) A taxpayer will be treated as incurring expenditure on a specified type of entertainment to the extent that the taxpayer pays an allowance for, or reimburses an employee’s expenditure on, the specified type of entertainment and the allowance or reimbursement is exempt income under section CB 12: Part A of Schedule 6A lists four “specified types of entertainment”: Corporate boxes Holiday accommodation Pleasure craft Food or beverages. Effectively, a description of “food or beverages” for the purposes of Part A of Schedule 6A is contained in Clause 4 of Part A, which states: Food or beverages - (a)Provided or consumed as an incidence of any of the types of entertainment specified in clauses 1 to 3; or (b)Provided or consumed off the business premises of the taxpayer; or (c)Provided or consumed on the business premises of the taxpayer - (i) At a party, reception, celebration meal, or other similar social function; or (ii) In an area of the premises, such as a boardroom or an executive or client dining room, reserved for use at the time only by those at a certain level of seniority and their guests and not open to all employees of the taxpayer working in the premises. The Schedule defines “Business premises” as: (a)The normal business premises; or (b)A temporary workplace,- of the taxpayer or of an associated person (not being premises or a workplace established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment). Part B of the Schedule lists excluded entertainment (i.e. entertainment which, being one of the specified types of entertainment under Part A of the Schedule, would otherwise be subject to the 50% deduction limit). Clause 9 of Part B states: Entertainment that is provided by the taxpayer for market value (or otherwise in an arm’s length transaction) in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business which consists of providing one or more specified types of entertainment. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 23 As already indicated in relation to the second set of criteria in clause 4(c), food or beverages provided or consumed on “business premises” (apart from food or beverages consumed in a corporate box, holiday accommodation, or a pleasure craft) are only included as a specified type of entertainment if the food or beverages are consumed either at a party or similar social function, or in a reserved area of the premises. In some situations, food and beverages consumed on licensed premises may be consumed at a party or similar social function or in an area reserved at the time for use by certain employees and guests. However, special offers of food and beverages of the type to which the Ruling applies that are made to the public by the licensee during ordinary opening hours of the licensed premises, would not ordinarily be consumed at a party or similar social function, or in an exclusive area as contemplated in clause 4(c) of the Schedule. B.As “excluded entertainment” Quite apart from the position outlined in the above, special offers of food or beverages of the type referred to would be excluded entertainment under Part B of the Schedule (and thus not be subject to the 50% deduction limit). This is because those special offers of food or beverages would usually come within clause 9 of Part B. Clause 9 applies to expenditure on entertainment that is provided at market value, or otherwise in an arm’s length transaction, in the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business where that business consists of providing one or more of the specified types of entertainment. Expenditure on such excluded entertainment is therefore fully deductible if the entertainment is provided by a business at market value or in an arm’s length transaction. It follows that clause 9 applies to special offers of food or beverages made by a licensee to members of the general public if the food or beverages are provided either at market value, or are otherwise provided in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business. In particular: The cost to the licensee of “happy hours”, where reduced price drinks are provided to customers during a particular time period in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business, will be fully deductible. Application of the Legislation The 50% deduction limit in section DG 1 applies to expenditure that is otherwise fully deductible but which is a “specified type of entertainment” under Part A and not “excluded entertainment” under Part B of Schedule 6A. Special offers of food or beverages to the public: A.As a “specified type of entertainment” When a licensee makes a special offer of food or beverages to the public, the expenditure on that food or beverages is, in most cases, not a specified type of entertainment under Part A of the Schedule (and thus not subject to the 50% deduction limit). This is despite the food or beverages being provided or consumed on the “business premises” of the licensee, in terms of clause 4(c) of Part A. Clause 4(c) has two sets of criteria, both of which must be met before such expenditure falls within a specified type of entertainment: The first requires that the food or beverages are provided or consumed on the “business premises” of the taxpayer; and The second contains two alternatives, which require that the food or beverages be provided or consumed, either at a party \[clause 4(c)(i)\], or in a reserved area of the premises \[clause 4(c)(ii)\]. The special offers of food or beverages made to the public by licensees, although meeting the first set of criteria in clause 4(c), do not ordinarily come within either of the alternatives in the second set. In relation to the first set of criteria in clause 4(c), the licensed premises where the offer occurs are the licensee’s “business premises” as they are the normal business premises of the licensee. The definition of “business premises” in the Schedule excludes “premises or a workplace established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment”. It could be argued that licensed premises are established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment and so would not be the licensee’s “business premises”. However, it is considered that from the licensee’s perspective, the licensed premises are established principally for the purpose of running a business and not for the purposes of enjoying entertainment, and so are the licensee’s “business premises” in terms of the Schedule. Note that, for the purposes of the definition of “business premises”, licensed premises are not a temporary workplace of a person who merely conducts a business meeting at the licensed premises because, from that person’s perspective, the licensed premises are a workplace established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 24 The cost to the licensee of free drinks, provided on certain days or at certain times to customers or categories of customers selected from members of the general public, is fully deductible if the provision of such free drinks occurs in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business. The cost of providing meals, offered in a “two meals for the price of one” deal, is fully deductible if the meals are provided in an arm’s length transaction with customers in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business. The cost to the licensee of drinks provided to customers in “toss the boss” competitions is also fully deductible if the competitor and the licensee have an arm’s length relationship. Where this occurs, the free drink prizes are provided in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of business. Allowances for free drinks for customers A licensee may pay a hospitality allowance to an employee, such as a bar manager, to cover the costs of providing free drinks to customers in the ordinary course of business. The expenditure on such an allowance is not subject to the 50% deduction limit. This is because the drinks are being provided or consumed on the licensee’s business premises but not at a party or similar social function or in a reserved area of the premises as contemplated under clause 4(c) of Part A to the Schedule, or are not being provided where there is other than an arm’s length relationship with the consumer. The allowance is fully deductible if it is incurred by the licensee in deriving the licensee’s gross income or if it is necessarily incurred by the licensee in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Example 1 A licensee offers half-price drinks on Saint Patrick’s day to all patrons who wear a green hat. All other drinks are provided at full price. As the half-price drinks are provided to the green hat wearers in arm’s length transactions in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business, the expenditure on the drinks is excluded from Part A of the Schedule and is fully deductible to the licensee. Example 2 A licensee offers the next round of drinks free for a period of one hour on a Friday night to any customer who, following the purchase of a round, is able to score more than 10 by throwing a single dart at a dartboard. As the free rounds of drinks are available to all customers in arm’s length transactions in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business, the expenditure on the drinks is excluded from Part A of the Schedule and is fully deductible to the licensee. IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eleven, No.5 (May/June 1999) 25 Correction to a previous item Qualifying Company Election Tax In Tax Information Bulletin volume 4, number 8 (April 1993) the Commissioner published a statement in respect of Section 394D (1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 Act (Section ME 4 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994), which concluded that: “... the Qualifying Company Election Tax (QCET) that a closely held company pays when it elects to become a Qualifying Company is “income tax paid”, so it should be credited to the company’s imputation credit Account (ICA) under section 394D(l) of the Income Tax Act 1976.” A review of that statement has been undertaken, and as a result of that review Inland Revenue has concluded that the payment of QCET does not give rise to a credit in the ICA. The statement in TIB Vol.4 No. 8 is now withdrawn. The withdrawal is effective from 1 June 1999. The reasons for this view are: Section ME 4 (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides that “ There shall arise as credits to be recorded in a company’s imputation credit account for any imputation year the following amounts: (a)The amount of any income tax paid by the company during the imputation year to meet a provisional tax obligation under the provisional tax rules or to satisfy an income tax liability under section BC 9, ... Therefore, for the payment of QCET to give rise to an ICA credit, it must be either “provisional tax” or “terminal tax”. Provisional tax “Provisional tax” is defined in section OB 1 of the Act as meaning: ... an amount payable as provisional tax under the provisional tax rules: The term “provisional tax rules” is defined in section OZ 1 and means: ... sections LD 6, LD 7, MB 1 to MB 6, MB 8 to MB 10, MB 12, and MC 1 of \[the Income Tax Act 1994\] and sections 119, 139B, and 178 of the Tax Administration Act 1994: None of those sections provide for the payment of qualifying company election tax. It is therefore Inland Revenue’s view that the payment of QCET does not constitute the payment of a provisional tax obligation as required by section ME 4 (1)(a) of the Act. Terminal tax: Section ME 4(1)(a) provides that “income tax paid ... to satisfy an income tax liability under section BC 9” will give rise to an ICA credit. Therefore it is necessary to consider whether the payment of QCET can fall within the ambit of the phrase “income tax paid ... to satisfy an income tax liability under section BC 9”. Section BC 8 prescribes the manner in which a taxpayer’s income tax liability is to be calculated. Having established the taxpayer’s tax liability in respect of their taxable income for the year, section BC 9 of the Act provides that the amount of tax payable is reduced by the taxpayer’s credits for tax paid or withheld during the income year. The credits that are so offset do not include any amount of QCET that may have been paid during the year. Where the taxpayer’s income tax liability (established pursuant to section BC 8), exceeds the credits that are available, the taxpayer is required to pay terminal tax. Therefore, where section ME 4(1)(a) refers to “income tax paid to satisfy a taxpayer’s income tax liability under section BC 9", it is referring to the payment of terminal tax, in respect of the taxable income that the taxpayer derived during the year. QCET is not paid to satisfy a taxpayer’s income tax liability under section BC 9, rather it is paid as a consequence of electing to become a qualifying company. It is our conclusion that the payment of QCET does not fall within the meaning of the phrase “...provisional tax obligation under the provisional tax rules or to satisfy an income tax liability under section BC 9...”. As a result, the payment of QCET does not give rise to a credit in the paying company’s imputation credit account. Application of the new interpretation From 1 June 1999 newly electing qualifying companies should not treat QCET as a credit in the ICA. It is not the intention of the Commissioner to retrospectively apply the new policy. However if a company which has applied the previously published policy wishes to be reassessed, its case will be viewed on its own merits.
