Mr Cunliffe outlined the role of government tax policy initiatives over the next two years in helping to achieve the goal of the government�s growth and innovation framework � to return New Zealand�s per capita income to the top half of the OECD rankings. The tax focus, he said, was on international tax, compliance costs for small to medium-sized enterprises, and specific issues identified by the private sector taskforces that are part of the growth and innovation framework. �The sound, sensible, relatively simple tax system that we have in New Zealand is a key competitive advantage internationally. We will keep that,� Mr Cunliffe said. �But there may be features of the tax system that are proving to be a barrier to growth and innovation, and we are keen to identify them and remove them where we can.� �One way tax policy can contribute to growth an innovation is to reduce the extent to which tax is a barrier to New Zealand doing business with the rest of the world,� he said. The government was considering and consulting on recommendations by Tax Review 2001 to �rationalise the taxation of outbound investment and to make New Zealand more attractive to overseas capital and migrants.� �A second way tax policy affects growth and innovation is through the tax-related compliance costs of doing business. The government is seeking to reduce the compliance costs of tax, with the spotlight on small to medium-sized enterprises, since they form a more significant part of the economy in New Zealand than they do in most other countries.� �There is scope for improving tax design and tax administration that will help to reduce compliance costs for these businesses. But the emphasis now is moving away from simplifying systems per se, to looking at how those systems impact on growing business � in other words, looking at the business life-cycle and tax impacts at the key moments in that life-cycle.� �A third way tax policy can contribute to growth and innovation is for the government to be open to concerns of the various business sectors. This does not mean introducing tax incentives for target sectors. Rather, it means government and business working together to identify roadblocks to growth, and working in a co-operative way to unlock them.� Four private sector taskforces had been set up to identify and consider measures that will help their sectors to grow, Mr Cunliffe said. �Tax has already emerged as an issue as the taskforces progress their work, and officials are working closely with them to ensure that tax issues can be properly considered from different perspectives.� �The government expects there to emerge from this work a small but important package of useful tax issues that are central to the growth and innovation strategy. They will then be progressed through the normal generic tax policy process.� Mr Cunliffe said that, as announced in the budget, the government had released officials�analysis of the Tax Review 2001 recommendation to reduce the tax burden on new foreign direct investment from 33 percent to 18 percent. The report containing the analysis is on the website of Inland Revenue�s Policy Advice Division at  HYPERLINK "http://www.taxpolicy.govt.nz" www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz.

1 David Cunliffe address to 2002 tax conference of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, 11 October 2002 I am very pleased to have the opportunity to address your annual tax conference today. It is my honour to represent the Minister of Finance and Revenue, Hon Dr Michael Cullen, for whom it is my privilege to serve as Parliamentary Private Secretary. Dr Cullen could not be here today as he is in a high level forum on growth strategy with 60 of NZ’s top CEOs and the PM in Parliament. He sends his best wishes – and me. As his PPS I have responsibility for specific projects as instructed by the Minister, currently in aspects of the value for money and growth strategies. It is also my pleasure to represent him on occasions such as this. However, in the nature of full disclosure, I have a confession to make: I am not a tax specialist. Before entering Parliament I trained in economics and politics, and worked as a diplomat and then in management consulting. Since I was elected to Parliament in 1999 I have served on the Finance and Expenditure Committee, through which I have been involved in the many issues raised in taxation bills. Taxation is an area of great complexity and great importance. Along with other members of the Finance and Expenditure Committee I have come to appreciate the enormous contribution the Institute of Chartered Accountants makes to tax policy development. Sometimes we agree with you, and sometimes we do not. But your views always deserve careful consideration, and very often are instrumental in guiding the select committee’s consideration. I would like to offer a personal tribute to Chris, Alan, Jeff, Julia, Aylton, John and the rest of the team for their work with FEC. 2 In my speech today I shall focus on the government’s growth and innovation framework and, in particular, on how tax policy initiatives over the next two years will contribute to that. I will then outline some of the other key aspects of the government’s tax policy work programme announced yesterday by Dr Cullen. The government’s growth and innovation framework The aim of the government’s growth and innovation framework is to lift New Zealand’s economic performance. Our goal is to return our per capita income to the top half of the OECD rankings over time. We have had an improved rate of growth over the last decade, compared to the OECD average and this year we could be looking at a rate approaching 4%. However, in order to sustain and lift this we must improve the total factor productivity growth rate. Step one is to recognise the importance of sound fundamentals: a healthy fiscal balance, an independent monetary policy, a world class education system, and the quality social services needed to retain and develop a high calibre workforce. Step two is to use smart techniques to accelerate New Zealand’s ability to become a source of high-value innovation in particular sectors of the global economy. The government believes the problem must be tackled on several fronts: o by developing and retaining New Zealanders’ skills and talent and attracting overseas talent to live and work here; o by enhancing the innovation system to allow better commercialisation of our ideas; o and by increasing what is called our “global connectedness” – attracting more foreign direct investment, improving our export promotion, and modernising New Zealand’s branding. With this strategic framework the government will also be focusing its resources on several areas of the economy that have the potential to leverage productivity and growth across the economy: biotechnology, information and communications technology, and the creative industries. 3 In summary then, the government’s growth and innovation policy framework sets out a way of identifying what is needed to achieve long-term improvements that will get us there. It involves a whole-of-government approach, in partnership with business and industry. As an example of this approach, at a practical level, the government has already begun a number of initiatives aimed at facilitating business growth. These initiatives are targeted at businesses at all stages of the business life-cycle, as shown in figure 1. Figure 1: Working with business 4 Role of tax in the growth and innovation strategy Given the important relationship of tax and business, the government’s growth and innovation goals require tax policy that is both innovative and sound. Tax policy must support the government’s fiscal position, while ensuring that business decisions are made for good business reasons – not for tax reasons. With this proviso, it has the potential, if properly used, to assist and reinforce the key levers of productivity growth. If used poorly it can have the reverse effect - the Muldoon government of the late 1970s and early 1980s used tax policy to encourage things it wanted to see happen and to discourage things it did not approve of. The result of uncoordinated and heavy-handed interventions was a jumble of incentives and disincentives that created numerous, sometimes gross, distortions. From the mid-1980s to late 1990s, the pendulum swung radically in the other direction, towards a broad-base, low-rate model that offered little room for the tax system to shape economic decisions. However, the disappointing growth performance over the decade of the 1990s as a whole, and the increasing social division and dislocation which emerged with it, left a majority of New Zealanders convinced that the neoclassical model had produced too little gain, for too much pain. Moreover, neoclassicism applied with puritanical zeal in a remote, small economy, was demonstrably unable to provide the rate of increase in productivity growth we need to realise our economic and social goals. There are some people still alive and in politics today who, like broken records, are stuck on the same old track. That LP fell off the hit parade about 1999 and can now only be bought in curiosity shops. 5 Over the last three years the model has evolved again. We have demonstrated a moderate, pragmatic approach to smart, active government. Within that we see tax policy as having a positive role to play in building a fairer society. We agree with the McLeod Tax Review that the basic architecture of our tax system is sound and should not be radically altered. In the election Labour made a commitment that it would not increase income tax or GST. We will keep to that commitment. We also agree with the McLeod report that we would not be better off with a general capital gains tax, death duties or similar tax measures used in other countries. The sound, sensible, relatively simple tax system that we have in New Zealand is a key competitive advantage internationally. We will keep that. But there may be features of the tax system that are proving to be a barrier to growth and innovation, and we are keen to identify them and remove them where we can. The government has identified three areas on which we should focus: international tax, compliance costs for small to medium-sized enterprises, and specific issues identified by various growth and innovation taskforces. International linkages One way tax policy can contribute to growth and innovation is to reduce the extent to which tax is a barrier to New Zealand doing business with the rest of the world. Good double tax agreements with key trading partners have an important role to play here. So do government efforts to ensure that our tax laws facilitate cross-border business. More radical changes to the tax system to rationalise the taxation of outbound investment and to make New Zealand more attractive to overseas capital and migrants were proposed by the Tax Review in its report to the government just under a year ago. 6 The government is continuing to consider and consult on these recommendations. One, relating to New Zealanders’ offshore portfolio equity investments, is – in certain circumstances – to apply a simpler, risk-free rate of return method of taxing investments. Another Tax Review recommendation under consideration is aimed at attracting highly skilled, high-income migrants to work and live here. The idea would be to grant them an exemption for a limited period from taxation in New Zealand on certain foreign-sourced income. A third Tax Review recommendation relating to international taxation was to reduce the tax burden on new foreign direct investment from 33 percent to 18 percent, in the case of company tax. As the Minister of Revenue announced at the time of the May budget, the government had been advised by officials that the proposal was unworkable, except as a transitional measure. The Minister said that before he concluded his consideration, however, he would release officials’ analysis of the proposal for comment from interested parties. That report is now available at this conference and on the website of the Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue. The release of the report is a further step in the policy development process, and, meanwhile, officials are continuing to look at options in this area. However, it is important to note that the government’s commitment to encouraging strategic foreign investment in high-leverage areas of the real economy is strong. That is reflected in the creation of the new Investment Promotion Agency, and it is an area in which I will personally take a close ongoing interest. 7 Compliance costs for small to medium-sized enterprises A second way tax policy affects growth and innovation is through the tax-related compliance cost of doing business. The government is seeking to reduce the compliance costs of tax, with the spotlight on small to medium-sized enterprises, since they form a more significant part of the economy in New Zealand than they do in most other OECD countries. New Zealand has an average of six employees per firm, whereas businesses in most other OECD companies average from ten to twenty employees each. Small to medium-sized businesses with fewer than twenty employees account for 97 percent of all businesses in New Zealand. They are also important to the business income tax base, as shown in figure 2. Self- employed people who work on their own or businesses that employ five or fewer staff contribute 41 percent of business income tax revenue. The next significant contribution to the business income tax base, 26 percent, comes from a small number of large businesses, with relatively little from the middle. Figure 2: New Zealand’s business income tax base by number of employees -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100+ 110 120 -20000 0 20000 40000 6000080000100000120000140000160000 180000 ca do do number of employees number of firms Income Tax 5 or fewer em ployees 41% 26 % 100+ employees 8 The government is looking at both legislation and administrative practices to reduce compliance costs on small to medium-sized enterprises in particular. The compliance cost burden seems to fall on this group disproportionately, since many compliance costs are largely fixed, no matter the size of the business. For example, when a business takes on its first employee it also encounters extra regulatory requirements in relation to PAYE, possibly fringe benefit tax, ACC, OSH and so on. The burden of doing so is little different for the first employee, the tenth or the hundredth. That’s why small business is most sensitive to compliance costs. There is scope for improving tax design and tax administration to help reduce compliance costs for these businesses. But the emphasis now is moving from simplifying systems per se, to looking at how those systems impact on growing businesses – in other words, looking at the business life-cycle and tax impacts at the key moments in that life cycle. The life-cycle approach involves looking at the different problems businesses face when they start up, once they are established, during expansion and on maturity or cessation. Officials have been instructed to think outside the square. The government is keen to look at proposals that make for positive change, and not just tinkering with the system. Nevertheless, we have to be realistic about tax-related compliance costs. There is a natural limit to how much compliance costs can be reduced for these businesses, especially when you consider that New Zealand imposes relatively low costs. A recently published OECD survey on compliance costs in ten countries found New Zealand’s tax-related compliance costs to be at the low end of the scale, as shown in figure 3. 9 Figure 3: OECD figures on tax-related compliance costs for companies with 1-19 employees 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 AustraliaAustriaBelgiumFinlandIcelandNew Zealand NorwayPortugalSpainSweden Taskforces A third way tax policy can contribute to growth and innovation is for the government to be open to the concerns of the various business sectors. This does not mean introducing tax incentives for target sectors. Rather, it means government and business working together to identify roadblocks to growth, and working in a co- operative way to unblock them. A partnership between the government and the private sector is far more achievable in a country the size of New Zealand than in a large one. We have achieved a lot in this area, and it is a key international advantage for New Zealand. The government is strongly committed to delivering real gains through partnership with the business and community. Only by the broader community understanding and owning the imperative that we must “play to win” as “team NZ” can we accelerate productivity gains to the necessary level in the increasingly complex global game. US dollars 10 As part of this approach, the government has chosen to focus resources on three key lateral areas that have been identified for their high-growth potential and, more importantly, their leverage value across the economy as a whole. They are biotechnology, information and communication technology, and the creative industries. Figure 4: Growth and innovation framework The government has set up a Growth and Innovation Advisory Board comprising representatives from the private sector to advise it on the overall implementation of the growth and innovation framework. Growth and Innovation Framework Growth and Innovation Advisory Board Information & communication technology Creative industries Biotechnology Minister of RS & T (Hon Peter Hodgson) ICT Taskforce Minister of IT (Hon Paul Swain) Screen Production Industry Taskforce Minister of ED (Hon Jim Anderton) Minister of ED (Hon Jim Anderton) Design Industry (DIT) Skills & talent Innovation system Global connectedness Focus areas Biotechnology Sector Taskforce Growth and Innovation Framework Growth and Innovation Advisory Board Information & communication technology Creative industries Biotechnology Minister of RS & T (Hon Peter Hodgson) ICT Taskforce Minister of IT (Hon Paul Swain) Screen Production Industry Taskforce Minister of ED (Hon Jim Anderton) Minister of ED (Hon Jim Anderton) Design Industry (DIT) Skills & talent Innovation system Global connectedness Focus areas Biotechnology Sector Taskforce 11 As shown in figure 4, four private sector taskforces working within the target sectors are also part of the growth and innovation framework. They are: o the Biotechnology Sector Taskforce, which reports to the Minister of Research, Science and Technology; o the Information and Communication Technology Taskforce, which reports to the Minister for Information Technology; o and for the creative industries, the Screen Production Industry Taskforce and the Design Industry Taskforce, both reporting to the Minister for Economic Development. These focus areas will help drive productivity gains across a range of specific industry sectors. Work is continuing with major sectors like dairy, forestry, fisheries, and others to accelerate the drivers and reduce the roadblocks to growth as we apply the emerging results of the lateral focus areas I have just described. The various taskforces have been charged with identifying and considering measures that will help their sectors grow. Tax has already emerged as an issue as the taskforces progress their work, and officials are working closely with them to ensure that tax issues can be properly considered from different perspectives. The government expects there to emerge from this work a small but important package of useful tax issues that are central to the growth and innovation strategy. They will then be progressed through the normal generic tax policy process. A tax issue that has surfaced so far is the way the shareholder continuity rules affect small, rapidly growing companies. This does not mean allowing larger companies to shelter income by buying the tax losses incurred by others. We have rules to stop this and we do not intend to alter that position. However, those rules also mean that when a small company with a history of tax losses introduces a new equity partner as it expands it can lose all its accumulated losses. This can hinder the growth of such firms for reasons unrelated to tax loss trading. We need to see whether we can protect the tax base without such adverse consequences. 12 The taskforces are looking at identifying a small number of issues of a similar nature. We also need to confirm that the new research and development tax rules deliver the intended policy result. R&D The last few days have seen renewed comment in the media on research and development expenditure. There has been a call for more private and public sector investment in R&D from the Knowledge Wave Trust. Larry Ellison of Oracle has also been reported as saying he is looking at setting up an R&D facility here in New Zealand. In 2001 the government changed the law relating to the tax treatment of R&D expenditure, aligning it more closely with the accounting treatment. This Institute helped the government to develop that reform. What the change meant was that, in practice, expenditure that most jurisdictions consider to be R&D is immediately deductible for tax purposes. The government chose to allow immediate deductions rather than take the road of Australia, which allows more than 100 percent deductibility for some types of R&D expenditure, but is surrounded by complex rules and red tape to protect the revenue base. Instead, the government supplemented immediate deductibility with more generous R&D grants. A liaison group of private sector people, Dr Cullen and Mr Hodgson has been set up to ensure that the new rules operate as intended, though we think we have solved most of the problems that people identified with the uncertainties of the previous rules. The government is keen to hear if problems arise in the interpretation of the new rules. 13 Update on other major issues GST and financial services You will no doubt be aware of the release earlier this week of the government discussion document on proposed changes to the GST treatment of financial services. These are the latest proposals to emerge from the government’s continuing review of the GST legislation. I am aware that New Zealand’s GST is regarded internationally as a model for its simplicity and for its comprehensive coverage, although the financial services area is one of the few exemptions. The aim of the latest discussion document is to broaden the ambit of GST to enable financial institutions to be treated more like other businesses. The government is therefore proposing to bring more financial services within the GST system, and one means of achieving this is by zero-rating the supply of these services to registered businesses. This would enable financial institutions to recover GST on purchases related to the supply of their services to businesses. Tax and privilege I see from your programme that tax privilege is the subject of tomorrow’s keynote address. As you know, in a discussion document released in June for public comment, the government proposed a new code for tax and privilege to replace the current legal privilege in tax matters. Submissions on the proposals have been received, and the government is now considering them. Needless to say, the submissions demonstrate a variety of views on the proposals. It will be interesting to see what new perspectives emerge from this conference’s consideration of the proposals. 14 Compliance and penalties review The first stage of the government’s compliance and penalties review is nearing completion. The bill containing major reforms to the taxpayer debt and hardship rules in the Tax Administration Act is close to enactment. Another bill containing further changes arising from the review – in relation to shortfall penalties, Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers, and a new promoter penalty – is being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. The government is planning a broader look at the legislation for the second stage of the compliance and penalties review, together with a number of technical problems that need sorting out, many of which were raised in submissions. The work will include an investigation of whether the current rules are improving voluntary compliance. Triangular taxation Plans for a joint New Zealand-Australian approach to relieving double taxation of investments in companies that operate in both countries are progressing. Following the release of the joint discussion document in March, both governments have considered the submissions and have undertaken further consultation. The next step is for legislation to be introduced in both countries. There is a good chance that this could happen next year, the twentieth anniversary of CER with Australia. Tax policy work programme More information about current tax policy issues is to be found on the government’s tax policy work programme, which was released yesterday. The programme is built around the two planks of supporting the government’s growth and innovation framework and its policies to build social cohesion. This is where most tax policy resources are going. Also included in the work programme are base maintenance measures to protect the revenue stream that have not been announced, though work on them is continuing, you will be pleased to know. The work programme also includes a number of initiatives that are already in progress, such as the review of credit unions. 15 To conclude, she’s a hard road finding the perfect tax system. Perhaps this conference provides the tax equivalent of a brewery tasting vault. I hope my comments today have thrown light on where the government’s growth and innovation framework is going, and the role of tax policy in contributing to growth and innovation. Thank you.

Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 1 3 May 2002 Minister of Finance and Revenue (Hon Dr Michael Cullen) cc: Associate Minister of Finance (Hon Trevor Mallard) Associate Minister of Finance and Revenue (Hon Paul Swain) Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Minister of Revenue (John Wright) Taxation of inbound investment Executive summary The Tax Review proposed that the Government decrease tax on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). It recommended doing so in a way that produced a dramatic reduction in the headline rates as follows: • Reduce the company tax rate for foreigners from 33% to 18%; and • Reduce the non-resident withholding tax rate on dividends (NRWT) from 15% to 2% The Tax Review also recommended increasing the effectiveness of other taxes that apply to FDI. The net result would be to reduce effective tax rates on FDI from the current approximate range of 15.75% to 33% to an approximate range of 12.41% to 19.64%. Two options were advanced as a way forward. Policy Option One was to apply the lower tax rate to all FDI. Policy Option Two (the Review’s preferred option) was to apply the lower tax rate only to new FDI. Benefits and Costs of FDI FDI provides productive capital without having to rely on domestic savings. This can contribute to achieving higher economic output. However, to be of benefit to New Zealanders’ increased FDI must produce benefits to New Zealanders over and above the return provided to the foreign investor. This is likely to come in the form of higher incomes for New Zealand employees. In simple terms this means more or better jobs than would exist in the absence of the FDI. These benefits need to be greater than the welfare cost of raising tax from other revenue sources. Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 2 Economic framework for taxing FDI The economic framework considers how tax revenue can be collected in a way that minimises economic costs. As a general principle this means taxing residents on a broad base at a low as possible rate on their world-wide income (the residence principle). This is on the assumption that New Zealand residents cannot avoid the incidence or burden of New Zealand tax so that it should be applied equally to all types of investment. Foreign investors, on the other hand, may be able to avoid New Zealand tax by investing elsewhere. If they have complete freedom to do so they will be able to withdraw investment from New Zealand until the point where any tax New Zealand imposes is offset by higher returns on their New Zealand investment. In such a case none of the incidence of tax is borne by the foreign investor and all of the incidence of tax is borne by New Zealanders, for example in the form of lower investment and lower wages. In these extreme circumstances it would be more efficient for New Zealand not to tax FDI at all. In determining the best tax treatment of FDI, therefore, an important issue concerns a judgement as to how sensitive FDI is to New Zealand tax. If New Zealand can impose high taxes on FDI and FDI is insensitive to tax so that the level and type of FDI is unaffected this would be an efficient New Zealand tax since New Zealand is then obtaining government revenue at no economic cost. FDI will be insensitive to New Zealand tax if any tax New Zealand imposes on a foreign investor does not reduce the after-all-taxes return to the non-resident investor because, for instance, the New Zealand tax is offset by a reduction in overseas taxes on that investor, by way of foreign tax credits. Alternatively, FDI may be insensitive to New Zealand tax if the investment is returning economic rents, that is, earnings in excess of that required to keep it in New Zealand. If FDI is sensitive to New Zealand tax the issue is how sensitive, and to what degree can New Zealand raise tax revenue at a low economic cost. Any reduction of tax on tax-sensitive FDI is still likely to result in a fiscal cost so that the welfare costs arising from replacing the net revenue loss need to be offset by net benefits to New Zealand, most likely in the form of more or better-paid jobs. Application to the Review’s proposals The Review’s proposals had two elements: • reduce the level of New Zealand tax on FDI; and • have this reduction focused on the company and NRWT “headline” rates so as to produce substantial reduction in these headline rates. The Review also preferred that tax rate reductions be limited to new FDI. A difficulty in determining whether New Zealand should reduce the level of tax on FDI is that, as noted above, this turns on the sensitivity to tax of FDI and we have no accurate gauge Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 3 of that. Moreover, it is highly likely that FDI spans the spectrum from highly tax sensitive to highly tax insensitive with no simple mechanism of distinguishing between these different reactions to tax. This difficulty is illustrated by the fact that the ability of FDI to offset New Zealand tax by using foreign tax credits is a significant reason why FDI might be insensitive to tax. Yet, about half of New Zealand’s existing FDI comes from countries that do not provide such credits and of those that do provide credits these are normally limited to tax only on repatriated profit. Even where foreign tax credits do offset New Zealand tax it is possible that an adverse reaction by foreign governments could have the same effect of offsetting New Zealand tax reductions with overseas tax increases. There is no reliable New Zealand evidence on the marginal tax sensitivity of FDI. Overseas evidence suggests that the sensitivity elsewhere is moderate but growing. Using relatively high estimates of FDI tax sensitivity suggests that New Zealand would still have a significant ($370 million pa) net revenue loss from reducing tax on all FDI as proposed by the Review and that even on generous assumptions it would seem unlikely that any such net revenue loss would be offset by a sufficient increase in benefits to New Zealanders such as more or better paid jobs. (Note that the revenue loss, prior to factoring in any increase in FDI, is around 500 million.) If a cut in taxes on FDI could be targeted, as the Review preferred, by limiting any such tax reduction to new FDI it is more likely that this would produce net benefits to New Zealand. However, our view is that any such limitation would be unsustainable after a relatively short period (5-10 years). For these reasons we conclude that, in our judgement, it is not desirable to implement the Review’s recommended changes to the taxation of FDI at this time. A second aspect of the Review’s recommendations was to focus any reduction of tax on headline tax rates. We can see the value of greater transparency of what are effective tax rates and compressing the extent to which they are determined by the mechanism used to finance FDI. However, there seems little room to manoeuvre on this point if there is no prior decision to reduce overall effective tax rates on FDI. Recommendations It is recommended that you: (a) Agree that application of the recommended lower rates of tax cannot be restricted to new FDI except as a transitional measure. As a result, the annual fiscal cost of implementing the Review’s reforms is around $500 million per annum. Agreed/Not agreed Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 4 (b) Note officials’ analysis is that a reduction in tax on FDI seems unlikely to produce sufficient benefits to New Zealand to offset the welfare costs of raising the revenue on other productive activity in New Zealand. Noted (c) Agree that it is necessary to keep the current tax treatment of FDI under review, in view of the importance of FDI to New Zealand’s economic development and in order to improve our understanding of the impacts of tax on FDI. Agreed/Not agreed (d) Agree to include a statement in the Budget indicating: • the Review’s recommended changes to the current tax treatment of FDI and the rationale underlying those recommendations; • that the Government shares the Review’s concerns regarding the significant and rising economic costs of taxing FDI and has considered the merits of the Review’s recommended reforms; • the Government is persuaded by officials’ comments that the revenue loss from reducing tax on all FDI as proposed by the Review is unlikely to be offset by a sufficient increase in benefits to New Zealanders; • the Government will release an analysis along the lines of this report, of the Review’s recommendations for private sector comment. Agreed/Not agreed Peter Wilson Robin Oliver for Secretary to the Treasury General Manager, Policy Inland Revenue Hon Dr Michael Cullen Minister of Finance and Revenue Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 5 Background 1. The Tax Review recommended that the Government consider reducing the tax burden on foreign direct investment (FDI) as a means of attracting more FDI. 2. You subsequently asked us to analyse whether implementing the Review’s recommendation would be desirable (T2001/2075: PAD2001/334 of 14 December 2001 refers). 3. This report assesses the extent to which New Zealand would gain from implementing the Review’s recommended changes to the current tax treatment of FDI. Strategic Context 4. The two key aspects to the Government’s strategy for building an economy capable of sustaining higher growth rates are: • Strengthening the foundations; and • Building more effective innovation. 5. More and better FDI is part of more effective innovation. The Tax Review’s recommendations on inbound investment stemmed from its view that an increase in FDI is imperative in order for New Zealand to prosper in the global economy, the expectation is that more FDI will benefit New Zealand by increasing the population’s entrepreneurial, managerial and scientific skills. 6. In this report, we examine the Review’s expectation. In particular, we look at the role the tax system can play in ensuring that New Zealand has enough FDI to prosper and grow. 7. At the same time, non-residents own a large proportion of the corporate tax base, so any tax reduction on FDI potentially has high fiscal costs, especially if applied to existing investments. Maintaining tax revenues is part of ensuring strong foundations. Outline of this report 8. The remainder of this report is organised as follows: • We discuss the costs and benefits of FDI to New Zealand; and • We then set out an economic framework for deciding how a small open economy should tax inbound investment in general; • To put the Review’s recommendations in context, we briefly discuss how FDI (and other inwards investment for comparison purposes) is currently taxed; Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 6 • We conclude by assessing the Review’s specific recommendations. The Nature of FDI, its Benefits and Costs 9. FDI can be defined in two broad ways, that undertaken respectively by “vertically” and “horizontally” integrated firms. 10. Vertically integrated firms fragment the production process into stages based on factor intensities and locate activities according to international differences in factor prices. Examples here are car firms building different parts of a car in different countries, and then bringing the parts together for assembly at multiple plants. 11. Horizontally integrated multinationals are firms that produce the same product in multiple plants, serving local markets by local production. Examples here are banking, computers and telecommunications. 12. We would stress, and this is very important to the question of taxing FDI below, that these categories, while helpful in explaining why FDI occurs, should not be taken to imply that FDI can be neatly compartmentalized. Many multinational firms are both vertically and horizontally integrated. The Benefits 13. The primary benefit of FDI is its contribution to higher productivity for New Zealand. Benefits to New Zealand occur particularly through positive externalities and knowledge spillovers including technology transfers, innovation and human capital accumulation. Spillovers arise from both vertical and horizontal FDI. 14. FDI provides productive capital without having to rely on domestic savings. Investment is higher than domestic savings, resulting in more jobs and increases in output. By the same token FDI allows New Zealanders to invest offshore, diversify their investment portfolios and minimise volatility, without compromising domestic capital accumulation. 15. Finally, like all productive activity in the economy, FDI raises revenue both from tax on the investment return to foreigners and from tax on higher New Zealand incomes. 16. The quality of FDI is as important as quantity. However, the often-popular distinction that a green field is ‘good FDI’ and mergers & acquisitions is ‘bad FDI’ is a false one. FDI is good to the degree that it facilitates the sorts of spillover discussed above and realises productivity benefits in New Zealand, which in turn translate into higher real incomes for New Zealand workers. 17. The benefits to New Zealand of FDI come from higher incomes and taxes. They do not accrue from the profits of the investment - since these accrue to the foreign investor. The distinction here is between Gross Domestic product (GDP) and Gross National Product Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 7 (GNP). GDP measures the amount of goods and services produced in New Zealand, regardless of the ownership of the returns from that production. GNP, on the other hand, measures the returns to New Zealanders from the production of goods and services anywhere in the world. 18. FDI increases GDP: it results in more goods and services being produced in New Zealand. It will increase GNP if there are spillovers: higher real incomes and improved production processes that can be mimicked by domestically owned firms. 19. An extreme example shows that FDI attracted to New Zealand by a zero tax rate might not bring any material benefits to New Zealand. Imagine a new factory that is owned by non- residents and is staffed by foreign workers, imports all its intermediate goods and that exports its entire product. The exports would count as GDP. Leaving aside the construction phase of the factory and incidental inputs like power and water, there would be no GNP from this plant: all the gains accrue to non-residents. On paper, in terms of GDP per head, New Zealand would look wealthier, but in terms of how much we could consume or save (GNP per head) there would be no change. 20. This is an extreme example, but it is presented to make a point: the benefits of FDI come from net additions to GNP. If the advent of the factory resulted in increased employment, GNP would increase (the wages paid to previously unemployed people). Likewise if New Zealand entrepreneurs could learn from the example of the new factory – for example by observing best practice stock control, that would allow GNP to increase over time. Costs of FDI 21. FDI is not, however, without costs to an economy. 22. The domestic resources that are employed by FDI are an opportunity cost to the rest of the economy: a worker employed in a factory owned by a non-resident cannot be employed in a domestically owned firm. Thus an economy at or close to full-employment might not benefit from FDI if it simply results in resources being moved from one productive sector to another. 23. This does not mean that economies at full employment should eschew FDI. Rather, it shows that the benefits from FDI have to be measured at the margin: • what is the increase in total employment coming from FDI, not how many people are employed in the new factory; • what is the increase in wages paid to people who move from an old employer to a new employer, not the wage bill of the new employer? Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 8 Measuring the costs and benefits 24. Quantifying the costs and benefits of FDI is difficult. What is needed is information at the margin about: (i) how much existing economic activity is displaced by FDI; (ii) the extent of increases in incomes to New Zealanders; (iii) net changes in employment and (iv) the welfare costs of raising tax from other sources. 25. In a tax system that is not optimal, a change for which the benefits outweigh the costs would represent a movement to a more efficient system. However, the above argument has stressed that the marginal costs and benefits need to be measured in terms of changes in the welfare of New Zealanders. It would be quite possible, for example, for FDI to increase by substantially more than the extra revenue that needs to be raised from New Zealand residents, while at the same time the extra benefits are considerably lower than the burden (the efficiency losses) caused by the distortions arising from the need to raise extra tax. In other words, the proper metrics in this context are: • On the benefits side: the net addition to GNP from FDI; and • On the cost side, the change in total deadweight loss that comes from a shift from taxing FDI to taxing some other activity. 26. For example, suppose that the effect of taxes on FDI is to raise the cost of capital in New Zealand, thereby shifting the burden to fixed factors in New Zealand. A reduction in taxes on FDI, combined with a revenue-neutral increase in taxes on those New Zealand fixed factors, would have no effect on the burden they face. This represents an unambiguous gain to New Zealand, to the extent that the tax change increases the amount of FDI and, in turn, that GNP (rather than simply GDP) is increased. The economics of taxing FDI 27. We now turn to the twin issues of how taxes affect FDI and how taxing FDI can affect the rest of the economy. The Basic Framework 28. In this section, we analyse the Tax Review’s recommendations in “optimal taxation” terms. That is, we ask the question “is taxing non-residents on the income they earn in New Zealand the least-cost (i.e., least deadweight loss) way of raising revenue in terms of national welfare?” This is not an easy question to answer, either analytically or empirically. What follows is a summary of our analysis of the issue. Further details can be supplied if you wish. 29. We would also stress that this sort of analysis is not a different principle from measuring the costs and benefits of FDI outlined above, it just makes the same point differently. 30. The answer to this question critically turns on the issue of the economic incidence of a tax on non-residents. That is, do non-residents actually bear the economic burden of taxes Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 9 that New Zealand seeks to impose of them, or can they shift that burden to New Zealanders and if they do so, what are the economic consequences? 31. If New Zealand can lower the after-all-taxes rate of return that non-residents earn in New Zealand without affecting their behaviour, then taxing them will involve a net gain to New Zealand. In other words, if we can tax FDI without an effect on the level or type of FDI in New Zealand real economic resources will be transferred from the rest of the world to New Zealand in addition to the economic gains from any investment undertaken in New Zealand by those non-residents. 32. If, however, non-residents can shift the incidence of any New Zealand tax to factors of production in New Zealand, then New Zealand will be worse off. No resources will be extracted from non-residents and there will be less investment in New Zealand. 33. The simplest example of the effects of taxing non-residents is the portfolio debt market. Below we consider whether there is anything different about foreign direct investment that might lead to a modification of the conclusions of the analysis of the debt market. 34. Investors in the portfolio debt market are motivated solely by the (risk-adjusted) rate of return they can earn from their investments: they are not investing to take a stake in the management of their investment target. Such investor from off-shore will, therefore, compare the after-all-taxes return they can earn in New Zealand with the after-all-taxes return they can earn elsewhere when deciding where to invest. 35. This point is critical to the analysis: non-residents have investment choices outside New Zealand. It is this that drives how they respond to any tax that New Zealand might seek to impose on them. 36. Consider non-resident portfolio investors who can earn a 10% return after paying taxes at home. If they are to invest in New Zealand, they will need to earn at least 10% after New Zealand and home taxes 1 . 37. Consider now an investment project in New Zealand paying 10% before New Zealand taxes, but upon which New Zealand imposed a 33% tax. The after New Zealand rate of return is now 6.7%. Non-residents will not take up this opportunity, because they have better options at home. 38. The only way to induce non-residents to invest in New Zealand is for the before-New Zealand tax rate to increase, so that the after-New Zealand tax return at least equals the alternatives available elsewhere. 39. Returning to our example, a pre-New Zealand tax rate of return of 15% would be required to attract non-resident investors. 40. The end result is: 1 This assumes that the non-resident’s home country taxes its residents on their worldwide income at the same rate as it taxes domestic income. The results of what follows are not altered if this is not the case Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 10 • Non-resident investors earns the required post-New Zealand tax rate of return, in this case 10%; • New Zealand has raised some revenue; but • New Zealand borrowers have to pay a higher cost of capital: in this case, 15%. 41. What has happened is that the burden of the tax imposed on non-residents has been shifted to New Zealand borrowers. And, because of the way capital markets work, it means that the cost of capital to all New Zealand borrowers will be increased. 42. In terms of optimal tax policy, what this suggests is that New Zealand should seek to raise revenue from borrowers directly, say through a higher income tax or consumption tax rate 2 . If it did so, then: • the level of government spending can be maintained; • borrowers are no worse off (they pay a tax directly, rather than having the incidence of a tax shifted onto them indirectly); and • the economy is better off by the reduction in the cost of capital – there is more investment. 43. This is another key point: the economic analysis of taxing non-residents is not saying the economy can be improved by reducing a tax on one sector, with that reduction financed by a reduction in spending elsewhere. Rather, it is saying that there is a better way to raise the same amount of revenue. The residence principle 44. The discussion above suggests that, as a starting point, New Zealand should adopt the “residence principle”, under which: • New Zealanders are taxed on their world-wide income on a broad base under the same income measurement rules at a uniform rate: the “broad base, low rate” approach; but • Non-residents are not taxed by New Zealand on income they earn here. 45. The desirability of the residence principle is subject to the caveat that New Zealanders with capital are also not mobile. There are considerable administrative and compliance difficulties involved in taxing New Zealanders on offshore income derived especially via intermediaries. However, we can approximate the taxation of worldwide income through mechanisms such as CFC and FIF rules. We cannot, however, stop New Zealanders leaving the country, establishing residence in another country and investing into New Zealand. 2 This is the application of the “production efficiency result”, due to Nobel Prize winning-economist Sir James Mirrlees that says that governments should impose distorting taxes on outputs from the production process, not on inputs to that process. So, for example, a GST- style tax on consumption is to be preferred to a revenue-equivalent cascading wholesale sales tax. Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 11 46. If the capital of non-residents and New Zealand residents with capital are both perfectly mobile, then the viability of taxing any income from capital needs to be questioned. We do not think that we have yet reached that point. We can say that both capital and high wealth individuals are becoming more mobile but at this point capital seems, overall more mobile than residence. When should FDI be taxed? 47. There are two circumstances when New Zealand gathers what might be termed “free revenue” from taxing non-residents, that is revenue at low (or even zero) economic cost to New Zealand. These circumstances are when: • The non-resident is earning “economic rents” and is thus not sensitive to the New Zealand tax; and • The foreign government allows a foreign tax credit for New Zealand tax. In this case the after-tax return of the non-resident does not change making the non-resident less sensitive to tax. Instead the foreign treasury bears the burden of the tax imposed on the non-resident investor. 48. Using this sort of approach, the desirability of any given regime for taxing FDI is determined by the extent to which non-residents (or foreign treasuries) bear the economic burden of a tax imposed on them. If foreign investors bear the burden of tax this means that they are not sensitive to tax and will not reduce or change the level of FDI in New Zealand because of tax. If that is the case removal of tax on FDI will : • Constitute a wealth transfer from New Zealand to the non-resident and/or the foreign treasury equal to the amount of tax forgone; and • Not result in an increase in FDI. How FDI is currently taxed 49. Government policy is that the imputation system does not apply to non-resident investors. Therefore, New Zealand potentially imposes two layers of tax on investments by non-residents into New Zealand companies, the company tax (at 33%) and Non-residents Withholding Taxes (NRWT) of between 15% and 30% (depending on whether new Zealand has a Double Tax Agreement with the country of residence of the investor) imposed on dividends and interest. 50. However, the effective tax rate on FDI is generally much lower than the statutory rates. This is because: • interest on debt is tax deductible; • the Foreign Investor Tax Credit (FITC) reduces the level of company tax to 21.18%; and Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 12 • often the non-resident taxpayer is entitled to a foreign tax credit for the NRWT. Equity Investment 51. Equity, whether FDI or portfolio investment, is taxed under the normal company tax regime. NRWT applies to dividends, with the rate varying between 15% and 30%, depending on whether New Zealand has a double tax agreement with the country of residence of the investor. 52. The combined effect of these two regimes can be very high effective tax rates on distributed income: between 43.05% and 52.8%. 53. However, the Foreign Investor Tax Credit or “FITC” works to reduce the combined company tax rate and NRWT to rate 33%, where the NRWT rate is 15%. FITC reduces the 33% level of company tax to 21.18% for non-residents. The tax saving must be passed out to the non-resident shareholders at the time of dividend distribution in the form of a supplementary dividend. The combined distribution is then subject to NRWT. If the taxpayer is entitled to a foreign tax credit for the NRWT then the total New Zealand tax is 21.18%. Otherwise it is 33%. 54. The same mathematical result could have been reached by eliminating the 15% NRWT on dividends to non-residents. The reason it was not done this way is because the regime was designed to ensure the benefit of the lower tax rate was passed onto non-residents (and thus indirectly New Zealand through lower cost of capital) rather than the foreign treasuries in the jurisdictions of the non-residents. Debt Investments 55. Debt investment is taxed at a very low rate. This policy is designed to keep the cost of capital low in New Zealand. 56. At the company level, debt is in effect, taxed at a rate of zero, since companies can receive a deduction for their interest expense: there is an exception to this rule – thin capitalisation – which is discussed further below. 57. At the NRWT level, the Approved Issue Levy or “AIL” regime sets a rate of NRWT of zero where the borrower and lender are operating at arms-length. Instead of NRWT, the borrower has to pay a tax-deductible levy of 2%, meaning that the overall effective rate of tax on debt investments is 1.34%. The borrower will usually elect to pay NRWT when the lender can receive a foreign tax credit for that NRWT. 58. The thin capitalisation rules apply to controlled firms that are heavily debt-financed (the benchmark being the world-wide ratio of debt to the sum of debt and equity of the parent group). These rules mean that no more than 75% of the capital of a firm controlled by a non- resident can be debt, with the remaining 25% being taxed as equity. Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 13 59. Non-residents undertaking capital intensive FDI into New Zealand have considerable freedom to finance their investments in the way that is most tax effective. Subject to commercial constraints, and the need for capital in particular, there is considerable flexibility as to whether they provide any internal finance, i.e. finance from the parent to the local subsidiary, in the form of debt or equity. (For external reporting purposes, such intra-firm payments will net out.) They have less flexibility when it comes to external debt (i.e. debt finance provided to the group by third parties like banks and bond-holders), since the interests of the lender need to be taken into account. However, within commercial limits, multi- national firms can treat equity finance, internal debt and external debt as close, if not perfect, substitutes. This means that when considering effective tax rates, it is appropriate to think about the taxation imposed on external debt as forming part of the equation. Combined effect 60. The different tax treatments applied to debt and equity financing and the flexibility that multi-national investors have in structuring their investments means that it is misleading to look only at the company tax rate when analysing the tax treatment of FDI. 61. What matters is the bottom line: how much tax does New Zealand impose, regardless of the form in which an investment is financed. 62. Table 1 summarises the various treatments of inbound investment. These are the New Zealand tax rates. The total tax rate might be higher, depending on home country treatment. 63. The effective rates for equity in Table 1 below are calculated on the basis that, within commercial constraints, firms structure their investments to minimise their New Zealand tax liabilities. We think that this is consistent with reality. Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 14 Table 1: Summary of Current Treatments 3 Minimum Effective Tax Rates (%) Maximum Effective Tax Rates (%) Portfolio Debt 0 4 1.34 5 Portfolio equity 22.18 6 33 7 FDI 0 8 21.5% 9 Analysis of the Review’s recommendations to reduce FDI 64. The Tax Review presented two policy options for reducing tax on FDI: • Policy Option One reduces the company tax rate to 18% to the extent a New Zealand company is owned by non-residents (with a 2% NRWT for FDI investors and repeal of the FITC regime, and 15% NRWT with an extended FITC regime for portfolio investors). • Policy Option Two is the same a Policy Option One except that the 18% rate only applies to new investment by non-residents (being either investment in new activities or certain significant expansions of existing activities). 65. The Review said that, in principle, they preferred Policy Option Two because the tax rate reduction is targeted at new investment. However, this preference was predicated on the ability to distinguish between new and existing investment. Consequently, if it transpires that this distinction is not workable, the Review suggested that the Government consider the merits of Policy Option One. Accordingly, before analysing, in general terms, the Review’s recommendation to lower tax on FDI, we first consider whether it is viable to restrict the low tax rates to new FDI. Limiting the low rate to “new FDI” 66. As mentioned above, the Review favoured Policy Option Two. This is because: 3 All calculations assume the underlying effective New Zealand tax rate is 33 percent. Discrepancies in the tax base mean this will, in general, be only approximately correct. 4 Assumes full foreign tax credits available for interest NRWT. 5 Assumes AIL paid. 6 Assumes full foreign tax credit available for dividend NRWT; no foreign tax credits for underlying company tax 7 Assumes no foreign tax credit available for dividend NRWT. Assumes DTA reduces the rate of NRWT to 15% 8 Assumes full foreign tax credit available for interest and dividend NRWT and for underlying company tax. 9 Assumes no foreign tax credits available. The 21.5 percent is calculated assuming a level of internal debt to equity of 50:50 as follows (.50 x 10%) + (.50 x 33%). We believe the range of “maximum” effective tax rates is 15.75% - 33%. The 15.75 percent is calculated assuming 75 percent associated party debt–financing, as follows: (0.75 x 10%) + (0.25 x 33%) = 15.75 percent. The maximum 33% effective tax rate assumes no associated party debt funding. Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 15 • new FDI is more sensitive to tax; and • reducing the rates of tax for all FDI would involve a large fiscal cost to the Government and, would provide a significant windfall gain to all non-residents with existing investments in New Zealand, with no offsetting benefit to New Zealand in the form of additional FDI. 67. The estimated fiscal cost of Policy Option Two is around $50 million per annum 10 . By contrast, the estimated fiscal costs of Policy Option One, which would reduce headline rates for all FDI, is approximately $500 million per annum 11 . 68. As noted by the Review, the viability of Policy Option Two depends upon the design of a satisfactory mechanism to quarantine the application of the tax reductions to income from new FDI in New Zealand. 69. The Review provided suggestions on the design of Policy Option Two. Officials believe that the Review’s idea of an “advance certification” regime supported by legislative criteria for determining new investment could be designed and should work for a limited period. (Although though we note that deciding whether IRD or an economic development agency should administer this regime would require further consideration.) 70. The regime would very likely have some arbitrary features to facilitate administration and minimise tax avoidance associated with recharacterisation of old investment as new investment. Even so, we expect mechanisms for exploiting the boundary between new and old investment would erode the regime over time. 71. Moreover, the costs of the regime would inevitably rise as existing capital stocks were, legitimately, replaced with new capital stocks. In other words, non-residents who currently have FDI in New Zealand and who replace their old capital stock with new capital stock, would expect to qualify for the new low rate. Consequently the proportion of FDI under the new rate would increase over time. 72. At some point the boundary would become unsustainable both politically and economically. We estimate that this point would be reached in 5 to 10 years. 73. We conclude, therefore, that Policy Option Two can only be regarded as a transitional means of ultimately implementing Policy Option One. If the Government decided to pursue Policy Option Two it would be highly desirable to signal at the outset when the dual rate system would expire and whether the single rate would be set at the new low rate for all FDI. 10 Assuming a robust distinction could be drawn between new and existing FDI activity, we estimated the static revenue cost of Policy Option One was a maximum of $50 million each year. This calculation assumes no growth in FDI and treats all flows of FDI as “new” investment. Of course this cost would compound each year so that in year two the reduction in revenue from the current level would be $100 million, in year three $150 million, and so on. Further more, although such a static revenue estimate is consistent with Government budgetary requirements, officials would need to incorporate some of the dynamic factors to provide a more complete picture of the revenue implications. For instance this would need to include the effect on costings of new FDI that would have come to NZ anyway under existing tax rates: New FDI is made each year under existing tax rates. Reducing the rates represents a loss of tax on investment that would have to come to New Zealand regardless. 11 Our estimated costs for Policy Option One is slightly more than the estimate provided in the Tax Review’s Final Report. (The estimate in that report was $460 million.) Obtaining reliable costings is difficult. We propose to undertake further work on costings prior to this analysis being released for consultation. Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 16 Analysis of the Review’s recommendation to lower tax rates on FDI 74. We now turn to assessing the Review’s proposed changes to the current tax treatment of FDI from the perspective of whether tax rates should be changed as a way of attracting more FDI (or a particular amount of additional FDI). 75. In analysing the Review’s recommendations we focus on the extent to which: • a reduction in New Zealand’s taxation of FDI would reduce the after-all taxes rates of return earned by non-resident investors; and • FDI is sensitive to changes in the after-all taxes rates of return available to non-resident investors; and • the fiscal cost of lowering taxes on FDI results in additional economic costs. Impact of lowering the tax rates on FDI on after-all-taxes returns to non-residents from FDI 76. In principle, the Review’s recommended reforms have the potential to increase the amount of FDI in New Zealand by: • increasing the after-all-taxes rates of return to non-resident investors, thereby reducing the extent to which New Zealand taxes reduce the level of FDI in New Zealand; and • reducing differences in the rates of tax that New Zealand applies to substitutable forms of FDI in New Zealand, thereby reducing the extent to which the New Zealand tax system distorts patterns of FDI in New Zealand. (Although as we noted at paragraph 25, only certain forms of FDI brings benefits to New Zealand.) 77. In practice, however, the extent to which the recommended reforms will achieve these objectives depends on a number of factors including the extent to which: • the reduction in statutory rates will reduce the effective rates of tax that New Zealand imposes on FDI and differences in those effective rates of tax between alternative forms of FDI; and • reductions in the rates of New Zealand tax are offset by increases in the rates of foreign tax applying to that income, due to reductions in the foreign tax credits that can be claimed by non-resident investors; and • other countries retaliate by raising the amount of tax levied on income from FDI in New Zealand. 78. We deal with each of these three items in turn below. Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 17 (i) Impact on effective rates of New Zealand tax 79. As discussed in section 8.45 of the Review’s Final Report, the recommended reforms to the tax treatment of FDI have the potential to reduce the economic costs of taxing FDI by: • Reducing the effective rates of tax New Zealand imposes on the income non-residents derive from their FDI. At the moment, assuming (i) a 50:50 debt equity ratio; and (ii) no foreign tax credits, the effective tax rate on FDI is around 21.5 percent. By contrast, the Review’s recommended approach (company tax rate of 18 percent plus NRWT at 2 percent) would, using the same assumptions, reduce the effective tax rate for non- resident investors to around 14.82 percent. • Reducing differences in the effective rates of tax imposed on alternative forms of FDI. Under the current tax treatment of FDI, assuming no foreign tax credits are available, the effective tax rates of New Zealand tax on the income of non-residents from FDI can range from approximately 15.75 percent to 33 percent. By contrast, under the Review’s recommended tax treatment of FDI, effective tax rates on FDI would range from 12.41% percent to 19.64 percent. (ii) Effect of foreign tax credits on “after all tax” returns derived by non-residents 80. The actual level and pattern of FDI in New Zealand depends not only on the rates of tax that New Zealand imposes on that investment income, but also on the rates of tax that are imposed by the home country in which non-resident investors reside. 81. If a non-resident investor is resident in a country that exempts New Zealand FDI income from tax (eg Australia, Canada and Hong Kong), then the recommended reductions in the headline rates of New Zealand tax would reduce the total rates of tax imposed on that income. In other words, FDI by non-residents located in those jurisdictions that operate exemption regimes is likely to be sensitive to changes in New Zealand’s headline rates of company tax and NRWT. Some indication of the major sources of FDI in New Zealand is provided in Table 2, which indicates the stock of direct investment by country. Table 2 indicates that countries that exempt foreign dividends from tax account for around 51 percent of the total stock of FDI in New Zealand, whereas those countries that provide credits for underlying foreign tax only account for about 30 - 40 percent of New Zealand’s stock of FDI. 82. By contrast, if a non-resident investor is resident in a country that offers foreign tax credits for underlying tax paid in New Zealand (eg the United States, United Kingdom, Japan and Germany), then reductions in New Zealand’s headline rates of tax would correspondingly reduce the underlying foreign tax credits. This would increase the amount of home country tax those non-resident investors have to pay on income repatriated from FDI in New Zealand. In other words, the Review’s recommended reductions in the rates of New Zealand NRWT would be offset, on repatriation of the income 12 , by increases in the rates of foreign tax applying to that income, thereby leaving the total rate of tax levied on that income largely unaffected. 12 Assuming the income from FDI is not taxed on an accrual basis by virtue of the application of an active income exemption. Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 18 Table 2: Stock of Direct Investment by Country 13 (Year ended 31 March 2001) Exemption method countries NZ$m % Australia 17,245 35.0% Netherlands 7,069 14.3% 6 1,124 2.3% Canada Switzerland 175 0.4% Total 25,613 51.9% Foreign tax credit country United States of America 6,971 14.1% United Kingdom 6,741 13.7% Singapore 1,165 2.4% Japan 749 1.5% Germany 340 0.7% Total 15,966 32.4% Other 7,734 15.7% Total FDI in New Zealand 49,313 100.0% 83. One option for reducing revenue loss would be to target the reduction in ‘headline’ rates to income on FDI from exemption countries and thus increase the investors’ after tax return, thereby reducing the extent to which New Zealand taxes reduce the level of FDI in New Zealand. However, such an approach would increase the likelihood of retaliation by those exemption countries, particularly Australia, which is the largest single source of FDI in New Zealand. (iii) Effect of reactions by other jurisdictions on after all taxes returns to non-residents 84. Competition between nations for FDI is intense. The Harmful Tax Practices project initiated by the OECD is a collective response to the perception that countries, including member states, are destructively engaged in a “race to the bottom”. 85. We do not believe that either Policy Option One or Policy Option Two would constitute a harmful tax practice. However, it is ultimately up to the OECD to make that judgement and it is possible that some members might object to the ring-fencing aspects of the Review’s recommendations 14. 86. In any event, it is probable that some countries will take unilateral action in response to New Zealand cutting rates on FDI. The net effect of their reaction would be to increase the foreign tax on the NZ sourced income and thereby neutralise the beneficial effect of such a 13 Statistics New Zealand 14 “Ring Fencing” refers to tax regimes that provide preferential treatment for non-residents, as opposed to applying across-the-board. Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 19 rate reduction. This would, in turn, make the affected non-resident investor less sensitive to the cutting of the tax rate. 87. For instance, the proposed reduction of the New Zealand company tax rate for new residents may have the effect of changing the tax status of New Zealand under the Australian CFC rules. 88. New Zealand is currently one of the seven broad-exemption listed countries under the Australian CFC regime. The broad list exemption countries are considered to have tax systems closely comparable to Australia. Australian officials have indicated that were New Zealand to drop its corporate tax rate to 18% for non-residents the Australian Government would need to consider whether New Zealand should be dropped from the broad-exemption list. 89. Under Australian CFC rules income from broad-exemption list countries is taxed on a repatriation basis. Income derived from all other countries is taxed on an accruals basis unless it passes the ‘active income test’. If New Zealand were to be dropped from the broad- exemption list this would remove the tax deferral advantage for Australian controlled foreign companies (CFCs) in New Zealand earning “passive” income in New Zealand, which is conferred by being exempt from accruals taxation. “Active income” would continue to be exempt from current taxation. 90. New Zealand’s current approach to taxing FDI, which involves regimes like AIL and FITC, are well known to tax policy makers in our major investment partners. To date, they have not elicited adverse reaction. One important reason for this is that New Zealand has been careful to ensure that its tax regimes do not reduce the ability of other countries to impose tax on the New Zealand sourced income of their residents. That is, we have limited reductions in tax to the amount New Zealand imposes. Indeed, through avenues like exchange of information between IRD and other tax administrations, we actively assist other countries in the taxation of their residents. Impact of change to the after-all-taxes returns to non-resident investors on the level of FDI in New Zealand 91. Having examined the impact that the Review’s recommendations on the after-all taxes returns to non-resident investors, we now turn our attention to an assessment of how those expected changes in after-all-tax rates of return are likely to alter the level of FDI in New Zealand. 92. As noted by the Review in the Final Report, the sensitivity of FDI in New Zealand to taxes imposed by New Zealand and the home country of non-resident investors depends on the extent to which there are economic rents arising from FDI in New Zealand. 93. FDI is often thought to be associated with the earning of economic rents. Economic rents are earnings in excess of those needed to keep resources in their present use. Firms earn economic rents when they have firm specific knowledge about a product or process that they Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 20 can only exploit by investing directly into New Zealand. The existence of economic rents is a key factor in explaining the relative insensitivity of FDI to taxation. 94. FDI is less sensitive to changes in tax than portfolio investment since tax rates are not necessarily the most important factor that determines non-resident investors’ decisions about the level and pattern of their FDI in New Zealand. Other non-tax factors, including: improved access to overseas markets; physical, regulatory and political infrastructure; cost of labour and natural resources, are equally if not more important. 95. For example, consider the case of FDI from Australia. This accounts for 35% of total FDI in New Zealand and is the most important source of FDI from a country that exempts their companies from tax on income from FDI. Recent research conducted by the Australian Productivity Commission 15 found that commercial (or market related) factors are more important overall than matters subject to government control in influencing decisions about outbound FDI. In particular, the Productivity Commission found that: • improved access to overseas markets is by far the most important commercial factor influencing the decisions by Australian firms to produce offshore; and • although much less important, foreign and domestic tax regimes are next in line and are the most significant government-related influence. 96. In other words, tax is certainly not the most important factor influencing outbound Australian FDI. However, tax is still the most important factor influencing the level of FDI that is under the direct control of the government. 97. Similarly, consider the case of FDI from the US. (The US, Japan and the UK together account for around 30 percent of total FDI in New Zealand and together are the most important sources of FDI from countries that provide credits for underlying foreign tax.) Research conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research in the USA (NBER) in 1998 16 found: • that the elasticity of real capital to after-tax rates of return was close to 3 in 1992. That is, a 1 percent reduction in the after-tax rate of return was estimated to produce a 3 percent increase in FDI; and • that the sensitivity of FDI to tax is increasing over time. The NBER estimated that the elasticity of real capital to after-tax rates of return increased from 1.5 in 1984 to 3 in 1992. As noted by the NBER, this result is consistent with the view that the increasing globalisation of production is increasing the sensitivity of FDI to tax rates. 15 Offshore Investment by Australian Firms: Survey Evidence, Commission Research Paper, AusInfo, Canberra, 2002 16 Rosanne Altshuter, Harry Grubert and T Scott Newton “Has U.S. Investment Abroad Become More Sensitive to Tax Rates?” NBER Working Paper No. W6383, January 1998 Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 21 Costs and Benefits of the Review’s proposal 98. Given officials’ view that any reduction in FDI would (at least over time) need to apply to old as well as new FDI, this suggests that there would be a substantial reduction in tax revenue from existing FDI without any obvious benefit to New Zealand. The reduction in tax revenue collected from existing FDI would simply constitute a wind-fall gain to existing FDI. 99. This sunk cost means that there would need to be substantial benefits from any increase in FDI resulting from the tax cuts. Using a set of assumptions that are very favourable to the case that a reduction in tax on FDI will lead to a significant increase in FDI and taxation, Table 3 shows that there would be revenue short-fall in the order of $370m from implementing the Review’s recommendation. Table 3 The Effects of Reducing Effective Tax rates • The Review’s recommendations would reduce the average effective tax rate on FDI from 21.5 per cent to 14.82 percent (assuming that all new FDI will come from countries that exempt foreign dividend income from tax); • Using a pre-tax rate of return of 8 percent the Review’s recommendations would increase the post-tax rate of return from 6.3 percent to 6.8 percent (i.e, an 8 percent increase); • a one percent increase in the after-tax rate of return rate produces a 2.8 percent increase in FDI (as suggested by the NBER study), so an 8 percent increase in the post-tax rate of return would produce a 22 percent increase in the level of FDI; • the amount of FDI is $50b (i.e, all of existing FDI is eligible for the reduced taxation). Therefore FDI increases by around $11b; • Under these assumptions, the estimated increase in FDI would have to be capable of producing benefits for New Zealand of at least $500m to offset the fiscal cost. The estimated increase in FDI would produce additional tax revenue of $130m (given 8 percent pre-tax rate of return and average effective tax rate of 14.82 percent). • This means that the additional $11b of FDI would have to produce more than $370m of additional benefits to New Zealand. For example, it would have to produce at least $370m of increased labour income for New Zealand. This would be equivalent to an additional 10,882 new jobs if we were to assume those employees were paid incomes of $34,000 per annum. 100. The critical question that arises from the example in Table 2 is whether lowering tax rates would actually result in an additional 11b in FDI into New Zealand. The answer to this question turns on the accuracy of the assumptions that drive this result. In other words, to be confident of this result we would need to be much more confident than we are about: • the accuracy of (i) the current effective tax rate and (ii) the new effective tax rate. These effective tax rates are themselves based upon assumptions about average debt:equity ratios of FDI; • the level of the stock of FDI in New Zealand; • the elasticity of FDI into New Zealand; Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 22 • whether New Zealand would attract the right sort of FDI – i.e. FDI that brings benefits to New Zealand. 101. These are matters on which there is currently little information. Consequently it is impossible to predict the outcome of lowering effective tax rates on FDI with any certainty. Additional economic costs of raising lost revenue from elsewhere 102. Table 2 above suggests that, assuming a given increase in FDI, the Government would need to raise an additional 175 million of revenue. In assessing the Review’s recommended reforms to the current tax treatment of FDI, it is essential to consider the additional economic costs that may arise from the manner in which the fiscal cost of implementing those reforms is financed by the Government. 103. The magnitude of those additional economic costs depends on the manner in which those fiscal costs are financed. For example, if the fiscal costs are financed by: • increasing other tax rates, or the deferral of future tax cuts, then the economic costs of implementing the Review’s recommendations will be increased by the deadweight costs arising from those taxes (which increase disproportionately with the tax rate); • reducing the Government’s Budget surplus, then the economic costs of implementing the Review’s recommendations will be increased by the costs of delaying planned reductions in Government debt (eg higher cost of capital). Alignment of statutory and effective tax rates 104. The Review expressed a preference for reducing the effective rates of tax on FDI through a reduction in ‘headline rates’. For example, the Review noted that: • ‘Reducing the headline corporate tax rate applying to non-residents, for example, would be a more transparent reduction in the effective tax rate but not a fundamental change to the existing position’ 17 ; and • ‘Relative to other ways of reducing effective tax rates on non-residents’ investment into New Zealand, a reduction in the company tax rate for companies owned by non-residents has the considerable advantage of being markedly more visible and therefore more clearly establishing New Zealand’s receptiveness to foreign investment’ 18 . Lowering ‘headline’ rates of company tax and NRWT was seen as a means of making New Zealand ‘stand out from the crowd’. 105. So far, we have assumed that non-resident investors base their investment decisions on the actual after-all-taxes rates of return from FDI. We recognise, however, that the determination of the actual effective rate of tax imposed on income from can be a complex 17 Paragraph 6.58 of the Review’s Issues Paper. 18 Paragraph 6.73 of the Review’s Issues Paper. Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 23 and costly exercise for certain types of FDI. As a result, some potential non-resident investors in New Zealand may base the initial investment decisions on ‘headline’ as opposed to actual effective tax rates as a means of reducing the ‘transactions costs’ associated with estimating actual effective tax rates. In other words, the higher headline company tax rate in New Zealand might be deterring some investors from exploring in more detail the scope for FDI in New Zealand as opposed to other countries such as Australia that have lower headline company tax rates. This would tend to reduce the sensitivity of FDI decisions to reductions in actual effective rates of tax if those tax reductions are implemented other than via reductions in ‘headline’ rates of tax. 106. Having said that, we believe that this issue of transparency should be considered separately from the proposal to reduce rates on FDI. That is, the primary issue to be determined is whether the effective tax rates on FDI into New Zealand should be lowered. The question of whether any such reductions should be delivered through lower statutory rates or through some other mechanism such as FITC is a secondary matter. 107. We note, however, that in order to align current statutory rates with current effective rates it would be necessary to eliminate the distinction in tax treatment between equity and inter-group financing. We do not believe that this type of reform would be likely to attract more FDI. Conclusions 108. On the basis of available information, we have reached the following conclusions: • It would be difficult to restrict the recommended reductions in tax rates to new FDI. As a result, the annual fiscal cost of implementing the Review’s reforms could be expected to increase over time from around $50 million per annum to around $500 million per annum. • The Review’s recommendations would increase the after-all-tax rates of return to non- resident investors located in those jurisdictions that: • provide credits for underlying New Zealand tax (eg US, UK, Japan). However, the magnitude of this increase in after-all-tax rates of return is likely to be very small since the recommended reductions in New Zealand rates of tax would reduce the foreign tax credits that can be claimed by the non-resident investor. As a result, most of the reduction in New Zealand taxes would be offset automatically by an increase in the home country rates of tax on that FDI income. This means that most of the benefits of the reduction in New Zealand tax rates would go to the foreign revenue authorities rather than increase after tax returns to non-resident investors and stimulate FDI in New Zealand; • exempt the dividend income from FDI in New Zealand (eg Australia, Netherlands, Hong Kong). The Review’s recommended reforms are more likely to reduce the after-all-tax rates of return on investments from these jurisdictions. However, even in this case, there is a risk that some countries would retaliate by altering their tax Budget Sensitive T2002/610; PAD2002/93: Taxation of inbound investment Page 24 treatment of income from FDI in New Zealand. For example, Australian officials have already indicated that the Australian Government would need to consider whether New Zealand should be dropped from the ‘broad exemption list’. • There is uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of the responsiveness of FDI to any consequential increases in after-all-tax rates of return. However, we believe FDI is relatively insensitive to tax. • There would be additional economic costs associated with making up the fiscal cost of implementing the Review’s proposal. 109. For these reasons, we conclude that it is not desirable for New Zealand to implement the Review’s recommended changes to the taxation of FDI at this time. 110. However, it is important to note that that the sensitivity of FDI to taxation is likely to be increasing over time due to a range of factors including: • increases in the mobility of capital; • changes in production technology; and • increases in tax competition between countries for FDI. 111. This means that it is important for the Government to keep the tax treatment of FDI under review. In particular, we believe it is important for the Government to explore initiatives designed to improve: • the Government’s understanding of levels and patterns of FDI, the sensitivity of FDI to tax, the amount of revenue raised from the current taxation of FDI, and the magnitude of the economic costs arising from taxing FDI. For example, it might be worthwhile for officials to explore the scope for working in partnership with interested parties in the private sector to develop a much better picture of the nature and extent of both inwards and outwards FDI and the main factors that drive those investment decisions; and • non-resident investors understanding the current tax treatment of the income from FDI in New Zealand, particularly the actual effective tax rates New Zealand currently applies to those investments. For example, it might be worthwhile for officials to explore options for improving the transparency of actual effective rates of tax currently applying to non- resident investors.

Tax legislation enacted
=======================

Legislation introduced in December's Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has been enacted. The bill passed through its final stages in Parliament last week, and the resulting Act received Royal assent today.

The bill's progress was interrupted by the pre-election dissolution of Parliament in June and the convening of the new Parliament in late August. As a result of the delay, the application dates of several measures in the bill had to be amended. The main changes in application dates are:

*   **Taxpayer financial relief/debt and hardship provisions:** from 1 July 2002 to 1 December 2002.
*   **GST and warranties:** from enactment to 1 August 2002.
*   **GST and penalty interest:** in relation to local authorities and rates, from 10 October 2000 to 1 July 2003 (the date the Local Government \[Rating\] Act 2002 comes into effect).
*   **Unit trust negative dividend measure:** opening balance for new supplementary available subscribed capital accounts can be calculated as at a date within the period from enactment until 30 September 2003.

### New law brings tax debt relief, greater certainty for taxpayers

Legislation enacted today will provide relief for many people who get into tax debt, introduce fairer instalment arrangements for paying off tax debt, and give Inland Revenue greater flexibility in dealing with taxpayers' debt problems.

"The new Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act clarifies, for both the public and Inland Revenue, the appropriate treatment for taxpayers who are finding it difficult to pay their tax bills," Revenue Minister Michael Cullen said.

"The problem of spiralling tax debt was a recurring theme in the findings of the Finance and Expenditure Committee's 1999 inquiry into the powers and operations of Inland Revenue. This goes a long way towards meeting those concerns, and complements reductions in late payment penalties legislated for last year.

"Underlying these changes is the principle that tax laws that are too lenient or too harsh discourage voluntary compliance, which is the backbone of the modern tax administration. The new law strikes a sensible balance," Dr Cullen said.

The new Act also:

*   introduces comprehensive new rules governing the transfer of overpaid tax within a taxpayer's account or to another taxpayer, changes that give taxpayers greater certainty;
*   removes the risk that warranty agreements by offshore warrantors will attract GST twice, a change that is particularly important to importers of motor vehicles and other goods under warranty;
*   clarifies the law relating to the tax treatment of wage-related provisions when a business is sold and employees are transferred;
*   introduces changes to prevent the over-taxation of widely held unit trusts and "Category A" group investment funds, resolving a longstanding tax problem for the unit trust industry;
*   introduces further measures aimed at simplification of the tax system and reduction of tax-related compliance costs;
*   clarifies the law to ensure that charities and other non-profit bodies can claim GST refunds on all their activities except exempt activities, such as the sale of donated goods.

### More Time For Business Recommendations Become Law

The first cluster of tax simplification recommendations from the 'More Time For Business' discussion document have become law with the enactment of the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act earlier this week.

"Tackling business compliance costs, especially for small business owners, is a major focus for this government and this Act is another step in the right direction," said Associate Minister of Revenue and Minister for Small Business Paul Swain.

"One measure that will particularly help small business owners is the removal of the requirement to value amounts of trading stock of less than $5,000. This will save small business owners that don't hold much stock, a fish and chip shop owner or part-time tradesperson for example, time and worry about getting it exactly right when they don't actually need to."

A second cluster of 'More Time For Business' recommendations is in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Maori Organisations, Taxpayer Compliance and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, currently before Parliament.

As well as the the trading stock rule-change the other measures enacted this week are:

*   The threshold below which individuals who are provisional taxpayers are removed from the use-of-money tax rules has been raised from $30,000 to $35,000 of residual income tax.
*   Banks and other financial institutions will have more flexibility in how they communicate resident withholding tax information to interest earners.
*   The requirement to file a tax return or request an income statement on behalf of a taxpayer who dies, but who would not have had to file a return or request a statement had they lived, has been removed.
*   Companies will no longer have to file multiple imputation returns to obtain income tax refunds.
*   Changes to the family tax credit will allow better targeting and make the application process easier.
*   The determination of family assistance entitlements has been simplified by removing the need to make a number of complex adjustments when calculating them.
*   Taxpayers with income totalling $200 or less from which tax has not been withheld will no longer have to file a tax return.

"Simplifying the tax system is a complex task and there is no one-size-fits-all solution that reduces tax-related compliance costs for everyone," said Mr Swain. The most effective approach is to tackle the problem by making incremental changes targeted at different problems. The measures in this bill reflect that approach to tax simplification."

Views sought on fringe benefit tax review
=========================================

The review of fringe benefit tax is about to begin, and the government is seeking the views of employers and other interested parties on issues to be covered - to ensure that the issues most of concern to those paying fringe benefit tax are fully considered. The focus of the review will be on simplifying and improving fringe benefit tax so as to reduce compliance costs, while maintaining FBT revenue. For more information see today's [media release](/news/2002/2002-10-30-views-sought-fringe-benefit-tax-review#statement)

### Government seeks employers' views on Fringe Benefit Tax

Employers and other interested parties are being invited to put forward their concerns about Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT), as the first step in the government's FBT Review, Associate Revenue Minister Paul Swain announced today.

Employers pay FBT on non-cash benefits they provide to employees and shareholder-employees. Fringe benefits include goods such as cars, job-related loans and subsidised transportation.

"The review will focus on reducing the difficulty and cost to employers of complying with FBT, while ensuring the revenue base is maintained," said Mr Swain. "It is one of a number of government initiatives concentrated on reducing the tax-related costs of doing business, especially for small to medium-sized enterprises."

FBT was introduced in 1985 to prevent people converting taxable income from employment into non-taxable income such as cars. It ensures that the correct amount of tax is paid on employment income, no matter what form it takes.

"The government has no plans to get rid of fringe benefit tax," said Mr Swain. "However there is scope for improving its effectiveness, simplifying it and reducing the associated compliance costs.

"This is the first major review of fringe benefit tax since it was introduced, and the government wants to make sure the review considers issues that are of real concern to employers and businesses. We know, for example, of several concerns relating to motor vehicles - including valuation, home-to-work use and work-related vehicles. We want to know what other areas of FBT are of concern to employers.

"As a first step, the government is consulting with employers and other interested parties about what issues they think should be covered in the review, and how fringe benefit tax compliance costs can be reduced.

"This consultation phase will be critical in determining the scope of the review, so I am keen for those who have views on how fringe benefit tax could be improved to have input. The next stage of the review process will be the release of a discussion document, in mid-2003, setting out proposals for change followed by opportunities to comment on that document. Any legislative changes resulting from the review will be introduced in 2004," said Mr Swain.

Consultation begins on tax compliance costs
===========================================

The tax-related compliance costs of smaller businesses are the focus of wide-ranging consultation with businesses that begins this month. Inland Revenue has organised a series of events for hearing the views of small and medium-sized businesses about the tax compliance cost problems that concern them most. They include visits to businesses, a nationwide series of focus groups, a telephone survey of over 2000 business people and tax agents, and a survey on Inland Revenue's website in which anyone can take part.

### Tax officials get alongside small business-people

Senior Inland Revenue Department officials will visit small to medium-sized business operators around New Zealand to hear their views on how to simplify the tax system, Associate Minister of Revenue Paul Swain announced this morning.

The visits are part of a major consultation excercise aimed at reducing tax-related compliance costs for small to medium-sized businesses and are an important part of the government's small and medium-enterprise strategy.

"The government is keen for IRD officials to get alongside small business owners to get an idea of the impact of policies at a practical level," said Mr Swain. "To do this we need to hear from businesses themselves about the complications and costs the tax system imposes on them, and their views on possible solutions.

"The idea of sending tax officials out to visit small businesses was first suggested by Revenue Minister Michael Cullen after the election," said Mr Swain. "It came out of discussions myself and Dr Cullen had with small business people."

There will be 30 visits, which will be completed by the middle of next month. The visits will be targeted at businesses in the regions which have been established in the last few years. "We want to talk to new small businesses to get an idea of the different compliance costs which businesses face as they grow," said Mr Swain.

As well as the visits the consultation exercise will involve collecting the views of small and medium-sized business people in three other ways:

*   A series of 15 focus groups, run by an independent research company, in cities and towns around the country. The first focus group was held in Napier on 31 October.
*   A telephone survey, conducted during December, of more than 2000 small to medium-sized businesses and tax agents.
*   A web site where taxpayers not consulted in the visits, focus groups or telephone survey can submit their views. This survey is open to anyone who wants to participate and is available from today at [www.ird.govt.nz](http://www.ird.govt.nz)
    

"The information that's gathered in the consultation will be fed into Inland Revenue's Small and Medium-sized Enterprise Project," said Mr Swain. "It will form the basis of a discussion document, scheduled for release in the middle of next year.

"This consultation is part of the government's SME Strategy, which is being driven by a team of ministers comprising Finance Minister Michael Cullen, Regional Development Minister Jim Anderton, Commerce Minister Lianne Dalziel, Associate Commerce Minister John Tamihere and myself.

"It follows on from the More Time For Business discussion document and the recommendations of the Ministerial Panel on Compliance Costs and is part of an ongoing government programme to simplify the tax system and reduce business compliance costs.

"These are all practical activities whose purpose is to come up with real solutions to real problems that may be hindering the growth of New Zealand's many smaller businesses," said Mr Swain. "I appreciate the time that already busy business people will be asked to put into any one of these exercises, but their first-hand knowledge of the effect of tax compliance costs on their business is essential to finding a better way of doing things."

MEDIA RELEASE

### Inland Revenue seeking tangible solutions to meet Small to Medium Business needs

Inland Revenue's structured programme of interactive consultation with small to medium sized businesses (SME) is underway. The programme aims to build greater understanding of business needs, look into ways of simplifying the tax process and reducing tax-related compliance costs for SME.

This initiative is one part of a governmental cross-sector approach to reduce tax compliance costs, create more time for businesses to carry out their business and encourage business growth and innovation.

"The initiative represents a significant effort by Inland Revenue to ensure the voices of small to medium business are heard. We want to identify the problems specific to this taxpayer group and find solutions to those problems," said Bruce Thompson General Manager Service Delivery.

Over the coming two months this programme will involve a combination of focus groups, qualitative and quantitative research providing a rich source of information. There will be four streams of consultation:

*   15 group discussions in larger centres with six to eight taxpayers representing customer groups such as GST registrants, larger employers, and small employers
*   30 one-on-one visits to taxpayers in provincial and rural areas by Inland Revenue's small business advisory service staff and senior managers responsible for communicating with, and providing information to taxpayers
*   A telephone survey with 2100 SME taxpayers and agents
*   A website survey in which any SME taxpayer can take part.

"The extensive consultation we are undertaking with SME will allow a greater understanding of the things that concern those business operators the most and will present opportunities for tangible solutions that specifically meet the needs of that taxpayer group."

In addition Inland Revenue has a number of other activities in progress to support SME, both operational and policy. Some of the information gathered during consultation could be used to further develop these.

*   A review of Inland Revenue's advisory service for small business ensuring resources are targeted and cater for common business life cycle changes. As part of this the department will be reviewing products and tools currently provided to small businesses to ensure these meet their needs.
*   Greater opportunities for business customers to interact electronically. Inland Revenue has launched a five-year plan to develop and promote the use of electronic technology to simplify calculating and paying tax and to broaden the range of electronic services that it provides to taxpayers.
*   In the last year Inland Revenue has enhanced the information we provide and developed a series of interactive services for business customers through the department's web site - [www.ird.govt.nz](http://www.ird.govt.nz)
    .
*   Development of an Industry Partnership strategy where the department is working along side industry groups to find ways to make it easier for their members to meet their tax obligations and to increase tax compliance within those groups.
*   The government has enacted a number of tax simplification and compliance cost reduction initiatives, many designed to assist small businesses including:
    *   Raising the turnover threshold for compulsory GST registration from $30,000 to $40,000
    *   Reducing the rate of late payment penalties and interest
    *   Introducing a staggered approach to the application of late payment penalties.

The main focus of these amendments is on modernising the specific tax rules that apply to M ä ori authorities and simplifying the income tax requirements for individuals who derive benefits from these organisations. Other amendments clarify the requirements for charitable tax exemption as they relate to marae and those organisations whose beneficiaries are connected by blood ties. The new rules for M ä ori authorities recognise that there is a continued need for a specific tax framework for M ä ori organisations that manage M ä ori assets held in communal ownership. Such entities are set apart from other entities like ordinary companies and trusts by factors like the difficulty of selling M ä ori freehold land and other tribal assets, the legal restrictions placed on the use of these assets, and the unique way in which such assets must be owned and administered. Application date The proposed amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2004-05 income year. However, the amendment relating to relaxing the public benefit requirement will apply from the beginning of the 2003-04 income year. Key features New rules will replace the current tax provisions section HI 1 to HI 5 in the Income Tax Act 1994, which apply to M ä ori authorities. These rules incorporate a credit attribution system similar to the company imputation model and provide that: • The income of a M ä ori authority will be taxed in the year the authority earns it, at an income tax rate of 19.5 percent. • The tax paid by the M ä ori authority will be credited to an account known as the “M ä ori authority credit account” and this tax will give rise to M ä ori authority credits. • Distributions to members that are made out of tax-paid income can be attributed with M ä ori authority credits to reflect the tax paid at the authority level. 4 • The amount of the distribution and the value of the M ä ori authority credit will be included in a member’s gross income. • M ä ori authority credits that cannot be offset against the member’s individual tax liability will be refundable to the member. The new rules will apply only to those entities that face the restrictions and constraints that justify the continued need for specific tax rules for M ä ori authorities. M ä ori authorities will have the option of electing out of the proposed rules and applying the general tax rules instead – but only if they meet the criteria for these rules. M ä ori authorities will also have the ability to re-enter the M ä ori authority rules if they wish but they will be subject to the tax consequences of being treated as if they had wound up. Transitional rules for movements in and out of the M ä ori authority rules will also apply. M ä ori authorities whose legal form is that of a corporate body will be required to apply the shareholder continuity rules that require the measuring of a shareholder’s economic interest for the purposes of the loss and M ä ori authority credit account rules. Other key amendments relate to: • Standardising the tax rules applying to the M ä ori Trustee. The “agent” tax rules contained in section HK 14 will be repealed, and the proposed M ä ori authority rules will apply to the M ä ori Trustee when it acts as agent in the collection and distribution of rents, royalties and interest. • Extending the donations deduction for M ä ori authorities. Section DI 2 will be amended to extend the deduction available to M ä ori authorities for donations to M ä ori associations to include donations of money to organisations with “approved donee status”. The deduction will continue to be limited to 5 percent of the net income of the authority. • Relaxing the public benefit requirement for charitable tax exemption. New section OB 3A is being inserted to provide that if an entity meets the “charitable purposes” requirement it will not be automatically excluded from the charitable income tax exemption simply because its members are connected by blood ties. In determining whether an entity meets the public benefit requirement other factors must be considered, such as the nature of the entity, the activities it undertakes, the potential beneficiary class, the relationship between the beneficiaries and the number of potential beneficiaries. Although relevant to iwi-based and hap ü -based organisations, the amendment will apply to all organisations seeking to meet the requirements of charitable income tax exemption. • Clarifying the tax status of marae. New section OB 3A will also provide that marae situated on M ä ori reservations that apply their funds solely to the administration and maintenance of the physical structures of the marae will qualify for charitable tax exemption. This change will not preclude marae or marae-based organisations from seeking the general charitable income tax exemption if they meet the common law requirements of a charity (as amended by the public benefit proposal). 5 Background The first specific set of tax rules applying to M ä ori authorities appeared in 1939. These rules were intended to apply to the various “working” organisations that administered large blocks of farmland owned in common by individual M ä ori (and not in private ownership). These organisations were the first to become known as M ä ori authorities. They included the Board of M ä ori Affairs, the M ä ori Trustee, the M ä ori land boards, special statutory trusts (such as the East Coast Commissioner) and various land trusts under the M ä ori land legislation. Although the rules were largely concerned with the taxation of income from M ä ori land, they also applied to any income earned by an organisation that administered property, income or reserves in trust for the benefit of M ä ori. Thus the essential character of all the organisations covered by the term “M ä ori authority” was that of trustee for the individual members. The 1939 rules were subsequently replaced in 1952 as a result of the recommendations made by a Commission of Inquiry. The Commission had been established to ascertain whether certain M ä ori farming operations were fully complying with their tax obligations and whether the law on this could be made clearer. This was the last time the M ä ori authority rules were reviewed. Since then, the number, scope and role of M ä ori authorities have changed. The rules have not kept pace with the major tax policy reforms of the last fifty years. As a result, the tax rules now involve unnecessary restrictions, complex processes and high compliance costs and, in some cases, can lead to double taxation of M ä ori authority income. It has been claimed that the M ä ori authority rules may actually be hindering M ä ori economic and social development, and over the years there have been repeated calls from various M ä ori groups for them to be reviewed. The inability of an organisation to qualify for a charitable tax exemption when its beneficiaries are determined on the basis of bloodlines has also been raised by M ä ori groups as a major concern, although it is by no means an issue limited to M ä ori. Although M ä ori organisations often provide benefits of a charitable nature to iwi and hap ü , they might not qualify for an exemption because their benefit extends to a specified group of people connected by blood-ties – that is, they fail to meet the “public benefit” requirement for charitable status. The government recognises that the public benefit requirement is inappropriate to New Zealand society because it fails to recognise New Zealand’s unique cultural groupings. The tax status of marae has also been raised as a significant issue for M ä ori. Marae have similar functions to churches and public halls but often cannot gain the same charitable tax exemption as these institutions because of the “public benefit” requirement and the uncertainty about whether maintaining marae is a charitable purpose at common law. This issue has become a matter of priority for marae that wish to access funding from other charitable entities such as community trusts. If marae do not have this exemption, they generally cannot have access to this funding. The government’s review that led to the changes in this bill involved consultation through the generic tax policy process, which in this case was expanded to embrace wider consultation with the M ä ori community. 6 The proposed amendments were developed after consideration of the submissions received and further consultation on the proposals contained in the discussion document Taxation of M ä ori organisations , released in August 2001. Tax consequences of the changes for typical Mäori authorities Small authority A M ä ori authority has a single asset consisting of a small block of land suitable for grazing. The land is leased to a local farmer for a period of five years for an annual rental of $4,000. Every year the trustees of the authority gather the rent and distribute it among the owners of the land. There are 20 owners. The authority has disbursements to make for work arising from the administration of the lease, inspections of the leasehold and recovery of arrears of rents of $1000. Current rules: The authority is taxed as agent for each member on his or her individual share of the income of the authority. This is so even if the owner does not actually receive the income. If each owner has an equal share in the authority’s income, when the $3,000 is distributed among the 20 owners, each owner receives $150. Each individual owner is then taxed on the $150 – this income is assumed to be his or her first income and is taxed at the rate of 19.5 percent. The authority pays the owner’s share of the tax on the owner’s behalf. Proposed rules: The authority pays tax on its taxable income at the rate of 19.5 percent ($4,000 less $1000 equals $3000). Tax is $585, so the income available for distribution is $2,415. When a distribution is made each owner could receive a distribution of $150, which will comprise $120.75 and M ä ori authority credits of $29.25. Large authority The authority has diversified holdings in farming, horticulture, forestry and other special projects such as tourism and commercial property. The authority has formed wholly owned companies to hold its commercial investments, thereby isolating M ä ori freehold land and other tribal assets of cultural significance from commercial risk. The taxable income from its commercial activities is $1.2 million. The authority has approximately 3,500 members. The authority delivers dividends to its members and provides a wide range of other benefits including education grants and grants for aged members, marae and tangi. Total members’ distributions totalled $360,000 for the income year. Current treatment: M ä ori authorities must deduct resident withholding tax from distributions made to their members at the rate of 33 percent. The resident withholding tax deduction is $118,800 ($360,000 x 33%). Members receive a cash distribution of $241,200 and resident withholding tax credits of $118,800. At the end of year members can claim a refund or pay additional tax equal to the difference between the resident withholding tax rate of 33 percent and their own marginal tax rate. Assuming all members are on marginal tax rates of 19.5 percent, an amount of $48,600 will be required to be refunded to members. This refund is the difference between the resident withholding tax deducted by the authority and the tax required to be paid by the members on the total members’ distributions. Thus the total cash distribution in the members’ hands will be $289,800. The income that is retained by the authority is taxed at the rate of 25 percent, so tax at the authority level will be $300,000. If this tax paid income is distributed after four years of it being earned, it will be subject to resident withholding tax as described above, and the large authority is prevented from claiming back the tax that it has paid – the $300,000. This situation results in double taxation. Proposed treatment: The authority pays tax on its taxable income at the rate of 19.5 percent. Tax is $234,000. The authority credits this amount to the M ä ori authority credit account. This credit entry gives rise to M ä ori authority credits that can be attributed to distributions of tax-paid income. Total members’ distributions is $360,000, which comprises cash of $289,800 and M ä ori authority credits of $70,200. Members can use these credits to offset their own tax obligations. Assuming all members are on marginal tax rates of 19.5 percent, they will have total tax to pay of $70,200 on the total members’ distributions. Members would not need to seek refunds or pay additional tax since the M ä ori authority credits are sufficient to meet the members’ tax liabilities. Double taxation of income is avoided by attributing tax paid at the authority level to distributions to members. 7 AMENDMENTS TO THE MÄORI AUTHORITY TAX RULES New definition of “Mäori authority” The new definition of “M ä ori authority” specifically lists those entities eligible to apply the new M ä ori authority rules. It provides greater certainty for entities seeking M ä ori authority tax status and also removes the present ambiguity caused by archaic and confusing terminology used in the language of the current definition. The new list of entities also ensures that the specific tax rules are confined to those entities that encounter the constraints and restrictions that justify the specific tax framework. The new definition of “M ä ori authority” will comprise: • entities established in accordance with a court order under the M ä ori Land Act 1993; • the M ä ori Trustee in its capacity as agent in the collection and distribution of rents, royalties and interest; • entities established in accordance with the M ä ori Trust Boards Act 1955; • the initial entities established that hold assets of the Treaty Settlement redress; • the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission established under the M ä ori Fisheries Act 1989; • the Crown Forestry Rental Trust, being the forestry rental trust established by deed referred to section 34 of the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989; and • wholly owned entities of a M ä ori authority or a group of M ä ori authorities. Retaining specific tax rules for M ä ori authorities recognises that certain M ä ori organisations have unique characteristics that set them apart from other entities such as companies and trusts. The most defining characteristic is the non-transferability of property rights, which is particularly evident in relation to M ä ori organisations that administer M ä ori freehold land on behalf of their owners under the M ä ori Land Act 1993. These organisations are shown in table 1. The M ä ori Land Act 1993 imposes restrictions on the ability of owners to alienate or trade their land interests (or shares as in the case of a M ä ori incorporation), and on the ability of the trustees of the authority to sell M ä ori land vested in them. The M ä ori Land Court also has wide powers to control the administration of M ä ori freehold land. The impact of these restrictions is to create three major constraints to economic efficiency in the use of M ä ori freehold land. The land may not be able to move to its highest value use, it is difficult to borrow money on M ä ori land, and the title to the land can be fragmented over time. T 8 T ABLE 1: P ROPOSED LIST OF M ÄORI AUTHORITIES Mäori authorityMembersIncome can be spent on or applied Ahuwhenua trust – M ä ori Land Act 1993 (Often used for commercial purposes, it is designed to promote the use and administration of land in the interest of its owners) The beneficial owners of the land. The land, money, and other assets must be held in trust for the members of the trust. Income can be applied in any way permitted by the trust order or for M ä ori community purposes. Kai tiaki trust – M ä ori Land Act 1993 (A type of trust established solely for minors or individuals with a disability who cannot manage their own affairs) Individual beneficiaries.The land, money, and other assets must be held in trust for the person with the disability.

Putea trust – M ä ori Land Act 1993 (Often used to manage small and uneconomic M ä ori land interests) The beneficial owners of the land or shares in the M ä ori incorporation, and including descendants of named beneficial owners. The land, money, and other assets must be held for M ä ori community purposes. Wh ä nau trust – M ä ori Land Act 1993 (A wh ä nau-oriented trust that allows M ä ori land interests to be managed for the benefit of the wh ä nau) Same as for putea trust.The land, money, and other assets must be held, and the income derived from those assets must be applied, for the purposes of promoting the health, social, cultural and economic welfare, education and vocational training, and general advancement in life of the beneficial owners and their descendants or for M ä ori community purposes. Whenua topu trust – M ä ori Land Act 1993 (An iwi-based or hap ü -based trust used primarily for receiving Crown land as part of any settlement) Members of the iwi or hap ü named in the order. The land, money, and other assets must be held for M ä ori community purposes. The court may direct that certain interests may be held for certain persons, and any income from those interests can be paid to those persons and their successors. M ä ori incorporation – M ä ori Land Act 1993 Beneficial owners of the land.The incorporation holds the land and other assets vested in it on trust for the incorporated owners in proportion to their several interests in the land. Dividends to shareholders can be made but only out of accumulated profits (including realised capital gains). Revenue can also be applied to costs and outgoings, reserves for contingencies, or a distribution by resolution of shareholders for any purpose. There is no ability to assign equitable interest otherwise than by means of disposition of a member’s interest. M ä ori TrusteeThe beneficial owners of land or shares in a M ä ori incorporation which are administered by the M ä ori Trustee. The income must be applied for the benefit of the individuals or group of individuals concerned or for M ä ori community purposes. M ä ori trust boards – M ä ori Trust Boards Act 1955 Members of iwi or hap ü .A board may, in its discretion, provide money for the benefit or advancement in life of any specific beneficiary, or of any class or classes of beneficiaries. A board may also apply its funds to the promotion of health, social and economic welfare, education and vocational training for the general benefit of members. 9 Mäori authorityMembersIncome can be spent on or applied Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission No specified members.The principal functions of the Commission are to facilitate the entry of M ä ori into and the development by M ä ori of, the business and activity of fishing. The Commission may grant assistance to any M ä ori or group of M ä ori for the purpose of enabling them to enter into or to continue in or develop the business and activity of fishing. Crown Forestry Rental TrustNo specified members.The trust provides funding for claimants to assist them in preparing, presenting and negotiating a claim before the Waitangi Tribunal. Claims involve or may involve licensed land. This assistance is funded from the investment income of rental proceeds. The surplus income remaining at the time of the winding up of the trust must be paid to the Crown free from the trust. Treaty settlement entitiesThese entities must specify exactly what group or groups they represent. They must also have the mandate of the group or groups that they purport to represent. Depends on what is specified in the trust deeds, settlement documents or legislation. Wholly owned entities of one or more M ä ori authorities Other M ä ori authorities.Depends on their constituting documents. The M ä ori Trustee is also subject to the same legislative restrictions in respect of its “trustee” role in the administration of properties under the M ä ori Land Act 1993. M ä ori trust boards have specific accountability responsibilities to the Minister of M ä ori Affairs and, in some cases, to the Governor-General under the M ä ori Trust Boards Act 1955. Including these entities in the definition also recognises the unique nature of membership in these entities. The membership of such an entity is a right that comes with whakapapa (genealogy). It brings with it rights to participate in the political processes and to access benefits when the nature of those benefits is determined through a collective decision-making process. Exercise of these membership rights is optional but rights cannot be transferred. Members also do not have a measurable interest in the assets of the entity and are unable to trade their “interests” in the same way as someone who holds shares in a company. Furthermore, members of M ä ori trust boards have no universal right to receive an annual dividend. Entities established to receive assets of the Treaty Settlement redress are similar to M ä ori trust boards in terms of their purpose and membership structure. However, they are not subject to a legislative framework that regulates their ability to alienate settlement assets. Even so, it is important to bear in mind why these organisations were established. For both the Crown and iwi, it has become essential for the entity that receives assets in settlement of a claim to be properly constituted and represent a clearly identified M ä ori group or groups. The organisation must also have the mandate of those whom it purports to represent. These entities are also established for iwi or hap ü groups, so the membership issues described in relation to trust boards are also applicable to treaty settlement entities. 10 The Crown Forestry Rental Trust and the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission have unique roles in New Zealand society. Both entities were created to receive and manage settlement assets until such time as the ownership rights of these assets is established or confirmed through the appropriate settlement redress process. M ä ori authorities may use wholly owned subsidiaries to undertake commercial activities in order to quarantine commercial risks. The new definition of “M ä ori authority” also includes wholly owned subsidiaries of one or more M ä ori authorities. Such entities will often have their own governance structures and are generally unfettered by the constraints of the parent M ä ori authority, so it could be argued that they should be excluded from the M ä ori authority tax rules. However, including wholly owned subsidiaries in the definition will allow parent authorities to apply a single tax framework to their activities. If wholly owned entities were excluded from being M ä ori authorities, the authorities would have to operate their commercial activities themselves and in doing so, they would lose any benefit of quarantining commercial risk and could be discouraged from setting up more efficient commercial structures. The glossary contains descriptions of the proposed entities that will be eligible to apply the new rules. The proposed credit attribution system The new rules incorporate a credit attribution system and share many of the same features of the company imputation model. Under the proposed system, the income of a M ä ori authority will be subject to an income tax rate of 19.5 percent. The tax paid by or on behalf of M ä ori authorities will give rise to M ä ori authority credits that can be attached to distributions of tax-paid income to members. Recipient members can use these tax credits to offset their own tax liabilities. Any unused tax credits will be refunded to the recipient members who are New Zealand residents for tax purposes. The tax paid at the authority level can be viewed as a withholding tax as members can use this tax against their own tax liabilities. M ä ori authorities will also be able to pass out capital receipts, such as treaty settlement assets, tax-free to their members. This measure preserves the current tax treatment of such distributions. A credit attribution system is both fair and accurate, as it avoids the incidence of double taxation of M ä ori authority income (which occurs at present) and provides the opportunity to align the tax paid at the authority level with the marginal tax rates of individual members of the authority. The technical requirements of the proposed rules involve: 11 Definition of “member” of a Mäori authority “Member” of a M ä ori authority will be defined to mean any person legally or beneficially entitled to the gross income of a M ä ori authority. The new definition recognises that M ä ori authorities may have members that are individuals, non- individuals or both. Definition of “distribution” made by a Mäori authority New section HI 2 sets out a broad definition of “distribution”, which is necessary to accommodate the wide range of financial and non-financial benefits that M ä ori authorities provide to their members. “Distribution” will be defined to mean all sums in money that are paid, credited or advanced by a M ä ori authority for the benefit of one of its members. The term will also include property transfers between M ä ori authorities and their members to the extent that the consideration paid does not equal the true value of the property. Thus it will be possible for a member of a M ä ori authority to receive both a dividend payment (if the authority is a M ä ori incorporation) and an education scholarship or some other assistance grant. Even so, these payments will be treated as a distribution under the proposed tax rules. The tax treatment of these distributions in the hands of the recipient members will depend on whether such distributions were made from tax- paid income sources or non-taxable income sources of the authority. Tracking income sources Allowing the pass through of non-taxable sources, such as treaty settlement assets or other capital receipts, to be tax-free to members will require M ä ori authorities to track their income sources. In doing so, they can mark distributions to members as being out of taxable sources or out of non-taxable sources. Distributions and the credit attribution rule M ä ori authorities can make two types of distributions: taxable distributions and tax- exempt distributions. Taxable distributions will be attributed with M ä ori authority credits. The credit attribution rule provides that the maximum rate at which taxable distributions can be attributed with tax credits will be 19.5 percent. Resident withholding tax at the rate of 19.5 percent will apply to that portion of the taxable distribution that has not had tax credits attributed to it. Such distributions will be taxable in the hands of the recipient members. Transfers of property between M ä ori authorities and their members to the extent that the consideration paid does not reflect the true value of the property will also be treated as taxable distributions. However, there is one exception to this rule. Property transfers that relate to the allocation of treaty settlement assets will not be regarded as a taxable distribution. Instead, it is intended to treat such distributions as capital distributions. This measure is consistent with the policy to allow M ä ori authorities to pass through capital receipts tax-free. 12 Distributions from non-taxable sources will not be fully credited with M ä ori authority credits nor will they be subject to resident withholding tax. Such distributions will not be subject to the credit attribution rule and, therefore, will be tax exempt to the recipient members. Maintaining a “Mäori authority credit account” New Part MK requires M ä ori authorities to establish and maintain a “M ä ori authority credit account”. This account will operate in a similar way to the imputation credit account that companies are required to operate and will be subject to similar rules. The M ä ori authority credit account will record: • All income tax paid and tax credits available to a M ä ori authority as credit entries. These credit entries increase the level of M ä ori authority credits available to attribute to distributions paid to members. • All taxes refunded to the M ä ori authority or any M ä ori authority credits passed on to members as a debit entry in the M ä ori authority credit account. Debit entries to the account result in a reduction in the tax credits available for distribution to members. Resident withholding tax withheld from, and imputation credits attached to, the income received by a M ä ori authority will flow through the account. Any unused resident withholding tax credits will be refundable to the authority at the end of the year. Any unused imputation tax credits will not be refundable to the authority but will be converted to a loss and carried forward for offset against income in subsequent years. The end of year requirements and the general penalty provisions relating to the imputation credit account will also apply to the account. If the account is in debit balance at as 31 March, the authority will be liable to pay additional income tax equal to the debit balance, since the authority has allocated more tax credits than it should have. The authority is liable to pay the additional income tax no later than 20 June following the end of the relevant income year in which there was a debit balance. A “M ä ori authority distribution penalty” of 10 percent will apply to the debit balance. If an authority fails to pay its additional income tax liability and the 10 percent penalty by the due date, the general compliance and penalties rules will apply. Anti-streaming rules for distributions Under the proposed rules M ä ori authorities will be able to make distributions from either taxable or non-taxable sources. It is possible that, since some members may benefit more from a non-taxable distribution, a M ä ori authority might wish to direct its income from non-taxable sources to those members best able to use them. This is known as “streaming”. The risk here is that, for tax purposes, some members might be treated more favourably than others unless safeguards are in place to mitigate this risk. 13 For example, a M ä ori authority proposes to grant two scholarships as part of its education scholarship programme. The funding for this initiative comes from both taxable and non-taxable sources. A member on a 33 percent tax rate will pay no further tax if he or she receives a non-taxable distribution. However, if the member receives a taxable distribution, there will be further tax to pay. Another problem arises where two M ä ori authorities, MA1 and MA2, have incorporated a subsidiary company, MACOY. MA1 has tax to pay and MA2 is in a loss position. MACOY could distribute non-taxable distributions to MA1 and distribute taxable distributions to MA2. Again, there would be unequal tax treatment. This situation is not permitted under the current rules, since MACOY is taxed as a company and is prevented from passing out capital distributions tax-free. To address this potential streaming issue, when a particular distribution is made, all recipient members of that distribution will be treated as having received a proportionate share of the taxable or non-taxable amounts distributed. This rule aims to ensure parity among recipient members while allowing M ä ori authorities to continue to make distributions from different sources. For example, if MA1 distributes education scholarship money, the successful recipients must receive a proportionate share of any taxable or non-taxable amounts available for distribution. Also, a new section GC 27A provides an anti-avoidance rule to deal with streaming that forms part of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage. This is similar to the current rule for imputation streaming. Finally, new section MK 7 will require that every taxable distribution is attributed with M ä ori authority credits at the same level. The first taxable distribution paid by the authority during the year will be referred to as the “benchmark distribution”. All subsequent taxable distributions paid during the year must carry tax credits at the same ratio as the benchmark distribution. An authority may attribute tax credits to a distribution at a different level to the benchmark distribution provided the authority advises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue that the distribution is not being credited at a different level as part of an arrangement to obtain a tax advantage. The government acknowledges, however, that these rules may not be sufficient to address the full potential of the problem of streaming. The issue will be closely monitored and, if necessary, the government will consider introducing countervailing legislation should streaming emerge as an issue. Applying the shareholder continuity requirements The shareholder continuity rules measure the economic interests that shareholders have in a company based on their voting rights or market value interests. These rules govern whether a company can carry forward its losses, use its imputation credits and offset its losses against the income of another company in the same group structure. The shareholder continuity rules will apply to M ä ori authorities whose legal form is that of a corporate body, in all situations that require the measuring of a shareholder’s economic interests. 14 Corporate M ä ori authorities will be required to maintain continuity of shareholding in respect of the M ä ori authority credit account. This requirement will limit the carry- forward of M ä ori authority credits for subsequent utilisation to situations where at least 66 percent of those persons who will benefit from such utilisation bore the tax liability that gave rise to the credit. In other words, M ä ori authority credits cannot be retained by a M ä ori authority that is later sold to shareholders who can make effective use of the M ä ori authority credits. Corporate M ä ori authorities will also be required to maintain continuity of shareholding in respect of their ability to carry forward losses. This requirement will limit the carry-forward of losses by a M ä ori authority to situations where at least 49 percent of those persons who will benefit from those losses actually incurred them. The discussion document proposed that the continuity rules not apply to M ä ori authorities on the basis that the majority of M ä ori authorities would experience practical difficulties in satisfying the technical requirements of those rules. However, because of the proposed inclusion of wholly owned companies in the definition of “M ä ori authority”, it is necessary to introduce safeguards to protect against any potential for “trading” of M ä ori authority credits and tax losses. Furthermore, introducing the continuity rules now will be important should the government decide in the future that M ä ori authorities should be able to offset losses within a group structure. Restricting the application of the rules to corporate M ä ori authorities is appropriate since these bodies should be able to meet the technical requirements of the continuity rules or, alternatively, qualify for the existing relief provisions under those rules. M ä ori incorporations and wholly owned companies can apply the rules, since they issue shares, whereas M ä ori trust boards and the Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission, who do not issue shares, should qualify for the “special corporate entity” relief. The shares in a special corporate entity are treated as being held by a single person. Consequently, a special corporate entity will always be 100 percent owned and no breach in continuity is possible. M ä ori authorities whose legal form is in fact a trust such as the M ä ori land trusts and the Crown Forestry Rental Trust will not be subject to the shareholder continuity rules because such rules are intended to apply to measure economic interests in corporate entities only. New tax requirements for members of a Mäori authority Members who receive taxable distributions can use the attached M ä ori authority credits or any resident withholding tax credits to offset their own individual liabilities. If their marginal tax rate is less than 19.5 percent, members may file a tax return or request a personal tax summary to claim the difference between 19.5 percent and their marginal tax rate. If their marginal tax rate is greater than 19.5 percent and they are required to file a tax return or request a personal tax summary, they will have to pay the difference between their marginal tax rates and 19.5 percent. Distributions of non- taxable income sources will not be taxable to members. 15 Taxable distributions from M ä ori authorities will be treated in the same manner as dividends for the purposes of the low-income rebate and tax return filing requirements. Charities and other exempt entities who are members and who receive taxable distributions will be required to file a return at the end of the year in order to claim a refund of their M ä ori authority credits. Proposed tax rate on Mäori authority income The income of a M ä ori authority will be subject to an income tax rate of 19.5 percent. This rate is based on the fact that the majority of people that derive benefits from a M ä ori authority will be on incomes of less than $38,000, the income threshold below which the statutory tax rate of 19.5 percent applies. Although this tax rate may be seen as more favourable than that applying to companies and trusts, it is fair and reasonable in that it reflects the income levels of the underlying members of a M ä ori authority and the restrictions and limitations that encompass communally owned M ä ori assets held for the benefit of future generations. A tax rate more aligned to the marginal tax rate of the majority of members will reduce administrative costs and compliance costs as there will be less need for members of a M ä ori authority to file a tax return or request a personal tax summary to seek a refund of overpaid tax at the authority level. Electing in or out of the Mäori authority tax rules M ä ori authorities differ in their size and sophistication, as well as their economic and social objectives. This will influence the likely range of activities an authority could seek to become involved in, so the M ä ori authorities of the future may look different. It is important that the tax system not inhibit M ä ori authorities but that it has the flexibility to accommodate their evolution. This will mean providing authorities with the flexibility to be taxed under the general tax laws and not as a M ä ori authority. New section HI 1 enables M ä ori authorities to elect in and out of the M ä ori authority rules. Ability to elect to apply the general tax rules M ä ori authorities will be able to choose to apply the general tax rules, if they meet the requirements of those rules, at any time after the implementation date. They will determine for themselves whether they wish to apply the M ä ori authority rules or the general tax rules if they meet the requirements of those rules. They will do so by filing the appropriate tax return. 16 Ability to elect back into the Mäori authority tax rules M ä ori authorities will also be able to re-enter the M ä ori authority tax rules. However, the government is concerned that this additional measure may create the risk of M ä ori authorities moving in and out of the M ä ori authority rules to obtain tax advantages. For this reason, if a M ä ori authority re-enters the rules it will be subject to the tax consequences as if it had wound up and disposed of its property at market value. These consequences would have arisen had the M ä ori authority, in fact, wound up and constituted a new entity for re-entry into the M ä ori authority tax rules. New section HI 7 deems property to be sold at market value and reacquired at that value. However, for depreciation purposes the M ä ori authority will only be able to claim depreciation on the original cost price of the property. If an entity is taxed as a M ä ori authority before enactment of the legislation but later chooses to be a company and files a company tax return in respect of the transition year, that entity has made a deliberate choice to elect out of the M ä ori authority rules. If it then elects to apply the M ä ori authority rules in a subsequent year, the entity has re-entered the M ä ori authority rules, so the tax consequences for wind-ups will be triggered. If an entity is taxed as a company before the reform but under the new rules chooses to be a M ä ori authority and files a M ä ori authority tax return in respect of the transition year, that entity has made a deliberate choice to elect into the M ä ori authority rules. However, because the entity never used the M ä ori authority tax rules, the consequences for wind-ups will not arise unless the entity re-enters the rules. Allowing M ä ori authorities to re-enter the M ä ori authority tax rules provides flexibility for governing boards and trusts to cope with changes in the nature of a M ä ori authority’s operations over time. This measure also means that M ä ori authorities can avoid the costs associated with winding up an authority and reconstituting a new entity. Safe-harbouring pre-reform income Income earned under the present rules will be exempt from tax when it is distributed under the proposed rules, to avoid double taxation of tax-paid income reserves. New section HI 3 provides that any pre-reform income will be regarded as a “non-taxable” source so that subsequent distributions from this source will be treated as tax-exempt distributions in the hands of the recipient members. Distributions of the pre-reform income will not be subject to the credit attribution rule. “Safe-harbouring” pre-reform income in this way is consistent with the principle that transitional measures relating to new reform proposals should not give rise to additional tax consequences. 17 Transitional rules for movements in and out of the Mäori authority rules If an authority moves from one group of tax rules to another, either in the year of implementation or by opting out, it will need to consider what rules will regulate its exit or entry from the proposed rules. New section HI 6 provides: • If a trust exits the M ä ori authority rules, tax-paid income sources will be treated as trustee income, and subsequent distributions of that income will be exempt from tax. If the entity consists of property administered by an agent (as frequently occurs with the M ä ori Trustee), a similar treatment will apply. In that case, any income taxed as M ä ori authority income will be treated as being non-taxable if distributed by an agent in subsequent periods. • If a trust enters the M ä ori authority rules, trustee income will be treated as a non-taxable source, and subsequent distributions of that income will be exempt from tax. • If a company exits the M ä ori authority rules, the balance in its M ä ori authority credit account will be transferred to the company’s imputation credit account provided the continuity requirements have not been breached on exit. While the credits available will not be sufficient to enable distributions to be paid fully credited, those that are transferred provide a fair reflection of the tax paid by the entity. If necessary the company can impute at a lower rate until further tax is paid. Any pre-reform income will be converted to available subscribed capital, and any subsequent distributions of this source will be exempt from tax. Any post reform tax-paid income will be a taxable source to which imputation credits can be attached. It should be noted that the entity will lose its ability to make non-taxable distributions from any capital reserves, as taxable distributions are a feature of the company tax rules. • If a company enters the M ä ori authority rules, any imputation credits will be extinguished and any tax-paid income reserves, capital gains, available subscribed capital and other non-taxable sources will be treated as non-taxable sources. These transitional measures ensure that M ä ori authorities will not be subject to any additional tax consequences arising from movements into or out of the M ä ori authority rules. Related amendments Tax return filing and other notification requirements Section 31 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being amended to require M ä ori authorities to provide their members with information about any distributions they receive so that members can comply with their tax obligations. 18 New section 68B is being inserted in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and will require M ä ori authorities to provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with a complete statement of their distributions for the income year. New section 69A in the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires M ä ori authorities to file a M ä ori authority credit account. Mäori authorities can elect a RWT rate of 19.5 percent to apply to their interest income An amendment is being made to Schedule 14 which will allow M ä ori authorities to choose a resident withholding tax rate of 19.5 percent to apply to their interest income. This choice is available to other taxpayers except companies. 19 OTHER KEY AMENDMENTS Standardising the tax rules for the Mäori Trustee The specific agent tax rules in section HK 14 will be repealed, as they are obsolete and result in unnecessary compliance costs for the M ä ori Trustee. The M ä ori authority rules will now apply to the taxation of income derived by the M ä ori Trustee when it acts as agent in the collection and distribution of rents, royalties and interest. The inclusion of the M ä ori Trustee in the definition of “M ä ori authority” clarifies that the M ä ori authority rules will apply to the M ä ori Trustee in all situations. Extending the donation deduction for Mäori authorities The current deduction available to M ä ori authorities for donations to M ä ori associations will be extended to donations to organisations with “approved donee status”. The maximum level of deduction will remain at 5 percent of the authority’s net income (calculated before taking into account the deduction), which is consistent with the deduction that will apply to ordinary companies. This measure will recognise the greater range of community benefits that are assisted by M ä ori authority funding. To qualify for approved donee status, an organisation must be established for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand or must be specifically listed in section KC 5. As only organisations can qualify for donee status, M ä ori authorities will not be able to claim this deduction for distributions to individuals. Relaxing the public benefit requirement for charitable tax exemption New section OB 3A relaxes the public benefit requirement so that an organisation that meets the “charitable purposes” requirement will not be automatically excluded from the charitable income tax exemption simply because its members are connected by blood ties. This measure will apply to both M ä ori and non-M ä ori entities, but it is especially relevant to iwi-based and hap ü -based entities. However, these entities must still meet the other requirements of a charity – that is, they must have a “charitable purpose” and they must be for the benefit of the public or an appreciably significant section of the public. In determining whether an entity benefits the public or an appreciably significant section of the public other factors must be considered, such as the nature of the entity, the activities it undertakes, the potential beneficiary class, the relationship between the beneficiaries and the number of potential beneficiaries. In practice, the application of this proposal will require some guidance so that an entity can determine whether it benefits the public. 20 The proposed change will provide greater certainty about how the requirements of charitable income tax exemption applies to M ä ori and non-M ä ori organisations whose beneficiaries are defined by reference to blood ties. Clarifying the tax status of marae Under the new section OB 3A, marae situated on M ä ori reservations that apply their funds solely to the administration and maintenance of the physical structures of the marae will qualify for charitable tax exemption. The amendment will apply only to marae that are established on a M ä ori reservation in accordance with the M ä ori Land Act 1993. If a commercial business is carried out on the marae and the income for that business is applied towards the maintenance and upkeep of the marae premises, that marae will be regarded as charitable for tax purposes. Limiting the application of marae funds to the administration of the physical structures of the marae means that no individual who is associated with the marae is able to receive any private financial benefit from the marae. Marae will also need to ensure that payments to individual members for services rendered are reasonable and do not exceed what would normally be paid for those services. This change will not preclude marae or marae-based organisations from seeking the general charitable income tax exemption if they meet the common law requirements of a charity (as amended by the public benefit proposal). If a marae does not meet the general exemption or the proposed exemption it would be treated as a non-profit body if it meets the requirements. Non-profit bodies can claim a tax deduction each income year of an amount equal to the lesser of their net income or $1,000. As non-profit bodies tend to derive little (if any) income, most of them do not pay tax. This measure recognises the important role marae play in supporting a way of life for New Zealanders within a structure of M ä ori culture and values. It will also provide comparable treatment to marae that applies to other bodies that carry out similar functions such as churches and public halls. 21 Glossary of terms relating to taxation of Mäori organisations Approved donee status To qualify for donee status an entity must meet the requirements in section KC 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which includes entities established for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic, or cultural purposes within New Zealand or that are specifically listed in this section. Entities interested in obtaining donee status must apply to the Inland Revenue Department. Beneficial owners The owner of a beneficial interest in land. If the land is vested in trustees, those trustees own the land as legal owners on behalf of the beneficiaries who hold their individual shares in the land. Charitable purpose A charitable purpose is a purpose for: • the relief of poverty; • the advancement of education; • the advancement of religion; or • any other purpose that is beneficial to the community. These categories of charitable purpose are prescribed by common law and may appear to be quite wide. However, the courts in determining whether the purpose of an entity is for “any other purpose that is beneficial to the community” have restricted the purposes similar to those listed in the preamble to the United Kingdom’s Charitable Uses Act 1601. Modern examples of type of activities that come within this purpose are: • providing public halls, public recreational facilities, botanical gardens, parks, libraries and museums; • social rehabilitation – integrating people back into the community; • providing an ambulance service, district fire brigade or life saving service; • repairing highways and bridges, providing a water supply, paving and lighting a town; and • the afforestation or making of public domains or national parks. Company The definition of a “company” for tax purposes is broad. It includes any body corporate or other entity that has a legal personality or existence distinct from those of its members, whether that body corporate or other entity is incorporated or created in New Zealand or elsewhere. Certain entities such as unit trusts are deemed to be companies for tax purposes, whereas M ä ori authorities are specifically excluded from that definition. Company tax rules Key features of company tax rules in the Income Tax Act 1994 are: • Companies are subject to a flat tax at a rate of 33 percent. • Companies are separate legal entities, and the members have an “interest” in the company, usually defined by shareholding. • The benefit of tax paid by a company can be passed on to shareholders as imputation tax credits attached to dividends. Gross dividends are included as gross income of the shareholder, but individual tax liabilities are satisfied in part by the amount of any tax credits that have been allocated to the dividend. • If a taxpayer receives a dividend that has more imputation credits attached than the level of tax payable on that dividend, and the taxpayer has other income, the excess tax credit can be used to satisfy this tax liability. • Tax losses can be carried forward to be offset against the future income of the company, subject to maintaining certain membership requirements from the beginning of the year of loss to the end of the year of carry forward. • Charitable gifts may be deductible if they are provided to organisations with approved donee status. (This concession is not available to closely held companies.) The deduction is subject to certain limits. • Capital gains are taxable when distributed to shareholders but not when distributed in the course of liquidation. • Available subscribed capital for initial investment in a company is defined as capital, and is non-taxable when distributed. Compliance costs Compliance costs are the other costs that people and businesses incur when they pay their tax, over and above the actual amount of tax they pay. These other costs can have a money value, in that they may involve time, fees paid to tax advisers, and other costs. They can also be “psychological” costs, such as the stress that comes from not being certain that you have met all the rules correctly, or even what those rules are. Court order A document prepared by and signed under the seal of a court to give effect to a decision of a judge of the court. 22 Crown Forestry Rental Trust The Crown and M ä ori entered into an agreement in 1989 permitting the Crown to dispose of its forestry interests, while protecting the ability to provide redress for Treaty claims. The agreement arose from action taken by M ä ori to the Court of Appeal to protect their claims to Crown forestry interests. The Court of Appeal action was adjourned ( sine die ) following the negotiated agreement between the parties. If no agreement had been reached or if the agreement is broken, M ä ori had the right to return to the Court of Appeal in order to protect their interests. The agreement was embodied in legislation, the Crown Forest Assets Act 1989. The Trust was formed in April 1990 with the signing of the Trust Deed. The 1989 agreement, the Crown Forest Assets Act and the Trust Deed were all negotiated and approved by the M ä ori Appointors. The Trust was established to: • Receive rental proceeds from Crown forest licences; and • Make the interest, earned from investment of the rental proceeds, available to assist M ä ori in the preparation, presentation and negotiation of claims before the Waitangi Tribunal which involve, or could involve, certain Crown forest land. Hapü Subtribe or kin group linked by a common ancestor. Imputation tax credits Imputation tax credits reflect the tax paid by a company. When companies pay dividends to their shareholders they can attach imputation tax credits to the dividends. The dividends are taxed in the hands of the shareholders, who can use those credits to offset their personal tax liability. If the credits cannot be used, they can be converted into a tax loss by shareholders and used in the next income year. I ndividuals Natural persons. Iwi Traditional M ä ori tribal hierarchy and social order made up of hap ü (kin groups) and wh ä nau (family groups) having a founding ancestor and territorial (tribal) boundaries. Mäori associations A “M ä ori association” is defined in the M ä ori Community Development Act 1962 and means a M ä ori Committee, a M ä ori Executive Committee or a District M ä ori Council. All of these bodies are committees of the New Zealand M ä ori Council. Mäori authority credit account A proposed measure that will record M ä ori authority income tax payments and refunds, and account for the number of tax credits available for distribution. Mäori community purposes M ä ori Community Purposes include the promotion by financial support, loans and grants, in support of health, social, cultural and economic welfare, educational and vocational training and anything else the trustees deem appropriate, provided the M ä ori Land Court approves. For a full definition of M ä ori Community Purposes refer to section 218 of the M ä ori Land Act 1993. Mäori freehold land This is land whose beneficial ownership has been determined by the M ä ori Land Court (that is, the M ä ori Land Court has created a title for the land and has determined the beneficial owners of that land). Under current law, the status of the land will continue to be M ä ori land unless the M ä ori Land Court makes an order changing the status of the land. Mäori incorporations A M ä ori incorporation is a structure similar to a company established to facilitate and promote the use and administration of M ä ori freehold land on behalf of the owners. M ä ori incorporations were designed to manage whole blocks of land and are some of the most commercial types of M ä ori-land management structures. M ä ori incorporations are established under Te Ture Whenua M ä ori Act 1993 (also known as the M ä ori Land Act 1993). Mäori land trusts The purpose of these trusts is to reduce the high transaction costs of managing fragmented lands with numerous owners, by amalgamating the land titles under a single entity and by delegating the management of the entity to a committee of owner representatives. The different types of M ä ori land trusts are: • Ahuwhenua trust – the most common M ä ori land trust. It is designed to promote the use and administration of land in the interest of its owners. These trusts are often used for commercial purposes. • Whenua topu trust – an iwi-based or hap ü - based trust designed to facilitate the use and administration of the land in the interest of the iwi and hap ü . This type of trust is used for receiving Crown land as part of any settlement. • Kai tiaki trust – established solely for individuals who are minors or have a disability, and who are unable to manage their own affairs. 23 • Wh ä nau trust – a wh ä nau-oriented trust. It allows the wh ä nau to bring together their M ä ori land interests for the benefit of the wh ä nau and their descendants. • Putea trust – allows owners of small and uneconomical interests to pool their interests together. Ahuwhenua and whenua topu trusts are land- management trusts and involve whole land blocks. Wh ä nau and putea trusts are share- management trusts and relate primarily to specified shares in land. Kai tiaki trusts are for minors or persons with a disability, and can include all their assets. Whenua topu and putea trusts allow spending for “M ä ori community purposes”. M ä ori community purposes are defined in Te Ture Whenua M ä ori Act as purposes that are for the promotion of education and vocational training, health, and social, cultural and economic welfare. Wh ä nau and ahuwhenua trusts may also use funds for M ä ori community purposes, if their trust orders allow and if the owners agree. The trust order will define who will benefit from M ä ori community-purpose funds. Mäori reservation An area of land that is set aside as a “M ä ori reservation” under section 338 of the M ä ori Land Act 1993 for specific purposes. One of those purposes could be for a marae. Mäori trust boards M ä ori trust boards are established under the M ä ori Trust Boards Act 1955 to manage tribal assets for the general benefit of their members. The boards are able to provide money for the benefit or advancement of their members and to apply their funds towards the promotion of health, social and economic welfare, and education and vocational training. Some boards were set up to administer compensation received as settlement of grievances by M ä ori against the Crown, while other boards were established to secure government recognition (in order to take up service contracts), or to secure a mandate in order to pursue Treaty of Waitangi claims. Marae Meeting place for the M ä ori community. Often an area of land set aside for the use of hap ü or iwi, with buildings on it, such as a meeting house and dining hall. Marginal tax rates applying to individuals “Marginal” tax rates are the rates that apply to the last dollar earned by a taxpayer. These rates take into account the low-income rebate. This means that a taxpayer has an “effective” tax rate of 15% when his or her gross income is less than or equal to $9,500. The low- income rebate abates progressively until the taxpayer earns $38,000. The marginal tax rates for individuals are: 0 – 9,50015% 9,501 – 38,00021% 38,001 – 60,00033% 60,001 and over39% Personal tax summary Most individuals who receive salary, wages, interest, or dividends will have their final income tax liability determined by means of an income statement instead of being required to file an annual tax return. These statements are commonly referred to as “personal tax summaries”. The personal tax summary is a summary of a taxpayer’s income and tax information. It tells you whether you will need to pay tax or if you are due a refund. “Public benefit” All entities other than those established for the relief of poverty must satisfy the “public benefit” test. This means they must be established for the benefit of the public or at least an “appreciably significant section” of the public. In determining whether an entity benefits “an appreciably significant section of the public”, it will be necessary to consider factors such as the nature of the entity, the number of potential beneficiaries, and the degree of the relationship between beneficiaries. Shareholder continuity rules Rules in the Income Tax Act 1994 that involve measuring a shareholder’s economic interest in a company by reference to his or her voting rights, or market value interests. Special corporate entity The definition of “special corporate entity” contains a list of entities. Such entities generally do not have share capital or shareholders that are natural persons. The shares of the special corporate entity are deemed to be held by the same single person. Consequently, it will always be 100 percent owned and no breach of the shareholder continuity in the special corporate entity is possible. The Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission The Treaty of Waitangi Fisheries Commission/Te Ohu Kai Moana (the Commission) is a statutory body established under the M ä ori Fisheries Act 1989, as amended by the Treaty of Waitangi (Fisheries Claims) Settlement Act 1992. It was set up in 1992 to replace the M ä ori Fisheries Commission that was established in 1989 to hold fisheries assets returned to M ä ori by the Crown, and to arrange for their eventual distribution to iwi. 24 Under the Deed of Settlement, the Crown agreed to fund M ä ori into a 50/50 joint venture with Brierley Investments Ltd to bid for Sealord Products Ltd, New Zealand’s biggest fishing company. In return, M ä ori agreed to relinquish all current and future claims for commercial fishing rights in New Zealand. The role of the Commission is set out in the M ä ori Fisheries Act. Its main function is to facilitate and assist the entry of M ä ori into, and the development by M ä ori of, the business and activity of fishing. A portion of the income it derives from the assets vested in it by the Crown (essentially cash, fishing quota and interests in fishing companies) funds the activities of the Commission. The assets can be categorised as “pre- settlement assets” and “post-settlement assets”. Pre-settlement assets are those vested in the Commission under the M ä ori Fisheries Act when originally enacted up to the date of settlement (23 September 1992) and the acquisition of Sealord Products Ltd on 6 January 1993 (“settlement date”). Post- settlement assets are those vested in the Commission after the settlement date in accordance with the Deed of Settlement. The Commission is holding the pre and post- settlement assets ultimately for the benefit of all M ä ori, until an agreed allocation model is finalised. Trust A trust is an equitable obligation under which a person (the trustee) who has control of a property is bound to deal with that property either: • for the benefit of identifiable persons (referred to as “beneficiaries”) and any other person who may enforce the obligation; or • for some object or purpose permitted by law. The property concerned is referred to as “trust property”. The person who created this trust relationship is referred to as the “settlor” and is the source of the trust property. The trustee has legal ownership of the trust property while the beneficiaries have a beneficial entitlement to that property. The trustee may also be one of the beneficiaries in a trust. Trust tax rules There are three types of trusts for tax purposes: qualifying, foreign and non- qualifying. The most common trust is a qualifying trust, which is defined for tax purposes as a trust that has been continuously liable for tax in New Zealand since being settled and which has met all of its tax liabilities. Trusts can also be “discretionary” or “non- discretionary”. Under a discretionary trust, a trustee has the power to determine who the beneficiaries are and the amounts distributed to them. The key features of the trust tax rules are: • A trust’s annual income is separated into two classes: “beneficiary income” and “trustee income”. “Beneficiary income” is the annual income earned by the trustee that is paid or applied to the beneficiary in that year or six months after, or that vests in the beneficiaries in terms of the trust deed. “Trustee income” is annual income earned by the trustee that is not beneficiary income – that is, income earned by the trust that has not been distributed within that timeframe or has not been vested in the beneficiaries. • Trustee income is taxed at 33 percent, while beneficiary income is taxed at the beneficiary’s marginal tax rate (unless it is beneficiary income of a minor, in which case it is taxed in some circumstances at the trustee rate of 33 percent). • Losses cannot be passed on to beneficiaries. • Income retains its nature when it is distributed. Capital gains are distributed tax-free, and dividends with imputation credits attached may be distributed to beneficiaries. • Any income that is taxed as trustee income or that is added to the trust’s “corpus” can be subsequently distributed to beneficiaries tax-free. • Trustees are obliged to deduct tax from beneficiary income at an appropriate rate as agent for the beneficiary. Waahi tapu An area (usually of land) that is sacred to M ä ori. Whänau Family – extends beyond the concept of immediate family (parents and siblings). “Wh ä nau” links people of one family to a common tipuna or ancestor. Winding up Termination of a business. Liquidation. Ceasing to operate as a business. Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties 27 OVERVIEW The compliance and penalties legislation in the Tax Administration Act 1994 came into effect on 1 April 1997. It was designed to promote effective and fairer enforcement of the Inland Revenue Acts by providing better incentives for taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their tax obligations. The post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation began in October 1999. Since the introduction of the legislation the rules have been considered in several forums, including the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance and many of the recommendations from the inquiry into the powers and operations of Inland Revenue by the Finance and Expenditure Committee in 1999 related to the compliance and penalties legislation. The discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review , released in August 2001, represented the findings of the first stage of the review. The proposals in that document relating to debt and hardship and transfers of excess tax were included in the Taxation (Relief, Refunds and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. This bill contains most of the remaining proposals. The proposal relating to tax agents who breach standards of care is being considered further, as are certain measures to the department’s information-gathering powers. The next stage of the compliance and penalties review will: • consider the changes in taxpayer behaviour resulting from the introduction of the current rules; • consider whether the current rules maximise voluntary compliance; • compare New Zealand’s rules with those of other countries, including the extent of non-compliance, audit practices and the range and scale of penalties applied in other countries; and • address a large number of technical matters. A discussion document will be released in due course. 28 GOOD BEHAVIOUR (Clauses 110 and 111) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 will give effect to the recommendations outlined in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review that taxpayers’ past compliance should be taken into account when imposing shortfall penalties. The rate of the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care and unacceptable interpretation will be reduced to 10 percent if within the previous four years the taxpayer has not been liable to pay a shortfall penalty on a tax shortfall identified during an audit for the same type of offence. For example, if a taxpayer is audited, a tax shortfall is ascertained and a shortfall penalty for not taking reasonable care is imposed and within four years of that audit the taxpayer again does not take reasonable care, the shortfall penalty on that subsequent breach will be imposed at the rate of 20 percent. The shortfall penalty on the subsequent offence does not have to be imposed within the four-year period; it is the offence that must occur within the four years for the higher penalty rate to apply. The discussion document proposed that this period be seven years. Submissions on the discussion document expressed concern that this period will be too long. The government agrees and has reduced the period to four years. This amendment will apply separately for each type of tax. For example, the rate of the shortfall penalty imposed on a taxpayer for not taking reasonable care in relation to GST will not be affected by a previous breach of the reasonable care test in relation to another tax type such as income tax. Application date The proposed amendments will apply on or after 1 April 2003. Key features Sections 141A and 141B will be amended to reduce the rate of the shortfall penalties for not taking reasonable care and unacceptable interpretation to 10 percent. Taxpayers who are audited and are found to have breached either of these standards, and within four years of the audit breach the standard again, will have the subsequent breach penalised at the current rate for the shortfall penalty of 20 percent. 29 Background The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended that: ...a past record of “good behaviour” be taken into account when deciding whether to impose a penalty 1 The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance also considered this issue. Its report recommended that: ...the government should specifically require the review team to report on: whether the government’s performance expectations of taxpayers are reasonable; whether, and to what extent, a past record of ‘good behaviour’ should be taken into account in deciding to impose penalties or to escalate enforcement;... 2 This matter was also considered by the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs. In its report it stated: The policy of imposing tax collection obligations on employers/small businesses, and then punishing them with penalties for getting it wrong builds strong resentment from those that have good ‘track records’. 3 The government addressed all of these concerns in its discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review , released in August 2001. The discussion document noted that applying a test for good behaviour and determining whether taxpayers had met that test would incur considerable compliance and administrative costs. The government was also concerned as to how such a test could be applied consistently to all taxpayers. As a way of taking into account good behaviour at low compliance and administrative costs, the government proposed that the lack of reasonable care shortfall penalty be reduced to 10 percent if the breach was the taxpayer’s first breach of that standard. Submissions on the discussion document recommended that “good behaviour” be taken into account when imposing all shortfall penalties. The government agreed in part and extended the proposal to apply also to unacceptable interpretations. The government considers that given the culpability associated with breaches of the other standards, good behaviour should not be a factor that is taken into account when imposing shortfall penalties for gross carelessness, taking an abusive tax position or evasion. 1 Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department: Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee , New Zealand House of Representatives, October 1999, page 4 – recommendation 7 and page 27. 2 Tax Compliance , Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, December 1998, paragraph 12.7. 3 Finding the Balance: Maximum Compliance at Minimum Cost, Final Report of the Ministerial Panel on Business Compliance Costs , July 2001, page 121. 30 Submissions also expressed concern that the proposal could discourage voluntary disclosures for tax shortfalls. The government agrees with the concerns raised in submissions. In order to resolve this issue the original proposal has been amended so that if a taxpayer voluntarily discloses a tax shortfall, disclosure of that shortfall will not lead to higher rates of shortfall penalties applying to subsequent breaches, whether those subsequent offences are voluntarily disclosed or not. It will only be when the taxpayer has been audited and a shortfall penalty is imposed that the “probation” period will begin. 31 PENALTIES FOR UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITIONS (Clauses 72(2) and (7), 111, 112, 113 and 116) Summary of proposed amendment The Tax Administration Act will be amended to provide that a shortfall penalty for not having a tax position that is “as likely as not to be correct” can be imposed, including cases where the taxpayer has not interpreted the law. The amendment prevents taxpayers choosing not to “interpret” the legislation to avoid possible shortfall penalties. To avoid any confusion, the name of the shortfall penalty will be changed from “unacceptable interpretation” to “unacceptable tax position”. While the amendment reflects the original intent of the legislation, the government is concerned that associated compliance costs will increase. Therefore, to mitigate the compliance cost impact of the amendment, the thresholds at which the penalty is imposed will be increased. The minimum threshold increases from $10,000 to $20,000 and the maximum threshold from $200,000 to $250,000. This means that before the penalty can apply, the total amount of the tax shortfall must exceed $20,000 and one percent of the total amount of tax the taxpayer has returned for the period. It will apply in all cases when a tax shortfall exceeds $250,000. Application date The amendment will apply on and after 1 April 2003. Key features Section 141B will be amended to change the name of the shortfall penalty for “unacceptable interpretation” to “unacceptable tax position”. This amendment is to ensure that the penalty will apply to tax positions that do not meet the criteria, regardless of whether the taxpayer has considered the legislation or not. The thresholds in section 141B at which the penalty will be imposed will be increased. Background The shortfall penalty for unacceptable interpretation is intended as a signal to taxpayers who take tax positions where there is a significant amount of tax at stake. It indicates that they should take extra care and that, when viewed objectively, their interpretations should be likely to be correct. 32 However, the current interpretation of “unacceptable interpretation” allows taxpayers to avoid making reasonable efforts to determine what the law is. The government is concerned that taxpayers could choose not to interpret the legislation on a complex tax issue, as a means of avoiding possible shortfall penalties. It therefore weakens the standard that larger taxpayers are required to meet, and makes a penalty more difficult to impose in cases where it is fair that it be imposed. The Finance and Expenditure Committee recommended that: The Inland Revenue Department reinforce both publicly and internally that if a taxpayer or adviser has not interpreted legislation a penalty for unacceptable interpretation cannot apply. 4 Some submissions on the discussion document noted that this proposal is contrary to the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee following its inquiry in 1999 into the powers and operations of Inland Revenue. However, as noted in the discussion document, the current interpretation of the legislation allows taxpayers to avoid making reasonable efforts to determine what the law is. This interpretation is contrary to the original intent of the legislation. Some submissions also recommended that if taxpayers have not interpreted the legislation and should have done so, the shortfall penalty that should be imposed is the lack of reasonable care penalty, not the unacceptable interpretation penalty. The government agrees with submissioners that in some cases if a taxpayer has not interpreted the legislation a shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care could be imposed. However, there is concern that there could be cases where a penalty cannot be imposed. For example, a taxpayer investing in a scheme asks the promoter if an interpretation is necessary on a particular point and the promoter says that the point is very clear and an interpretation is not necessary; the taxpayer has taken reasonable care and no shortfall penalty can be imposed. 4 Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department: Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee , New Zealand House of Representatives, October 1999, page 4 – recommendation 9 and page 28. 33 ONUS OF PROOF (Clause 105) Summary of proposed amendment If a taxpayer can prove on the balance of probabilities that an assessment is wrong by a specific amount, the court must reduce the assessment by that specific amount. This will allow taxpayers to correct assessments they show to be wrong in part. Application date The amendment will apply to challenges brought on or after the date of enactment. Key features A new subsection (1A) is added to section 138P to provide that if a taxpayer proves on the balance of probabilities that the assessment is excessive by a specified amount, the court will reduce the assessment by that amount. Background The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance noted that a taxpayer who wishes to challenge an assessment is required to prove not only that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s assessment is wrong, but also by how much it is wrong. It recommended that the law be clarified to provide that if a taxpayer proves, on the balance of probabilities, that the assessment is excessive by a specified amount, the court should reduce Inland Revenue’s assessment by that amount. 5 In the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review the government said that it agreed with the Committee’s recommendation. 5 Tax Compliance , Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, December 1998, paragraphs 10.12 and 10.13. 34 TAX IN DISPUTE (Clauses 72(5), 98, 99(2), 100, 101, 102(2), 103 and 104) Summary of proposed amendment It will no longer be necessary for taxpayers to pay 50 percent of the tax in dispute at the beginning of the dispute, since the rationale for this was removed by the introduction of use-of-money interest on overpaid and underpaid tax. However, Inland Revenue will be given the power to require payment of all of the amount in dispute when it considers that there is a risk that the amount will not be paid. Application date The amendment will apply on or after 1 April 2003. Key features Section 138I will be amended to remove the requirement to pay 50 percent of the tax in dispute at the beginning of the dispute. Inland Revenue will be given the power to require payment of all of the tax in dispute when there is a risk to the revenue. Background As noted in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review , the Tax Administration Act requires that the taxpayer pay the non-deferrable tax relating to the amount in dispute – that is, 50 percent of the amount of tax that is being disputed. The justification for requiring payment, however, was significantly reduced with the introduction of two-way use-of-money interest. The government is still concerned that in rare cases there is a risk that the tax will never be paid. For example, if a taxpayer enters a dispute merely to delay payment of tax and then leaves the country. To reduce the risk to the revenue, Inland Revenue will be given the power to require payment of all of the tax in dispute when there is a risk that that amount will not be paid. 35 INFORMATION-GATHERING POWERS (Clauses 73, 74 and 75) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments give effect to the government’s proposals set out in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review in relation to information-gathering powers. The amendments aim to clarify and correct deficiencies in the existing rules. They will affect only a small number of taxpayers, and will improve the Commissioner’s ability to access the necessary information to confirm taxpayers’ correct tax positions. Application date The amendments to the information-gathering powers of Inland Revenue will apply to information requests made on or after the date of enactment. Key features The amendments will extend and clarify Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers. Section 16 will be amended to: • clarify that third parties can be required to give reasonable assistance and facilities in an investigation; • clarify who may be given authority to enter a taxpayer’s premises; and • allow Inland Revenue to remove and photocopy documents. Section 17 will be amended to: • allow Inland Revenue to requisition information held by offshore entities controlled by a New Zealand resident; and • give Inland Revenue the discretion to require documents to be sent to a particular Inland Revenue office. Background Inland Revenue relies on taxpayers being honest in the provision of information about their income. Information is, in many cases, almost exclusively within their possession and control. If Inland Revenue decides to audit a taxpayer, the value of the audit process is compromised if it cannot independently verify the taxpayer’s tax position. Therefore Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers in sections 16 and 17 are critical to the department carrying out its statutory function of collecting the correct amount of tax. 36 In December 1998 the Committee of Experts reported to the then government. The committee raised several issues relating to Inland Revenue’s information-gathering powers and made several recommendations that have formed the basis of the proposed amendments. In August 2001 the government released a discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, which included a chapter on information-gathering powers. The proposals in the discussion document were in line with the recommendations of the Committee of Experts. The discussion document also proposed that the legislation be amended to clarify who may be given authority to enter a taxpayer’s premises. Detailed analysis Reasonable assistance from third parties Under section 16(2), Inland Revenue has the authority to require the owner, manager, and current or former employees of any business that is being investigated to give reasonable assistance in an investigation or to answer questions relating to an investigation. There is uncertainty, however, over whether third parties – for example, a taxpayer’s bank manager – are required to give reasonable assistance or answer questions. The Committee of Experts recommended that section 16(2) be clarified. It commented that in principle, third parties should be required to give reasonable assistance and answer questions because the information being sought can be requisitioned under section 17. This statutory requirement would also protect third parties from actions for breach of confidence or infringement of the Privacy Act 1993. The amendment to section 16(2) will clarify that occupiers must provide Inland Revenue with reasonable assistance and facilities. “Occupier” under Australian case law has been interpreted to mean all persons entitled to be on the premises, including employees, and is not restricted to the owner or lease holder. Submissions on the discussion document raised concerns that Inland Revenue may request facilities that may not be available or appropriate. A taxpayer is not expected to provide Inland Revenue with facilities other than those already existing. It is essential that basic facilities such as lighting are available to Inland Revenue. Authority to enter a taxpayer’s premises This issue was not raised by the Committee of Experts but was included in the discussion document as a result of the government’s own concerns. The ability to have other persons accompany Inland Revenue officers onto taxpayer’s premises is necessary as those other persons may have specialist skills not possessed by Inland Revenue officers, such as computer forensic skills. The ability to have the Police accompany officers may be necessary to discourage physical violence. Accordingly, section 16 will be amended to allow other persons, whose assistance is considered necessary, to enter taxpayers’ premises. 37 Currently, a taxpayer’s consent or a judicial warrant must be obtained before Inland Revenue officers can enter the taxpayer’s private dwelling. Section 16 requires a warrant to specify the individual investigator who may enter the premises. Practical difficulties can arise if circumstances require another Inland Revenue officer not named in the warrant to take part in the investigation. Section 16 will be amended to allow warrants to authorise Inland Revenue officers in general to enter a private dwelling. These amendments will reduce practical difficulties in enforcing the Inland Revenue Acts. Removing documents for photocopying Although section 16 confers on Inland Revenue full and free access to all premises to inspect and copy any books, documents or anything else that Inland Revenue considers necessary or relevant for tax purposes, it has no authority to remove documents for copying elsewhere. The Committee of Experts was concerned that the current wording of section 16 could create problems in cases where it is not possible or practicable to make copies of documents on the taxpayer’s premises. The government is concerned that the risk of documents being altered or destroyed exists despite the availability of inspection. The value of an audit is compromised if Inland Revenue cannot independently verify the taxpayer’s tax liability. If Inland Revenue is to discharge its statutory duty of collecting the right amount of tax, documents must be able to be protected from being altered or destroyed. Section 16 will be amended to provide Inland Revenue with the power to remove documents for photocopying. Documents will not be removed if it is practicable to make copies on premises. The power to remove documents will be tightly controlled, and guidelines will be developed around the use, handling and storage of information. The amendment will expressly state that documents removed from a taxpayer or third party for the purpose of copying will be returned to the taxpayer as soon as practicable. The taxpayer will be given a list of the documents removed. A submission on the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review suggested that if given the power to remove documents for photocopying, Inland Revenue should have a duty to provide an identical set of copied documents to the taxpayer. This would ensure taxpayers were aware of the specific documents obtained from their records. Administrative guidelines will require taxpayers to be provided with a copy of the specific documents photocopied, unless all the documents removed were photocopied. Requisition of information held by offshore entities Under section 17 Inland Revenue can require a person to produce for inspection any records under the control of that person. However, there is uncertainty over the meaning of “control” and, in particular, over whether documents can be regarded as 38 being under the control of a New Zealand resident if that resident has control of an offshore company which has those documents in its possession. The Committee of Experts recommended that section 17 be amended to ensure that New Zealand resident individuals and companies can be required to produce such records for inspection in New Zealand. The amendment will allow Inland Revenue to requisition from New Zealand residents records held by offshore entities controlled by them and provide that foreign secrecy laws restricting the production of records in New Zealand be ignored. The Committee of Experts noted that foreign secrecy laws are an important reason for companies establishing subsidiaries in certain countries in the first place so as to exploit such laws to frustrate investigations by tax authorities in their home countries. Countries such as Australia and the United States already have such provisions for ignoring foreign secrecy laws. Documents to be sent to a specified Inland Revenue office The Committee of Experts noted that section 17 requires a person to produce documents for inspection only at the person’s premises. The committee considered that it could be more efficient in some cases for documents to be sent to a particular Inland Revenue office. Therefore it recommended that section 17 be amended to give Inland Revenue the discretion to require that documents be sent to a particular Inland Revenue office. Submissions on the discussion document recommended that the legislation provide that documents be sent to the Inland Revenue office closest to the taxpayer. As certain issues are dealt with at designated Inland Revenue offices, it would not be in the interests of either the taxpayer or Inland Revenue to have the documents delivered to any office other than the office where the matter is being dealt with. Having documents delivered to the office closest to the taxpayer would often necessitate the double handling of documents, create an unnecessary administrative burden and most likely delay Inland Revenue’s response to the taxpayer. Other matters under consideration The ability to remove computers to copy information In the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review, the government proposed that section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended to clarify that the word “document” includes computers. This proposal was aimed at clarifying that Inland Revenue has clear authority to access or remove computers for the purpose of copying information they contain. The submissions on the discussion document raised concerns regarding the removal of computers and the impact upon businesses. The government recognises the importance of information to taxpayers and appreciates the need to minimise disruption appreciated. Officials will carry out additional research on this proposal. 39 Removal of the words “necessary or relevant” The removal of the words “necessary or relevant” from section 17 was also proposed in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review. This issue will now be considered following the government’s forthcoming review of tax and privilege. 40 CAPPING THE PENALTY FOR LACK OF REASONABLE CARE (Clause 118) Summary of proposed amendment The Tax Administration Act will be amended to impose a monetary cap on the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care. The cap will be set at $50,000 per tax position and will apply to those shortfalls identified through voluntary disclosure or Inland Revenue audit within two months of the relevant return being filed. The amendment is designed to ensure that the shortfall penalty is not out of step with the offence if identified speedily. Application date The amendment will apply to shortfall penalties for lack of reasonable care imposed on or after 1 April 2003. Key features A new section 141JAA will be inserted to provide a $50,000 cap on the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care, in cases where the shortfall is identified within a two-month period through voluntary disclosure or an Inland Revenue audit. Background The discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review recommended that a monetary cap on the shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care be introduced. The government is concerned about the application of the lack of reasonable care penalty to very large errors that are speedily identified and corrected. The government considers that in some cases the size of the penalty may be excessive and may, in fact, discourage voluntary compliance. Submissions on the discussion document recommended that the monetary level of the cap be reduced and that the period of time in which to identify the shortfall be extended. The government declined both these submissions as it considers that implementing them would greatly reduce the incentives on taxpayers to take reasonable care. 41 PROMOTER PENALTIES (Clauses 72(4), 109, 113, 114, 115, 117, 120 and 121) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will give effect to the proposal in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review that a new penalty on promoters of certain “tax arrangements” be introduced. A number of submissions on the discussion document raised concerns about the proposal. These concerns have been taken into account in developing the proposal further. If an arrangement is offered, sold, issued or promoted to five or more people in an income year and it involves an abusive tax position, the promoter will be liable for a promoter penalty. The penalty will be 100 percent of the tax shortfalls of the investors, calculated using a 39 percent tax rate. The penalty is aimed at reducing the number of such investments by holding the people responsible for the design and sale of tax arrangements directly accountable for their actions. The government is concerned that in many cases investors in such arrangements are not aware of the tax effects of their investment. It is also concerned that the abusive tax position shortfall penalty, which is intended to be applied to taxpayers who are not complying, is, in fact, being applied to taxpayers who thought that they were complying but were, in fact, misled by the promoters. The government has therefore proposed that if the taxpayer has less than $50,000 invested in an arrangement and has advice independent from the promoter that it does not involve an abusive tax position, the shortfall penalty on the taxpayer will be imposed at 20 percent rather than the normal 100 percent. Application date The amendment will apply to arrangements entered into on or after the date of enactment. Key features New sections 141EA and 141EB will be inserted to provide for the imposition of a civil penalty on promoters, in cases where investment in an arrangement leads to the investor having a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position imposed. Taxpayers who have less than $50,000 invested in an arrangement and independent advice that it does not involve an abusive tax position will have the shortfall penalty imposed at 20 percent, rather than the normal 100 percent. 42 Background As noted in the discussion document Taxpayer compliance, standards and penalties: a review , if a taxpayer becomes a party to an arrangement that is considered by Inland Revenue to involve an abusive tax position, a shortfall penalty is imposed on the taxpayer. Although the compliance and penalties legislation penalises promoters in their capacity as taxpayers, the legislation imposes no civil sanctions on promoters in their capacity as promoters of “arrangements”. The compliance and penalties legislation therefore provides no incentive for promoters to ensure that the tax effects they claim for their arrangements are correct. Furthermore, offer documents in some cases restrict taxpayers from taking legal action against the promoter. The government considers that promoters of such arrangements should be held clearly accountable for their actions. The promoter is usually the party with the greater knowledge of the arrangement’s tax effects. Often, the true tax impact of an arrangement may be determined by features that the promoter is aware of but the investor is not. These undisclosed features may place the investor at risk of significant penalties. The discussion document recommended that the introduction of a penalty on promoters as the best way to ensure that they are held clearly accountable for their actions. The penalty was to apply to arrangements that involved breaches of an anti- avoidance provision or results in an investor having a shortfall penalty for an abusive tax position. Submissions on the discussion document were concerned that it is often difficult to determine whether an arrangement has involved tax avoidance. The government agrees and the amendment will only apply when an arrangement involves an abusive tax position. The discussion document also proposed that imposition of the penalty on the promoter would not depend on the successful imposition of a penalty on the investor. The government now considers that the promoter penalty should be imposed in tandem with the shortfall penalty on the taxpayer. As noted in the discussion document, the promoter penalty will generally be imposed as one penalty – but if additional taxpayer shortfalls are detected, further penalties will be imposed. In effect, the penalty on the promoter will be based on the extent of tax shortfalls generated by the arrangement. This will ensure that the promoter faces a penalty that reflects the total tax impact of the arrangement. To prevent disputes about the rate of tax to be used to determine the tax shortfall, a flat rate of 39 percent will be used. Investors in these arrangements are typically high-income earners, so the use of the 39 percent rate is appropriate. Other policy issues 45 TAX AND CHARITIES (Clauses 6, 8 and 31) Summary of proposed amendments Late last year the government announced a number of proposed changes in relation to charities, some of which involve legislative amendments to the Income Tax Act. The changes being included in this tax bill are: • increasing the maximum donation rebate for individual donors to $630, in line with inflation since 1990; • setting one threshold for deductibility of corporate donations, namely, a maximum of 5 percent of net income, which simplifies the current rules by removing both the limit on donations to any one donee and the aggregate limit of $1000; • removing the prohibition on deductions for donations made by close companies, where those companies are listed on a recognised exchange, which allows a greater range of companies to qualify for the deduction; • clarifying that to qualify for the income tax exemption, an entity’s charitable purposes has to be carried out in each year the tax exemption is claimed, thus ensuring that charitable purpose is continuous. Application date The changes to the rebate and deduction provisions are to take effect from the beginning of the 2002-03 income year. The change to verify that charitable purposes have to be continuous to qualify for the income tax exemption is to take effect from the beginning of the 2003-04 income year. Key features The maximum rebate that can be claimed by an individual donor under section KC 5(3)(b) is to be changed from $500 to $630. The section DJ 4(a) limit (of the greater of 1 percent of net income or $4000) on donations by companies to individual charities is being removed, as is the $1000 limit in section DJ 4(b)(i). This leaves just one limit – the aggregate limit of all gifts made in any one year of 5 percent of net income (current section DJ 4(b)(ii)). The rewritten section DJ 4 also requires that for a close company to be able to deduct its donations, its shares must be quoted on the official list of a recognised exchange. 46 Amendments to section CB 4(1)(c) and (e) verify the requirement that charitable purpose be continuous. Background The changes in this bill were first canvassed in the government discussion document Tax and charities , which dealt with a range of tax issues. It was the first major review of the charities tax legislation since the Working Party on Charities and Sporting Bodies report of 1989. One of the key issues canvassed in the discussion document was whether there should be a registration, reporting and monitoring system for charities that claim the exemption from income tax. Another significant issue was whether the definition of “charitable purpose” was still appropriate. A number of specific tax issues were also discussed, including the tax provisions that allow donors a rebate or deduction for their donations to charities. There was significant public interest in the proposals, with over 1600 submissions being received. In response, the government proposed an initial package of changes and set up a working party comprising charitable sector representatives, to provide recommendations on a registration, reporting and monitoring system for charities. The working party provided its recommendations earlier this year, the prime recommendation being that registration, reporting and monitoring should be carried out by a new entity, a charities commission. The government is still considering its response to those recommendations. In the meantime, the government is proceeding with the increase in the maximum rebate level and simplification of the company deduction thresholds. It is also proceeding with the technical clarification that to qualify for the income tax exemption, an entity’s charitable purposes have to be carried out in each year the tax exemption is claimed. This change removes any argument that an entity only has to demonstrate a charitable purpose when it is established. 47 C HARITABLE DONEE STATUS (Clause 31) Summary of proposed amendment The Open Home Foundation International Trust, the Register of Engineers for Disaster Relief New Zealand, The Hillary Himalayan Foundation and Together for Uganda are to be given charitable donee status. This will enable donors to obtain tax relief on their donations. An amendment will also be made to the name of The Save the Children Fund. Application date The amendments will apply from the 2002-03 income year. Key features The following organisations are being added to section KC 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which lists the organisations that qualify for charitable donee status: • Open Home Foundation International Trust; • Register of Engineers for Disaster Relief New Zealand; • The Hillary Himalayan Foundation; and • Together for Uganda. The name of The Save the Children Fund, which already has donee status, will be amended to Save the Children New Zealand (and its branches) to reflect the name and structure under which this organisation now operates. Background Donations to qualifying organisations entitle individual taxpayers to a rebate of 33 1/3 percent of the amount donated, to a maximum for all donations of $500 a year (to be increased to $630 a year by this bill). Donations by non-closely held companies (to be extended by this bill to a closely held company that is listed on a recognised stock exchange) qualify for a deduction from net income. The amount allowable as a deduction depends on the company’s net income. Open Home Foundation International Trust The Open Home Foundation International Trust has been established to raise educational standards in developing countries. The trust’s current focus is training programmes that ensure the wellbeing and safety of children. The Open Home Foundation has operated in New Zealand since 1977. 48 Register of Engineers for Disaster Relief New Zealand The Register of Engineers for Disaster Relief New Zealand has been established to maintain a register of suitably qualified engineers who are available for disaster relief work in New Zealand and overseas. The register supplies information on suitably qualified engineers to relief agencies and civil defence, supply technical advice to relief agencies and civil defence, run training courses, publish literature and maintain technical information related to disaster relief. The Hillary Himalayan Foundation The Hillary Himalayan Foundation has been established to assist people in Nepal, Sikkin, Bhutan, Tibet and those parts of India and Pakistan that are in the Himalayan and Karakoram mountains and foothills. The assistance to be provided includes the provision of medical facilities and supplies, improving agricultural methods and food production, establishing educational facilities, improving the region’s infrastructure, and conserving the local environment. Together for Uganda The Together for Uganda trust has been established to raise funds to assist underprivileged people in Uganda. 49 TAX SIMPLIFICATION – TAX POOLING (Clauses 37, 95, 97 and 124) Summary of proposed amendments New rules that will allow taxpayers to pool their provisional tax payments are being introduced. Under the new legislation, these payments may be pooled with those of other taxpayers, with the result that underpayments may be offset by overpayments within the same pool. The amendments reduce taxpayers’ exposure to use-of-money interest on underpaid tax and increase interest on overpaid tax. The proposal is a tax simplification measure canvassed in the government discussion document More time for business , released in May last year. Application date The new rules will apply from the 2003-04 income year. Key features A new subpart MBA is being inserted into the Income Tax Act 1994, and consequential amendments are being made to the Tax Administration Act 1994. They will allow businesses to pool their provisional tax payments, offsetting tax underpayments by overpayments within the same pool, thereby reducing use-of- money interest exposure. The pooling arrangement will be made through a commercial intermediary who will arrange for participating taxpayers to be charged or compensated for the offset. Participating taxpayers will pay or receive interest on their tax underpayments and overpayments respectively. The new subpart MBA sets out rules governing the set-up and maintenance of tax pooling accounts. For example, the requirements for persons wishing to become tax pooling intermediaries are set out in section MBA 3. These include giving the Commissioner notice that: • participating taxpayers’ payments to the intermediary will be held on trust; • the intermediary’s administration and information technology systems will ensure that participating taxpayers’ personal information and payment details will be kept private; • the intermediary’s record-keeping systems will allow the correct amounts to be paid back to participating taxpayers if the tax pooling account is wound up; and • participating taxpayers will be made aware that payments to the intermediary do not satisfy their obligations to Inland Revenue. Section MBA 4 provides that a tax pooling account will continue until it is wound up, and will not relate to a particular income year. 50 Section MBA 5 sets out the procedures governing intermediary deposits into a tax pooling account, including, for example, the stipulation that use-of-money interest will immediately start accruing on the amount deposited as soon as it is paid into the account by the intermediary. Section MBA 6 sets out the procedures governing intermediary requests for transfers to be made from a tax pooling account to participating taxpayers. For example: • An intermediary may only request transfers on a monthly basis, but may request those transfers to be made to participating taxpayers’ provisional tax accounts as at any date – so long as there are, or were, sufficient funds in the tax pooling account on that particular effective date. • Upon actioning a transfer request, Inland Revenue will provide both the intermediary and the taxpayer concerned with a statement confirming that the action has been taken. Section MBA 7 provides for refunds from a tax pooling account to an intermediary. Section MBA 8 provides that Inland Revenue may wind up a tax pooling account if it considers, for example, that: • the intermediary’s actions are preventing participating taxpayers from managing their use-of-money interest risks; or • the intermediary has breached any of its obligations under the legislation. Background Taxpayers have to pay their income tax liability on their terminal tax date. Often the amount actually due is uncertain, with the amount paid during the year reflecting the taxpayer’s best judgement of the law on a large number of technical issues. If taxpayers’ judgement of their liability is incorrect, say as a result of an amended assessment, and they have actually overpaid or underpaid tax, Inland Revenue applies use-of-money interest. At present, there is no administrative mechanism allowing taxpayers to reflect this uncertainty in their payment of tax. This issue is much more pointed in the area of provisional tax, where taxpayers are trying to estimate how much income they will earn in a year, with use-of-money interest applying if they are wrong. This is exacerbated by the fact that many taxpayers consider that the rate of interest the government pays on tax overpayments to be too low and the rate it charges on underpayments too high. Under the proposed change, taxpayers will be able to approach their intermediary at any time and “borrow” from the pool, requesting that tax payments be made on their behalf to Inland Revenue whenever there are funds available at a relevant tax payment due date. The intermediary will be required, in turn, to provide the department with a schedule setting out the participating taxpayers and the amounts to be transferred to their respective tax payment accounts on the relevant date. 51 Pooling will provide advantages to taxpayers and commercial intermediaries, without affecting the tax base, because the intermediaries will manage underpayments and overpayments to Inland Revenue on the participating taxpayers’ behalf. This means intermediaries ought to be able to pay a higher rate of interest to taxpayers who have overpaid their tax into the pool, and charge a lower rate of interest to those who have underestimated their tax and have therefore borrowed from the pool than the rates of use-of-money interest paid by the department. They will be able to do so by arbitraging the interest rate differential between the department’s rates and their own financing costs. The department will continue to receive the correct amount of tax. Tax pooling will reduce use-of-money interest costs for participating taxpayers, by ensuring that the interest charged or paid on underpaid or overpaid tax will more readily reflect the true commercial cost of borrowing or lending for the taxpayers concerned. Another advantage arising from tax pooling is that it will involve the introduction of intermediaries between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Taxpayers who chose to participate will reduce their need to communicate with Inland Revenue about their tax payments. 52 TAX SIMPLIFICATION – PAYE AND INTERMEDIARIES (Clauses 35, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 56, 57, 58, 65(7), 65(9), 65(14), 65(23), 67(2), 67(7), 76, 80, 85, 96, 106, 119, 123, 124(2), 124(4), 125, 126, 127, 131, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 152, 153, 154, 156, 157, 158, 159, 162, 163, 164(1), 164(2), 164(3), 164(4), 164(6), 164(8), 164(9), 164(10), 164(11) and 162(12)) Summary of proposed amendment The bill introduces a proposal to give employers the option of using accredited PAYE intermediaries to meet their obligations to calculate and pay PAYE deductions and to file employer monthly schedules. The transfer of those obligations to intermediaries will mean that employers who meet requirements to provide intermediaries with basic payroll information and the gross wages of their employees in a timely manner will not face any penalties for the incorrect application of the PAYE rules. Application date The amendment will come into effect from 1 April 2003. Key features The main change proposed is a new subpart NBA in the Income Tax Act 1994. As well as describing the purpose of the new legislation and recognising the intermediary as an entity in the PAYE rules, that subpart will contain the rules in relation to: • the accreditation of PAYE intermediaries by Inland Revenue; • requirements on employers who want to transfer their PAYE obligations to an intermediary; • obligations on PAYE intermediaries; • the trust account in which wages and deductions are held by intermediaries before being paid to employees and Inland Revenue respectively; and • termination of the arrangement between employers and intermediaries. Changes also need to be made to the penalties and use-of-money interest rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994. To the extent that employers provide gross wages and the correct payroll information to the intermediary by the date specified, they will not be liable for penalties for the breach of the PAYE rules. Currently, employers are also required to make a number of non-tax deductions from employees’ gross wages, such as student loan repayments and child support deductions. When an employer engages a PAYE intermediary, the intermediary will become responsible for making these deductions. “PAYE intermediary” becomes a defined term in section OB 1. 53 The current PAYE law is focused only on the actions of employers, so numerous consequential amendments are proposed to extend the scope of the rules to intermediaries. Generally, the consequential amendments add references to “PAYE intermediaries” in instances which currently refer only to “employer”. It is not intended, however, to extend the references to “employer” which relate to the underlying employment relationship. For example, employees will still receive source deduction payments from the employer, regardless of the fact that it may actually be paid via a PAYE intermediary. Accreditation of intermediaries New section NBA 2 sets out the administrative process for accrediting PAYE intermediaries, the criteria to be used by the Commissioner to accredit, and the rules for removing accreditation. Employers who wish to transfer their PAYE obligations to an intermediary will be able to transfer them only to an accredited PAYE intermediary. As outlined in More time for business , the government considers that accreditation of intermediaries is important to ensure the integrity of the PAYE system. This requirement was supported in the consultation process. To maximise flexibility in accreditation requirements, the detailed criteria for accreditation will be specified administratively. Anyone applying for accreditation will generally need to be able to apply the PAYE rules correctly and pay PAYE and file returns in the format prescribed by Inland Revenue. The software to be used to calculate tax deductions will need to be certified by Inland Revenue as suitable for that purpose. Intermediaries will also have to provide an assurance to Inland Revenue and employers that gross wages paid by employers will be held in trust accounts, and personal information will be kept private. They will also need to make the employer aware that Inland Revenue is not responsible for the security of net wages. Inland Revenue will have the power to remove accreditation if the Commissioner considers that the intermediary is not applying the PAYE rules correctly. Arrangements between employers and intermediaries New section NBA 3 and NBA 4 outline the responsibilities of the employers who wish to transfer their PAYE obligations to an intermediary. In order to administer the new system and verify that the proposed intermediary is accredited, Inland Revenue will need to know, in advance of the arrangement, the identity of the proposed intermediary, and into which accounts the gross wages will be deposited. The arrangement will need to apply to all of the employers’ employees. Participating employers will be required to pay the gross wages of their employees into the intermediary’s trust account. The discussion document proposed an alternative model where employers do not have to transfer the gross wages to the intermediary, instead holding the wages until the tax on them has to be paid to Inland Revenue. The government has decided not to legislate for this alternative model because it did not receive sufficient support in consultation. Employers will still be required to keep records of gross wages paid so that Inland Revenue can verify that intermediaries have appropriately distributed all the gross wages received from 54 employers. Basic payroll information from employers to intermediaries will need to be provided within the timeframe set by the intermediary. To provide the greatest flexibility in the arrangements between employers and intermediaries, no general timeframe is being legislated for. Intermediaries will bear the responsibility for making calculations and payments on time, so they are best placed to communicate their information needs to employers. Duties of payroll intermediaries New section NBA 5 sets out the main obligations on intermediaries. These are to calculate and pay PAYE, meet filing requirements, provide remittance certificates and keep records as though they were the employer for whom they are acting. Other than the obligations described above, it is not proposed to legislate for the services that intermediaries provide to employers or the charges for those services. This is intended to facilitate the most flexible commercial agreement possible between employers and intermediaries about what information they provide to each other and how they provide it. It is envisaged that employers will make arrangements to provide information required by staff such as payslips and general records so that they can audit their payroll expenses and have sufficient information to allow them to move their custom to another intermediary if need be. Wages and deductions to be held on trust New section NBA 6 sets out the requirements for setting up and operating the trust accounts into which employers must deposit gross wages. An intermediary will be allowed to hold multiple trust accounts, but will be required to provide information relating to all such accounts to the Commissioner at the time of accreditation. The new section will ensure that: • Only gross wages are allowed to paid be into an intermediary’s trust account – that is, an intermediary’s fees for example cannot be deposited into the trust account. • Withdrawals from the account are limited to employees’ net wages and the payment of the relevant deductions to the Commissioner. Termination of arrangement The proposed section NBA 7 sets out the rules for the termination of an arrangement between employers and intermediaries. Either party to the arrangement can terminate it by notice to the other party and Inland Revenue. To ensure certainty in the arrangement the termination must be prospective. Any proceeds in the trust account at the time the arrangement ceases must be dealt with as if the arrangement was still in effect. This is important given the possible time lag between the deposit of gross wages and dates when payment of wages and deductions should occur. No rules are proposed to deal with deposits mistakenly made by employers into the trust account once the arrangement has ceased. The government considers it best for the parties to come to their own arrangement in such situations. 55 Penalties and interest Various changes are proposed to Part IX of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to reflect the liability of intermediaries for applying the PAYE rules. For example, under the proposed section 141JB, intermediaries will be liable for late filing, late payment and shortfall penalties to the extent that employers have provided gross wages and the correct payroll information to the intermediary within the time agreed by the parties. Changes to section 139AA will mean that PAYE intermediaries will also be subject to the non-electronic filing penalty. A new section 120OA is being added to Part VII of the Tax Administration Act 1994 with respect of the application of use-of-money interest. That section will impose interest on PAYE intermediaries who fail to make the appropriate payment of PAYE deductions by the due date. Associated changes are required to the tax and penalty recovery provisions in Part X of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For example, changes to sections 167 to 169 ensure that if a PAYE intermediary receives gross wages and the relevant information from an employer but fails to make the appropriate deductions, these amounts can be recovered from the intermediary. Similarly, changes to sections 156 and 157 of the Tax Administration Act allow the Commissioner to recover penalties from intermediaries when a penalty is so imposed. Finally, Part XI of the Tax Administration Act is being changed to allow the Commissioner to remit penalties imposed on PAYE intermediaries, for example, if there is reasonable cause. Section 183A currently allows for remission of a late filing, late payment and non-electronic filing penalty if the penalty arose as a result of an event beyond the control of a taxpayer. Similarly, provisions dealing with the cancellation of interest and the payment of refunds, when tax is overpaid, are being amended so that they apply equally to PAYE intermediaries. Non-tax deductions required to be made from gross wages Employers are also required to make a number of non-tax deductions from employees’ gross wages and remit them as part of PAYE. If an employer engages an intermediary to take over PAYE obligations, the intermediary will also be responsible for making these additional, non-tax, deductions. The deductions include the earner account (or employee) levy, student loan repayment deductions and child support. The Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001, the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 and the Child Support Act 1991 govern the collection of these deductions along with tax. In the case of the earner levy and student loan repayment deductions, the respective Acts treat these deductions as a tax deduction for the purposes of the PAYE rules. A number of consequential amendments are also required. For example, section 221 of the Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2001 is being amended to ensure that a PAYE intermediary is able to collect levies by deduction from employee earnings. In the case of student loan repayment deductions, section 25 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 is being changed to allow a borrower to inform a PAYE intermediary of a student loan repayment obligation. Minimal changes are 56 required to the Child Support Act 1991 to ensure that a PAYE intermediary is able to make the appropriate deductions when notified of a liability. Consequential amendments are therefore required to the respective legislation to ensure that intermediaries are responsible for making the relevant deductions and are also liable for penalties if these obligations are not met. Background This simplification initiative was outlined in the government discussion document More time for business , released in May last year. It was developed in response to employers’ concerns about the time they spend keeping up to date with the PAYE rules, calculating and paying deductions, and filing returns. In addition they face the risk of penalties if mistakes have been made. The new legislation is intended to reduce the obstacles to payroll firms acting as intermediaries between employers and Inland Revenue, and therefore the barriers that discourage employers from using intermediaries to do this work. Consequently, employers’ resources should be freed up to be used more productively elsewhere in their businesses. It is also intended to reduce the worry and stress associated with penalties. This initiative was also designed to support employers who already use intermediaries to help meet PAYE obligations. Although these employers currently benefit from using PAYE specialists to meet their obligations, they are statutorily responsible for penalties that arise from mistakes made by the intermediary. Therefore they still face the residual risk that a mistake has been made and this creates unnecessary worry and stress for them. The legislation will reduce that risk. 57 INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 3) Summary of proposed amendments The bill confirms the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2002-2003 income year. The annual rates to be confirmed are the same rates that applied for the 2001-2002 income year. Application date The amendment will apply for the 2002-2003 income year. Key features The rates listed in Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 will be confirmed for the 2002-2003 income year. Background The Income Tax Act 1994 provides for the rates of income tax specified in the First Schedule of the Act to be confirmed each year. 58 GST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES (Clauses 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141 and 142) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments will clarify the GST treatment of cross-border supplies of telecommunications services by inserting a new place of supply rule, zero-rating provisions and definitions. Although in policy terms it is clear that supplies of telecommunications services should be subject to GST in New Zealand when they are consumed in New Zealand, the general place of supply rule and zero-rating provisions in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 are not easily applied to cross-border supplies of telecommunications services. This leads to uncertainty as to when supplies of telecommunications services are subject to GST in New Zealand, and when they are not. The amendments will reduce this uncertainty by inserting provisions dealing specifically with cross-border supplies of telecommunications services. Application date The amendments will apply from 1 July 2003. Key features Provisions will be inserted into the GST Act to determine to whom a supply of telecommunications services is made and the circumstances in which it will be subject to GST in New Zealand. These rules will be in addition to the general place of supply rule in section 8(2), which is based on the residence of the supplier. They will, however, override the proviso to section 8(2), which deems there to be a supply in New Zealand in certain instances when a service is physically performed in New Zealand. The amendments to section 8 will: • Deem there to be a supply of services in New Zealand when a person physically in New Zealand (other than a telecommunications supplier) initiates (including on behalf of another person) a supply of telecommunications services from a telecommunications supplier outside New Zealand (the “physical location” test). This will require an offshore telecommunications supplier who makes more than $40,000 of supplies to persons in New Zealand (other than telecommunications suppliers) to register for GST here. 59 • When use of the physical location test is impractical for a class of customer or service, deem there to be a supply of services in New Zealand when a person with a billing address in New Zealand initiates (including on behalf of another person) a supply of telecommunications services from a telecommunications supplier outside New Zealand (the “billing address” test). • Require the billing address test, if used for a member of a class of customer or service, to be used consistently for all members of that class of customer or service. • Clarify which party initiates collect calls and conference calls. • Allow the Commissioner to clarify in other situations where a call is initiated. Section 51 will be amended to provide that non-resident telecommunications suppliers do not have to register for GST solely as a result of making supplies that section 8(5) or 8A treats as being made in New Zealand to persons who are not resident, but who are physically in New Zealand. This will ensure that non-resident cellular phone companies do not have to register for GST in New Zealand solely because they make supplies of telecommunications services to non-resident customers “roaming” in New Zealand. New provisions will zero-rate supplies of telecommunications services made: • by New Zealand telecommunications suppliers to non-resident tele- communications suppliers when a telecommunications service is initiated outside New Zealand; and • to non-resident persons, other than telecommunications suppliers, when a telecommunications service is initiated outside New Zealand. For purposes of clarification, a definition of “telecommunications services” is proposed. This will extend the application of the amendments to the provision of access to global information networks (the Internet). Background The nature of telecommunications services means that it can be difficult to state with certainty where the services are performed. Determining where services are performed is of particular importance as in many instances the rules in the GST Act (for instance, section 8(2)(a) and section 11A(1)(j)) look to where a service is physically performed to determine its treatment. The concept of physical performance does not fit well with the nature of telecommunications services. Overseas case law suggests that the physical performance of telecommunications services takes place where the telecommunications equipment (such as satellite dishes and exchanges) used to provide the service is situated. 6 6 British Sky Broadcasting \[1996\] BVC 1107. 60 The physical performance test can be particularly difficult to apply in cases where cross-border telecommunications services are supplied, as in many instances the suppliers of the services will have equipment located in both countries (such as a satellite station) to complete the “circuit” needed for a telephone call. There can also be uncertainty as to who is receiving the supply of telecommunications services. For example, in an international call between two consumers, either fixed line or mobile, there will be component supplies of telecommunications (“connection” services) between telecommunications companies to link the two consumers in different jurisdictions combining to make the “whole” of the call between the consumers. Certain provisions of the GST Act are, therefore, difficult to apply to supplies of telecommunications services, including: • section 8(2)(a)(ii): the taxation of services physically performed in New Zealand; • section 11A(1)(j): the zero-rating of services physically performed outside New Zealand; and • section 11A(1)(k): the exclusion from zero-rating where services are provided directly in connection with movable personal property in New Zealand. The provisions in this bill will reduce these uncertainties by enacting specific provisions in relation to cross-border telecommunications services. 61 GOODS AND SERVICES TAX ON DOMESTIC LEGS OF INTERNATIONAL PASSENGER CRUISES (Clause 137) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will allow the zero-rating of the domestic leg of international passenger cruises if either the first place of departure or the final place of destination of the cruise is outside New Zealand. An international voyage remains international in character even when the voyage includes stops at more than one New Zealand port. The amendment clarifies the GST treatment of these cruises. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Section 11A(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (GST Act) is being amended to provide that an international cruise that visits a number of New Zealand ports, and in respect of which the first place of departure or the final place of destination is outside New Zealand, is zero-rated for the purposes of GST. Background At present, the legislation is not clear as to whether an international cruise that visits a number of New Zealand ports should be considered as one supply, or as a series of individual supplies between ports. Two typical international cruises of this kind are shown in figures 1 and 2. To make a distinction between the international and domestic aspects of the one sea voyage may often be impractical, regardless of how many New Zealand ports are visited. To require an apportionment of the fee charged for the cruise would require overseas cruise operators to determine the portion of the cruise that is consumed in New Zealand. Because of the compliance and administrative costs associated with apportioning the domestic and international legs of an international cruise the legislation should zero- rate the domestic portion of an international journey. This recognises that the supply of the voyage is in general predominantly international and is consumed overseas. Other types of cruises not illustrated in figures 1 or 2 which may visit a number of New Zealand ports but which either leave from or depart to a destination offshore require similar clarification in the legislation. The practical effect of this amendment is that since these types of cruises are not easily distinguished from other international cruises, they will be zero-rated in the same manner. 62 F IGURE 1 F IGURE 2 Remedial amendments 65 DEPRECIATION RULES ON AMALGAMATION (Clauses 9, 14, 15 and 144) Summary of proposed amendments A proposed amendment will make it clear that an anti-avoidance rule in the depreciation provisions applies on the transfer of depreciable property on a non- qualifying amalgamation. Another amendment corrects an oversight in the rules that govern depreciation on a qualifying amalgamation. It will allow companies that amalgamate in a qualifying amalgamation to claim depreciation deductions in the year of amalgamation for the period up to the date of amalgamation. Application date The amendment that clarifies the application of the anti-avoidance provision on a non- qualifying amalgamation applies in relation to property acquired on or after the date of introduction of the bill into Parliament. The amendment relating to depreciation deductions on a qualifying amalgamation has retrospective application. It applies from the introduction of the amalgamation provisions in 1994, unless a taxpayer has filed a return before the date of introduction of the bill into Parliament in which a deduction was not claimed. Key features Sections EG 17 and FE 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 are being amended to make it clear that the rules in section FE 5 for determining the cost of assets acquired in non- qualifying amalgamations are subject to the anti-avoidance rule in section EG 17. That rule limits the cost base of a depreciable asset acquired from an associate to the original cost of the asset to the associate. A new section FE 6A is being introduced so that the ban on claiming a depreciation deduction in the year of disposal is lifted where the disposal occurs on a qualifying amalgamation. Background Tax rules governing the amalgamation of companies were introduced following reforms to company law in 1993. The interaction of these rules with the depreciation provisions has given rise to two problems. The first relates to the anti-avoidance rule in section EG 17, the second to the basic depreciation rule in section EG 1. 66 Anti-avoidance rule and non-qualifying amalgamations The amalgamation provisions provide concessionary tax treatment for the transfer of property on a qualifying amalgamation (essentially one between resident companies). Property is deemed to be acquired by the amalgamated company at tax book value, rather than at market value. Because the provisions are concessionary, taxpayers can elect that they do not apply. The amalgamation is then non-qualifying, and property is deemed to be acquired by the amalgamated company at market value, following section FE 5. Section EG 17 prevents taxpayers who are associated from increasing depreciation deductions by transferring a depreciable asset between them at a price above its original cost. The base value of the asset to the new owner is limited to the cost of the asset to the old owner. The restriction in section EG 17 should apply to property transfers between associated companies in an amalgamation. Otherwise, a company which holds depreciable assets with a market value above their original cost could obtain increased depreciation deductions simply by amalgamating with another company under the same ownership and electing for the amalgamation to be non-qualifying, so that the assets are treated as transferred at market value. It was never the intention of the amalgamation provisions that associated companies should be able to avoid section EG 17 in this way. It is not entirely clear that the rule in section EG 17 takes priority over the rule in section FE 5. An amendment is being made to section EG 17 to put this beyond doubt. An amendment is also made to section FE 5 to counter an argument that section EG 17 cannot apply on a non-qualifying amalgamation because there is no acquisition from an associate, the amalgamating company having ceased to exist at the time the acquisition is deemed to occur under section FE 5. Basic depreciation rule Under section EG 1(2), no depreciation deduction is allowed for most classes of depreciable property in the year in which the property is disposed of. In the year of disposal there is a square-up of depreciation deductions so that in total, over the period of ownership, the taxpayer deducts only the difference between the purchase and the sale price. When depreciable property passes between companies on a qualifying amalgamation, however, it passes at tax book value. In effect, this means that there is no square-up. Because of section EG 1(2) the old owner cannot claim a depreciation deduction for the period up to the amalgamation. The new owner can only claim in respect of the period following amalgamation. The effect is that depreciation for the period of the year up until the date of amalgamation remains locked away until the asset is finally disposed of. It is therefore proposed to amend the amalgamation rules so that depreciation can be deducted for the period up to amalgamation. 67 The amendment is retrospective because some amalgamating companies have claimed the depreciation deduction for the period up to amalgamation, either because they were unaware of the technical defect in the legislation or because they assumed that this was intended. However, some taxpayers may have chosen to take advantage of the opportunity to defer the deduction until the amalgamated company disposed of the asset. Their position is protected. Future proposals This bill puts beyond doubt the relationship between sections FE 5 and EG 17. There may well be other provisions where the relationship is not absolutely clear, and these will be considered separately. In the meantime, it is not intended that the current amendment cast an adverse inference on the interaction between sections FE 5 and other provisions in the Income Tax Act. 68 INTEREST COMPONENT OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR FILM PRODUCTION EXPENDITURE (Clause 13) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment corrects a technical problem regarding the inter-relationship between the interest rules enacted last year and the rules applying to the reimbursement of film production expenditure. It clarifies that the reimbursement of interest expense can qualify as film expenditure. Application date Because the amendment verifying that the timing of interest deductions is determined by the accrual rules applied from the 1997-98 income year, the amendment to section EO 4 is also to be backdated to apply from the 1997-98 income year. Key features A new section EO 4(2A) indicates that for the purposes of subsection EO 4(1), the reimbursement of interest expense can qualify as film production expenditure. Background Last year the Income Tax Act was amended to allow certain types of companies to deduct interest expenses more simply. The amendments included verification that the timing of interest deductions is determined by the accrual rules rather than other timing rules in the Act. Transitional exceptions were provided for taxpayers that had been applying the other timing rules. Under section EO 4(1) of the Act, when a person reimburses another party for film production expenditure, that person can deduct that reimbursement as if it were film production expenditure they had incurred themselves. Conceivably, the amount reimbursed could cover interest as well as other more direct film production expenses. An inadvertent result of clarifying that interest deductions have to be timed under the accrual rules is that it seems that section EO 4(1) cannot apply to any reimbursement of interest expenses. Consequently, while the rest of the reimbursement would be deductible either in the year it is incurred or the year the film is completed, whichever is later, under the timing rule applying to the costs of producing a film, the reimbursement of interest expenses would probably not be deductible until the film was sold, under another timing rule. The amendment rectifies the problem. 69 INTERNATIONAL TAX – REMEDIAL ISSUES (Clauses 16, 42, 43 and 65) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to the conduit, branch equivalent tax account and provisional tax rules to clarify that: • The non-resident shareholding percentage used when receiving conduit relief is the same percentage used in the conduit excess interest allocation rules. • Only one branch equivalent tax account credit can be created when a company uses losses to offset its income tax liability and also pays income tax. • The definition of “residual income tax” excludes transfers from a branch equivalent tax account. Although these amendments are primarily remedial in nature, they also involve base maintenance as the law currently allows interpretations contrary to the original policy intent. Application dates The clarification to: • the conduit rules will apply from the 1998-99 income year except when a taxpayer has a filed an income tax return based on the current law before the date of introduction of the bill, when it will apply from the next income year or 2002-03, whichever is earlier; • branch equivalent tax account credits will apply from 1 April 1995 except when a taxpayer has filed an income tax return based on the current law before the date of introduction of the bill, when it will apply from the next income year; • the definition of “residual income tax” will apply from the 1995-96 income year except when a taxpayer has a filed an income tax return based on the current law before the date of introduction of the bill, when it will apply from the next income year or 2002-03, whichever is earlier. Key features • Section FH 3(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994, within the conduit excess interest allocation rules, is being amended to ensure that the non-resident shareholding percentage is either the same as the one used to calculate conduit relief either under section KH 1 or is the average of the percentages used to receive conduit relief under section NH 7. 70 • New sections MF 4(1A) and MF 8(2A) are being added to limit the branch equivalent tax account credits that arise under sections MF 4(1)(a) and (b) and MF 8(2)(a) and (b) respectively. When a company pays income tax as well as uses losses from New Zealand operations to reduce its taxable income, the credits will be limited to attributed foreign income multiplied by the company tax rate. • Paragraph (ka) is being added to the definition of “residual income tax” in section OB 1 to clarify that it does not include debit transfers from the branch equivalent tax account made under sections MF 5(4) or MF 10(3). Background Conduit rules The conduit rules aim to relieve New Zealand tax on foreign sourced income of New Zealand resident companies to the extent they have non-resident shareholders. These rules are buttressed by interest allocation rules to prevent excessive interest deductions being taken against New Zealand income, while the foreign income has tax relieved from it. The conduit excess interest allocation rules initially compare the company’s group debt to asset ratio with a safe harbour threshold of 66 percent. Before making this comparison the foreign assets of the company that receive conduit relief are reduced by the non-resident shareholding percentage in order to measure the debt that generates New Zealand tax deductions against the assets that generate taxable income. To ease compliance costs, there are a number of dates that a company receiving conduit relief may choose to calculate its non-resident shareholding percentage in a year. Additionally, a listed company may choose any date in a year, if for commercial reasons it would normally calculate its non-resident shareholding percentage on that date. It was always the policy intention that the non-resident shareholding percentage that applied to the calculation of conduit relief would be the same one that applied to reducing the assets when calculating whether the conduit excess interest allocation rules applied. An amendment is being made to clarify this intent. Branch equivalent tax accounts The branch equivalent tax account rules aim to prevent double taxation of foreign income that is subject to income tax under controlled foreign company or foreign investment fund rules, as well as subject to foreign dividend withholding payment on foreign dividends received. The intention is that regardless of which income stream occurs first, tax will only be paid once. The branch equivalent tax account mechanism provides that if income tax has been paid first, a branch equivalent tax account credit arises which offsets the liability to foreign dividend withholding payment. Alternatively, if a dividend had been paid in advance of the income being earned in the controlled foreign company, with foreign 71 dividend withholding payment being paid first, a branch equivalent tax account debit arises which offsets the liability to income tax. A branch equivalent tax account credit can also be created when losses from New Zealand sources have been offset against attributed foreign income, so no liability to income tax arises. It was never the intention that when a company paid income tax and also used losses from New Zealand sources that the credits created would exceed the value of the tax rate multiplied by the attributed foreign income for the year, which the law currently allows. An amendment is being made to limit the credits accordingly. Residual income tax The provisional tax rules aim to tax income that has not had tax deducted from or credited to it in any form in the year it is earned. Its calculation is based around “residual income tax”, which is the tax liability on income in the previous year that did not have tax paid or deducted from it. As noted in the discussion of branch equivalent tax accounts, the payment of foreign dividend withholding payment generates a branch equivalent tax account debit that can be used to offset a liability to income tax. Although a company may transfer a branch equivalent tax account debit to meet its income tax liability on attributed foreign income, the current definition of residual income tax does not take into account branch equivalent tax account debit transfers. This means the law as it stands requires that a company would have to pay provisional tax on income from which foreign dividend withholding payment had already been deducted contrary to the aim of the provisional tax rules. The proposed amendment clarifies that transfers of a branch equivalent tax account debit by a company are excluded from the definition of “residual income tax” within the provisional tax rules. 72 RATIONALISATION OF TERMINAL TAX PAYMENT DATE PROVISIONS (Clauses 38, 54, 55, 65, 69, 90, 91, 92, 93, 99, 102, 122, 150, 151, 161 and 164) Summary of proposed amendments The terminal tax payment date provisions for income tax are being rationalised by reducing the three such provisions to a single provision. A number of consequential amendments will be made to the tax Acts and other legislation. These amendments will not result in a policy change to terminal tax payment dates. Application date The amendments rationalising the terminal tax payment date provisions will apply from the 2002-03 income year. Key features The three separate terminal tax payment date provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 are to be combined into one provision. This will make it easier for taxpayers to determine their terminal tax payment dates. It will also allow other provisions that refer to terminal tax payment dates to be made significantly more concise. The rationalisation of the terminal tax payment date provisions will be mainly achieved by repealing the specific payment date provisions in sections NC 17 and MC 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, applying to employees and provisional taxpayers. The following related amendments will also be made: • Minor amendments will be made to the general terminal tax payment date provision in section MC 2 (to be re-enacted as new section MC 1) so that it can apply to all persons. • The definition of “terminal tax date” in section OB 1 will be amended so that it refers to the date determined under new section MC 1 for payment of terminal tax for an income year by a person. If a person does not have to pay terminal tax for an income year, new section MC 1 will apply as if the person does have terminal tax for the year. This ensures that all persons can be treated as having a terminal tax date – for example, persons whose tax credits equal or exceed their income tax liability. This amendment will allow the definition to be used more widely in other provisions, thereby making them more concise. • Part A of Schedule 13, which specifies the months for payment of provisional tax and terminal tax, will be amended to clarify that persons (such as employees) who do not have the Commissioner’s permission to use a non- standard balance date have a March balance date. A non-resident company that does not have a fixed establishment in New Zealand will also be treated as having a March balance date for the purpose of determining its provisional tax 73 or terminal tax payment dates. (This continues the treatment of such companies under current section MC 2(1).) • Section MC 3, which authorises regulations to be made to allow taxpayers with outstanding tax liabilities to make instalment payments, will be repealed because it is redundant. There are no such regulations in existence and the function of allowing taxpayers in arrears to make instalment payments is covered by the taxpayer relief provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994. • A number of consequential amendments will be made to the tax Acts and other legislation to cater for the combining of the three current terminal tax date payment provisions into one provision. The following provisions in current sections MC 1 and NC 17 will not be re-enacted as part of the single terminal tax payment date provision in new section MC 1 because they are unnecessary: • Sections MC 1(3) and NC 17(2)(c), which allow the Commissioner to specify an earlier terminal tax date for a particular taxpayer. Although these provisions have a revenue protection purpose, they are unnecessary because there are other provisions with a similar function that are more effective, in particular, section 44 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which allows tax to be assessed and payable on demand in high-risk situations such as when a person is about to leave New Zealand. • Section NC 17(1), which contains a separate assessment provision for employees. The general income tax assessment provision in section 92 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 can apply to all taxpayers, and there is no reason for having a separate assessment provision for employees. (The separate assessment provision for provisional taxpayers was repealed in 1996.) • Section NC 17(3), which provides that income tax payable under an income statement (that is treated as an assessment under section 92 of the Tax Administration Act 1994) is due on the dates specified in section NC 17(2). This provision was originally enacted because section NC 17(2) applies only to income tax payable under an assessment made under section NC 17(1). Because the separate assessment provision in section NC 17(1) is not being retained, section NC 17(3) will also become unnecessary. Background Terminal tax is the difference between a taxpayer’s tax credits (such as provisional tax, PAYE and imputation credits) and the taxpayer’s income tax liability for an income year. There are currently three separate provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 covering the payment dates for terminal tax: section NC 17, applying to employees (other than non-filing taxpayers); section MC 1, applying to provisional taxpayers; and section MC 2, applying to persons generally. The existence of separate terminal tax payment date provisions for employees and provisional taxpayers in sections NC 17 and MC 1 is for historical reasons only. PAYE and provisional tax were implemented in 1958 as self-contained legislative codes with their own recovery, penalty, assessment and payment date provisions. 74 Many of these separate provisions have been replaced by more generic provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 1994 (for example, the penalty provisions). The separate terminal tax payment date provisions for employees and provisional taxpayers are, therefore, an unnecessary residue of the original separate legislative codes for PAYE and provisional tax. 75 THE INCLUSION OF MATERIAL FACTS IN PRIVATE OR PRODUCT RULINGS (Clause 72) Summary of proposed amendment The definition of “arrangement” in the Tax Administration Act 1994 is being altered to clarify that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can include in private and product rulings facts that the Commissioner considers to be material, or relevant as background or context to any of the matters on which the private or product ruling is sought. Under the amendment, such facts will form part of the “arrangement” that is the subject of a ruling. Consequently, they will become subject to the provisions that determine that a ruling ceases to apply if the arrangement is materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling. The amendment prevents private and product rulings having a wider application than intended. Application date The amendment applies from the date of enactment. Key features The definition of “arrangement” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be amended to duplicate the definition of “arrangement” contained in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, and to include, for the purposes of the private and product rulings legislation, facts that are material, or relevant as background or context to any of the matters on which a private or product ruling is sought. The amendment will allow the Commissioner to include facts that may not technically be part of the “arrangement” (as currently defined in section OB 1) that is the subject of a ruling, but nevertheless are important as background or as context to the transaction proposed. Such facts will become subject to the ruling non-application tests contained in sections 91EB(2)(a) and 91FB(2)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The tests provide that if the arrangement is, in reality, materially different from the arrangement identified in the ruling, then the ruling does not apply. The amendment will not affect the Commissioner’s existing ability to include facts in private and product rulings that are, under the existing definition of “arrangement”, unambiguously part of the arrangement that is the subject of the ruling. 76 Background Private and product binding rulings are made in respect of an “arrangement”. The word “arrangement” is defined as “any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), including all steps by which it is carried into effect”. The legislation prescribes that when a private or product ruling is issued, the particular arrangement to which the ruling applies must be specified as part of the ruling. It also provides that if the actual arrangement subsequently proves to be materially different from that specified in the ruling, then the ruling will not apply. Inland Revenue often includes in a ruling numerous facts describing an arrangement that are considered to be relevant as background or as context to the transaction proposed. However, it is possible that, on a strict interpretation, while the facts are highly relevant, they do not form part of the “arrangement” as such. Excluding these facts potentially makes the ruling of more general application than intended. It is therefore important that Inland Revenue can set out these facts in rulings without giving rise to the technical issue of whether the facts are part of the “arrangement” identified in the ruling.

The first stage was the reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976, which resulted in the enactment of the Income Tax Act 1994. The second stage, the rewrite of the core provisions of the Act, was completed in 1996. This bill, which rewrites Parts A to E and Y of the Act, is the third stage of the project, leaving approximately half of the Act to be rewritten in future stages. The key aim of the rewrite project is to produce tax legislation that is clear, uses plain language and is structurally consistent. Clear legislation makes an important contribution to increasing voluntary compliance with tax laws, because taxpayers can more easily identify and observe their income tax obligations. The objective is to make the legislation clear without substantively changing the policy content, and associated compliance requirements, of the current Act. The policy clarifications made in the bill are of a minor nature and have been presented for public consultation in recent years. They are discussed in chapter four. The bill rewrites Parts C, D, and E and aspects of Parts A and B. It re-enacts, but does not rewrite, the remainder of the Act. The new Act comes into force on 1 April 2004 and applies to income derived in the 2004-05 tax year and later tax years (or in the corresponding income years). Care has been taken in the development of the bill to ensure that its provisions have the same outcomes as those of the current Act. Some minor policy clarifications have been made, but were subject to consultation before they were included. If in the initial years of the new Act’s operation it is found to produce a different result from that which would have been produced under the 1994 Act, the Government will promote a remedial amendment to correct the position from the date of effect of the new legislation. The bill re-enacts the entire Act for the benefit of users. The options for the bill were to: • amend the current Act by replacing Parts A to E and Y with rewritten Parts; or • produce a new Act containing rewritten Parts A to E and Y and reproduced Parts F to O and the schedules. The second option was chosen because it minimises confusion over the numbering of sections. For example, in the current Part C, section CB 1 is about the exempt income status of interest. In the rewritten Part C, clause CB 1 is about the income status of amounts derived from business. If the current Act were amended, users referring to section CB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 would need to make it clear whether the reference is to section CB 1 of the Act before it was amended or section CB 1 as inserted by the amendment. If there is a new Act, the reference can be identified as section CB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or section CB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2002. 2 History of the rewrite New Zealand’s Income Tax Act is a very old piece of legislation, dating back to 1891. In the intervening period the Act has expanded significantly to become a more comprehensive measure of income and to reflect the changing nature of tax and business in New Zealand. The Act has been recast on several occasions but it was not until the 1990s that it was comprehensively reviewed from a fundamental structural and presentational perspective. Various reports and papers in the early 1990s discussed the rewriting of the Income Tax Act. The first significant report was that of the Consultative Committee on the Taxation of Income from Capital (the Valabh Committee) in 1990. The committee highlighted various weaknesses in the numbering, formatting and reorganisation of the legislation, including: • a lack of integration in the core provisions, and between the core provisions and the rest of the Act; • difficulty in discerning the scheme and purpose; • the absence of a logical structure in the Act and the ordering of its sections; • a failure in the organisation of the material to reflect the Act’s role, that role being to quantify taxable income, to impose the tax liability on that income, and to set out the process of assessment and collection; and • inconsistent drafting styles, redundant wording, cumbersome sections, and repetitive provisions. To resolve these problems the Valabh Committee proposed: • the division of the existing legislation into separate Acts; • the division of those Acts into parts and subparts; • the reorganisation of the legislation into a more logical and coherent scheme; • the consolidation of certain legislation; • the use of purpose clauses and extra-statutory references; and • a commitment to modern drafting techniques and to plain language. Following on from the recommendations of the Valabh Committee, the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act recommended in 1993 that the Act be reordered, reorganised and progressively rewritten. The report of the Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department in 1994 also supported the rewriting of the Act. 3 The substantive reordering of the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 was completed in 1994. This work produced the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. New core provisions for the Income Tax Act 1994 were enacted in 1996, with effect from the 1997-98 year. As a result, the Income Tax Act is now organised by parts based around a set of core provisions under an alphanumeric numbering system. There has been some consolidation of material by topic, and the definitions have been brought together in one section. Work over the last few years has focussed on refining the new structure and progressively redrafting Parts A to E of the Act using plain language drafting techniques. During that time, the following documents have been issued for purposes of consultation: • a discussion document on the possible structure and content of Parts C, D, and E and their relationship to the new core provisions; 1 • two issues papers identifying policy issues that had arisen in the course of rewriting; 2 and • an exposure draft of the rewritten legislation. Submissions made in response to these documents have had an important influence on the development of this bill. New Zealand has not been alone in seeing the need for rewriting its tax legislation. Similar work is under way in Australia and the United Kingdom. Advisory Panel The Advisory Panel on the Rewrite of the Income Tax Act has provided the Government with valuable assistance in the development of the bill. The panel, which was established in 1995, is chaired by Colin Blair and consists of one representative each from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand, the New Zealand Law Society, the Inland Revenue Department and the Treasury. The panel has two core functions: • to ensure that there is a procedure in place to identify any policy issues that might arise from the rewrite drafting instructions or draft legislation and to refer such policy issues to the Government with relevant comments; and • to act as a “steering committee” and report periodically to the Government on the achievement by the project team of pre-determined milestones and adherence to agreed processes, including adequate public consultation. 1 Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Parts C, D and E.

June 1998. 4 It has performed those functions to a high standard and has made an important contribution to the development of this bill. Why the Act needs rewriting Although the Income Tax Act itself dates back to 1891, the structure on which it is based has existed since 1916, when the Act comprised 43 pages and 169 sections. Since that time layers and layers of major changes and new groups of tax rules have been added to the legislation, with the result that it now comprises over 2000 pages. The 1916 structure was not able to support the increased volume and sophistication of the legislation that was added later, with the result that by 1990 it had become difficult to discern a cohesive scheme and purpose within the Income Tax Act 1976. Moreover, the language that has been used by drafters over the years to deal with complex policy objectives was very difficult for most readers to understand. The problem was discussed in detail in the report Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department, 3 presented to the Minister of Revenue in 1994. The report said: Currently the legislation attempts to deal with the complexity and to provide certainty and precision through the detailed expression of policies in the variety of complex circumstances in which they operate. As a result the intent is often blurred in a torrent of convoluted language in sentences of an average length, measured by a 1992 study, of 135 words. Tax practitioners, Treasury and IRD agree that the legislation is difficult to read and understand. That must have a direct bearing on the difficulties and the cost of administering the legislation and the difficulties and the cost for taxpayers of complying with the legislation. \[page 79\] Advantages of rewriting the Act The benefit of clear legislation will be felt in the longer term. The report Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department observed that: In a 1994 study by Tan and Tooley, 69 percent of tax practitioners surveyed considered tax legislation difficult to read. In commenting to the review committee on those findings, IRD agreed that tax legislation was very difficult to read and understand. It is obvious that those comprehension problems must have a direct bearing on the difficulties and so the cost of administering the legislation and the cost of complying with the legislation. \[Appendix H of the report\] Making the law clearer will result in an overall reduction in business compliance costs. The reorganisation of material into a consistent structure, and rewriting it in plain language, will make it easier for readers to locate all the material they need to read and to understand what they read, thus saving time and cost. 3 Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Department: Report to the Minister of Revenue (and on tax policy, also to the Minister of Finance) from the Organisational Review Committee. April 1994. 5 Examples of the benefit of plain language drafting The plain language style of drafting includes presenting ideas clearly and directly, avoiding archaic terms, repetition and verbosity, and using words as close to their ordinary meaning as possible. Set out here are three samples of rewritten legislation which demonstrate the advantage of using these principles. 6 EXAMPLE 1 Breaking a 14-line sentence into easily understood pieces Current legislation DJ 2 Deduction from estate income of irrecoverable book debts Where the amount of any debt owing to any person at the date of the person's death has been included in gross income of the person or of the trustee of the person's estate for any income year, and the debt or any part of it is proved to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to be irrecoverable and to have been actually written off by the trustee as a bad debt, the amount so written off shall be deemed to be a loss incurred by the trustee in the income year in which the amount was written off, and shall be allowed as a deduction, first to the trustee to the extent of any gross income derived by the trustee as trustee income, and then, as to any balance, to any beneficiary to the extent of any gross income derived in that year by or in trust for the beneficiary if that beneficiary has a vested interest in the capital of the estate to the extent that the loss is chargeable against the capital of that beneficiary; and any balance not allowed as a deduction in that year shall be allowed as a deduction in that same manner to the extent of gross income of the trustee or beneficiary derived in the next income year and so on. Rewritten legislation DB 24 Bad debts owed to estates When this section applies (1) This section applies when – (a) a debt owing to a person at the date of their death is, for a tax year, – (i) counted income of the person; or (ii) counted income of the trustee of their estate; and (b) some or all of the debt is written off as bad because it is not recoverable. Deduction (2) The following persons, in the following order, are allowed a deduction for the amount of the debt written off: (a) first, the trustee, to the extent of counted income derived as trustee income; and (b) second, any beneficiary who has a vested interest in the capital of the estate, to the extent of counted income derived in the tax year by or in trust for the beneficiary, and to the extent to which the amount is chargeable against the capital of the beneficiary; and (c) third, the trustee or a beneficiary denied a deduction for the balance in the tax year is allowed a deduction in the same manner in the next tax year, and so on. (3) Link with subpart DA This section supplements the general permission. The general limitations still apply. 7 EXAMPLE 2 Breaking up a long sentence covering three ideas into three separate sections Current legislation CD 4 Personal property The gross income of any person includes, any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of any personal property or any interest in personal property (not being property or any interest in property which consists of land), if the business of the person comprises dealing in such property or if the property was acquired for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of it, and any amount derived from the carrying on or carrying out of any undertaking or scheme entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit. Rewritten legislation Schemes for profit CB 2 Carrying on or carrying out schemes for profit An amount that a person derives from carrying on or carrying out an undertaking or scheme entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit is income of the person. Personal property CB 3 Personal property acquired for purpose of disposal An amount that a person derives from the disposal of personal property is income of the person if they acquired the property for the purpose of disposing of it. CB 4 Business of dealing in personal property An amount that a person derives from the disposal of personal property is income of the person if their business is to deal in property of that type. 8 E XAMPLE 3 Explaining what is allowed rather than what is not Current legislation DD 1 Certain deductions not allowed - rents, interest, and premises Except as expressly provided in this Act, no deduction is allowed to a taxpayer in respect of any of the following sums or matters: (a) ......... (b) Interest (not being interest of any of the kinds referred to in section DB 1(1)(e) and not being interest to which section LF 7 applies to prohibit a deduction), except so far as the Commissioner is satisfied that - (i) It is payable in deriving the taxpayer's gross income; or (ii) It is necessarily payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving the taxpayer's gross income; or (iii) ......... Rewritten legislation DB 6 Interest: not capital expenditure Deduction (1) A person is allowed a deduction for interest incurred. (2) (3) Exclusion Subsection (1) does not apply to interest for which a person is denied a deduction under section DB 1. Link with subpart DA This section overrides the capital limitation. The general permission must still be satisfied and other general limitations still apply. 9 Chapter Two STRUCTURE OF THE NEW ACT The structure of the revised Act has been the subject of much discussion from the time of the Valabh Committee report, culminating in the discussion document on the rewrite of Parts C, D, and E of the Income Tax Act 1994 (September 1997). That document set out a detailed structure for the three parts. The importance of the three as a group is that, together, they define the elements that determine net income. The discussion document recognised that creating a clearer scheme for the Act requires a logical organisation of the material that takes into account both the function of provisions and their subject matter. Accordingly, improving the structure has been a key aim of the rewrite. The core provisions enacted in 1996 gave the Act a more consistent scheme, establishing the notion that each part of the Act has a specific function. The bill applies this notion across Parts C, D, and E and also clarifies the interaction of those parts with the core provisions. Therefore the core provisions have also been rewritten. Structural principles The general structural principles adopted in the rewritten legislation are: • Organising from the general to the specific. Parts, subparts, and sections generally begin with more widely used rules and conclude with less widely used rules. • Using general rules to perform a pivotal role. General rules have been used to overarch more specific rules, the general deductibility provision in draft Part D being a prime example. This approach helps to identify the inter- relationships between the provisions and any common policy intent. • Minimising overlap. An aim has been to make the categories used to group items as self-contained as possible. • Grouping like with like. Functions or subject matter that are the same have been grouped for the reader’s convenience, and to put provisions within a context. • Reducing repetition. An aim has been to minimise duplication. Applying common sets of rules is one technique that has been used to achieve this. • Using a consistent format. This aids accessibility by improving the flow of the text. • Linking back to the core provisions. When the Act was restructured in 1994, subparts CA, DA, and EA were reserved for provisions setting out the purpose of the relevant part. However, purpose provisions have not been included in the bill on the basis that it is difficult to draft a meaningful yet comprehensive purpose provision for parts which are either lists or disparate. Also, the title, structure, table of contents, and sub-indexes should adequately clarify the role 10 of each Part. Instead, for draft Parts C and D, subpart A sets out the general rules that link back to the core provisions. Draft Part E does not have a similar set of general rules because it contains a disparate set of regimes. • Placing terminating provisions into a separate subpart at the end of each part. This is a continuation from the current Act but the contents of subparts CZ, DZ, and EZ have been significantly culled because many of the provisions are either spent or are unlikely to have future relevance. Omitting these provisions does not remove their application to relevant past situations, but it does reduce the size of the Act. Core provisions of the bill Overall, the core provisions retain their role of stating the principal rules on what is income, what is a deduction, and how that income or deduction is timed. Draft Parts C, D, and E then provide the associated detail. However, a consequence of rewriting the legislation in phases is that the rewrite of later parts can necessitate changes to previously rewritten parts. This is true of the core provisions and has resulted in several key changes: • The deduction rules in section BD 2 have been shifted to draft Part D. This change was signalled in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E and is discussed further in the commentary on the structure of draft Part D (page 15). • The proposal that the terms derived and incurred be defined in the legislation has not proceeded in light of the submissions on the exposure draft. Submitters expressed the view that the proposed definitions were not a clear reflection of the case law interpretation of the terms and were likely to result in confusion rather than enlightenment. The submissions have been accepted, but it is nevertheless desirable that readers of the legislation appreciate the importance of these terms. For this reason the bill draws readers’ attention to the fact that their meaning in the tax context has been established by case law. • The rules on allocating income and deductions acknowledge that there are sets of rules that are not general timing regimes but nevertheless allocate amounts to income years other than simply on a derived and incurred basis, as understood by the common law. The discussion document on Parts C, D, and E proposed that these timing regimes be included in non-exhaustive definitions of derived and incurred, on a deemed basis. The reason for not adopting the discussion document approach is that is easier for readers if the timing rule and the associated income/deduction provision are kept together, as many of the timing aspects are ancillary minor modifications and closely linked with their respective income and deduction provisions. Similarly, certain key terminological changes have been made: • Gross income has become income. Gross income was a useful term to emphasise the change from a net to a gross basis as part of the core provisions, but this change has now been sufficiently understood and embedded to allow the simpler term income to be used. Also, some items of gross income are, in fact, net concepts and the term is, therefore, inaccurate. 11 • A new concept of counted income distinguishes amounts of income that are taxable from amounts, such as exempt income, that are not. The term counted income is used both in the core provisions and in cases where the current term gross income needs to be read as excluding exempt income – for example, when deductions are authorised. This approach preserves current law, under which references to gross income must be read as excluding exempt income. • Annual allowable deduction has become annual total deduction. Likewise, allowable deduction has become deduction. This does not imply any change to the apportionment rules. • Taxpayer is replaced by person. The Act currently applies these terms without any uniformity – some subparts refer to taxpayers while others refer to persons. The bill applies person across the board in Parts A to E because the subtleties of the definition of taxpayer are not evident from the term. • Tax year has been defined as the period from 1 April to 31 March. Income year has been retained in recognition that individual taxpayers may have assessment periods that end other than on 31 March. Certain provisions have been omitted. Section AA 2, which attempts to identify whom the Act covers, has been omitted because of its inaccuracy. Even though the discussion document had noted the benefit of section AA 2 as an indication to readers as to whether they are covered by the Act, it is too inaccurate as a general statement and would become too detailed if made accurate. Section AA 3 (1) has also been omitted because it duplicates an equivalent provision in the Interpretation Act 1999. Part C of the bill Draft Part C defines income and identifies the person to whom the income belongs. It also defines amounts that would be income but are, nevertheless, exempted or excluded from income. The structure of draft Part C largely follows that set out in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E, taking into account the submissions on that document; for example, business income has been given greater prominence than proposed in the discussion document. Overall structure General rules as to what is income are set out in draft subpart CA. These introduce the specific rules in the rest of draft Part C and include a catch-all provision in clause CA 1 to pick up any other amounts that would be income under ordinary concepts, corresponding to section CD 5. Following the structural principle of organising from the general to the specific, four general categories of income result: • income from business or trade-like activities, in draft subpart CB; • income from holding property (divided into non-equity, in draft subpart CC, and equity in draft subpart CD); 12 • income from employment in draft subpart CE; and • pensions and government entitlements (such as benefits, compensation and government grants) in draft subpart CF. Draft subpart CG then brings together the separate provisions throughout the Act relating to recoveries and adjustments for the purposes of either: • negating the effect of a deduction previously allocated to an income year, such as in the case of a recovered bad debt; or • limiting the effect of a deduction in the year to which it is allocated, such as trading stock adjustments or when a government grant or suspensory loan is provided under current subpart DC. Moving to the more specific, income from controlled foreign companies and foreign investment funds, life insurance, superannuation funds, petroleum mining, and mineral mining are respectively contained in draft subparts CQ, CR, CS, CT, and CU. Provisions that quantify income and time when it is recognised have been moved to draft Part E. Entity-specific rules for group companies and crown research institutes are contained in draft subpart CV. Amounts that are exempt income or excluded income are, respectively, provided for in draft subparts CW and CX. Exempt income covers amounts that would normally be considered to be income but are exempted by virtue of the nature of the income or the person who receives the income. The exemption is made specifically. Excluded income covers those other amounts that the statute excludes from tax other than by specific exemption, such as output tax on goods and services supplied by a registered person, as well as those items, such as fringe benefits, that are equivalent to income or would be income were it not for the fact that someone else pays the tax. Draft subpart CY notes that there are provisions in other parts of the Act that make items income. Likewise, draft Part D contains a comparable draft subpart DY for deductions elsewhere in the Act. The placement of the provisions outside Parts C and D will be revisited as the other Parts of the Act are progressively rewritten. Draft subpart CZ has been retained for terminating provisions. If an income provision has an ancillary timing element, the timing element is sometimes included as part of the income provision, rather than being relocated to draft Part E. This is allowed for in the core provisions (clause BD 3(2)). For example, clause CB 29(1) provides that an amount equal to the market value of stolen property is income. Subclause (2) then directs that the amount is income in the income year in which the property is stolen. Splitting off such a closely linked timing element and relocating it in draft Part E would make the information less accessible to readers and make it more difficult for them to find their way to a correct conclusion on the application of the legislation. 13 Part D of the bill The purpose of draft Part D is to define amounts that are deductions. The discussion document on Parts C, D, and E proposed that the Act’s general deductibility rule, currently in section BD 2(1), include section BD 2(2)(e), which precludes deductions for capital expenditure (unless specifically allowed in the Act). Remaining deduction rules would then be divided into the following categories: • deductions for expenditure or loss that satisfy the requirement of the general deductibility rule for a link with deriving gross income; • deductions for expenditure or loss that expand on the general deductibility rule; and • supplementary deductions created by statute. The principle behind the discussion document’s approach was to make explicit whether a specific rule narrows or expands the general deductibility rule and to clarify the relationship between expansions and limitations; for example, expansions are usually subject to the general limitations. The bill adopts aspects of this approach. The general deductibility rule, entitled general permission, is set out in clause DA 1. The exclusions in section BD 2(2) are then brought into clause DA 2 as general limitations to the general permission. The general limitations are limitations for expenditure or loss: • of a capital nature (the capital limitation); • of a private or domestic nature (the private limitation); • incurred in deriving exempt income (the exempt income limitation); • incurred in deriving income from employment (the employment limitation); and • incurred in deriving schedular gross income subject to final withholding (the withholding tax limitation). The provision denying a deduction for capital expenditure, currently in section BD 2(2)(e), has not been included as part of the general permission as was proposed in the discussion document on Parts C, D and E. Instead, it has been included in the general limitations as the capital limitation. Grouping it with the other general limitations is seen as a more appropriate location. Clause DA 3 then sets out in detail the relationship between the remaining rules in draft Part D – those in draft subparts DB to DF and DN to DX – and the general permission and general limitations. The rules in draft subparts DB to DF and DN to DX cover limitations and expansions of the general permission. However, they are not grouped according to whether they limit or expand. Instead, the bill retains a subject-based approach. This approach gives readers of the legislation greater comfort that, once they have dealt with the provisions in a discrete block, there are unlikely to be other provisions elsewhere that also need to be taken into account. Nevertheless, there is still a need to identify which rules override which. Hence, each 14 clause that allows a deduction concludes with a provision identifying its relationship with the other deduction rules. Included among the rules from draft subpart DB onwards are rules which specifically allow a deduction for certain amounts which arise from a calculation undertaken in draft Part E. For example, the trading stock adjustment required when opening value exceeds closing value is allowed as a deduction by clause DB 40, and clause DB 41 allows a deduction for the unexpired amounts of expenditure on prepayments. Draft subpart DY notes that there are provisions in other parts of the Act that make items deductible. Draft subpart DZ covers terminating provisions. Part E of the bill Draft Part E contains sets of rules that have a predominant focus on matching or allocation of income or deductions. As a number of the existing sets of such rules deal with quantification, this has been signalled in the title of the Part. Given that draft Part E contains a range of provisions and sets of rules with differing operative effects, it does not have any general opening provisions. To some extent, such rules are already contained in the core provisions. Nor does draft Part E contain every element of a specific provision that has a timing aspect. This is because splitting every provision would provide difficulties from a reader’s perspective, as many timing provisions are closely linked with their respective income and deduction provisions. Instead, ancillary timing rules remain with the specific provision creating income or a deduction. Necessarily, there has had to be an exercise of judgment as to what is ancillary, bearing in mind that the ultimate aim is to enhance the ease with which readers can find their way to the correct conclusion on the application of the legislation. In addition to the rules on depreciable assets, trading stock, and revenue account property, draft Part E also contains sets of rules within which the timing, income and deduction rules cannot easily be separated, that is, the financial arrangements rules, the international rules and the life insurance rules. However, these groups of rules have been drafted to preserve, for draft Parts C and D, the actual provisions that make the timed and quantified amount either income or a deduction. Specific timing rules Specific timing rules may defer all or part of an income or deduction amount to one or more subsequent income years or, conversely, permit the income or deduction amount to be allocated to an earlier income period. Some timing rules do not allocate income or deductions, as such, but merely have the effect of modifying the allocation that would otherwise occur. A good example is the trading stock valuation rules, which make adjustments separately from the actual deduction claimed for the cost of the trading stock. 15 The key specific timing rules are: • accrual expenditure (section EF 1); • revenue account property (section EF 2); • depreciation (subpart EG); • financial arrangement rules (subpart EH); and • valuation of trading stock (subparts EE, EL, and EM). Other structural changes A number of administrative rules have been moved to the Tax Administration Act 1994. Numbering In draft Parts C, D and E, clauses applying potentially to all or a large number of taxpayers occupy the top of the alphabet, and sections applying to particular groups of taxpayers occupy the bottom of the alphabet, leaving a gap in the middle. The gap allows drafters some leeway in future to avoid the use of subparts with 3-letter identifiers – for example, to avoid inserting a subpart CEA between subparts CE and CF. 17 Chapter Three ORGANISATION OF MATERIAL This chapter sets out the approach that has been taken to the organisation of the legislation. The changes are not categorised on a clause-by-clause basis, but by subject matter. The reason is that the legislation in Parts C, D, and E provides the income, deduction, and timing rules for transactions that have tax implications, with many of the rules being allocated to more than one Part. Discussion of the approach taken to the organisation of material between the Parts is more easily achieved through discussion on a subject matter basis than on a clause by clause basis. This chapter explains the main changes that have been made. It also sets out the subparts or clauses in the bill where the subject matter has been located. However, the information in the boxes should not be regarded as being a definitive list of all the clauses in the bill that deal with the subject matter referred to. Depreciation Bill references Subject matter subpart EE Depreciation To be consistent with the approach adopted for other sets of rules in draft Part E, the depreciation rules are drafted so as to preserve for draft Parts C and D the role of specifying what is income or a deduction. Hence, the focus of the depreciation rules is on the quantification of an amount of depreciation loss. The general rules in draft subpart DA must then be applied to identify whether or not a deduction is allowed for the loss (but with a specific override of the general limitation preventing deductions for capital amounts). This approach also clarifies the relationship between the depreciation rules and the general rules relating to deductibility of expenditure and loss. It avoids duplication of wording designed to require a link with income production appearing in both the general rules and the depreciation rules. The treatment of improvements has been made explicit. At present, the practice is for improvements to be treated separately from the main asset in the year that they are made, and to be eligible for a part-year depreciation deduction. After the end of the income year, the improvement can either be incorporated into the main asset, or continue to be treated as a separate depreciable item. This practice is not, however, explicitly provided for in the current legislation. If the improvement is a separate item, the bill treats it as separately depreciable. Otherwise, the expenditure is incorporated into the cost of the asset. In either case depreciation of the improvement begins from the time the improvement is made. In the bill, specific depreciation-related definitions have been brought into the body of the text. At present, the definitions are spread between subpart EG and section OB 1. The most important definition affected by this change is adjusted tax value. 18 The bill also brings together the provisions relating to ownership, and specifically allows for joint ownership. At present, the only express acknowledgement of the possibility of joint ownership is in section EG 19(8), which refers to disposals by partnerships. For reasons of clarity, the bill divides disposals between actual disposals and other events that are currently deemed to be disposals. Dividends Bill references Subject matter subpart CD Income from equity subpart CW Exempt income – Income from equity Because the bill uses a substantially different approach to presenting the dividend provisions from that in the current legislation, a more detailed explanation of the approach adopted in the bill is set out below. Background The dividend provisions in the Act are currently contained in subpart CF. Those provisions have a varied history. Before 1958, dividends were not taxed directly. From 1958 to 1988 both the company and the shareholder were taxed with, generally, no recognition of any tax paid by the company when an amount was distributed. In 1988 the imputation system was introduced. This system allows individual dividend recipients an offset for any New Zealand tax paid by the company on the distributed income. Also in 1988, the definition of dividend in the Act was rewritten because it had become unwieldy, not only as a result of incorporating imputation but also through the introduction of various withholding tax rules, fringe benefit tax, and a range of policy amendments. Those policy amendments essentially widened the dividend definition to bring in non-cash items. 4 In the early 1990s the Valabh Committee reviewed the definition of dividend, and several changes were made as a result. The key change was the introduction of an explicit shareholder capacity test. This test limited the definition’s coverage to distributions arising from a shareholder’s ownership interest in a company. 5 Since then, the main change to the definition has been to provide for the tax consequences of company law reform that facilitated the buy-back of shares. 4 For example, the remission of loans to shareholders, the acquisition of property at above market rates from shareholders, the making available of company property for the private use of shareholders and the provision of low interest loans to shareholders, and shares in lieu of dividends. 5 A person may receive a payment from a company in many possible capacities – for example, as an employee (in the form of wages), or payment for the provision of other services (say as a contractor), or from the sale of an asset to the company. From the perspective of a dividend, what is important is that there is a link between the payment and a person’s shareholding in the company. 19 Case law Key cases underlying the law on dividends are Smout v CIR (1982) 5 NZTC 61,158 and CIR v Brierley (1990) 12 NZTC 7,184. These cases found that the definition of dividend was a code and exhaustive of the primary taxability of transactions between a company and its shareholders. A code attempts to embody everything (including the common law and existing statutes) in a coherent piece of legislation. These two cases held that distributions from a company to a shareholder that were not dividends were capital in nature and were, therefore, not taxable elsewhere within the Act. Changes to the law since these two cases limit their effect. Under section CF 2(15), for example, a share repurchase can give rise to gross income when the shares are held on revenue account, despite the fact that an amount is excluded from being a dividend. Other exceptions are section CF 3(1)(g) and (h) which, respectively, relate to fringe benefits and certain monetary remuneration received by shareholders. Although these two items are not dividends, they are not excluded (that is, tax-free) income in the Act. Approach underlying the rewritten provisions The central idea behind the definition of dividend is to encompass all corporate distributions to shareholders. Accordingly, the starting point for the rewritten definition is that a dividend is any (net) transfer of value that is obtained by virtue of a shareholder’s ownership interest in a company. This underlies the concept of transfer of value in the bill. But there are certain limitations to this wide coverage because not all transfers of value are treated as dividends. Certain additions are also necessary. And some items are included in the legislation to remove doubt as to whether they are dividends. The adjustments are summarised in the following table. Type of adjustments Reason adjustment necessary Additions Imputation and DWP credits Not of value to company but are of value to shareholder Certain foreign tax credits and refunds of foreign tax Is a benefit to the recipient but not paid by the company Attributed repatriation by controlled foreign company Is a notional non-cash adjustment and so no transfer is made by the company Taxable bonus issue No transfer of value as there is no distribution of property Certain non-cash benefits of shareholder-employees Is a transfer of value but not necessarily received in shareholder capacity Subtractions Returns of capital – share cancellations, treasury stock etc Are transfers of value but no net gain to shareholder Capital distributions on liquidation Are transfers of value but are capital rather than income in nature Taxed elsewhere: subject to FBT, monetary remuneration, cash distributions in relation to notional distributions, FIF interest calculated under certain methods To ensure no double taxation Property from amalgamating company that does not exist after the amalgamation Is conceptually not a transfer of value as the amalgamating company remains in existence as part of the amalgamated company Property made available by flat-owning company No real transfer of value as is merely a form of ownership Use of associated company’s property De minimis rule applies and also exclusion for “downwards” transfers only caught because of breadth of “associated person” rules Included in legislation to remove doubt Non-taxable bonus issues No transfer of value as no property distributed. Share splits reduce the value of existing shares. Included in legislation to confirm that they are excluded income 20 The approach is similar to that outlined in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E. One major exception is that the bill follows the present legislation in making the shareholder capacity test explicit. 6 The bill also retains the indicative criterion for measuring shareholder capacity (that is, the payment is made on terms different from that applying to non-shareholder relationships) even though this is only one possible factor for assessing capacity. Benefits of this approach The main benefits of defining dividend generically followed by specific adjustments are that it: • allows readers to tell at an early stage whether they need to delve further into the subpart; • focuses on the essence of a dividend, which is a net transfer of value from the company to the shareholder in the capacity of shareholder; • simplifies the presentation by removing the need to list all possible instances when a distribution is a dividend. Transfer of value covers section CF 2 (1)(a)- (k) (apart from taxable bonus issues in (f)); and • facilitates future changes to the definition, since they can more readily be accommodated through changes to the adjustments. Specific drafting style The approach to dividends in the rewritten legislation differs from that of the current legislation in a number of main areas. Terminology – Use of ‘company’, ‘share’ and ‘shareholder’ These defined terms have been rewritten and rationalised. The aim is to have a consistent set of words defining when non-standard entities, such as unit trusts, category A group investment funds and producer boards, are treated as companies. Although this stretches the natural meaning of the terms company and share, it is necessary to use a single defined term which is not so generic as to be meaningless to readers, and the relevant entities are generally bodies corporate in nature. The various explanations and qualifications that relate to the individual adjustments to the general rule are now located with the adjustments, and detailed calculation rules are dealt with subsequently and separately. The current legislation is divided between what is a dividend (section CF 2(1)) and what is not a dividend (section CF 3(1)). Following each of these subsections is a series of provisions found both in the rest of subpart CF and elsewhere within the Act. The reader needs to go through these provisions to establish whether there are any limitations to an item specified in either section CF 2(1) or section CF 3(1) or, alternatively, how to calculate the amount that is, or is not, a dividend. These 6 The reason for making the capacity test explicit rather than implicit is to put the application of the test beyond doubt. Making the test explicit also removes the need specifically to exclude payments by a company to its shareholders in relation to services provided to the company. 21 additional rules have generally either now been located alongside their relevant lead provision or else shifted (to avoid obscuring the basic rules) into a separate segment containing detailed calculation rules. Complex and directly relevant definitions incorporated back into the rules At present, key definitions are spread between subpart CF and section OB 1. The definition most affected by this is available subscribed capital. To assist readers, complex and inter-linked definitions have generally been converted into sections located in the relevant segment of draft subpart CD. Employment Bill references Subject matter subpart CE Employee or contractor income subpart CW Exempt income – Employee or contractor income subpart CX Excluded income – Fringe benefits subpart DC Employee or contractor expenditure subpart DD Entertainment expenditure Provisions relating to employees’ remuneration and benefits have been reordered. The main changes are as follows: • Amounts that employees are required to account for as income are brought together in draft subpart CE, including amounts currently provided for in the definition of monetary remuneration and benefits under share purchase agreements. • Amounts that employees would ordinarily be required to account for as income, but that are specifically exempted, are brought together under the heading ‘Employee or contractor income’, in draft subpart CW (Exempt income). • Fringe benefits are identified in a separate division of draft subpart CX (Excluded income). • The specific deduction provisions for employers, at present in subpart DF, now appear in draft subpart DC (Employee or contractor expenditure). Their relationship to general deductibility rules has been made clearer. • The rules limiting deductions for expenditure on entertainment, currently in subpart DG and schedule 6A, now appear in draft subpart DD (Entertainment expenditure). 22 Farming and forestry Bill references Subject matter clauses CB 23 and CB 24 Timber clause CB 25 Refunds under income equalisation scheme clauses CW 1 to CW 3 Forestry clause CX 44 Income equalisation schemes subpart DO Farming and aquacultural business expenditure subpart DP Forestry expenditure subpart DQ Income equalisation schemes subpart EH Income equalisation schemes clause EI 1 Spreading backward of income from timber subpart EJ Spreading of specific expenditure – Farming and forestry The provisions on farming and forestry have been reordered. The main changes are: • The provisions on income arising from farming or forestry have been set out together in clauses CB 23 to CB 25. • The provisions on certificates about the nature of trees and the purpose of their planting, sections CJ 1(3) and DO 4(5), have been moved to the Tax Administration Act 1994. • The provisions on income equalisation schemes have been teased out into a subpart that is longer but simpler than current subpart EI. Films Bill references Subject matter clause CC 11 Films subpart DS Film industry expenditure subpart EJ Spreading of specific expenditure – Films The main structural changes made by the bill are to separate the allowable deduction and timing elements of the current film expenditure provisions in sections EO 3 and EO 4 and move them to draft Parts D and E respectively. The rewritten film expenditure provisions reduce the current overlap between the film expenditure rules and arrange them in a more logical order. The bill makes it clear that the film expenditure rules override the matching rules for the cost of revenue account property. Because all amounts received from the disposal of a film are income, films would come within the definition of revenue account property. 23 Financial arrangements rules Bill references Subject matter clause CC 3 Financial arrangements clauses DB 9 to DB 12 Financial arrangements adjustments subpart EW Financial arrangements rules subpart EZ Terminating provisions – Old financial arrangements rules The rules for calculating and allocating income and expenditure under financial arrangements were revised in 1999. The 1999 revisions were implemented by making the sections in subpart EH into division 1 and adding a division 2. Some minor amendments were made to division 1, but essentially it was left unchanged so as not to disturb the law under which existing financial arrangements had been made. There is no advantage in departing from that approach and rewriting it now. As a result, the bill contains a rewritten version only of subpart EH, division 2. Division 1 has been shifted to subpart EZ. International Bill references Subject matter subpart CQ Attributed income from foreign equity subpart DN Attributed losses from foreign equity subpart EX Controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules The structure of these provisions has been altered in a number of ways: • Provisions relating to both the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules and the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules have been re-ordered. • Provisions that merely create the income amount or deduction amount have been included in, respectively, draft subparts CQ (Attributed income from foreign equity) and DN (Attributed losses from foreign equity). This is consistent with the structural approach in the bill. Each of these subparts is subdivided to deal separately with the CFC and FIF rules. Each subpart has a section listing the criteria that must be satisfied for amounts to be attributed under either the CFC or FIF rules. These provisions cross-refer to the relevant provisions in draft Part E that detail the specific rules in the CFC and FIF regimes. • The remaining detailed rules within the CFC and FIF regimes have been shifted from draft Part C, where they are currently located, into draft Part E. Because the rules apply equally to the calculation of income amounts and loss amounts, it is inappropriate to put them in draft Part C. Also, because the rules deal in significant part with both timing and quantification aspects, draft Part E is a more appropriate location. 24 • Some very detailed definitions have been shifted from section OB 1 into the body of the operative provisions in draft subpart EX. For example, the definition of interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme is so detailed that it best appears as a specific provision in draft subpart EX. • Some spent provisions have been omitted, and in one case a terminating provision (relating to FIF interests held on 1 April 1993) has been shifted to draft subpart EZ. • Provisions in the FIF rules that treat non-market transactions as having taken place at market value have been shifted into subpart GD, on the basis that the bill’s structure requires subpart GD to be used for circumstances when transactions are deemed to take place at market value. However, a flag is left in draft subpart EX directing readers to the relevant provision in subpart GD. • In draft subpart EX the detailed rules of the CFC and FIF regimes have been restructured and subdivided to make it easier to understand how the detail of those regimes functions to produce a result in terms of income or loss for a taxpayer. • Some new terminology has been introduced. In particular, the term attributing interest has been used in the FIF rules to avoid having to use the existing term interest in a foreign investment fund to define both what constitutes a fund and what constitutes an interest that gives rise to FIF income or loss. Also, to reduce verbosity, the acronyms CFC and FIF are used widely. Life insurance, general insurance and superannuation funds Bill references Subject matter subpart CR Income from life insurance subpart CS Superannuation funds clauses CX 34 to CX 36 Insurance subpart DR Life insurance business expenditure clauses DV 1 to DV 4 Superannuation funds subpart EY Life insurance rules clauses FC 13 to FC 17 Non-resident general insurers These provisions deal with sections of the Act that specifically relate to the taxation of life insurers, general insurers, and superannuation funds. There are two main structural changes. First, the bulk of the provisions on life insurance have been moved into draft Part E. An amount timed and quantified under the life insurance rules in draft Part E is made either income or a deduction by a provision in draft Part C or Part D. Second, the provisions on non-resident general insurers have been moved into Part F, which deals with apportionment and recharacterised transactions. 25 Livestock Bill references Subject matter clause CH 1 Trading stock, livestock, and excepted financial arrangements clause DB 40 Trading stock, livestock, and excepted financial arrangements subpart EC Valuation of livestock These provisions set out the options available to owners and bailees of livestock for valuing livestock on hand at the end of the year. Taxpayers are required to choose a particular valuation option. As with trading stock, the purpose of valuing the livestock on hand is to establish the extent to which an adjustment needs to be made to ensure that what is claimed as a deduction is only the cost of the stock that is sold. But, in the case of the herd scheme, the adjustment serves a different purpose – to ensure that any change in an animal’s average value does not have a tax impact. At present, the livestock valuations fit into the general trading stock rules (through section EE 2) by subtracting the opening value from the closing value to produce a valuation adjustment. Livestock is specifically included within the definition of trading stock. In the bill, livestock is separated from the definition of trading stock. The reason for not treating livestock as trading stock is that livestock is an amalgam of plant and goods produced for sale. 7 Despite this separation, livestock will continue to be on revenue account. Partnership elections To prevent confusion about whether a valuation election applies to all activities of a taxpayer when that taxpayer has an interest in a partnership as well as other interests, the bill makes it clear that the partnership interest is to be treated separately. The general rule is that an election applies to all of a taxpayer’s livestock. But the intention is that taxpayers can make separate elections for the partnership interest and their individual interests. Therefore taxpayers who own their own farm and are also a partner in another farming venture do not have to apply the same valuation method chosen for the partnership to livestock on their own farm. 7 The herd scheme option for valuing livestock for tax purposes is provided in recognition that animals can be on hand to produce other goods (such as offspring, wool and milk) rather than merely as goods in their own right. 26 Mining Bill references Subject matter subpart CT Income from petroleum mining subpart CU Income from mineral mining clauses CX 37 and CX 38 Petroleum mining clauses CX 39 to CX 41 Mineral mining subpart DT Petroleum mining expenditure subpart DU Mineral mining expenditure Provisions relating to both petroleum and mineral mining have been reordered: • Provisions identifying income from mining and related activity are brought together in draft subparts CT (Income from petroleum mining) and CU (Income from mineral mining). Much of this material is currently located in Part D. • Provisions allowing deductions related to mining activity are brought together in draft subparts DT (Petroleum mining expenditure) and DU (Mineral mining expenditure). The bill makes it clear that the specific petroleum mining deduction provisions override the revenue account property rules (section EF 2). Property Bill references Subject matter subpart CB Income from business or trade-like activities subpart CC Income from holding property (excluding equity) clauses CW 4 to CW 8 Income from holding property (excluding equity) clauses DB 13 to DB 16 Premises costs clauses DB 17 to DB 22 Revenue account property clauses DB 28 to DB 31 Patent rights clauses DB 33 to DB 36 Theft and bribery clauses EI 2 to EI 5 Land clauses EJ 19 and EJ 20 Leases Provisions relating to property have been reordered: • Income provisions that are currently grouped within single sections have been split into separate sections. For example, the three limbs of section CD 4 (Personal property) now appear in three different clauses, with their subject matter clearly signalled. The different rules in section CD 1 (Land transactions) are similarly separated. • Amounts that are royalties, but that are currently identified in the definition of royalty in section OB 1, are brought into the substantive royalty provision in draft Part C. 27 • Provisions that allow a deduction for expenditure incurred following non- compliance with a covenant to repair, currently in sections EN 1 and EO 5, now appear in a division, ‘Premises costs’, of draft subpart DB (Specific rules for expenditure types). • Spreading options for income and expenditure appear under the division heading ‘Land’ in draft subpart EI (Spreading of specific income) and under ‘Leases’ in subpart EJ (Spreading of specific expenditure). However, ancillary timing rules such as section EN 5, which allocates income derived from stolen property, have been relocated with the income or deduction provision to which they relate. Trading stock Bill references Subject matter clause CH 1 Trading stock, livestock, and excepted financial arrangements clause DB 40 Trading stock, livestock, and excepted financial arrangements subpart EB Valuation of trading stock (including dealer’s livestock) These provisions set out the valuation rules for trading stock that are used to value stock on hand at year-end. This value is then compared with last year’s closing value (equivalent to this year’s opening value) to derive an annual valuation adjustment. The approach adopted in the bill is consistent with the approach outlined in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E in that the adjustment feeds into either draft Part C or Part D rather than, as at present, the closing value being income and the opening value a deduction. The definition of trading stock has been incorporated into the bill. However, livestock has been excluded from the definition, as have bloodstock and excepted financial arrangements. This makes no practical difference as livestock and bloodstock already have their own subparts. There are two reasons for excluding excepted financial arrangements from the definition. The excepted financial arrangement provisions do not fit well with the trading stock rules because they apply to all excepted financial arrangements that are revenue account property, not just those that are trading stock. Moreover, excepted financial arrangements can be valued only at cost, whereas trading stock in general can potentially be valued at either its cost, market value or replacement price. Even though livestock, bloodstock and excepted financial arrangements have been separated from trading stock, they are all put through the same process to calculate a combined annual stock adjustment (see clause EA 1). 29 Chapter Four POLICY CLARIFICATIONS Making the law clearer has been achieved by using plain language within a consistent structure. The objective is to do this without substantively changing the policy content, and associated compliance requirements, of the current Act. Care has been taken to ensure that, apart from minor policy clarifications, the bill produces the same outcome as the existing law. The proposed policy clarifications were presented in the exposure draft of the rewritten legislation that was released for public consultation in September 2001, in earlier policy documents, such as issues papers 1 and 2, and in two discussion documents. The bill takes into account the submissions received on those documents. The policy clarifications that have been made in the bill are of a minor nature and have been presented for public consultation in recent years. Rather than repeat all those proposals, this chapter is confined to the main changes that have been made in the bill. Consistent with the principles of self-assessment outlined in the discussion document Legislating for self-assessment of tax liability, especially Chapter 4, Commissioner’s discretions have been removed where appropriate. Two proposed changes that were identified in the exposure draft were opposed in submissions and have not been included in the bill. They relate to the provision of services to shareholders at less than market value, and taxation of dealers in personal property. Dividends – inclusion of services The central idea behind the definition of dividend is to encompass all corporate distributions to shareholders. Accordingly, the starting point for the rewritten definition is that a dividend is any (net) transfer of value that is obtained by virtue of a shareholder’s ownership interest in a company. The exposure draft of the rewritten legislation suggested that, conceptually, this approach would include not only benefits arising in relation to property but also benefits from services provided by the company to its shareholders for inadequate consideration. Consequently, it was proposed that the definition of dividend be extended to cover services provided by all organisations, not just closely-held companies. Submissions on the exposure draft opposed this change as representing a significant change in the law which should be subject to further consultation. For this reason it has not been included in the bill, but will be subject to further consultation as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. 30 Dealers in personal property The rewrite exposure draft proposed a change to the provision that taxes the sale of personal property by a person who is in the business of dealing in that type of property (section CD 4). The provision currently does not clarify whether or not the property must have been acquired or held for the purposes of the business – section CD 4, third limb. The exposure draft proposed the express removal of a portfolio distinction for these dealers by deeming all property in which they dealt to be on dealing account. The proposal was opposed in some submissions, which argued that it went beyond clarification and would represent a change in the law. As a result, it has not been included in the bill, and further consultation will be undertaken through the normal tax policy development process. New issue: Recovery of amounts previously claimed as a deduction One policy issue that has not been the subject of public consultation relates to the recovery of an amount that has previously been allowed as a deduction. Currently, the Act prohibits a deduction for expenditure or loss which, although otherwise deductible, is recoverable under insurance or a right of indemnity. This denial can create a problem if the amount recovered is itself treated as income. Denying the deduction means that the taxpayer ends up being taxed twice. General insurers who get reinsurance payments as part of their business are an example of taxpayers who are, theoretically at least, exposed in this way. The bill deals with this problem by dispensing with the provision that prohibits the deduction of the amount recovered and replacing it with a provision that treats the amount recovered as income. The change is that the amount recovered is treated as income in the year it is recovered, whereas under current law it is effectively treated as income in the year the deduction was claimed. Part C changes Section CB 1 (Exempt income – interest). Subsection (1)(a), which provides a limited exemption for interest from Post Office National Development Bonds or New Zealand Savings Certificates, has not been rewritten as it is obsolete. Section CB 2 (Non-residents’ exempt income). Subsection (1)(c), which exempts personal services income earned by visitors to New Zealand if the visit does not exceed a period of 92 days has been rewritten as clause CW 15. The clause now makes clear that the day of arrival and the day of departure each counts as a whole day for the purpose of calculating the 92-day period. The change makes the provision consistent with section OE 1(4), which directs part-days to be included when calculating the 183-day period for residence. 31 Section CB 3 (Public and local authorities’ exempt income). Paragraph (b)(i), which exempts any amount derived by a local authority other than an amount received in trust, has been rewritten as clause CW 29 and now makes clear that the amounts intended to be excepted from the exemption are amounts that a local authority receives as a trustee. Section CB 3 (Public and local authorities’ exempt income). Paragraph (d), which exempts the income of Geothermal Development Limited, has not been rewritten as it is obsolete. Section CB 5 (Certain pensions, benefits, and other compensation exempt). Subsection (1)(d), which exempts certain retiring allowances of former public servants of the Cook Islands and Western Samoa, has not been rewritten. The payments identified in the provision are now deemed not to be income by clause HH 3 (5), the provision that provides generally that distributions to beneficiaries from a qualifying trust are not income. The provision is, therefore, superfluous. Section CC 2 (Payments to employees or former employees while on naval, military, or air service). This section has been omitted from the bill because it is redundant. The effect of the section is covered by clause CA 1(2). Section CC 3 (Forestry encouragement grants). This section has not been rewritten because grants are no longer available. Section CD 1 (Land transactions). The timing of the associated person tests in section CD 1(2)(b), (c), and (d) has been clarified. Clauses CB 6 to CB 9 make clear that the test of association applies when land is acquired or, in the case of builders, improved, rather than at the time of disposal. Section CE 2 (Amounts derived from use or occupation of land). This section has not been rewritten. Its predecessor was introduced in 1939 at a time when farmers whose land had an unimproved value of £3,000 or less were not liable to pay income tax. The intention of the government of the day was to ensure that farmers would pay income tax on the same basis as other income earners. However, that policy objective is now achieved by the general business rule so section CE 2 is superfluous. Section CE 4 (Amounts remitted to be gross income). Issues paper 2 proposed that when amounts of expenditure or loss for which a deduction has been allowed in one year are remitted in a subsequent year, the remitted amount be treated as income and allocated to the year in which the remission occurs. Currently, the remitted amount is treated as income but is backdated to the year the original deduction was taken, requiring an amendment to the tax return for that year. The proposal has been incorporated into the bill. Section CJ 1 (Income from minerals, timber, or flax). The reference to flax in section CJ 1 has not been rewritten. Amounts derived from a disposition of flax will continue to be identified as income, when appropriate, by clauses CB 1 to CB 4 (sections CD 3 (Business) and CD 4 (Personal property) of the 1994 Act). Expenditure incurred in deriving such income will continue to be deductible under the normal deductibility and revenue account property rules. 32 Section CK 2 (Energy trading operators). This section, which provides that certain amounts are income of energy trading operators, has not been rewritten. No energy trading operators remain in existence and so the provision is obsolete. Section CL 2 (Trustee income). This section provides that the trustees of investing superannuation funds are not taxed on the proceeds of life insurance policies that have been issued in New Zealand. The section has been rewritten as clause CX 35 and altered to extend coverage to life insurance policies offered or entered into in New Zealand. This makes the provision consistent with the other parts of the life insurance tax regime. Section CM 2 (Business of life insurance may include provision of annuity). This section treats annuity business as though it were life insurance business. The section has been absorbed into the definition of life insurance. Section CM 18(1) (Transfer of life insurance business). This subsection sets out the opening balance of the actuarial reserves that a transferee must use in performing the policyholder base income or loss calculation under section CM 15. It is the aggregate of the actuarial reserves of the life insurer in respect of all policies of life insurance for which the life insurer was the insurer immediately after the transfer. A change has been made to make it clear that the pre-existing life insurance business of the transferee is also included in the opening actuarial reserves figure. Section CM 18(2) (Transfer of life insurance business). This subsection deals with the transfer of life insurance business between companies in a wholly owned group. The provision has been rewritten as clause EY 44, and a change has been made to make it clear that both companies in a wholly owned group must be in the same group at the time of that transfer rather than at any time during the year. Section CN 3(2) (Non resident life insurer issuing policies in New Zealand). This subsection makes it clear that non-life insurance business of a life insurer is taxed under the normal provisions of the Act. This provision was used under the former schedular approach to the taxation of life insurance. It has not been rewritten because it is no longer needed. Section CZ 3 (Fringe benefit tax). This section, which imposed fringe benefit tax in limited circumstances during the period April to October 1989, is obsolete and has not been rewritten. Section CZ 6 (Insurance companies other than life insurance companies). The transitional provisions relating to non-life insurers contained in section CZ 6 have been omitted as they are no longer applicable. Part D changes Section DH 2 (Use of actual records to establish business use proportion of motor vehicle). Clause DE 12 allows Inland Revenue Mileage Rates to be used to measure business use of a motor vehicle. 33 Section DF 3(1) (Contributions to employees’ superannuation schemes). The first part of this section has not been rewritten. In allowing a deduction for employer superannuation contributions, it merely replicates the general deduction rule. The part of subsection (1) that allocates the deduction to the time when the contribution is made has been combined with section EO 1 in a new, comprehensive timing rule for employer superannuation contributions (clause EJ 21). Subsection (2), which denies a deduction for employer superannuation contributions to schemes that are not superannuation funds or companies has not been rewritten either. The denial pre- dates, and is now superseded by, the current foreign investment fund rules, and its removal was proposed in issues paper 1, page 46. Subsection (3), which directs a reversal of earlier deductions allowed for employer contributions to a superannuation scheme if the employer receives a benefit from the scheme, has been replaced by an income provision (clause CG 5). This change is consistent with proposals in the discussion document on Parts C, D, and E and was specifically proposed in issues paper 1. The current limitation to contributions made in the preceding 12 months has also been removed, as proposed in the issues paper. Section DF 6 (Payments to employees or former employees while on naval, military, or air service). This section, which allows employers a deduction of up to $8 a week for payments made to employees or former employees called up for service in the armed forces, has been omitted from the bill. Section DG 1 (Limitation on deduction for expenditure on specified types of entertainment). Section DG 1 and Part A, clause 4(c)(ii) of Schedule 6A limit the deductibility of expenditure on food and beverage if provided or consumed in an area of the taxpayer’s premises reserved for senior staff and their guests. The bill makes it clear that the legislation applies not only where the area is reserved for senior staff and their guests, but also where it is reserved exclusively for senior staff. Section DM 4 (Farm-out arrangements). A cross-referencing error in this section has been corrected. The error occurred when the Income Tax Act 1976 and the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 were reordered into the Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Current section DM 4(2)(a)(i) provides that excess expenditure incurred before 16 December 1991 is allowed as a deduction in accordance with section DM 1(2). That reference, however, should have been to section DM 1(3). Section DM 11 (Further development expenditure in Maui field). This section has been omitted from the bill as the Maui B project is now complete. Sections DO 3 (Certain expenditure on land used for farming or agricultural purposes) and DO 4 (Expenditure on land improvements used for farming or agricultural purposes). These sections have been rewritten as clauses DO 1 and DO 4, and the current overlap between the two provisions has been removed. Currently, section DO 3, introduced in 1991, allows certain expenditure on assets to be deducted in the year of incurrence. At the same time, section DO 4, an older provision, continues to direct that some of the same expenditure is to be recognised over the life of the assets under a depreciation-type scheme. The draft now provides that the expenditure in question should be deducted in the year of incurrence. 34 Section DO 6 (Deductions by lessors of land used for farming or agricultural purposes). The section allows lessors of farm land a deduction for expenditure identified in section DO 3, which they are able to claim if they, rather than their tenants, are carrying on a farming business on the land. It has been rewritten as clause DO 5, and now extends to expenditure of the type identified in section DO 4. Section DZ 1 (Premium paid in respect of leased machinery). This section is obsolete and has been omitted from the bill. Sections DZ 2 to DZ 4 (Certain expenditure on land used for forestry purposes, farming and agricultural purposes, or aquaculture). These sections are obsolete and have been omitted from the bill. Section DZ 6 (Companies engaged in exploring for, searching for, or mining petroleum). This section has been omitted from the bill as the Maui B project is now complete. Part E changes Section EG 19(4) (Disposition of depreciable property). The reference in item ‘b’ has been changed from cost to base value. Section EJ 2 (Compensation in connection with outbreak of scrapie). This section is obsolete and has been omitted from the bill. Section EL 5 (Herd scheme for specified livestock). Subsection (4) has been rewritten in clause EC 10(3) in a way that makes it clear that it applies only to increases in numbers of a class of livestock, and does not apply to bailment deficiencies arising under section EL 7. Section EL 10 (Valuation of high-priced livestock). Subsection (7) has been omitted from the bill on the basis that it is no longer relevant. The subsection set out the method of valuing livestock that were classified as high-priced livestock under the previous livestock valuation rules. It not expected that any of that livestock will still be on hand when the bill comes into force. Section EO 2 Deduction to lessee in non-specified lease). The section has been rewritten as clause EJ 19, but the application dates in subsection (3) have not been included as they are obsolete. Sections EO 3 (Costs of acquiring any film or any right in any film) and EO 4 (Cost of producing films). The overlap between sections EO 3 and EO 4 for expenditure incurred in producing a film has been removed (by removing the rules in section EO 3 relating to film production). This simplification of the legislation should not result in a substantive change in policy because section EO 3 is subject to section EO 4. Currently, a film owner who incurs expenditure in producing a film must use section EO 4 to deduct that expenditure. In addition: 35 • The provisions that replace section EO 4 provide that they are the only provisions under which film production expenditure can be deducted. • Broadcasters have been excluded from the rewritten film production expenditure provisions. • The bill makes it clear that broadcasters who incur production expenditure on a film are excluded from the film expenditure rules only if the film is produced mainly for the purpose of being broadcast in New Zealand. • The anti-avoidance provision, section EO 4(12), relating to expenditure that is deemed to be incurred at the time of payment, has been relocated to Part G. • The reference to right as an amount that is dependent on or calculated by reference to income from the sale, use, rental or other exploitation of a film (currently contained in section EO 4A(2)(a)(ii)) has been incorporated into the replacement provisions for sections EO 3 and EO 4. As a result, these sections constitute a code for all film-related expenditure incurred by persons who own a right in a film. This change simplifies the drafting of the replacement provisions to sections EO 4A and GD 12. • As a result of removing the film production rules in section EO 3, the associated anti-avoidance provisions (in section GC 11(3) and (4)) have also been omitted. (The corresponding provisions for the film expenditure rules in section EO 4(1) to (12), GD 12(1) and (1A), have been retained.) Section EZ 1 (Spreading of income arising in 1992-93 income year from revaluation of specified livestock); Section EZ 2 (Spreading of liquor revaluation income); Section EZ 3 (Depreciation allowances, etc., on motorcars); Section EZ 7 (Unreturned retail profit in relation to goods sold on hire purchase); Section EZ 8 (No first year depreciation allowance for previously exempt taxpayers). These sections are obsolete and have been omitted from the bill. Parts F to N changes Section FB 6 (Films). This section deals with the apportionment of expenditure in the acquisition of a film if the film is acquired together with other property. It has been omitted from the bill because it is considered to be unnecessary. Section IE 1 (Net losses may be offset against future net income). Issues paper 2 proposed that section IE 1(4) should be repealed and the general rule in section CE 4 relied on instead; the effect of the ordering rule in section IE 1(4)(d) should be relocated to section CE 4; and the deduction for post-remission payments in section IE 1(4)(g) should be relocated to Part D. The proposal has been incorporated into clauses CG 2 and DB 38 of the bill. 36 Part O changes Definition of ‘superannuation scheme’. The definition has been changed to align it with that in the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. This provides for consistency between the Acts. Definition of ‘trading stock’. The issues pertaining to the inter-relationship between bloodstock and trading stock have been addressed through excluding livestock from trading stock. 37 Chapter Five PLAIN LANGUAGE DRAFTING Plain language law drafting seeks to convey the intended message of the legislation in the plainest possible way. It involves not only using plain language as far as possible, but also using shorter sentences and ‘ordinary’ grammar, formatting provisions consistently, and arranging information so that it can be easily found. This chapter sets out the guidelines on various matters of style and language that have been used in rewriting the legislation in this bill. They are based on the guidelines proposed in the government discussion document Rewriting the Income Tax Act – objectives, process, guidelines 8 and on Parliamentary Counsel Office drafting guidelines. Style Active or passive The active voice has been used in preference to the passive voice. Capitals Capitals have been used only as necessary. Capitals have not been used: • to begin each paragraph of a series of paragraphs within a sentence; or • to begin each word defined in a series of definitions. A word used in a general sense does not have a capital letter even though the same word used in a particular sense does – for example, court or government. Capitals have been used for: • titles of legislation; • the Crown; • names and titles of persons of considerable eminence (Governor-General, Minister). 8 Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Objectives, process, guidelines. A discussion document. December 1994. 38 Drafting in the positive Affirmative statements are usually more direct and straightforward than negative statements. The use of multiple negatives, as in the example below, is confusing and has been avoided when possible: Notwithstanding anything in this Act, with respect to the income of an underwriter carrying on the business of insurance, the gross income of the underwriter shall not include gross income derived from insurance business carried on out of New Zealand to the extent that the gross income so derived consist of income other than income of the kinds referred to in any of paragraphs (e), (f), (g), (h), (l), (m), and (n) of section OE 4(1). Numbers Figures have been used instead of words except at the beginning of a sentence. Examples are: No later than 12 months after the end of the income year... Twelve months after the end of the income year and no later... Paragraphing Sentences have been presented in a paragraphed form when doing so assists communication. Otherwise they have been broken up into separate subsections. If a sentence has needed to be divided beyond subparagraphs, the structure of the sentence has been reviewed. In these cases, the sentence has been broken up into shorter sentences to make it more comprehensible. Parentheses Parentheses enclose explanations, illustrations and digressions that are connected with the message of the sentence. They have been used with caution because an interruption to the flow of the sentence may impede understanding. Present tense The present tense and the indicative mood have been used wherever possible. Provisos The traditional form of legal proviso beginning provided that is archaic and has been avoided. It may be uncertain whether the proviso is intended to be a true proviso derogating from a general provision or a co-ordinate supplementary provision. An example of the latter is found in the first proviso to the general interest deductibility section, section DD 1(b) of the Income Tax Act 1994, which states: Provided that for the purpose of this paragraph expenditure incurred under the accrual rules is treated as interest payable... The words provided that are superfluous. 39 References to dates The format used for referring to dates is 1 April 1995, not the first day of April 1995 or 1 st April 1995. References to legislative provisions A reference in one section of the Act to another provision of the same Act does not include the words of this Act unless to omit them would create ambiguity, as when another Act is referred to in the same provision. Section length Sections and subsections have been kept to a manageable length. The length of sections depends on whether there is a relationship between subsections which is complementary and obvious. In some cases, subsections, and sections without subsections, contain more than one sentence. Sentence structure Generally, a short sentence has been used in preference to a long sentence, to ensure that the core structure of a sentence can be easily recognised by the reader. The intention has been to ensure that the core structure is not obscured by multiple or complex modifying elements, particularly those positioned before the subject. Singular or plural There may be a choice between constructing a sentence in singular or plural terms. The general rule that has been adopted is to use the singular. Symbols, abbreviations and acronyms A symbol, abbreviation or acronym has been used when it assists the flow of meaning. Common examples are $ and %. Acronyms have also been used for often repeated technical terms such as FIF and FBT. In these cases, the acronyms have been defined. Word choice The plain language drafting style used in the rewritten legislation minimises complexity, repetition and the use of redundant words. It also uses words according to their ordinary meaning as far as possible. Accurately expressing the intended meaning In a number of cases in the existing Act, words have been used in a way that does not accurately express their intended meaning. Every effort has been made to correct these in the rewritten legislation. 40 • all, each, every These words are often used unnecessarily in the existing Income Tax Act and have generally been omitted or replaced by a, an or the. The use of all, each and every has been restricted to contexts in which their core meaning is needed. • any A or an has generally been used instead of any as they are usually simpler, free from ambiguity and often just as effective. Any can be ambiguous because it is capable in some contexts of carrying the same meaning as every. • deem The purpose of deeming is to create a “legal fiction”. Deeming provisions have been used only if a thing is to be treated as something it is not or not treated as something it is. The word treated has, in most instances, been used instead. • less than, more than Provision for less than X and more than X leaves X itself unprovided for. This has been avoided by providing for X. Above/below and over/under have been avoided. Less means a smaller amount of and has been applied only to things measured by amount. • may, must, shall May has been used when a power, permission, benefit or privilege given to some person may, but need not, be exercised. May is discretionary. It has not been used when a duty must be performed. • Notwithstanding anything in this Act (or an equivalent phrase referring to a group of provisions) does not indicate which provisions are to be overridden, especially if the phrase is used more than once in the Act. The specific provisions which are overridden should ideally be identified unless the intention is to override all provisions in the Act. Problems which can otherwise arise include incomplete communication of the legal effect of the provisions and the possibility of a broader application than intended. When it has been necessary to clarify the relationship between provisions, the drafters have used plain language, affirmative statements and specific references. For example: CC 5 Annuities Income (1) An annuity derived by a person is income of the person. Apportionment (2) Income under an annuity due but unpaid on the date on which a person disposes of the annuity is apportioned between the person disposing of the annuity and the person acquiring it. Relationship with sections CW 4 and CW 23 (3) This section is overridden by sections CW 4 (Annuities under life insurance policies) and CW 23 (Annuities from Crown Bank Accounts). 41 • where Although where has been traditionally used to introduce a conditional clause, in common usage it suggests place. It has been replaced with when or if in the rewritten legislation. Using words in a consistent manner Some terminological changes have been made to ensure that words are used in a consistent manner. Examples are: • Acquisition. The rewritten provisions use acquisition and acquire in place of expressions such as acquires or becomes possessed of, acquired or created, and purchase or creation. • Disposal. The rewritten provisions use disposal in place of sale or other disposition, sale or other transfer, alienation or transfer, and similar expressions. The verb used is dispose. • Mainly. The rewritten provisions use mainly in place of primarily and principally and similar expressions. The expression primarily and principally was considered by Eichelbaum J in Newman Tours Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,027 (High Court). The judge interpreted the expression as requiring that the purpose not only be the main one, in the sense of outweighing all the other purposes, singly or collectively, but also the primary one, that is, the first one. Sufficiently similar connotations can be conveyed in the single word mainly. • They. The rewritten provisions use they as the singular pronoun in place of repetition of the taxpayer or the person or multiple gender pronouns, i.e. His, her or it. There is ample authority that this is an acceptable English usage. Avoiding archaic or unnecessary words The rewritten legislation avoids the use of the following wherever possible: • above and below in references (for example, subsection (1) above) • abovementioned, aforementioned, beforementioned, foregoing • an amount equal to an amount of • as to, especially before whether • hereby, hereafter, herein, hereinafter, hereinbefore, hereto, herewith, hitherto • pursuant to • said, aforesaid • save that, forthwith • thereto, thereof, thereafter, therefrom • whatsoever, whomsoever, wheresoever 42 Terminology changes Other examples of differences in terminology between that used in the current Act and that adopted in the rewritten legislation are: Current legislation Rewritten legislation aggregate total all or some of a part or all of all or a part of all or part of or similar phrases some or all of as the case may be as applicable by means of by by virtue of the fact that because commence start elect choose (but, for the noun, election, not choice) exceeds is more than expire end fair and reasonable reasonable furnish file immediately following immediately after in respect of with respect to for about concerning in the event that if just and reasonable reasonable less than zero negative may not must not (if that is the right sense) nil zero 43 notwithstanding despite although even if even though partly or wholly wholly or substantially or similar phrases wholly or partly wholly or mainly preceding prior earlier (unless of 2) previous prior to before purchase buy referred to as called subject to overridden by subsequent later subsequent to after succeeding following terminate end until such time as until 45 Chapter Six TRANSITION TO THE NEW ACT The new Act comes into force on 1 April 2004 and first applies to income derived in the 2004-05 tax year (or corresponding income year). Transitional provisions Clause YA 3 of the bill sets out the transitional provisions. These provisions simply ensure that a reference in any Act or document to the new Income Tax Act can be read as a reference to the 1994 or 1976 Acts, and a reference to one of those Acts can be read as a reference to the new Act. The clause provides that: • A reference in an enactment or document to a provision in the new Act is to be read as a reference to the corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 1994 (or the Income Tax Act 1976 if applicable) to the extent that it is necessary to reflect sensibly the intent of the enactment or document. Similarly, references to the new Act are to be read as references to the 1994 or 1976 Act. • A reference in an enactment or document to a provision in the Income Tax Act 1994 or the Income Tax Act 1976 is to be read as a reference to the corresponding provision in the new Act to the extent that it is necessary to reflect sensibly the intent of the enactment or document. Similarly, references to the 1994 or 1976 Acts are to be read as references to the new Act. Saving of binding rulings Clause YA 4 is designed to ensure that binding rulings that were based on the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994, and were intended to apply in one or more of the years following the date of effect of the new Act, will continue to apply. It applies to binding rulings applied for before 1 April 2004. The clause provides that when a binding ruling has been issued about a provision in the Income Tax Act 1994, it will be treated as if it had been issued about the equivalent provision in the new Act at the time the new Act began to apply. An equivalent provision is one that corresponds to the provision in the 1994 Act on which the ruling was based. If that provision in the new Act is subsequently amended, the provisions of section 91G of the Tax Administration Act will apply in the same way as if the binding ruling had been made under the new Act. Clause YA 4(1)(c) uses the words “corresponds to the old law” to link the provision in the 1994 Act on which the ruling was based with the provision in the new Act which has the same effect. These words are designed to reflect the Government’s intention that existing binding rulings should not be affected by the enactment of the new Act, but should continue to apply as if they had been made about provisions in that Act at the time it came into effect. Clause YA 4 also provides that a binding ruling cannot be issued concerning the application of the new Act to an arrangement already governed by a binding ruling subject to the savings provision. 46 Accordingly, it will be important that the words used in the savings provision are given an appropriately purposive interpretation so that taxpayers and Inland Revenue do not have to go to the time and effort of obtaining or issuing replacement binding rulings. In other words, the intention is that the requirement that the new law corresponds to the old law should not to be given any narrow, obstructive interpretation to prevent binding rulings being saved. Saving of accrual determinations Clause YA 5 is designed to ensure that accrual determinations which were based on the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 (or the Income Tax Act 1976), and were intended to apply in one or more of the years following the date the new Act came into force, will continue to apply. It applies to accrual determinations made before 1 April 2004. The clause provides that when an accrual determination has been issued about a provision in the Income Tax Act 1994 or the Income Tax Act 1976, it will be treated as if it had been issued about the equivalent provision of the new Act at the time the new Act began to apply. An equivalent provision is one that corresponds to the provision in the earlier Act on which the determination was based. Clause YA 5(1)(d) uses the words corresponds to the old law to link the provision in the earlier Act on which the determination was based with the provision in the new Act which has the same effect. These words are designed to reflect the Government’s intention that existing accruals determinations should not be affected by the enactment of the new Act, but should be able to continue as if they had been made about a provision in that Act at the time it came into force. As with clause YA 4, it will be important that these words are not given any narrow interpretation that would prevent accrual determinations from being saved.
