For the purposes of this Agreement, income derived by or through an entity or arrangement that is treated as wholly or partly fiscally transparent under the tax law of either Contracting State shall be considered to be income of a resident of a Contracting State but only to the extent that the income is treated, for purposes of taxation by that State, as the income of a resident of that State. This Agreement shall not affect the taxation, by a Contracting State, of its residents except with respect to the benefits granted under paragraph 2 of Article 9 and Articles 19, 20, 22, 24, 25 and 27. ARTICLE 2 TAXES COVERED This Agreement shall apply to taxes on income imposed on behalf of a Contracting State, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied. There shall be regarded as taxes on income all taxes imposed on total income, or on elements of income, including taxes on gains from the alienation of movable or immovable property, and taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises. The existing taxes to which the Agreement shall apply are in particular: in China: the individual income tax; the enterprise income tax; (hereinafter referred to as �Chinese tax�); in New Zealand: the income tax; (hereinafter referred to as �New Zealand tax�). 4. The Agreement shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes which have been made in their taxation laws. ARTICLE 3 GENERAL DEFINITIONS For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: the term �China� means the People�s Republic of China; when used in geographical sense, means all the territory of the People�s Republic of China, including its land territory, internal water, territorial sea and the air space above them, in which the Chinese laws relating to taxation apply, and any area beyond its territorial sea, within which the People�s Republic of China has sovereign rights or jurisdiction in accordance with international law and its internal law; the term �New Zealand� means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New�Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; the term �person� includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; the term �company� means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; the terms �enterprise of a Contracting State� and �enterprise of the other Contracting State� mean, respectively, an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; the term �international traffic� means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State; the term �competent authority� means, in the case of China, the State Administration of Taxation or its authorised representative, and in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; the term �national�, in relation to a Contracting State, means: any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of a Contracting State; and any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in a Contracting State. As regards the application of the Agreement at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning which it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Agreement applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. ARTICLE 4 RESIDENT For the purposes of this Agreement, the term �resident of a Contracting State� means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of that person�s domicile, residence, place of incorporation, place of effective management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then the individual�s status shall be determined as follows: the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which a permanent home is available to the individual; if a permanent home is available to the individual in both States, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which the individual�s personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); if the State in which the individual has their centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if a permanent home is not available to the individual in either State, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which the individual has an habitual abode; if the individual has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which the individual is a national; if the individual is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting State of which such person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Agreement, having regard to its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by this Agreement except to the extent and in such manner as may be agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting States. ARTICLE 5 PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT For the purposes of this Agreement, the term �permanent establishment� means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. The term �permanent establishment� includes especially: a place of management; a branch; an office; a factory; a workshop, and a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources. The term �permanent establishment� likewise encompasses: a building site, or construction, assembly or installation project, if such site or project lasts more than twelve months; the furnishing of services, including consultancy services, by an enterprise through employees or other personnel engaged for such purpose, but only if activities of that nature continue (for the same or a connected project) within a Contracting State for a period or periods aggregating more than 183 days within any twelve-month period; and the carrying on of activities by an enterprise of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State (including the operation of substantial equipment), which consist of, or which are in connection with, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources, including standing timber, situated in that other State, for more than 183 days in any twelve-month period. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term �permanent establishment� shall be deemed not to include: the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any activity not listed in subparagraphs a) to d), provided that this activity has a preparatory or auxiliary character; or the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in sub-paragraphs a) to e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 but subject to the provisions of paragraph 6, where a person is acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an enterprise and, in doing so, habitually concludes contracts, or habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded without material modification by the enterprise, and these contracts are in the name of the enterprise, or for the transfer of the ownership of, or for the granting of the right to use, property owned by that enterprise or that the enterprise has the right to use, or for the provision of services by that enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. a) Paragraph 5 shall not apply where the person acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting State carries on business in the first-mentioned State as an independent agent and acts for the enterprise in the ordinary course of that business. Where, however, a person acts exclusively or almost exclusively on behalf of one or more enterprises to which it is closely related, that person shall not be considered to be an independent agent within the meaning of this paragraph with respect to any such enterprise. For the purposes of this Article, a person or enterprise is closely related to an enterprise if, based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the control of the same persons or enterprises. In any case, a person or enterprise shall be considered to be closely related to an enterprise if one possesses directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial interest in the other (or, in the case of a company, more than 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company�s shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) or if another person or enterprise possesses directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial interest (or, in the case of a company, more than 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company�s shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) in the person and the enterprise or in the two enterprises. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. ARTICLE 6 INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry, or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. The term �immovable property� shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in question is situated. The term shall in any case include any natural resources, property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property,�rights to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber, and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for or in respect of the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit, natural resources or standing timber; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services. Any right referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be regarded as situated where the property to which it relates is situated or where the exploration or exploitation may take place. ARTICLE 7 BUSINESS PROFITS The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. Where: a resident of a Contracting State beneficially owns (whether as a direct beneficiary of a trust or through one or more interposed trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and in relation to that enterprise, that trustee has or would have, if it were a resident of the first-mentioned State, a permanent establishment in the other State, then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee through such permanent establishment shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the resident�s share of profits may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. Nothing in this Article shall affect any provisions of the laws of either Contracting State at any time in force as they affect the taxation of any income from any form of insurance. ARTICLE 8 SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped or embarked in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, or for leasing on a full basis of a ship or aircraft for purposes of such carriage, may be taxed in that other State. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. ARTICLE 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES Where: an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State � and taxes accordingly � profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall, if necessary, consult each other. ARTICLE 10 DIVIDENDS Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company - which holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends throughout a 365 day period that includes the day of the payment of the dividend (for the purpose of computing that period, no account shall be taken of changes of ownership that would directly result from a corporate reorganisation, such as a merger or divisive reorganisation, of the company that holds the shares or that pays the dividend); 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends holds, together with any associated enterprises directly or indirectly no more than 25 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends, and the beneficial owner is the Government of the other Contracting State. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term �Government of the other Contracting State� shall include: in the case of China: the China Investment Corporation; the Silk Road Fund Co., Ltd.; the National Council for Social Security Fund; and a statutory body or any entity wholly owned by the Government of China, and performing functions of a governmental nature, as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States; in the case of New Zealand: the New Zealand Superannuation Fund; the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation; the Earthquake Commission; the Accident Compensation Corporation; and a statutory body or any entity wholly owned by the Government of New Zealand, and performing functions of a governmental nature, as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. The term �dividends� as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company�s undistributed profits to a tax on the company�s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. ARTICLE 11 INTEREST Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, interest arising in a Contracting State and derived and beneficially owned by a resident of the other Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in the first-mentioned Contracting State provided the beneficial owner of the interest is dealing wholly independently with the payer and is: the other Contracting State, including political subdivisions and local authorities thereof; the Central Bank of that other Contracting State; in the case of China: the China Development Bank; the Agricultural Development Bank of China; the Export-Import Bank of China; the China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation; the China Investment Corporation; the Silk Road Fund Co., Ltd.; the National Council for Social Security Fund; any other institution wholly or mainly owned by the Government of China as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States; in the case of New Zealand: the New Zealand Export Credit Office; the New Zealand Superannuation Fund; the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation; the Earthquake Commission; the Accident Compensation Corporation; any other institution wholly or mainly owned by the Government of New Zealand as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States; or any statutory body of a Contracting State performing functions of a governmental nature as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, interest referred to in that paragraph may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest if the beneficial owner of the interest: is an enterprise named in paragraphs 3c)(i)-(iv) and 3d)(i) that holds directly or indirectly more than 10 per cent of the voting power in the payer of the interest; in all other cases, together with any associated enterprises, holds directly or indirectly more than 10 per cent of the voting power in the payer of the interest. The term �interest� as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor�s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws, relating to tax, of the Contracting State in which the income arises, but does not include any income which is treated as a dividend under Article 10. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by, or deductible in determining the profits attributable to, such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. ARTICLE 12 ROYALTIES Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. The term �royalties� as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for: the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like property or right; the use of, or the right to use: motion picture films; films or audio or video tapes or disks, or any other means of image or sound reproduction or transmission for use in connection with television, radio, internet or other broadcasting; the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, scientific or commercial equipment; knowledge or information concerning industrial, technical, commercial or scientific experience; any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph a) or b), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph c) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph d); giving up, wholly or partly, a right relating to the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that Contracting State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by, or deductible in determining the profits attributed to, such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. ARTICLE 13 ALIENATION OF PROPERTY Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. Income or gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State or of movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including such income or gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise) or of such a fixed base, may be taxed in that other State. Income or gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State that operates ships or aircraft in international traffic from the alienation of such ships or aircraft, or from movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that Contracting State. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares or comparable interests, such as interests in a partnership or trust, may be taxed in the other Contracting State if, at any time during the 365 days preceding the alienation, these shares or comparable interests derived more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property, as defined in Article 6, situated in that other State. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State if the recipient of the income or gain, at any time during the twelve-month period preceding such alienation, had a participation, directly or indirectly, of at least 25 per cent in the capital of that company. Income or gains from the alienation of any property, other than that referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident. ARTICLE 14 INDEPENDENT PERSONAL SERVICES Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that State except in the following circumstances, when such income may also be taxed in the other Contracting State: if that person has a fixed base regularly available to the person in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing that person�s activities; in that case, only so much of the income as is attributable to that fixed base may be taxed in that other State; or if that person�s stay in the other Contracting State is for a period or periods amounting to or exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve-month period commencing or ending in the taxable year concerned; in that case, only so much of the income as is derived from that person�s activities performed in that other State may be taxed in that other State. The term �professional services� includes especially independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as the independent activities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants. ARTICLE 15 INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18, and 19, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve-month period commencing or ending in the taxable year concerned, and the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and the remuneration is not borne by, or deductible in determining the profits attributable to, a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic by an enterprise of a Contracting State, may be taxed in that Contracting State. ARTICLE 16 DIRECTORS� FEES Directors� fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person�s capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. ARTICLE 17 ENTERTAINERS AND SPORTSPERSONS Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 14 and 15, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person�s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson acting as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 14 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, income derived from such activities as are referred to in paragraph 1 performed under a cultural agreement or arrangement between the Contracting States shall be exempt from tax in the Contracting State in which the activities are exercised if the visit to that State is wholly or substantially supported by public or government funds of either Contracting State. ARTICLE 18 PENSIONS Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 19, pensions and other similar remuneration paid to an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State. ARTICLE 19 GOVERNMENT SERVICE a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration, other than a pension, paid by the Government of a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to the Government of that State or subdivision or authority, shall be taxable only in that State. However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: is a national of that State; or did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. a) Pensions and other similar remuneration paid by, or out of funds created by, a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to the Government of that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State. However, such pensions and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the individual is a resident of, and a national of, that State. The provisions of Articles 15, 16, 17, and 18 shall apply to salaries, wages, pensions, and other similar remuneration in respect of services rendered in connection with a business carried on by the Government of a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof. ARTICLE 20 STUDENTS Payments which a student who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of that student�s education receives for the purpose of that student�s maintenance or education shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. ARTICLE 21 OTHER INCOME Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement shall be taxable only in that State. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in the other State. ARTICLE 22 ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION In China, in accordance with the provisions of the law of China, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows: Where a resident of China derives income from New Zealand, the amount of tax on that income payable in New Zealand in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (except to the extent that these provisions allow taxation by New Zealand solely because the income is also income derived by a resident of New Zealand) may be credited against the Chinese tax imposed on that resident. The amount of the credit, however, shall not exceed the amount of the Chinese tax on that income computed in accordance with the taxation laws and regulations of China. Where the income derived from New Zealand is a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of New Zealand to a company which is a resident of China and which owns not less than 20 per cent of the shares of the company paying the dividend, the credit shall take into account the tax paid to New Zealand by the company paying the dividend in respect of its income. In New Zealand, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows: Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Chinese tax paid under the laws of China and consistent with this Agreement (except to the extent that these provisions allow taxation by China solely because the income is also income derived by a resident of China), in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in China (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. ARTICLE 23 ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, a benefit under this Agreement shall not be granted in respect of an item of income if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Agreement. ARTICLE 24 NON-DISCRIMINATION Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 8 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State in similar circumstances are or may be subjected. The provisions of the Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description. ARTICLE 25 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which that person is a resident or, if that case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 24, to that of the Contracting State of which that person is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of paragraphs 2 and 3. When it seems advisable for reaching an agreement, representatives of the competent authorities of the Contracting States may meet together for an oral exchange of opinions. ARTICLE 26 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. ARTICLE 27 MEMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AND CONSULAR POSTS Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. ARTICLE 28 ENTRY INTO FORCE This Agreement shall enter into force on the thirtieth day following the day on which the two Contracting States have notified each other that the domestic legal procedures for such entry into force have been fulfilled. The relevant date shall be the day on which the last notification is received. The provisions of this Agreement shall have effect: in the case of taxes withheld at source, in respect of amounts paid on or after the first day of January of the calendar year next following that in which the Agreement enters into force; in the case of other taxes, for any taxable year beginning on or after the first day of January of the calendar year next following that in which the Agreement enters into force. The Agreement between the Government of the People�s Republic of China and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Protocol thereto signed at Wellington on 16 September 1986, as modified by the Protocol signed at Wellington on 7 October 1997 (hereinafter referred to as �the 1986 Agreement�) shall cease to have effect with respect to any taxes to which this Agreement applies in accordance with paragraph 2. The 1986 Agreement shall terminate on the last date on which it has effect in accordance with paragraph 3. ARTICLE 29 TERMINATION This Agreement shall continue in effect indefinitely but either of the Contracting States may, on or before the thirtieth day of June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of a period of five years from the date of its entry into force, give to the other Contracting State, through diplomatic channels, written notice of termination and, in such event, this Agreement shall cease to have effect: in the case of taxes withheld at source, in respect of amounts paid on or after the first day of January of the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given; in the case of other taxes, for any taxable year beginning on or after the first day of January of the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. The date of receipt of such notice by the other Contracting State shall be definitive for the determination of the deadline (the thirtieth day of June in any calendar year).  IN WITNESS whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto, have signed this Agreement.

For the Government of New�ZealandFor the Government of the People�s Republic of China � \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Clare Fearnley New�Zealand Ambassador to ChinaWang Jun Commissioner of the State Taxation Administration  PROTOCOL At the signing of the Agreement between the Government of the People�s Republic of China and the Government of New Zealand for the Elimination of Double Taxation with respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance (hereinafter referred to as �the Agreement�), both sides have agreed upon the following provisions, which shall form an integral part of the Agreement: With reference to Article 5: For the sole purpose of determining whether the periods referred to in paragraph 3 have been exceeded, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on activities in the other Contracting State referred to in paragraph 3, and these activities are carried on during one or more periods of time that, in the aggregate, exceed 30 days without exceeding the periods referred to in paragraph 3, and where connected activities are carried on in that other Contracting State in connection with activities identified in paragraph 3 during different periods of time, each exceeding 30 days, by one or more enterprises closely related to the first-mentioned enterprise, these different periods of time shall be added to the aggregate period of time during which the first-mentioned enterprise has carried on activities referred to paragraph 3. �Enterprises closely related to the first-mentioned enterprise� has the meaning given in subparagraph 6 b). With reference to Articles 10, 11 and 12, it is understood that the term �beneficial owner� is not used in a narrow sense (such as the meaning that it has under the trust law of many common law countries). Income arising from guarantee or insurance services provided by: the China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation shall be taxed only in China; the New Zealand Export Credit Office shall be taxed only in New�Zealand. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2 paragraphs 1 and 2, the taxes covered by the Agreement do not include any amount which represents a penalty or interest imposed under the laws of either Contracting State. With regard to Article 10 subparagraph 2 b), it is understood that New Zealand�s supplementary dividend tax credit rules contained in subpart LP of the Income Tax Act 2007 have the effect of reducing the company tax paid by the New Zealand company provided that same amount is then distributed by the New�Zealand company by way of supplementary dividend to the foreign shareholder in the same taxable year as the payment of the principal dividend. These rules currently only apply to portfolio investment; it is agreed that should New Zealand repeal or significantly amend the supplementary dividend tax credit rules in subpart LP of the Income Tax Act 2007, the New Zealand Competent Authority shall inform the Chinese Competent Authority of this repeal or amendment with a view to reviewing Article 10. With regard to Article 11, it is understood that New Zealand�s approved issuer levy regime in subpart 6B of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 allows interest having a New Zealand source to be paid to a non-resident who is not related to the borrower with no non-resident withholding tax if the borrower makes an election to pay approved issuer levy equal to 2% of the interest; it is agreed that should New Zealand repeal or significantly amend the approved issuer levy rules, the New Zealand Competent Authority shall inform the Chinese Competent Authority of this repeal or amendment with a view to reviewing Article 11. With regard to Article 24: The Article shall not apply to any provision of the laws of a Contracting State which: is designed to prevent avoidance or evasion of taxes, including: (A) measures designed to address thin capitalisation and transfer pricing; (B) controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules; and (C) measures designed to ensure that taxes can be effectively collected and recovered, including conservancy measures; is of a type which the OECD Model Commentary on Article 24 as it read on 15 July 2014 contemplates not being subject to that Article; is otherwise agreed to be unaffected by Article 24 in an Exchange of Notes between the Contracting State; With regard to paragraphs 2 and 4, it is understood that the term �in similar circumstances� is intended to clarify, consistent with the OECD Model Commentary as it read on 15 July 2014, that in determining whether Article 24 paragraphs 2 and 4 apply, the permanent establishment or enterprise in question must also be in a similar position to the comparable domestic enterprise in terms of factors such as the legal structure of the enterprise, the size of the enterprise, and the regulatory regime under which they operate. In the Agreement, the term �taxable year� means �income year� in the case of New Zealand.  IN WITNESS whereof the undersigned, duly authorized thereto, have signed this Protocol.

Agreement between The Government of New Zealand and The Government of the People’s Republic of China For the Elimination of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance The Government of New Zealand and the Government of the People’s Republic of China, Desiring to further develop their economic relationship and to enhance their cooperation in tax matters, Intending to conclude an Agreement for the elimination of double taxation with respect to taxes on income without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance (including through treaty-shopping arrangements aimed at obtaining reliefs provided in this Agreement for the indirect benefit of residents of third States), Have agreed as follows: ARTICLE 1 PERSONS COVERED 1. This Agreement shall apply to persons who are residents of one or both of the Contracting States. 2. For the purposes of this Agreement, income derived by or through an entity or arrangement that is treated as wholly or partly fiscally 2 transparent under the tax law of either Contracting State shall be considered to be income of a resident of a Contracting State but only to the extent that the income is treated, for purposes of taxation by that State, as the income of a resident of that State. 3. This Agreement shall not affect the taxation, by a Contracting State, of its residents except with respect to the benefits granted under paragraph 2 of Article 9 and Articles 19, 20, 22, 24, 25 and 27. ARTICLE 2 TAXES COVERED 1. This Agreement shall apply to taxes on income imposed on behalf of a Contracting State, irrespective of the manner in which they are levied. 2. There shall be regarded as taxes on income all taxes imposed on total income, or on elements of income, including taxes on gains from the alienation of movable or immovable property, and taxes on the total amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises. 3. The existing taxes to which the Agreement shall apply are in particular: a) in China: (i) the individual income tax; (ii) the enterprise income tax; (hereinafter referred to as “Chinese tax”); b) in New Zealand: (i) the income tax; (hereinafter referred to as “New Zealand tax”). 3 4. The Agreement shall apply also to any identical or substantially similar taxes that are imposed after the date of signature of the Agreement in addition to, or in place of, the existing taxes. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall notify each other of any significant changes which have been made in their taxation laws. ARTICLE 3 GENERAL DEFINITIONS 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires: a) the term “China” means the People’s Republic of China; when used in geographical sense, means all the territory of the People’s Republic of China, including its land territory, internal water, territorial sea and the air space above them, in which the Chinese laws relating to taxation apply, and any area beyond its territorial sea, within which the People’s Republic of China has sovereign rights or jurisdiction in accordance with international law and its internal law; b) the term “New Zealand” means the territory of New Zealand but does not include Tokelau; it also includes any area beyond the territorial sea designated under New Zealand legislation and in accordance with international law as an area in which New Zealand may exercise sovereign rights with respect to natural resources; 4 c) the term “person” includes an individual, a company and any other body of persons; d) the term “company” means any body corporate or any entity that is treated as a body corporate for tax purposes; e) the terms “enterprise of a Contracting State” and “enterprise of the other Contracting State” mean, respectively, an enterprise carried on by a resident of a Contracting State and an enterprise carried on by a resident of the other Contracting State; f) the term “international traffic” means any transport by a ship or aircraft operated by an enterprise of a Contracting State, except when the ship or aircraft is operated solely between places in the other Contracting State; g) the term “competent authority” means, in the case of China, the State Administration of Taxation or its authorised representative, and in the case of New Zealand, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or an authorised representative; h) the term “national”, in relation to a Contracting State, means: (i) any individual possessing the nationality or citizenship of a Contracting State; and (ii) any legal person, partnership or association deriving its status as such from the laws in force in a Contracting State. 2. As regards the application of the Agreement at any time by a Contracting State, any term not defined therein shall, unless the context otherwise requires, have the meaning which it has at that time under the law of that State for the purposes of the taxes to which the Agreement applies, any meaning under the applicable tax laws of 5 that State prevailing over a meaning given to the term under other laws of that State. ARTICLE 4 RESIDENT 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “resident of a Contracting State” means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of that person’s domicile, residence, place of incorporation, place of effective management or any other criterion of a similar nature, and also includes that State and any political subdivision or local authority thereof. This term, however, does not include any person who is liable to tax in that State in respect only of income from sources in that State. 2. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, then the individual’s status shall be determined as follows: a) the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State in which a permanent home is available to the individual; if a permanent home is available to the individual in both States, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State with which the individual’s personal and economic relations are closer (centre of vital interests); b) if the State in which the individual has their centre of vital interests cannot be determined, or if a permanent home is not available to the individual in either State, the individual shall be deemed to be 6 a resident only of the State in which the individual has an habitual abode; c) if the individual has an habitual abode in both States or in neither of them, the individual shall be deemed to be a resident only of the State of which the individual is a national; d) if the individual is a national of both States or of neither of them, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall settle the question by mutual agreement. 3. Where by reason of the provisions of paragraph 1 a person other than an individual is a resident of both Contracting States, the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to determine by mutual agreement the Contracting State of which such person shall be deemed to be a resident for the purposes of the Agreement, having regard to its place of effective management, the place where it is incorporated or otherwise constituted and any other relevant factors. In the absence of such agreement, such person shall not be entitled to any relief or exemption from tax provided by this Agreement except to the extent and in such manner as may be agreed upon by the competent authorities of the Contracting States. ARTICLE 5 PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT 1. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term “permanent establishment” means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on. 7 2. The term “permanent establishment” includes especially: a) a place of management; b) a branch; c) an office; d) a factory; e) a workshop, and f) a mine, an oil or gas well, a quarry or any other place of extraction of natural resources. 3. The term “permanent establishment” likewise encompasses: a) a building site, or construction, assembly or installation project, if such site or project lasts more than twelve months; b) the furnishing of services, including consultancy services, by an enterprise through employees or other personnel engaged for such purpose, but only if activities of that nature continue (for the same or a connected project) within a Contracting State for a period or periods aggregating more than 183 days within any twelve-month period; and c) the carrying on of activities by an enterprise of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State (including the operation of substantial equipment), which consist of, or which are in connection with, the exploration for or exploitation of natural resources, including standing timber, situated in that other State, for more than 183 days in any twelve-month period. 4. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, the term “permanent establishment” shall be deemed not to include: 8 a) the use of facilities solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise; b) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of storage, display or delivery; c) the maintenance of a stock of goods or merchandise belonging to the enterprise solely for the purpose of processing by another enterprise; d) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of purchasing goods or merchandise or of collecting information, for the enterprise; e) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for the purpose of carrying on, for the enterprise, any activity not listed in subparagraphs a) to d), provided that this activity has a preparatory or auxiliary character; or f) the maintenance of a fixed place of business solely for any combination of activities mentioned in sub-paragraphs a) to e), provided that the overall activity of the fixed place of business resulting from this combination is of a preparatory or auxiliary character. 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 but subject to the provisions of paragraph 6, where a person is acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an enterprise and, in doing so, habitually concludes contracts, or habitually plays the principal role leading to the conclusion of contracts that are routinely concluded 9 without material modification by the enterprise, and these contracts are a) in the name of the enterprise, or b) for the transfer of the ownership of, or for the granting of the right to use, property owned by that enterprise or that the enterprise has the right to use, or c) for the provision of services by that enterprise, that enterprise shall be deemed to have a permanent establishment in that State in respect of any activities which that person undertakes for the enterprise, unless the activities of such person are limited to those mentioned in paragraph 4 which, if exercised through a fixed place of business, would not make this fixed place of business a permanent establishment under the provisions of that paragraph. 6. a) Paragraph 5 shall not apply where the person acting in a Contracting State on behalf of an enterprise of the other Contracting State carries on business in the first-mentioned State as an independent agent and acts for the enterprise in the ordinary course of that business. Where, however, a person acts exclusively or almost exclusively on behalf of one or more enterprises to which it is closely related, that person shall not be considered to be an independent agent within the meaning of this paragraph with respect to any such enterprise. b) For the purposes of this Article, a person or enterprise is closely related to an enterprise if, based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, one has control of the other or both are under the 10 control of the same persons or enterprises. In any case, a person or enterprise shall be considered to be closely related to an enterprise if one possesses directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial interest in the other (or, in the case of a company, more than 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) or if another person or enterprise possesses directly or indirectly more than 50 per cent of the beneficial interest (or, in the case of a company, more than 50 per cent of the aggregate vote and value of the company’s shares or of the beneficial equity interest in the company) in the person and the enterprise or in the two enterprises. 7. The fact that a company which is a resident of a Contracting State controls or is controlled by a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State, or which carries on business in that other State (whether through a permanent establishment or otherwise), shall not of itself constitute either company a permanent establishment of the other. ARTICLE 6 INCOME FROM IMMOVABLE PROPERTY 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State from immovable property (including income from agriculture or forestry, or fishing) situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term “immovable property” shall have the meaning which it has under the law of the Contracting State in which the property in 11 question is situated. The term shall in any case include any natural resources, property accessory to immovable property, livestock and equipment used in agriculture and forestry, rights to which the provisions of general law respecting landed property apply, usufruct of immovable property, rights to explore for or exploit natural resources or standing timber, and rights to variable or fixed payments as consideration for or in respect of the exploitation of, or the right to explore for or exploit, natural resources or standing timber; ships and aircraft shall not be regarded as immovable property. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall apply to income derived from the direct use, letting, or use in any other form of immovable property. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3 shall also apply to the income from immovable property of an enterprise and to income from immovable property used for the performance of independent personal services. 5. Any right referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article shall be regarded as situated where the property to which it relates is situated or where the exploration or exploitation may take place. ARTICLE 7 BUSINESS PROFITS 1. The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the enterprise carries on business as aforesaid, the profits 12 of the enterprise may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 2. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, there shall in each Contracting State be attributed to that permanent establishment the profits which it might be expected to make if it were a distinct and separate enterprise engaged in the same or similar activities under the same or similar conditions and dealing wholly independently with the enterprise of which it is a permanent establishment. 3. In determining the profits of a permanent establishment, there shall be allowed as deductions expenses which are incurred for the purposes of the permanent establishment, including executive and general administrative expenses so incurred, whether in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated or elsewhere. 4. Insofar as it has been customary in a Contracting State to determine the profits to be attributed to a permanent establishment on the basis of an apportionment of the total profits of the enterprise to its various parts, nothing in paragraph 2 shall preclude that Contracting State from determining the profits to be taxed by such an apportionment as may be customary; the method of apportionment adopted shall, however, be such that the result shall be in accordance with the principles contained in this Article. 5. No profits shall be attributed to a permanent establishment by reason of the mere purchase by that permanent establishment of goods or merchandise for the enterprise. 13 6. For the purposes of the preceding paragraphs, the profits to be attributed to the permanent establishment shall be determined by the same method year by year unless there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary. 7. Where: a) a resident of a Contracting State beneficially owns (whether as a direct beneficiary of a trust or through one or more interposed trusts) a share of the profits of a business of an enterprise carried on in the other Contracting State by the trustee of a trust other than a trust which is treated as a company for tax purposes; and b) in relation to that enterprise, that trustee has or would have, if it were a resident of the first-mentioned State, a permanent establishment in the other State, then the business of the enterprise carried on by the trustee through such permanent establishment shall be deemed to be a business carried on in the other State by that resident through a permanent establishment situated in that other State and the resident’s share of profits may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment. 8. Where profits include items of income which are dealt with separately in other Articles of this Agreement, then the provisions of those Articles shall not be affected by the provisions of this Article. 9. Nothing in this Article shall affect any provisions of the laws of either Contracting State at any time in force as they affect the taxation of any income from any form of insurance. 14 ARTICLE 8 SHIPPING AND AIR TRANSPORT 1. Profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State from the operation of ships or aircraft in international traffic shall be taxable only in that State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State derived from carriage by ship or aircraft of passengers, livestock, mail, goods or merchandise which are shipped or embarked in the other Contracting State and are discharged at a place in that other State, or for leasing on a full basis of a ship or aircraft for purposes of such carriage, may be taxed in that other State. 3. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall also apply to profits from the participation in a pool, a joint business or an international operating agency. ARTICLE 9 ASSOCIATED ENTERPRISES 1. Where: a) an enterprise of a Contracting State participates directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of the other Contracting State, or 15 b) the same persons participate directly or indirectly in the management, control or capital of an enterprise of a Contracting State and an enterprise of the other Contracting State, and in either case conditions are made or imposed between the two enterprises in their commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 2. Where a Contracting State includes in the profits of an enterprise of that State — and taxes accordingly — profits on which an enterprise of the other Contracting State has been charged to tax in that other State and the profits so included are profits which would have accrued to the enterprise of the first-mentioned State if the conditions made between the two enterprises had been those which would have been made between independent enterprises, then that other State shall make an appropriate adjustment to the amount of the tax charged therein on those profits. In determining such adjustment, due regard shall be had to the other provisions of this Agreement and the competent authorities of the Contracting States shall, if necessary, consult each other. ARTICLE 10 DIVIDENDS 1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 16 2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the dividends is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed: a) 5 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends if the beneficial owner is a company - which holds directly at least 25 per cent of the capital of the company paying the dividends throughout a 365 day period that includes the day of the payment of the dividend (for the purpose of computing that period, no account shall be taken of changes of ownership that would directly result from a corporate reorganisation, such as a merger or divisive reorganisation, of the company that holds the shares or that pays the dividend); b) 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends in all other cases. This paragraph shall not affect the taxation of the company in respect of the profits out of which the dividends are paid. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2, dividends shall not be taxed in the Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident if the beneficial owner of the dividends holds, together with any associated enterprises directly or indirectly no more than 25 per cent of the voting power in the company paying the dividends, and the beneficial owner is the Government of the other Contracting State. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term “Government of the other Contracting State” shall include: a) in the case of China: 17 (i) the China Investment Corporation; (ii) the Silk Road Fund Co., Ltd.; (iii) the National Council for Social Security Fund; and (iv) a statutory body or any entity wholly owned by the Government of China, and performing functions of a governmental nature, as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States; b) in the case of New Zealand: (i) the New Zealand Superannuation Fund; (ii) the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation; (iii) the Earthquake Commission; (iv) the Accident Compensation Corporation; and (v) a statutory body or any entity wholly owned by the Government of New Zealand, and performing functions of a governmental nature, as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. 4. The term “dividends” as used in this Article means income from shares or other rights, not being debt-claims, participating in profits, as well as income from other corporate rights which is subjected to the same taxation treatment as income from shares by the laws of the State of which the company making the distribution is a resident. 5. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the dividends, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State of which the company paying the dividends is a resident through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, 18 and the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 6. Where a company which is a resident of a Contracting State derives profits or income from the other Contracting State, that other State may not impose any tax on the dividends paid by the company, except insofar as such dividends are paid to a resident of that other State or insofar as the holding in respect of which the dividends are paid is effectively connected with a permanent establishment or a fixed base situated in that other State, nor subject the company’s undistributed profits to a tax on the company’s undistributed profits, even if the dividends paid or the undistributed profits consist wholly or partly of profits or income arising in such other State. ARTICLE 11 INTEREST 1. Interest arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such interest may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the interest is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the interest. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article, interest arising in a Contracting State and derived and beneficially owned by a 19 resident of the other Contracting State shall be exempt from tax in the first-mentioned Contracting State provided the beneficial owner of the interest is dealing wholly independently with the payer and is: a) the other Contracting State, including political subdivisions and local authorities thereof; b) the Central Bank of that other Contracting State; c) in the case of China: (i) the China Development Bank; (ii) the Agricultural Development Bank of China; (iii) the Export-Import Bank of China; (iv) the China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation; (v) the China Investment Corporation; (vi) the Silk Road Fund Co., Ltd.; (vii) the National Council for Social Security Fund; (viii) any other institution wholly or mainly owned by the Government of China as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States; d) in the case of New Zealand: (i) the New Zealand Export Credit Office; (ii) the New Zealand Superannuation Fund; (iii) the Guardians of New Zealand Superannuation; (iv) the Earthquake Commission; (v) the Accident Compensation Corporation; (vi) any other institution wholly or mainly owned by the Government of New Zealand as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States; or 20 e) any statutory body of a Contracting State performing functions of a governmental nature as may be agreed from time to time between the competent authorities of the Contracting States. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, interest referred to in that paragraph may be taxed in the Contracting State in which it arises at a rate not exceeding 10 percent of the gross amount of the interest if the beneficial owner of the interest: a) is an enterprise named in paragraphs 3c)(i)-(iv) and 3d)(i) that holds directly or indirectly more than 10 per cent of the voting power in the payer of the interest; b) in all other cases, together with any associated enterprises, holds directly or indirectly more than 10 per cent of the voting power in the payer of the interest. 5. The term “interest” as used in this Article means income from debt-claims of every kind, whether or not secured by mortgage and whether or not carrying a right to participate in the debtor’s profits, and in particular, income from government securities and income from bonds or debentures, including premiums and prizes attaching to such securities, bonds or debentures as well as all other income treated as income from money lent by the laws, relating to tax, of the Contracting State in which the income arises, but does not include any income which is treated as a dividend under Article 10. 6. The provisions of paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the interest, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the interest arises through a permanent establishment situated therein, or 21 performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the debt-claim in respect of which the interest is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 7. Interest shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that State. Where, however, the person paying the interest, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the indebtedness on which the interest is paid was incurred, and such interest is borne by, or deductible in determining the profits attributable to, such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such interest shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 8. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the amount of the interest, having regard to the debt-claim for which it is paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. 22 ARTICLE 12 R O YALT IES 1. Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. However, such royalties may also be taxed in the Contracting State in which they arise and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of the royalties is a resident of the other Contracting State, the tax so charged shall not exceed 10 per cent of the gross amount of the royalties. 3. The term “royalties” as used in this Article means payments of any kind received as a consideration for: a) the use of, or the right to use, any copyright, patent, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or other like property or right; b) the use of, or the right to use: (i) motion picture films; (ii) films or audio or video tapes or disks, or any other means of image or sound reproduction or transmission for use in connection with television, radio, internet or other broadcasting; c) the use of, or the right to use, any industrial, scientific or commercial equipment; d) knowledge or information concerning industrial, technical, commercial or scientific experience; 23 e) any assistance that is ancillary and subsidiary to, and is furnished as a means of enabling the application or enjoyment of, any such property or right as is mentioned in subparagraph a) or b), any such equipment as is mentioned in subparagraph c) or any such knowledge or information as is mentioned in subparagraph d); f) giving up, wholly or partly, a right relating to the use or supply of any property or right referred to in this paragraph. 4. The provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply if the beneficial owner of the royalties, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State in which the royalties arise through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the royalties are paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 5. Royalties shall be deemed to arise in a Contracting State when the payer is a resident of that Contracting State. Where, however, the person paying the royalties, whether the person is a resident of a Contracting State or not, has in a Contracting State a permanent establishment or a fixed base in connection with which the liability to pay the royalties was incurred, and such royalties are borne by, or deductible in determining the profits attributed to, such permanent establishment or fixed base, then such royalties shall be deemed to arise in the State in which the permanent establishment or fixed base is situated. 6. Where, by reason of a special relationship between the payer and the beneficial owner or between both of them and some other person, the 24 amount of the royalties, having regard to the use, right or information for which they are paid, exceeds the amount which would have been agreed upon by the payer and the beneficial owner in the absence of such relationship, the provisions of this Article shall apply only to the last-mentioned amount. In such case, the excess part of the payments shall remain taxable according to the laws of each Contracting State, due regard being had to the other provisions of this Agreement. ARTICLE 13 ALIENATION OF PROPERTY 1. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of immovable property referred to in Article 6 and situated in the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. 2. Income or gains from the alienation of movable property forming part of the business property of a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State or of movable property pertaining to a fixed base available to a resident of a Contracting State in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing independent personal services, including such income or gains from the alienation of such a permanent establishment (alone or with the whole enterprise) or of such a fixed base, may be taxed in that other State. 3. Income or gains derived by an enterprise of a Contracting State that operates ships or aircraft in international traffic from the alienation of such ships or aircraft, or from movable property pertaining to the operation of such ships or aircraft, shall be taxable only in that Contracting State. 25 4. Gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares or comparable interests, such as interests in a partnership or trust, may be taxed in the other Contracting State if, at any time during the 365 days preceding the alienation, these shares or comparable interests derived more than 50 per cent of their value directly or indirectly from immovable property, as defined in Article 6, situated in that other State. 5. Income or gains derived by a resident of a Contracting State from the alienation of shares of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other Contracting State if the recipient of the income or gain, at any time during the twelve-month period preceding such alienation, had a participation, directly or indirectly, of at least 25 per cent in the capital of that company. 6. Income or gains from the alienation of any property, other than that referred to in paragraphs 1 to 5, shall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which the alienator is a resident. ARTICLE 14 INDEPENDENT PERSONAL SERVICES 1. Income derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of professional services or other activities of an independent character shall be taxable only in that State except in the following circumstances, when such income may also be taxed in the other Contracting State: a) if that person has a fixed base regularly available to the person in the other Contracting State for the purpose of performing that person’s 26 activities; in that case, only so much of the income as is attributable to that fixed base may be taxed in that other State; or b) if that person’s stay in the other Contracting State is for a period or periods amounting to or exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve-month period commencing or ending in the taxable year concerned; in that case, only so much of the income as is derived from that person’s activities performed in that other State may be taxed in that other State. 2. The term “professional services” includes especially independent scientific, literary, artistic, educational or teaching activities as well as the independent activities of physicians, lawyers, engineers, architects, dentists and accountants. ARTICLE 15 INCOME FROM EMPLOYMENT 1. Subject to the provisions of Articles 16, 18, and 19, salaries, wages and other similar remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment shall be taxable only in that State unless the employment is exercised in the other Contracting State. If the employment is so exercised, such remuneration as is derived therefrom may be taxed in that other State. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1, remuneration derived by a resident of a Contracting State in respect of an employment exercised in the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in the first-mentioned State if: 27 a) the recipient is present in the other State for a period or periods not exceeding in the aggregate 183 days in any twelve-month period commencing or ending in the taxable year concerned, and b) the remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is not a resident of the other State, and c) the remuneration is not borne by, or deductible in determining the profits attributable to, a permanent establishment or a fixed base which the employer has in the other State. 3. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Article, remuneration derived in respect of an employment exercised aboard a ship or aircraft operated in international traffic by an enterprise of a Contracting State, may be taxed in that Contracting State. ARTICLE 16 DIRECTORS’ FEES Directors’ fees and other similar payments derived by a resident of a Contracting State in that person’s capacity as a member of the board of directors of a company which is a resident of the other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State. ARTICLE 17 ENTERTAINERS AND SPORTSPERSONS 1. Notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 14 and 15, income derived by a resident of a Contracting State as an entertainer, such as a theatre, 28 motion picture, radio or television artiste, or a musician, or as a sportsperson, from that person’s personal activities as such exercised in the other Contracting State, may be taxed in that other State. 2. Where income in respect of personal activities exercised by an entertainer or a sportsperson acting as such accrues not to the entertainer or sportsperson but to another person, that income may, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 14 and 15, be taxed in the Contracting State in which the activities of the entertainer or sportsperson are exercised. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, income derived from such activities as are referred to in paragraph 1 performed under a cultural agreement or arrangement between the Contracting States shall be exempt from tax in the Contracting State in which the activities are exercised if the visit to that State is wholly or substantially supported by public or government funds of either Contracting State. ARTICLE 18 PENSIONS Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 of Article 19, pensions and other similar remuneration paid to an individual who is a resident of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State. 29 ARTICLE 19 GOVERNMENT SERVICE 1. a) Salaries, wages and other similar remuneration, other than a pension, paid by the Government of a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to the Government of that State or subdivision or authority, shall be taxable only in that State. b) However, such salaries, wages and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the services are rendered in that State and the individual is a resident of that State who: (i) is a national of that State; or (ii) did not become a resident of that State solely for the purpose of rendering the services. 2. a) Pensions and other similar remuneration paid by, or out of funds created by, a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof to an individual in respect of services rendered to the Government of that State or subdivision or authority shall be taxable only in that State. b) However, such pensions and other similar remuneration shall be taxable only in the other Contracting State if the individual is a resident of, and a national of, that State. 3. The provisions of Articles 15, 16, 17, and 18 shall apply to salaries, wages, pensions, and other similar remuneration in respect of services 30 rendered in connection with a business carried on by the Government of a Contracting State or a political subdivision or local authority thereof. ARTICLE 20 STUDENTS Payments which a student who is or was immediately before visiting a Contracting State a resident of the other Contracting State and who is present in the first-mentioned State solely for the purpose of that student’s education receives for the purpose of that student’s maintenance or education shall not be taxed in that State, provided that such payments arise from sources outside that State. ARTICLE 21 OTHER INCOME 1. Items of income of a resident of a Contracting State, wherever arising, not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement shall be taxable only in that State. 2. The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to income, other than income from immovable property as defined in paragraph 2 of Article 6, if the recipient of such income, being a resident of a Contracting State, carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein, or performs in that other State independent personal services from a fixed base situated therein, and the right or property in respect of which the income is paid is effectively connected with such permanent establishment or fixed base. In such 31 case the provisions of Article 7 or Article 14, as the case may be, shall apply. 3. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2, items of income of a resident of a Contracting State not dealt with in the foregoing Articles of this Agreement and arising in the other Contracting State may also be taxed in the other State. ARTICLE 22 ELIMINATION OF DOUBLE TAXATION 1. In China, in accordance with the provisions of the law of China, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows: a) Where a resident of China derives income from New Zealand, the amount of tax on that income payable in New Zealand in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (except to the extent that these provisions allow taxation by New Zealand solely because the income is also income derived by a resident of New Zealand) may be credited against the Chinese tax imposed on that resident. The amount of the credit, however, shall not exceed the amount of the Chinese tax on that income computed in accordance with the taxation laws and regulations of China. b) Where the income derived from New Zealand is a dividend paid by a company which is a resident of New Zealand to a company which is a resident of China and which owns not less than 20 per cent of the shares of the company paying the dividend, the credit shall take into account the tax paid to New Zealand by the company paying the dividend in respect of its income. 32 2. In New Zealand, double taxation shall be eliminated as follows: Subject to the provisions of the laws of New Zealand which relate to the allowance of a credit against New Zealand tax of tax paid in a country outside New Zealand (which shall not affect the general principle of this Article), Chinese tax paid under the laws of China and consistent with this Agreement (except to the extent that these provisions allow taxation by China solely because the income is also income derived by a resident of China), in respect of income derived by a resident of New Zealand from sources in China (excluding, in the case of a dividend, tax paid in respect of the profits out of which the dividend is paid) shall be allowed as a credit against New Zealand tax payable in respect of that income. ARTICLE 23 ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, a benefit under this Agreement shall not be granted in respect of an item of income if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining that benefit was one of the principal purposes of any arrangement or transaction that resulted directly or indirectly in that benefit, unless it is established that granting that benefit in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant provisions of this Agreement. 33 ARTICLE 24 NON-DISCRIMINATION 1. Nationals of a Contracting State shall not be subjected in the other Contracting State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith, which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which nationals of that other State in the same circumstances, in particular with respect to residence, are or may be subjected. This provision shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 1, also apply to persons who are not residents of one or both of the Contracting States. 2. The taxation on a permanent establishment which an enterprise of a Contracting State has in the other Contracting State shall not be less favourably levied in that other State than the taxation levied on enterprises of that other State carrying on the same activities in similar circumstances. This provision shall not be construed as obliging a Contracting State to grant to residents of the other Contracting State any personal allowances, reliefs and reductions for taxation purposes on account of civil status or family responsibilities which it grants to its own residents. 3. Except where the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article 9, paragraph 8 of Article 11, or paragraph 6 of Article 12, apply, interest, royalties and other disbursements paid by an enterprise of a Contracting State to a resident of the other Contracting State shall, for the purpose of determining the taxable profits of such enterprise, be deductible under the same conditions as if they had been paid to a resident of the first-mentioned State. 34 4. Enterprises of a Contracting State, the capital of which is wholly or partly owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by one or more residents of the other Contracting State, shall not be subjected in the first-mentioned State to any taxation or any requirement connected therewith which is other or more burdensome than the taxation and connected requirements to which other similar enterprises of the first-mentioned State in similar circumstances are or may be subjected. 5. The provisions of the Article shall, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2, apply to taxes of every kind and description. ARTICLE 25 MUTUAL AGREEMENT PROCEDURE 1. Where a person considers that the actions of one or both of the Contracting States result or will result for that person in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, that person may, irrespective of the remedies provided by the domestic law of those States, present a case to the competent authority of the Contracting State of which that person is a resident or, if that case comes under paragraph 1 of Article 24, to that of the Contracting State of which that person is a national. The case must be presented within three years from the first notification of the action resulting in taxation not in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement. 2. The competent authority shall endeavour, if the objection appears to it to be justified and if it is not itself able to arrive at a satisfactory solution, to resolve the case by mutual agreement with the competent authority of the other Contracting State, with a view to the avoidance of taxation which is not in accordance with the Agreement. Any agreement reached 35 shall be implemented notwithstanding any time limits in the domestic law of the Contracting States. 3. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement any difficulties or doubts arising as to the interpretation or application of the Agreement. They may also consult together for the elimination of double taxation in cases not provided for in the Agreement. 4. The competent authorities of the Contracting States may communicate with each other directly for the purpose of reaching an agreement in the sense of paragraphs 2 and 3. When it seems advisable for reaching an agreement, representatives of the competent authorities of the Contracting States may meet together for an oral exchange of opinions. ARTICLE 26 EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION 1. The competent authorities of the Contracting States shall exchange such information as is foreseeably relevant for carrying out the provisions of this Agreement or to the administration or enforcement of the domestic laws concerning taxes of every kind and description imposed on behalf of the Contracting States, or of their political subdivisions or local authorities, insofar as the taxation thereunder is not contrary to the Agreement. The exchange of information is not restricted by Articles 1 and 2. 2. Any information received under paragraph 1 by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or 36 authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) concerned with the assessment or collection of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, the determination of appeals in relation to the taxes referred to in paragraph 1, or the oversight of the above. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information received by a Contracting State may be used for other purposes when such information may be used for such other purposes under the laws of both States and the competent authority of the supplying State authorises such use. 3. In no case shall the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 be construed so as to impose on a Contracting State the obligation: a) to carry out administrative measures at variance with the laws and administrative practice of that or of the other Contracting State; b) to supply information which is not obtainable under the laws or in the normal course of the administration of that or of the other Contracting State; c) to supply information which would disclose any trade, business, industrial, commercial or professional secret or trade process, or information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to public policy (ordre public). 4. If information is requested by a Contracting State in accordance with this Article, the other Contracting State shall use its information gathering measures to obtain the requested information, even though that other State may not need such information for its own tax purposes. The 37 obligation contained in the preceding sentence is subject to the limitations of paragraph 3 but in no case shall such limitations be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because it has no domestic interest in such information. 5. In no case shall the provisions of paragraph 3 be construed to permit a Contracting State to decline to supply information solely because the information is held by a bank, other financial institution, nominee or person acting in an agency or a fiduciary capacity or because it relates to ownership interests in a person. ARTICLE 27 MEMBERS OF DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS AND CONSULAR POSTS Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the fiscal privileges of members of diplomatic missions or consular posts under the general rules of international law or under the provisions of special agreements. ARTICLE 28 ENTRY INTO FORCE 1. This Agreement shall enter into force on the thirtieth day following the day on which the two Contracting States have notified each other that the domestic legal procedures for such entry into force have been fulfilled. The relevant date shall be the day on which the last notification is received. 38 2. The provisions of this Agreement shall have effect: a) in the case of taxes withheld at source, in respect of amounts paid on or after the first day of January of the calendar year next following that in which the Agreement enters into force; b) in the case of other taxes, for any taxable year beginning on or after the first day of January of the calendar year next following that in which the Agreement enters into force. 3. The Agreement between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of New Zealand for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Protocol thereto signed at Wellington on 16 September 1986, as modified by the Protocol signed at Wellington on 7 October 1997 (hereinafter referred to as “the 1986 Agreement”) shall cease to have effect with respect to any taxes to which this Agreement applies in accordance with paragraph 2. 4. The 1986 Agreement shall terminate on the last date on which it has effect in accordance with paragraph 3. ARTICLE 29 TERMINATION This Agreement shall continue in effect indefinitely but either of the Contracting States may, on or before the thirtieth day of June in any calendar year beginning after the expiration of a period of five years from the date of its entry into force, give to the other Contracting State, through 39 diplomatic channels, written notice of termination and, in such event, this Agreement shall cease to have effect: a) in the case of taxes withheld at source, in respect of amounts paid on or after the first day of January of the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given; b) in the case of other taxes, for any taxable year beginning on or after the first day of January of the calendar year next following that in which the notice of termination is given. The date of receipt of such notice by the other Contracting State shall be definitive for the determination of the deadline (the thirtieth day of June in any calendar year). IN WITNESS whereof the undersigned, duly authorised thereto, have signed this Agreement. Done at on the day of , , in duplicate in the Chinese and English languages, both texts being equally authentic. For the Government of New Zealand For the Government of the People’s Republic of China \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Clare Fearnley New Zealand Ambassador to China Wang Jun Commissioner of the State Taxation Administration PROTOCOL At the signing of the Agreement between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of New Zealand for the Elimination of Double Taxation with respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance (hereinafter referred to as “the Agreement”), both sides have agreed upon the following provisions, which shall form an integral part of the Agreement: 1. With reference to Article 5: For the sole purpose of determining whether the periods referred to in paragraph 3 have been exceeded, a) where an enterprise of a Contracting State carries on activities in the other Contracting State referred to in paragraph 3, and these activities are carried on during one or more periods of time that, in the aggregate, exceed 30 days without exceeding the periods referred to in paragraph 3, and b) where connected activities are carried on in that other Contracting State in connection with activities identified in paragraph 3 during different periods of time, each exceeding 30 days, by one or more enterprises closely related to the first-mentioned enterprise, these different periods of time shall be added to the aggregate period of time during which the first-mentioned enterprise has carried on activities referred to paragraph 3. “Enterprises closely related to the first-mentioned enterprise” has the meaning given in subparagraph 6 b). 2 2. With reference to Articles 10, 11 and 12, it is understood that the term “beneficial owner” is not used in a narrow sense (such as the meaning that it has under the trust law of many common law countries). 3. Income arising from guarantee or insurance services provided by: a) the China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation shall be taxed only in China; b) the New Zealand Export Credit Office shall be taxed only in New Zealand. 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 2 paragraphs 1 and 2, the taxes covered by the Agreement do not include any amount which represents a penalty or interest imposed under the laws of either Contracting State. 5. With regard to Article 10 subparagraph 2 b), a) it is understood that New Zealand’s supplementary dividend tax credit rules contained in subpart LP of the Income Tax Act 2007 have the effect of reducing the company tax paid by the New Zealand company provided that same amount is then distributed by the New Zealand company by way of supplementary dividend to the foreign shareholder in the same taxable year as the payment of the principal dividend. These rules currently only apply to portfolio investment; b) it is agreed that should New Zealand repeal or significantly amend the supplementary dividend tax credit rules in subpart LP of the Income Tax Act 2007, the New Zealand Competent Authority shall 3 inform the Chinese Competent Authority of this repeal or amendment with a view to reviewing Article 10. 6. With regard to Article 11, a) it is understood that New Zealand’s approved issuer levy regime in subpart 6B of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 allows interest having a New Zealand source to be paid to a non-resident who is not related to the borrower with no non-resident withholding tax if the borrower makes an election to pay approved issuer levy equal to 2% of the interest; b) it is agreed that should New Zealand repeal or significantly amend the approved issuer levy rules, the New Zealand Competent Authority shall inform the Chinese Competent Authority of this repeal or amendment with a view to reviewing Article 11. 7. With regard to Article 24: a) The Article shall not apply to any provision of the laws of a Contracting State which: (i) is designed to prevent avoidance or evasion of taxes, including: (A) measures designed to address thin capitalisation and transfer pricing; (B) controlled foreign company and foreign investment fund rules; and (C) measures designed to ensure that taxes can be effectively collected and recovered, including conservancy measures; 4 (ii) is of a type which the OECD Model Commentary on Article 24 as it read on 15 July 2014 contemplates not being subject to that Article; (iii) is otherwise agreed to be unaffected by Article 24 in an Exchange of Notes between the Contracting State; b) With regard to paragraphs 2 and 4, it is understood that the term “in similar circumstances” is intended to clarify, consistent with the OECD Model Commentary as it read on 15 July 2014, that in determining whether Article 24 paragraphs 2 and 4 apply, the permanent establishment or enterprise in question must also be in a similar position to the comparable domestic enterprise in terms of factors such as the legal structure of the enterprise, the size of the enterprise, and the regulatory regime under which they operate. 8.

FACT SHEET: GST AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES The Government has announced proposed changes to the GST treatment of telecommunications services intended to apply from 1 October 2020. This fact sheet provides a summary of the proposals. Aligning GST treatment The GST treatment of most telecommunications services would be aligned with the treatment of other remote services and determined based on the residency of the consumer. This would be achieved by repealing most of the existing special rules for telecommunications services in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. It is expected that for most telecommunications services the proposals would not change their GST treatment. However, this proposal would change the GST treatment of mobile roaming services so that: • Outbound mobile roaming services provided to New Zealand residents overseas would be subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%; and • Inbound mobile roaming services provided to non-residents in New Zealand would no longer be technically subject to GST. Specific location If the recipient needs to be at a specific location to receive certain telecommunications services, such as making a call from a phone booth, the GST treatment of those services would be determined by the physical location of the recipient rather than their residency. Why change? New Zealand’s current rules for applying GST to telecommunication services are out of date and inconsistent with international best practice as outlined by the OECD’s VAT/GST guidelines. Under the OECD’s best practice guidelines, a consumer’s usual place of residence is used to determine which country has the right to tax the consumption of remote services. This means a remote service should generally be subject to New Zealand GST when it is supplied to a New Zealand-resident consumer. The OECD guidelines define remote services as services where it is not necessary for the supplier and the consumer to be in the same place (for example, a digital download). The OECD’s definition of remote services is broad and includes telecommunication services. Therefore, under these guidelines supplies of telecommunications services should be subject to GST when it is consumed by a New Zealand resident, regardless of the consumer’s location. New Zealand has already adopted rules consistent with the guidelines for most remote services, but our current rules for telecommunications services are inconsistent with international best practice. What do the changes mean in practice? Consumers Whether GST applies to supplies of telecommunications services would no longer be determined by the location of the person (usually the consumer) who initiates that supply from a telecommunications supplier, but instead by the residency of the customer. Most customers will see no change to the GST treatment of telecommunications services they use. However, one of the main effects of this proposal would be that outbound roaming services used by New Zealand residents overseas would be subject to 15 per cent GST. Conversely, inbound roaming services used by non-residents would not be subject to GST. 1 Example Nell, a New Zealand resident, uses roaming services on her New Zealand mobile phone while she is on holiday in Brussels. The roaming services allows Nell to use her mobile phone as if she was in New Zealand, to make and receive calls, voicemails, text messages and use the internet while she is overseas. The proposed changes mean that roaming services supplied to Nell by her New Zealand telecommunications provider would be subject to GST. Telecommunications service providers From 1 October 2020, telecommunications service providers will need to start charging GST on roaming services supplied to New Zealand-resident consumers. We are consulting on the technical details of the proposed changes to make sure the changes are as easy to comply with as possible and are workable in practice.

Questions and answers 1 It is unlikely New Zealand GST is currently charged on inbound roaming services. Under current rules, a special GST-registration rule for non-resident telecommunications suppliers means that they are not required to register if their only supplies in New Zealand are inbound roaming services . Why should roaming services be subject to GST when I have to be outside New Zealand to receive them? Under the best practice guidelines developed by the OECD, roaming services should be subject to GST or VAT in the consumer’s usual place of residency, regardless of the consumer’s location. International consistency with these guidelines minimises the incidence of roaming services being subject to either double-taxation or double non- taxation. Furthermore, roaming allows a New Zealand resident to access a New Zealand mobile network whilst overseas and therefore it is appropriate that New Zealand GST apply to these services. What if I buy a local SIM card instead of using roaming services when I’m overseas? It is common practice for tourists travelling overseas to purchase local SIM cards, use a local mobile phone or a portable mobile router (such as pocket wi-fi) of the country they are travelling instead of using roaming services on their New Zealand mobile phone. A special rule is proposed so that the residency of the consumer using these mobile telecommunications services would be determined solely by the country code of the SIM card they are using to receive those services. This would mean that the mobile telecommunications services a tourist receives through using a local New Zealand SIM card would be subject to GST. Equally, the mobile telecommunications services a New Zealand resident receives through a foreign SIM card overseas would not be subject to GST. Example Kirsty is a New Zealand-resident on holiday in Egypt. Instead of using roaming services on her New Zealand mobile phone, she purchases an Egyptian SIM card at Cairo airport. The mobile telecommunications services she receives through her Egyptian SIM card will not be subject to New Zealand GST. Steve, Dave and Cameron are Australian tourists on holiday in New Zealand. To avoid paying international roaming charges while in New Zealand, they purchase a pocket wi-fi device from the local supermarket. This device provides them with a private wi-fi signal and allows them all to connect to internet from their respective mobile devices. This mobile telecommunications services they receive through the pocket wi-fi will be subject to GST at 15 percent. It can be argued that the consumer’s physical location and not their residency is a more appropriate proxy for determining whether GST applies for these situations as, to receive the “non-roaming” mobile telecommunications services, the consumer using a local SIM card needs to be in the country associated with that SIM card. Further, in practice, it is likely to be difficult for telecommunications suppliers to charge the correct jurisdictions’ GST or VAT when a tourist is using a local SIM or phone. Will I be charged GST if I use a phone booth or go to an internet café overseas? Where the recipient of a supply of telecommunications services is required to be in a specific location in New Zealand to receive the services - for example, making a call from a telephone booth or using a paid internet service at a hotel - it is proposed that regardless of the residency of the recipient consumer, a supply of telecommunications services by a resident supplier would be subject to 15 per cent GST. Equally, a supply of telecommunications services would not be subject to GST if the supply requires the recipient to receive the services at a specific location outside New Zealand. Examples Chris, an Australian tourist on holiday in New Zealand, uses a telephone booth in Auckland to make a call. Chris is charged 15 per cent GST as he needs to be at the phone booth to receive the service. Jo, a New Zealand resident on holiday in Australia, pays to use her hotel’s wi-fi service. Despite being a New Zealand resident, the supply of wi-fi is not subject to New Zealand GST as Jo needs to be at the Australian hotel to receive the service. Will there be any changes to the GST treatment of cross-border business-to - business supplies of telecommunications services? No. Telecommunications services supplied by a non-resident to a GST-registered business are currently generally not subject to GST. Under the proposed approach, these services will continue to not be subject to GST unless the supplier chooses to zero-rate the supply in order to claim back any New Zealand GST incurred in making the supply. Telecommunications services supplied by a resident to a non-resident supplier of telecommunications services are currently zero-rated and this treatment will be maintained.

This issues paper provides further details of the announcement, specifically the decisio n to repeal most of the special rules currently in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for taxing supplies of telecommunications services. 1.2 Under the current special rules for telecommunications services, whether a telecommunications service is subject to New Zealand GST is generally based on the physical location of the consumer at the time that service is initiated. This approach is out of date and inconsistent with international best practice (based on guidelines developed by the OECD) which applies GST to these types of services based on the consumer’s usual place of residence. In light of New Zealand’s new GST rules for taxing supplies of remote services, which are based on the residency of the customer, we consider that a better approach would be to align the GST treatment of telecommunications services with our rules for remote services. 1.3 Remote services, such as digital downloads and online services, are services which have no necessary connection between the place where the services are performed and the location of the recipient of the services. The GST treatment of a remote service is generally determined by the residency of the consumer. 1.4 Aligning the treatment of most telecommunications services with the treatment of remote services would result in outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents overseas being subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%. However, inbound mobile roaming services received by non-residents while in New Zealand would not be subject to GST. 1 1.5 However, treating telecommunications services as remote services would, in some cases, not result in appropriate outcomes. Some telecommunications services require the recipient of the services to be in a specific location to receive the services. For example, a person making a call from a phone booth needs to be at the phone booth to receive the telecommunications services. For these types of telecommunications services, the location of the consumer of the services is a more appropriate proxy than the consumer’s residency for determining the place of consumption. We therefore propose that the GST treatment of this type of telecommunications services be determined by the location of the recipient of the services. 1 Under the current rules, inbound mobile roaming services received by non-residents while in New Zealand are potentially subject to GST. However, section 51(1)(e) means that currently most inbound roaming services are not subject to GST, as non-resident telecommunications suppliers are not required to register if their only taxable supplies are supplies of telecommunications services to non-residents. 2 SENSITIVE Summary of proposed changes It is proposed that: • Most of the special rules in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 for supplies of telecommunications services be repealed. • The GST treatment of most telecommunications services be aligned with the treatment of other remote services and determined based on the residency of the consumer. • However, the GST treatment of some specific telecommunications services will be determined by the physical location of the recipient rather than their residency, if to receive the services, the recipient needs to be at a specific location. The proposed changes are not intended to change the GST treatment of most telecommunications services. However, the proposed changes would mean that: • Outbound mobile roaming services received by New Zealand residents overseas would be subject to GST at the standard rate of 15%; and • Inbound mobile roaming services received by non-residents in New Zealand would no longer be technically subject to GST.

This means that GST applies at the standard rate of 15% to most goods and services that are consumed in New Zealand (with very few exemptions). This ensures that the tax is fair, efficient and simple. 2.2 Most other jurisdictions with GST or Value Added Tax (VAT) systems also apply the destination principle for determining the place of consumption. Under this principle, a good or service should be taxable in the jurisdiction in which it is consumed. 2.3 Another key principle of GST is tax neutrality. Tax neutrality in GST means that as a consumption tax, GST is borne by the final consumer and should not be a tax on businesses. 2 It also means that GST should be applied evenly across all businesses in similar circumstances carrying out similar transactions, including similar transactions by resident and non-resident businesses. When different groups of suppliers are treated the same for GST purposes, it ensures that one group is not competitively advantaged over another group. It also means that consumer behaviour is not driven by tax considerations in situations where goods and services supplied by different suppliers are readily substitutable. 2.4 The “place of supply” rules in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) 3 determine where consumption of goods and services occurs and, therefore, whether they are subject to New Zealand GST. For the supply of services, we generally look to the supplier’s location and the place of physical performance to determine consumption. Traditionally, these proxies for consumption could easily be applied to services, as the consumption of services would typically occur in the same place the services were performed. For example, a haircut performed in New Zealand would be subject to New Zealand GST. 2.5 The emergence of imported telecommunications services (such as call-back services and international roaming) in the early 2000s, however, gave rise to concerns about how our GST rules at that time applied to these services. The concept of physical performance used to determine consumption and, therefore, which country had the right to tax a service did not fit well with the nature of telecommunications services. Unlike traditional services, telecommunications services were (and still are) highly mobile, often involve many different supplies or “connections”, and can be supplied across borders, which meant it was not always clear where the consumption of the services occurred. 2 In New Zealand, although GST is collected at each stage of the supply chain, businesses can deduct the GST costs of their inputs through an input tax credit mechanism. This ensures that the tax flows through businesses to tax supplies made to final consumers. 3 Unless otherwise stated, all legislative references in this issues paper are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 6 SENSITIVE 2.6 As a result, in 2003 special GST rules for cross-border supplies of telecommunications services were introduced. Under these special rules: • A supply of telecommunications services is generally subject to GST if the supply is made to a person physically in New Zealand at the time the service is initiated. • A supply of telecommunications services is not subject to GST if the supply is made to a person physically outside New Zealand at the time the service is initiated. • Telecommunications services supplied by a non-resident to a GST- registered business are not subject to GST. • Telecommunications services supplied by a resident are zero-rated if supplied to a non-resident supplier of telecommunications services. • A non-resident supplier of telecommunications services is not required to register if their only taxable supplies are supplies of telecommunications services to non-resident consumers. 2.7 The special rules for telecommunications services use the location of the person who initiates the supply from a telecommunications supplier as a proxy for determining the place of consumption of these services. It is not always clear who has initiated a supply of telecommunications services. Section 8(9) provides three tests for determining the person who has initiated a supply. Furthermore, for certain telecommunications services it can be difficult to determine the location of the person who initiated the supply. Section 8A allows suppliers to use the customer’s billing address to determine the place of supply if the actual location of the initiator of the supply cannot be determined. The “initiator” test is unique to New Zealand’s GST system. 2.8 When these special rules were introduced in 2003 the place where the service was initiated was considered the best proxy for determining the place of consumption. However, New Zealand’s approach to applying GST to telecommunications services is now out-of-date and inconsistent with international best practice. 2.9 The International VAT/GST Guidelines (the Guidelines) developed by the OECD recommend taxing these services based on the consumer’s usual place of residence. Many other countries (with the notable exception of Australia) adopt approaches consistent with these guidelines for applying GST/VAT to telecommunications services. OECD VAT/GST Guidelines 2.10 Over time, the rise of the global economy, technological advances, and trade liberalisation have led to growth in digital supplies of services and intangibles. These developments have allowed businesses to supply services to customers remotely from anywhere in the world, so that customers no longer need to be in the same location as the supplier to consume the services. It was considered internationally that the traditional proxies for determining consumption did not work for the supply of these “remote services” (including telecommunications services) as it was often unclear where the consumption of these services 7 SENSITIVE occurred and, therefore, which country had the right to tax the supply. This led to growing uncertainty globally about how GST/VAT should apply to these services. 2.11 As a result, the OECD developed best practice guidelines which provided proxies for determining consumption for supplies of services and intangibles. 4 For “on-the-spot” services, where the nature of the service requires the supplier and the consumer to be in the same place (for example, a haircut), the Guidelines suggest a place of performance test for determining the place of consumption. For remote services and intangibles, where it is not necessary for the supplier and the consumer to be in the same place (for example, a digital download), the Guidelines suggest the consumer’s usual place of residence as the test for determining the place of consumption. 2.12 The Guidelines adopt a broad definition of what is a remote service and include supplies of telecommunications services. 5 2.13 The consumer’s usual place of residence has been broadly accepted as the best proxy for determining the place of consumption for remote services and intangibles. It is relatively easy to determine and less open to manipulation than other proxies such as the location of the consumer at the time of supply (which gives rise to problems of both determining the location of the consumer and how to treat a supply consumed in multiple locations). It is also considered a relatively simple proxy for suppliers to apply in practice. 2.14 In line with the Guidelines, since 1 October 2016, GST has applied to remote services (such as online services and digital downloads) supplied by offshore suppliers to New Zealand-resident consumers at the standard rate of 15%. While our remote services regime covers a broad range of services, telecommunications services are not covered by the regime. Other countries’ approaches 2.15 Many jurisdictions with comparable GST/VAT systems use the residency of the consumer as a proxy for consumption of telecommunications services. The most notable exception is Australia, whose rules for telecommunications services are similar to New Zealand’s current rules. United Kingdom 2.16 The United Kingdom (UK) is the most recent example of a country which has moved to a residency-based test for consumption of supplies of telecommunications services. Before 1 November 2017, the UK applied a “use and enjoyment” rule to telecommunications services, which meant that if telecommunications services were consumed outside the EU, they were treated as being outside the scope of UK VAT. This approach had the same effect as New Zealand’s current rules in the GST Act for supplies of telecommunications services. 4 OECD (2017), International VAT/GST Guidelines, OECD Publishing, Paris 5 International VAT/GST Guidelines, page 69 8 SENSITIVE 2.17 However, as part of its 2017 Budget, the UK Government announced changes to their VAT place of supply rules for telecommunications services – specifically, supplies of telecommunications services by UK suppliers to UK non-business users (that is, UK consumers). The changes mean that since 1 November 2017, these services, when supplied to UK residents, are subject to UK VAT regardless of where they are consumed. In practical terms, it means that UK VAT now applies to roaming services when UK consumers use their mo bile devices outside the UK and the EU. Equally, supplies to visitors from countries outside the EU are no longer subject to UK VAT. 2.18 In making the change, the UK Government noted it would align the UK treatment of telecommunications services with the internationally agreed approach for taxing these services. European Union 2.19 Under the EU’s rules, since 1 January 2015, supplies of telecommunications, broadcasting and electronic services have been subject to tax in the Member State in which the customer is resident. VAT applies regardless of whether the customer is a business or a final consumer, and regardless of whether the supplier is based in the EU or outside. 2.20 The definition of telecommunications services in the EU VAT Directive 6 is similar to the definition in New Zealand’s GST Act, except that it does not specifically exclude content. Norway 2.21 Norway’s VAT on electronic services (e-services) has applied since 1 July 2011. Under Norway’s rules, e-services include electronic communication and telecommunications services. The definition of these services is based on the EU VAT Directive and the EU VAT Regulation No 282/2011. 7 Switzerland 2.22 Similarly, since 2010, Switzerland’s “remote services” rules cover both telecom and electronically supplied services. Australia 2.23 Telecommunications supplies of global roaming services outside Australia by an Australian-resident supplier are treated as GST-free (zero-rated) when: • the customer is outside Australia when the service is supplied; and • the effective use and enjoyment of the supply by the customer takes place outside Australia. 2.24 Telecommunications supplies made by an Australian-resident supplier to a non-resident supplier are GST-free if the supply enables a non-resident customer (who has a subscription to a telecommunications network outside 6 Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax 7 Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 282/2011 of 15 March 2011, Article 7 9 SENSITIVE Australia) to roam in Australia. In effect this means that no Australian GST applies to either outbound or inbound roaming services. Effect of the current rules for telecommunications services 2.25 The GST rules for telecommunications services (based on the physical location of the consumer) are out-of-date and inconsistent with both international best practice and with our rules for taxing supplies of remote services. The current rules result in the following outcomes: Resident suppliers 2.26 Supplies of telecommunications services by a resident to a person who initiates that supply outside New Zealand are zero-rated (subject to tax at a rate of zero percent). In practical terms, this allows a resident telecommunications supplier to zero-rate roaming services provided to New Zealand-resident consumers who are temporarily offshore (outbound roaming). The principle on which this rule is based was that the consumption of roaming services occurred offshore as the recipient of the services is offshore when these services are physically performed. Example 1: Current GST treatment of outbound roaming services Nell is a New Zealand resident visiting her Aunty in Brussels. Nell uses her New Zealand mobile phone during her visit to Brussels. GST is charged at the rate of zero percent on the roaming services supplied by the New Zealand telecommunications services provider to Nell. Non-resident suppliers 2.27 Supplies of telecommunications services by non-residents to both resident and non-resident consumers physically in New Zealand are subject to GST provided the non-resident supplier meets the threshold for GST registration. This means that under current rules, inbound roaming services to non-resident consumers who are temporarily in New Zealand could technically be subject to New Zealand GST. However, a special rule for suppliers of telecommunications services means these suppliers are not required to register if their only taxable supplies are supplies of telecommunications services to non-residents physically in New Zealand. 8 Example 2: Non-resident supplier of inbound roaming services not required to register Britphones is a British telecommunications company that supplies $100,000 worth of roaming services to British tourists on holiday in New Zealand. Britphones does not make any other taxable supplies in New Zealand. Britphones is not required to register for GST as their only taxable supplies in New Zealand are telecommunications services supplied to non-residents. 8 Section 51(1)(e) of the GST Act 11 SENSITIVE CHAPTER 3 Proposals It is proposed that: • The special rules in the GST Act for supplies of telecommunications services be mostly repealed. • The GST treatment of most telecommunications services be aligned with the treatment of other remote services. • The GST treatment of some specific telecommunications services will be determined by the physical location of the recipient rather than their residency, if to receive the services, the recipient needs to be at a specific location. • The residency of a consumer receiving mobile telecommunications services be determined solely by the country code of the SIM card they are using to receive those services. • Business-to-business supplies of telecommunications services by non-resident suppliers would continue to not be subject to GST. The problem 3.1 As outlined in chapter 2, the approach of many countries is to apply tax to telecommunications services on a residency basis. As New Zealand’s current rules are not aligned with international best practice they could give rise to potential double non-taxation and double taxation issues. Outbound roaming services supplied to New Zealand-resident consumers temporarily offshore may not be taxed in any country (double non-taxation). On the other hand, inbound roaming services received by a non-resident in New Zealand could possibly be subject to tax in both New Zealand and in the country where the consumer is usually resident (double taxation). 3.2 Further, the nature of telecommunications services has changed significantly since the special GST rules were introduced in 2003. The lines between telecommunications services and content are now blurred and services that were once separate are now supplied together over data-based networks. 3.3 It does not make sense when these services are now so interconnected, for the supply of digital content to be treated differently (currently taxable under the remote services regime) from the telecommunications services through which the content is able to be provided or delivered. The current rules mean that a New Zealand resident would, for example, be charged GST on music that she has downloaded while overseas, but no GST would be charged on the roaming services that she has used to download the music. 12 SENSITIVE Example 3: Current treatment of outbound roaming services versus treatment of other remote services Nell is still in Brussels on holiday. She uses roaming services on her New Zealand mobile phone to search for a song title. She then pays to download that song from a popular international music website. The song she downloads onto her phone is subject to New Zealand GST (taxable under the remote service rules). However, the underlying roaming services which enabled her to search for the song on the internet and subsequently download it onto her phone are not subject to GST (currently zero-rated under the special rules for telecommunications services). The main proposal 3.4 The Government has proposed to repeal most of the special rules applying to telecommunications services. Repealing the telecommunications services rules would mean that telecommunications services would generally be treated as remote services. As such, their place of consumption would be determined by the residency of the recipient of the services. 3.5 However, for certain telecommunications services the consumer’s residency is not an appropriate proxy for the place of consumption. These services require a person to be in a specific location to receive the services. For these specific telecommunications services we propose that the location of the recipient of the services should be used for determining the place of consumption (discussed in chapter 4). Telecommunications services as remote services 3.6 Section 2 of the GST Act defines a remote service as: a service that, at the time of the performance of the service, has no necessary connection between – (a) the place where the service is physically performed; and (b) the location of the recipient of the services 3.7 We consider that most telecommunications services meet this definition. Therefore, by repealing the special GST rules for telecommunications services, the treatment of telecommunications services would be aligned with the treatment of other remote services and based on the consumer’s residency rather than their physical location. This means that telecommunications services supplied to New Zealand-resident consumers would be subject to GST regardless of the location of the consumer. Conversely, telecommunications services supplied to non-resident consumers would not be subject to GST. 3.8 For most telecommunications services, aligning their treatment with the GST treatment of other remote services would not change their GST treatment. These telecommunications services are currently initiated in New Zealand by a New Zealand resident, or initiated outside New Zealand by a non-resident. 13 SENSITIVE Example 4: Telecommunication services supplied to a resident Brett is a New Zealand resident living in Hamilton. Brett receives mobile phone services from Kiwiphone, a New Zealand-resident telecommunications supplier. The mobile phone services supplied to Brett are currently standard-rated (subject to GST at 15%) as they supplied by a New Zealand resident and are initiated by Brett in New Zealand (meaning that section 11AB, which zero-rates telecommunications services initiated outside New Zealand, does not apply to the treatment of the services). These mobile phone services would still be standard-rated in the absence of the special telecommunications rules as they are supplied by a New Zealand resident. Brett also receives landline phone services to his house in Hamilton from Kiwiphone. These services are currently subject to GST at 15% as they are initiated by Brett in New Zealand. In the absence of the special telecommunications rules these services would also be subject to GST at 15% as they are supplied by a New Zealand resident. Brett also contracts Catapult Broadband, an American internet service provider to supply internet to Brett’s home in Hamilton. Under the current rules, assuming Catapult Broadband meets the registration threshold, they would need to charge GST on the internet services they provide to Brett as the services are initiated by a person in New Zealand. Under the remote services rules these internet services would still be subject to GST as they are provided to a New Zealand-resident consumer. Mobile roaming services 3.9 Telecommunications services supplied to a New Zealand resident physically outside New Zealand, or to a non-resident physically inside New Zealand would have their GST treatment changed under the proposals. The place of consumption for these services would no longer be determined by the place the services are initiated but would instead be determined by the residency of the recipient of the services. 3.10 The most prominent type of telecommunications services that would have their GST treatment changed under the proposals are mobile roaming services. For example, outbound roaming services supplied to New Zealand residents outside New Zealand are currently zero-rated but would be standard-rated (subject to GST of 15%) under the proposed changes. Example 5: Roaming services supplied to residents Kiwi Telco, a New Zealand-resident telecommunications supplier, supplies mobile phone services to New Zealand residents. Currently, Kiwi Telco charges GST on the mobile phone services its customers receive in New Zealand. However, Kiwi Telco zero-rates the roaming services it provides to its customers when they are outside New Zealand. Under the proposed rules, Kiwi Telco would be required to charge GST at the standard rate on both the regular mobile phone services and the outbound roaming services it supplies to New Zealand residents. 3.11 Conversely, inbound roaming services supplied to non-residents inside New Zealand would no longer be potentially subject to GST. 14 SENSITIVE Example 6: Roaming services supplied to non-residents Ozzy Telco is an Australian telecommunications company that supplies roaming services to Australian tourists on holiday in New Zealand. Ozzy Telco also makes some taxable supplies to New Zealand residents and is therefore GST-registered. Currently Ozzy Telco would be required to return GST on the inbound roaming services it provides to tourists in New Zealand. Under the proposals, Ozzy Telco would no longer be required to return GST on its supplies of inbound roaming services to non-residents. Telecommunications services supplied by residents to non-residents 3.12 Applying the remote services rules to telecommunications services would mean that telecommunications services supplied by a resident supplier to non- residents outside New Zealand would remain zero-rated. Teleco mmunications services supplied to non-residents physically in New Zealand would under section 8(2) be prima facie still subject to GST at the standard rate. However, section 20(3)(dc) would mitigate double taxation by reducing the amount of output tax payable on these services to the extent the supplier has incurred liability for, returned and paid a consumption tax in another jurisdiction. Example 7: Telecommunications services supplied by a resident to non-residents Kiwiphone is a New Zealand-resident telecommunications supplier that primarily supplies mobile phone services to New Zealand residents. However, Kiwiphone also operates a mobile network in the UK through which it supplies mobile phone services to UK residents. Currently, the regular mobile services Kiwiphone supplies to UK residents are zero-rated under section 11AB(b), whilst the inbound roaming services they supply to UK residents physically in New Zealand are standard rated. Under the remote services rules the regular mobile services Kiwiphone supplies to UK residents would remain zero-rated and the inbound roaming services they supply to UK residents in New Zealand would prima facie be subject to GST at the standard rate. However, as Kiwiphone is registered for VAT in the UK they are paying UK VAT on these inbound roaming services at the rate of 20%. Under section 20(3)(dc) Kiwiphone would therefore not be required to return GST on the inbound roaming services they supply to UK residents. Local SIM cards, phones and portable mobile routers 3.13 It is a common practice for tourists travelling overseas to purchase local SIM cards or use local portable mobile routers (such as, pocket wi-fi) of the country they are travelling in to avoid paying international roaming charges. Alternatively, some tourists may purchase local mobile phones of the country they are travelling in to use while away on holiday. 3.14 Under the remote services rules, these mobile telecommunications services a tourist receives should be subject to GST/VAT in the jurisdiction they are resident in even if they are using a local SIM card or phone. However, it can be argued that the place of consumption for the telecommunications services a tourist receives through the use of a local SIM card, portable mobile router or mobile phone should be the tourist’s physical location and not their residency as, to receive the “non-roaming” mobile telecommunications services, a tourist using a local SIM card needs to be in the country associated with that SIM card. 15 SENSITIVE 3.15 In practice it is also likely to be difficult for telecommunications suppliers to charge the correct jurisdictions’ GST or VAT when a tourist is using a local SIM or phone. Under section 8B(2) suppliers are required to use two non- contradictory pieces of evidence for determining the residency of the consumer. However, under paragraph (e) one of the pieces of evidence that can be used is the mobile country code of the SIM card used by the person. It may therefore be difficult for a supplier of mobile phone services to have two non-contradictory pieces of evidence for a consumer’s residency status when a tourist is using a local SIM card. 3.16 As such, we propose that the residency of a consumer receiving these mobile telecommunications services should be determined solely by the country code of the SIM card they are using to receive those services. This would mean that mobile telecommunications services a tourist receives through using a New Zealand SIM card, for example, would be subject to GST. Likewise, the mobile telecommunications services a New Zealand resident receives through a foreign SIM card while overseas would not be subject to GST. Example 8: New Zealand resident using a foreign SIM card Kirsty, a New Zealand resident, is on holiday in Egypt. To avoid paying international roaming charges she purchases a SIM card of a local Egyptian telecommunications supplier. The mobile telecommunications services she receives through her Egyptian SIM card will not be subject to GST. Example 9: Non-residents using a New Zealand mobile device Steve, Dave and Cameron are Australian tourists on holiday in New Zealand. To avoid paying international roaming charges while in New Zealand, they purchase a pocket wi-fi device from the local supermarket. This device provides them with a private wi-fi signal and allows them all to connect to the Internet from their respective mobile devices. This mobile telecommunications service they receive through the pocket wi-fi will be subject to GST at 15%. 3.17 We are seeking feedback on whether this is an appropriate approach for determining the place of consumption of mobile telecommunications services when a person uses a local SIM card or mobile device while overseas. Business-to-business supplies 3.18 Telecommunications services supplied by a non-resident to a GST-registered business are generally not subject to GST under section 8(8). Treating telecommunications services as remote services should generally maintain this treatment. Under section 8(4D), remote services supplied by a non-resident to a GST-registered business are not subject to GST unless the supplier chooses to zero-rate the supply in order to claim back any New Zealand GST incurred in making the supply. 3.19 Currently telecommunications services supplied by a resident are zero-rated if supplied to a non-resident supplier of telecommunications services. We recommend that this treatment be retained to ensure that GST remains a tax on consumption and not on businesses. 16 SENSITIVE Definition of telecommunications services 3.20 Telecommunications services are currently defined in section 2 of the GST Act as: the transmission, emission or reception, and the transfer or assignment of the right to use capacity for the transmission, emission or reception, of signals, writing, images, sounds or information of any kind by wire, cable, radio, optical or other electromagnetic system, or by a similar technical system, and includes access to global information networks but does not include the content of the telecommunication 3.21 While we are proposing to repeal the special telecommunications rules we consider that a definition of telecommunications services is still required in the GST Act. We are therefore seeking feedback on whether the current definition is still fit for purpose. Application date 3.22 It is proposed that the new rules apply from 1 October 2020. 17 SENSITIVE CHAPTER 4 Place of supply of specific telecommunications services It is proposed that: • Specific telecommunications services supplied by residents would be subject to GST at 15% regardless of the consumer’s residency if, to receive the services, the recipient of the services needs to be in a specific location in New Zealand. • Specific telecommunications services would not be subject to GST even when supplied to a New Zealand resident, if to receive the services the recipient needs to be in a specific location outside New Zealand. • A new test for determining the place of supply of these specific telecommunications services replace the existing test based on the location of the person initiating the supply. 4.1 Some telecommunications services require the recipient of the services to be in a specific location to receive the services. For example, a person using wi- fi at an internet cafe needs to be at that cafe to receive the wi-fi services. For these types of telecommunications services, we do not consider the residency of the recipient of the services to be an appropriate proxy for determining the place the services are consumed. Instead we propose that the place of consumption for these telecommunications services be determined by the location that the services are received. 4.2 The current test for determining the place of supply of telecommunications services, based on the location of the person initiating the supply, may achieve the correct result for these specific telecommunications services. However, we do not propose keeping the “initiator test” for these telecommunications services. It may not always be clear who has initiated a supply of telecommunications services. Furthermore, determining the place of consumption based on where a service is initiated is unique to New Zealand’s GST. Therefore, we consider that repealing this test and developing a clearer test for the place of consumption of these specific telecommunications services is appropriate. OECD Guidelines 4.3 As noted in chapter 2, the OECD’s International VAT/GST Guidelines recommend that for business-to-consumer supplies of services, the place of consumption should generally be determined by: • the consumer’s residency, in the case of remote services; and 18 SENSITIVE • the place where the service is performed, in the case of on-the-spot services. 4.4 However, the Guidelines also note that in some specific cases these proxies may not be appropriate for determining the place of consumption. The Guidelines mention the provision of wi-fi in an internet cafe or the use of a telephone booth to make a phone call as examples of remote services in which the consumer’s residency is not an appropriate proxy for determining the place of consumption. Instead the Guidelines note that, in the case of these telecommunications services, the actual location of the consumer is a more appropriate proxy for the place of consumption. 4.5 In line with the Guidelines, we consider that for specific telecommunications services which require the consumer to be in a specific place to receive the services (such as making a call from a phone booth), the place of consumption should be determined by the location of the consumer. Supplies received in New Zealand 4.6 We propose that regardless of the residency of the recipient, a supply of telecommunications services by a resident supplier would be subject to GST at 15% if the supply requires the recipient to receive the services at a specific place in New Zealand. This generally aligns with the current GST treatment of these telecommunications services. Example 10: Internet Cafe Wi-Fi & Kai is an internet cafe located in Tauranga. They charge customers $5 an hour for access to wi- fi at the cafe. As customers need to be at Wi-Fi & Kai to receive the supply of wi-fi it will be subject to GST at the rate of 15% regardless of the residency of the cafe’s customers. Example 11: Phone booth Aneale, an Australian tourist in Wellington, uses a phone booth to make a call to a friend. Despite being a non-resident, Aneale would be charged GST at 15% on the supply of telecommunications services as he had to be at the phone booth in Wellington to receive the supply. 4.7 We do not anticipate many instances in which these specific telecommunications services could be supplied in a specific location in New Zealand by non-resident suppliers. Supplies received outside New Zealand 4.8 We propose that regardless of the residency of the recipient, a supply of telecommunications services would not be subject to GST (or zero-rated) if the supply requires the recipient to receive the services at a specific place outside New Zealand. This also would generally align with the current treatment of these services. 19 SENSITIVE Example 12: Telecommunication service received at a specific place outside New Zealand Keava, a New Zealand resident, is staying at a hotel in Sydney. The hotel charges her for using the phone in her room to make an international call to her sister in Hamilton. Despite Keava being a New Zealand resident, the supply of telephone services would not be subject to GST as Keava had to be in her hotel in Sydney to receive the supply.
Habitual buying and selling of land A tax policy consultation document September 2019 Prepared by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue First published in September 2019 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Habitual buying and selling of land – a tax policy consultation document ISBN 978-1-98-857305-2 © Crown Copyright This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence.

The rules that tax certain sales of land contain exclusions from tax for people who use that land as their main home, residence or business premises. However, the ability to use these exclusions is restricted where the taxpayer has a regular pattern of buying and selling land used as a main home, residence or business premises. This is because it is assumed that a person who has a regular pattern of buying and selling land primarily acquires that land for sale and should be taxed on any gain, whether or not they used the land as their residence or business premises while they owned it. 2. There are concerns that the current regular pattern restrictions are not working as intended. As currently drafted, taxpayers who habitually buy and sell can structure around the regular pattern restrictions. This can be done by using associated persons to carry out separate transactions, or by varying each transaction so that there is no “pattern”. This undermines the integrity of the tax system by allowing people to take advantage of the exclusions in circumstances where this was not intended. 3. This paper discusses the issues and proposes possible solutions. Officials seek your views on the issues and proposed solutions identified. Background 4. The land sales rules contain various exclusions for land used as a main home, residence or business premises. If one of these exclusions applies, an amount that would otherwise be subject to tax under one of the land sales rules, will not be taxable (for example, an amount derived by a land dealer from selling land will not be taxable if the land dealer used the land as their residence while they owned it). 5. However, the main home exclusion in section CB 16A, the residential exclusion in section CB 16, and the business premises exclusion in section CB 19 do not apply where there has been a regular pattern of buying and selling property used for such purposes. The restriction assumes that a person who has a regular pattern of buying and selling land primarily acquires that land for sale and should be taxed on any gain, whether or not they used the land as their residence or business premises while they owned it. 6. For the purposes of the residential exclusion in section CB 16 and the business premises exclusion in section CB 19, the regular pattern restriction applies where a person has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of, or erecting and disposing of, dwellinghouses occupied mainly as a residence by the person or premises used for business. 7. For the purposes of the main home exclusion in section CB 16A, the regular pattern restriction applies in addition to the cap on how frequently the main home exclusion can be used in a two-year period. The main home exclusion cannot be used where: • the exclusion has been used by the person twice within the two years prior to the current sale; or • the person has engaged in a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land used as their main home. 8. There are concerns that these regular pattern restrictions are not working as intended. 4 The proposals Group of persons or entities 9. As currently drafted, all of the regular pattern restrictions apply quite narrowly to the activities of a single person. This allows taxpayers to circumvent the application of the regular pattern restrictions by buying and selling land using different but associated persons or entities each time (for example, the first property is purchased by the person, the second is purchased by their partner, the third by their family trust etc). 10. To resolve this concern, it is suggested that an amendment be made to ensure that the regular pattern restrictions apply where a person, or a group of people or entities has a regular pattern of buying and selling land that has been: • occupied by the person or group of people as their main home, residence or business premises (as applicable); or • occupied as a main home, residence or business premises (as applicable) by the person or group of people that controls the entity or entities that own the land. 11. A group of people or entities will not have a regular pattern of buying and selling land merely because they are associated and together buy and sell a number of properties. It is necessary that the same person or group of people or entities all occupy each of the properties. Example 1: Residential exclusion Mr and Mrs A have a history of purchasing rundown residential properties to renovate and sell. They live in the properties while they renovate them, and each property is sold within two years. To date, Mr and Mrs A have repeated this pattern five times. The first property they purchased was held in Mr A’s name. The second property was held in Mrs A’s name. The third property was held in the name of the A Family Trust. The fourth property was held in Mr A’s name. The fifth property was held in the name of the A Property Trust. Under the current rules, the regular pattern restriction in both the residential exclusion in section CB 16 and the main home exclusion in section CB 16A would not apply. This is because a person has not engaged in a regular pattern of buying and selling land used as a residence or main home of that person. The proposed amendment would ensure that the regular pattern restriction would apply to this scenario because a group of people has engaged in a regular pattern of buying and selling land that was all occupied as a residence or main home by Mr and Mrs A (who control the A Family Trust and the A Property Trust). 5 Example 2: Business premises exclusion G purchases run-down buildings to renovate and sell. While he owns the buildings, he runs a piano tuning business out of them. Over the past eight years, he has purchased four run-down buildings, relocated his piano tuning business to the building, carried out repairs and maintenance, and then sold the building for a profit. Each building has been purchased by a separate company that is wholly owned by G. Under the current rules, the regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion in section CB 19 would not apply. This is because a person has not engaged in a regular pattern of buying and selling land used as a business premises for that person. The proposed amendment would ensure that the regular pattern restriction would apply to this scenario because a group of people has engaged in a regular pattern of buying and selling land that was all used as premises to carry on a piano tuning business by G (who controls all of the companies). Example 3: No regular pattern Q Corp is the holding company for a group of 20 retail stores selling electronics. Each store is owned by a separate subsidiary of Q Corp. None of the subsidiaries had any intention of selling their stores when they were initially purchased. However, over the space of 10 years, five of the subsidiaries sell their original stores and relocate to a new store in a better location. The proposed amendment to the regular pattern restriction would not result in the restriction applying in this situation. While, overall, it could be said that the group has regularly bought and sold land over the 10-year period, none of those properties were purchased with an intention of resale. Instead, the sales were merely disposals of capital assets used to carry on the separate business of each sub. Example 4: Regular pattern in a group of companies B Corp is a holding company for a group of eight house building subsidiaries. Each of the subsidiaries has a spec home, which they use as an office (all management, administrative, and architectural work is undertaken from that location). All the subs carry on activities involving both buying land in new subdivisions and building to sell, as well as building on land owned by third parties. Over the course of 10 years, 5 of the subs relocate their office to a new spec home and sell their old one (all sales occur within 10 years of constructing the spec home). Each of the subs separately are in the business of building. The subs acquired the land used for the spec houses in the course of their business (taxable under s CB 7). Under the current rules, the regular pattern restriction in the business premises exclusion in section CB 19 would not apply. This is because a person has not engaged in a regular pattern of buying and selling land used as a business premises for that person. The proposed amendment would ensure that the regular pattern restriction would apply to this scenario because a group of people has engaged in a regular pattern of buying and selling land that was acquired with an intention of resale. 12. The distinction between examples 2 and 4 and example 3 is that the subsidiaries in example 3 do not have an intention of resale. We are interested in views as to whether this raises any policy concerns. 6 Similar activities 13. Because of the language used in the residential exclusion in section CB 16 and the business premises exclusion in section CB 19, the regular pattern restrictions in those provisions have been interpreted very narrowly to apply only where there is a similarity or likeness between the transactions (for example, a pattern of buying land, building a home on the land and then selling). This means that the regular pattern restrictions will not apply where a person has a pattern of buying and selling land that they occupy as a residence or business premises, where they carry out different activities on the land while they hold it. For example, the first property is bought, lived in and sold, the second is renovated while it is lived in and sold, or the third is a bare section where a house is built and occupied then sold). 14. Officials consider that the regular pattern restrictions should apply more broadly to any pattern of buying and selling land used as a residence or business premises. It should not matter whether properties were simply bought and sold, or whether any building or renovation work occurred while the person owned the land. What should be relevant is that there are “regular” transactions (that is, the transactions occur at sufficiently uniform or consistent intervals). 15. Therefore, it is suggested that an amendment be made to broaden the scope of the regular pattern restrictions in the residential exclusion in section CB 16 and the business premises exclusion in section CB 19, to ensure they apply to all patterns of buying and selling land used as a residence or business premises. Example 5: Different activities Miss P is a property developer. She purchased a property that she used as her main home. She sold it three years later and purchased a run-down property which she occupied while it was renovated. Miss P sold that property three years later and purchased another property which she also renovated while she lived there. Three years later she sold that property and purchased a bare block of land. Miss P built a house on the land which she occupied as her dwelling until she sold it three years later. Under the current rules, Miss P does not have a regular pattern because she has not carried out the same activities on the land for each property. Therefore, she can rely on the residential exclusion for each property sale. The proposed amendment would ensure that the regular pattern restriction would apply to this type of scenario because, while the activities carried out on the land are different, the transactions occur at sufficiently uniform or consistent intervals such that she has a regular pattern of buying and selling land. 16. The regular pattern restriction to the main home exclusion in section CB 16A refers only to a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land that is used as a main home. Therefore, officials are of the view that this provision is already focused on the regularity of the sale and purchase transactions and does not require amendment. However, officials are interested in submitters’ views on this point. Time-period restrictions 17. As noted, the main home exclusion in section CB 16A contains both a regular pattern restriction and a restriction where the exclusion has been used twice within the two years prior to the current sale. 7 18. Officials suggest that similar time-period restrictions could be useful in addition to the regular pattern restrictions to the residential exclusion in section CB 16 and the business premises exclusion in section CB 19. Officials are interested in submitters’ views on this proposal. 19. Officials are also interested in submitters’ views on the number of transactions and the relevant time periods that should be considered if such a time-period restriction is added to the residential exclusion in section CB 16 and the business premises exclusion in section CB 19. Officials suggest a time-period restriction of more than twice in three years might be appropriate. Other considerations 20. While officials consider that the regular pattern restrictions require amendment to ensure that taxpayers cannot structure around them, it is not intended that such amendments should result in ordinary commercial or family transactions, where there is no purpose of sale, being taxed. 21. The regular pattern restrictions are not, for example, intended to apply where people move from time to time as a result of changes of circumstance (such as relocating for work or to get nearer to a good school). It is also not intended that the regular pattern restrictions should prevent small businesses from moving to larger premises over time as their business expands. 22. Officials are interested in submitters’ views as to whether the proposed amendments to the regular pattern restrictions are likely to capture these types of transactions in circumstances that would not already be caught under the current rules. Submissions 23. Officials seek submissions on the proposals set out in this policy consultation document. 24. Submissions should be made by Friday 18 October 2019 and can be emailed to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Habitual buying and selling” in the subject line. 25.

Holding costs for privately used land that is taxable on sale A tax policy consultation document October 2019 Prepared by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue First published in October 2019 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, PO Box 2198, Wellington 6140.

The objective is to recommend ways to improve the efficient use of land, and ensure that the current tax settings are fair, balanced, and encourage and support productive investment. 1.2 One of the issues being considered is the rules for the deductibility of holding costs for land that is taxable on sale and is used privately (in whole or in part) while it is held. For example, this will arise where a bach or second home is sold within five years so that the gain from the sale is taxable under the bright-line test. This will also arise where a person regularly purchases properties to renovate and sell, and lives in the properties while they own them. The issues 1.3 Holding costs are costs such as interest, rates, insurance, and repairs and maintenance expenditure that are incurred as a result of owning land. It is generally accepted that, to the extent that land is used to earn taxable income, holding costs are deductible. So, if a person owns a rental property, holding costs are deductible in full (subject to the new rental ring-fencing rules) because those costs relate to the taxable rental income. Equally, if land is held by a land dealer, holding costs are deductible in full because those costs relate to the taxable income from the sale of the land. 1.4 However, our tax system does not allow deductions for expenditure to the extent that it is private or domestic in nature. This is known as the private limitation. This means that holding costs relating to a person’s main home are not deductible. 1.5 While the law is relatively clear about the deductibility of holding costs where land is used solely for either inco me-earning or private use, the law is currently unclear about the treatment of holding costs where they relate to land that is subject to income tax on sale and is used privately while it is held. This consultation document considers this issue. 1.6 In determining the correct treatment for the deductibility of holding costs, this consultation document considers the following issues: • the extent to which holding costs should be deductible where land is subject to income tax on sale and is used privately, in whole or in part, while it is held; and • whether periods of vacancy should be treated as periods of either private use or income earning use. 1.7 This consultation document also proposes the following technical amendments to bring the legislation into line with established practice, to ensure that: • costs of acquisition and improvements to land are deductible where land is taxable on sale under the bright-line test or the various 10-year rules, despite there being 2 no knowledge that the land sale was going to be taxable when the expenditure was incurred; and • the provision that allows a deduction for the costs of acquisition and improvements 1 overrides the private limitation so that the whole of those costs are deductible even if the land is used privately. 1.8 These proposed amendments are discussed in more detail in chapters 4 and 5. 1.9 These issues have arisen as a result of the introduction of the bright-line test, which brings more privately used land into the tax base. However, they can also arise in relation to land that is taxed under the other land sales rules. The proposals in this document are intended to apply to land taxed under the bright-line test and to land that is taxed under any of the other land sales rules. Summary Deductibility of holding costs for private use periods 1.10 This consultation document considers three options for the deductibility of holding costs for land subject to income tax on sale that is used privately. These options are: • apportioning the holding costs between the taxable gain on sale and the private use of the land while it is held; • allowing deductions for all holding costs, even though there is private use; and • denying deductions for all holding costs for periods of private use. 1.11 These options are discussed in more detail in chapter 2. 1.12 While an apportionment approach would arguably be the most accurate option, it would not be consistent with other areas of New Zealand’s tax law where no apportionment is required. Most obviously, holding costs for rental properties are fully deductible (subject to the new rental ring-fencing rules) even though those costs also often relate to a non- taxable capital gain. 1.13 Therefore, officials’ current view is that denying deductions for all holding costs for periods of private use would be the best option. Treatment of periods of vacancy 1.14 This consultation document also considers the correct tax treatment of holding costs relat ing to land that is not actively used and is taxable on sale. This is necessary to decide whether unused or vacant land should be treated as being used privately or for income earning purposes when determining deductibility. This is discussed in more detail in chapter 3. 1.15 Officials propose that the treatment of periods of vacancy as either private or income- earning use should be based on the other uses of the land throughout the period of ownership. 1 Section DB 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3 How to make a submission 1.16 Officials invite submissions on the proposed changes and points raised in this consultation document. 1.17 Send your submission to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Holding costs for privately used land that is taxable on sale” in the subject line. 1.18 Alternatively, submissions may be posted to: Holding costs for privately used land that is taxable on sale C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.19 The closing date for submissions is 1 November 2019. 1.20 Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it is acceptable for Inland Revenue officials to contact submitters to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.21 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts of submissions, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. 4 CHAPTER 2 Deductibility of holding costs for private use periods 2.1 Holding costs are generally deductible where land is used to earn taxable income. However, the private limitation denies a deduction for an amount of expenditure or loss to the extent it is of a private or domestic nature. 2.2 The level of deduction that is allowed for holding costs in situations where there is some private use of the property and the sale of the property is taxed is currently unclear. 2.3 Three options for deductibility are discussed below. Option 1: Apportionment 2.4 Holding costs relate both to any current year use of the land and to any eventual gain on sale. The holding costs could therefore be apportioned between the private-use benefit and the taxable gain on sale. For example, if a person received $100 worth of private benefits from their private use of the land, and a $100 taxable gain on sale, they would be entitled to a deduction of fifty percent of the holding costs on the basis that only fift y percent of the total benefit is taxable. 2.5 Arguably, apportioning holding costs between private and taxable benefits would be the most accurate approach. However, correct apportionment requires both the benefit of the current year use, and the income derived on sale, to be measurable. Measuring the value of the private benefit is likely to be difficult, and the taxable gains are not known until the property is sold. Therefore, accurate apportionment is likely to be complex. Simplified apportionment approaches could be developed (for example, fifty percent of ho lding costs are deductible for private use periods regardless of the values of the private and taxable benefits), however, these would be arbitrary and would compromise accuracy. 2.6 An apportionment approach would also be inconsistent with other areas of New Zealand’s tax law where no apportionment for holding costs is required. For example, holding costs for rental properties held on capital account are fully deductible (subject to the new rental ring-fencing rules) even though those holding costs also relate to a non- taxable capital gain. Requiring apportionment in those circumstances would likely improve neutrality and fairness. However, it would be a significant change to the existing tax law and may increase complexity. Option 2: Allow all deductions 2.7 The second option would be to allow deductions for holding costs in full, despite any private use, on the basis that the holding costs are all incurred in deriving the taxable income from sale. This bases deductibility on whether there is a taxable use of the land, regardless of whether there is a non-taxable or private use of the land. 5 2.8 Allowing deductions in full for holding costs during periods of private use would result in deductions being allowed for private expenditure. This is inconsistent with an important principle of New Zealand’s tax framework. Option 3: Deny all deductions 2.9 The final option would be to deny all deductions for holding costs for periods in which the land is used privately. For example, no deductions for holding costs would be allowed for a bach that is taxed on sale under the bright-line test but was used one hundred percent privately while it was held. 2.10 This option bases deductibility on the current year use of the land. If the current year use of land is inco me-earning, for example a rental property, deductions for holding costs would be allowed. Conversely, deductions would be denied if the current year use of land is private. Where current year use of land involves a mixture of both income-earning and private use, deductions would only be denied for the days where the land is used privately. 2.11 Consistent with the current rules for rental properties where deductions are allowed in full despite the gain on sale not being taxed, the taxable gain on sale would be ignored for determining the deductibility of holding costs. 2.12 This option is consistent with keeping private expenditure out of the tax base. This option is also consistent with the Tax Working Group’s capital gains tax design recommendations, where it was recommended that no deductions should be allowed for holding costs where land is used privately. 2 It may also reduce compliance costs for bright-line taxpayers who would otherwise have to find prior year evidence to support deductions at the time of sale. 2.13 This option may be seen as unfair as it does not recognise the fact that the holding costs do relate in part to the taxable gain on sale. Furthermore, in situations where a person regularly purchases properties to renovate and sell, and lives in the properties while they own them, this approach would deny all holding costs (including repairs and maintenance expenditure) for the period in which they live in the properties. Officials’ views 2.14 An approach which apportions holding costs between the current year use and the gain on sale would arguably be the most accurate option. However, as noted, an apportionment approach would likely be complex, or sacrifice accuracy in order to reduce complexity. 2.15 Furthermore, an apportionment approach is inconsistent with other parts of the tax system where apportionment is not required. As noted, requiring apportionment in cases where the current year use is income-earning and the gain on sale is non-taxable would be a significant change to the existing tax law and is likely to increase complexit y. Officials therefore do not propose changing the existing tax law to require apportionment in these circumstances. 2 See the Tax Working Group’s Final Report, Vol II, Chapter 4, paragraph 8. 6 2.16 In the absence of changing existing tax law to require apportionment when the gain on sale is non-taxable and the current year use is income earning, officials’ view is that an apportionment approach is not appropriate for situations where the current year use is private and the gain on sale is taxable. 2.17 Instead, officials consider the best option is to deny deductions for holding costs for periods of private use. Holding costs for different entities 2.18 For simplicity, the discussion has focused on land in individual ownership. However, land can be owned by a number of different entity types. Officials are aware that having different rules applying to different entity types might incentivise owners to move land into entities where the rules are perceived to be better. This is not considered to be a good outcome. 2.19 Officials consider the above proposals should apply in the same way for individuals, partnership, trusts, and look-through companies. For all of those entities, expenditure is only deductible where there is sufficient connection between the expenditure and income, or between expenditure and a business carried on for the purpose of deriving income. To the extent that land is used privately, holding costs will not be connected to any income. Therefore, the proposals to deny deductions (wholly or in part) for private use should affect individuals, partnerships, trusts, and look-through companies in the same way. 2.20 For most expenditure, the same principle applies to companies. If land owned by a company is used privately by its shareholders, and the company is deriving no income from that use, most holding costs will not be deductible to the extent of the private use. However, companies are generally entitled to full interest deductions whether or not the interest is connected to income. Therefore, taxpayers could choose to use a company to hold private land in order to obtain full interest deductibility. 2.21 While officials are aware of this potential inequity between companies and other structures it is not proposed that the rules should be changed for companies. While companies are allowed full interest deductions, private use of land by shareholders will either require the shareholders to pay full market rent to the company (which is taxable to the company and non-deductible to the shareholders) or would give rise to taxable dividend income for the shareholders. Private use of land by employees of the company will give rise to a benefit to the employee which is either taxable as employment income, or subject to FBT. 2.22 On that basis, officials consider that there are already rules that disincentivise company ownership of privately used land. However, officials are interested in whether there are other views on this issue. 2.23 Even if no changes are made to the rules for interest deductibility for companies, officials will monitor this area and consider changing the rules should taxpayers start to use this structure more. 7 CHAPTER 3 Treatment of periods of vacancy 3.1 The second issue is the correct tax treatment of holding costs relating to land that is not actively used and is taxable on sale. If deductions are denied (wholly or in part) as a result of private use, it is necessary to determine whether unused or vacant land should be treated as being used privately, or for income earning purposes. 3.2 The treatment of vacant or unused time as either private or income-earning could depend on the other uses of the land during the period of ownership. This would mean that: • Where land is otherwise actively used either privately or for income-earning purposes, any vacant or unused days could be treated similarly. For example, where a person has a rental property that is vacant for a couple of months between tenants, that vacant time would still be treated as income-earning use. If a person has a bach that is wholly used for private purposes, unused time would be treated as private use. • Where land is used for both income-earning and private purposes and there are more than 62 days of vacant or unused time, the current “mixed-use asset rules” could continue to apply. These rules apportion vacant days based on the proportion of actual private and income-earning days (for example, if a bach is used privately for 20 days in a year and is rented through Airbnb for 20 days in a year and is otherwise vacant, fifty percent of the vacant days are treated as private days and fifty percent of the days are treated as income earning days). 3.3 Where land is wholly vacant or unused, the use could be considered income earning if: • it is held for a business of dealing in, developing, or building on land; • it is held for another income-earning purpose (for example, land purchased to expand a current business onto, or to erect a rental property); or • the taxpayer otherwise informs the Commissioner at the time of purchase that the land was acquired solely with an intention of resale for profit. 3.4 In all other situations where land is wholly vacant or unused the use would be considered private. 3.5 This approach to the treatment of periods of vacancy ensures that legitimate businesses can still claim deductions for holding costs for periods of vacancy, while also ensuring that private expenditure is kept out of the base. 3.6 In contrast, treating all periods of vacancy as either wholly private or wholly income- earning use would either deny deductions for legitimate business expenditure, or allow deductions for private expenditure. 8 CHAPTER 4 Overriding the general permission 4.1 In most cases, there has to be sufficient connection between expenditure and income, or between expenditure and a business carried on for the purpose of deriving income before expenditure can be deducted. This is known as the general permission. Whether the general permission has been satisfied is judged at the time the expenditure is incurred. 3 4.2 In some situations involving land subject to the land sale rules there may not be the required connection between expenditure on holding costs and income, because at the time the expenditure is incurred it may not be known whether the disposal of the land will be taxed. 4.3 This may be the case, for example, with land that is taxed if sold within a particular timeframe (that is, 5 or 10 years). The issue may also arise where land is taxed if certain circumstances eventuate during the time the land is held (for example, if a division or development is carried on, or if the land increases in value because of a zoning change, within 10 years of acquiring the land). 4.4 This issue is relevant because the provision that allows for the cost of acquisition and improvements to the land to be deducted (section DB 23) is subject to the general permission being satisfied. 4.5 It was clearly intended that the cost of land that is taxed under any of the land sale rules would be deductible, so that only the net proceeds are income (or a loss). That is how the provisions operated prior to the rewrite of the Income Tax Act, under the “profits or gains” approach. However, it seems that the splitting out of income and deductions into separate provisions may have inadvertently created some uncertainty in respect of land taxed under some of the land provisions. 4.6 In situations where it is not known or anticipated at the time land is acquired that the disposal will be taxed, but it transpires that one of the land sale rules does in fact apply, the cost of the land may not currently technically be deductible under section DB 23. This is because there is not be the requisite nexus between the cost of the land (at the time that is incurred) and expected future income. 4.7 To address this issue it is proposed that section DB 23 be amended so that it overrides the general permission for disposals of revenue account property. 4.8 Should it be decided that holding costs should be deductible where there is no income- earning current use of the land, an amendment will also be needed to allow for deductions of those costs where it is not known at the time the costs are incurred that the sale of the land will be taxable. 3 CIR v Banks (1978) 3 NZTC 61,236 (CA). 9 CHAPTER 5 Overriding the private limitation 5.1 The current provision that allows deductions for the costs of acquisition and improvement of land (section DB 23) is subject to the private limitation. Therefore, technically, where there is private use of land that is subject to tax on sale, part of the costs of acquisition and improvements should also be denied to take into account the private benefit received. 5.2 However, officials are of the view that private use should not affect the deductibility of acquisition and capital improvement costs. As noted, these costs should be fully deductible at the time of sale, no matter how the property is used while it is held to ensure that only the net proceeds are income. 5.3 To address this issue it is proposed that section DB 23 should also be amended so that it overrides the private limitation.

This allocation usually has little or no commercial significance but can have a material impact on the parties’ tax obligations. Accordingly, it is not appropriate for the parties to determine the allocat ion without reference to market values. 1.4 In most cases, the Income Tax Act 2007 already explicitly requires the amount allocated to taxable assets in a mixed supply to be determined on the basis of market values. However, with the exception of the rules for trading stock, these rules do not explicitly require the seller and buyer to adopt the same allocation, that is, there is no general consistency requirement. 1.5 In many mixed supply transactions, the parties agree on an allocation which is based on market values and follow it in their tax returns. This is best practice, and the proposals in this issues paper are intended to encourage it. However, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is aware of other practices which are not desirable, but which are difficult to deal with under the current provisions. 1.6 Buyers and sellers in some transactions are adopting different allocations for tax purposes, almost always to the detriment of the Government’s revenue base. Sometimes these differences are based on different views of market values, where the parties have not agreed on an allocation. 2 Sometimes, one party files its tax return on the basis of an allocation explicitly agreed between the parties, while the other files on a different basis because the agreed allocation does not in its view represent market value. 1.7 In some cases, the parties agree to and both adopt an allocation which in the Commissioner’s view is not based on market value. The parties may then take the 1 Revenue account property is an asset that when sold would result in a taxable gain or deductible loss. Conversely, capital account property is an asset that when sold would result in a non-taxable, non-deductible capital gain or loss. Depreciable property is an asset whose market value is expected to decline in value over its economic life. 2 In most cases the market value of an asset cannot be precisely determined, may be subject to debate between valuation experts, and falls within a range. 6 position that the Commissioner has no power to challenge the allocation, because it has been agreed between arm’s length parties, or because there is no explicit market value rule for a buyer of depreciable property. 1.8 Officials consider that: • in all cases allocations should be based on relative market values, 3 and the Commissioner must have the power to adjust an allocation (whether or not agreed) that is not so based. Officials believe that this is already the law, but for a purchaser of depreciable property, it could usefully be clarified; • in a transaction which is a mixed supply for both parties, the parties should adopt the same allocation when filing their tax returns, and the Commissioner should be able to easily determine whether or not they have done so. 1.9 This issues paper: • explains in more detail why the allocation of the price in a mixed supply is important for tax purposes; • summarises the current law; • explains the issues arising in practice under the current law; and • proposes some so lutions to those issues. 1.10 Feedback on the proposed solutions is invited, including any modifications to the proposals or solutions which may be preferable. Summary of proposals 1.11 To increase taxpayer certainty, prevent vendors and purchasers from engaging in allocation practices that reduce tax revenue, and to minimise administrative costs, officials suggest the following rules for transactions where both vendor and purchaser treat the transaction as a mixed supply: • that in all cases the vendor and purchaser be required to use the same allocat ion of the total purchase price to the different types of property; • that this be achieved by a hierarchy of rules – if the parties: - agree on an allocation, both must file their returns using that allocation; - do not agree on an allocation, then:  the purchaser must use the vendor’s allocation when filing its tax return. In this case, there would be a requirement for the vendor to disclose their allocation to the purchaser and the Commissioner within a specified period, for example, within three months of 3 The amounts allocated still have to add up to the global purchase price, but the proportion of that purchase price allocated to a specific asset should be its market value relative to the total market value of all the assets being purchased. 7 when the assets are treated for tax purposes as disposed of by the vendor;  if the vendor fails to provide an allocation, the purchaser may make the allocation, in which case that allocation would be provided to the vendor and the Commissioner and would be required to be adopted by the vendor; • that allocations must be based on relative market values, except possibly in the case of a non-agreed allocation to depreciable property, where depreciated cost or possibly original cost could be adopted instead; • it may be appropriate to have a de minimis for these suggested changes. 1.12 It is expected that any amendments arising from these proposals will be included in a tax bill to be introduced in the first half of 2020. How to make a submission 1.13 Submissions are invited on the proposals in this discussion document. 1.14 The closing date for submissions is 14 February 2020. 1.15 Submissions can be made: • by email to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Purchase price allocation” in the subject line; or • by post to: Purchase price allocation C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.16 Submissions should include a brief summary of the major points and recommendations.

A less common example is a sale of forestry land, where the bare land may be on capital account, but the timber is always on revenue account. Essentially, any time a person sells or buys, in a single transaction, two or more items with different tax treatments, there is a need for an allocation of the consideration between those items. 2.2 Alt hough this allocation is required for income tax and often accounting purposes, it generally has no, or little, other commercial significance. It does not affect the amount payable, nor does it affect the manner or timing of the payment. It is therefore possible for the parties to agree it in their transaction documents, or to be silent about it. 2.3 The example illustrates the significance of the tax allocation. Example Suppose A Co has agreed to sell its business to B Co. The assets include land and buildings (all acquired after May 2010), fit-out and other depreciable property, receivables and trading stock. The purchase price for all of the assets on a going concern basis is $15 million. Assume for simplicity no liabilities are to be assumed by B Co so the consideration provided is limited to the cash price. A Co is entitled to a deduction for the depreciated cost of its fit-out and other depreciable property, and the cost of its receivables and its trading stock. It will only be taxable on the portion of the sale price attributable to these items (in the case of depreciable property, up to the original cost of the property), and not the portion attributable to the land and buildings, or goodwill. Accordingly, the amount retained by A Co after tax will be twenty eight percent higher to the extent it is allocated to the land and buildings or goodwill than if it is allocated to the other items. Suppose A Co believes that an appropriate allocation of the price is as set out in the following table. This table also shows the tax effect of the allocation for A Co. Allocation A Co Cost\* A Co Profit A Co Tax ($000) ($000) ($000) ($000) Land and buildings 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 Depreciable property 6,000 6,000 0 0 Receivables 1,000 1,200 (200) 56 Trading stock 1,500 1,400 100 (28) Goodwill 3,500 0 3,500 0 Total 15,000 10,600 4,400 28 \* or tax book value, where relevant B Co’s position is generally the opposite of A Co’s. The tax outcome of the transaction is less favourable for B Co as the amount allocated to the land and buildings and goodwill increases, because B Co can claim no deduction for those items. In other respects, their interests are not opposed. For example, B Co will be better off allocating the price to fast-moving trading stock than to depreciable assets, since the deduction for trading stock will be able to be claimed sooner than the deduction for the cost of depreciable assets. That allocation will therefore maximise the present value of its tax deduction. From A Co’s perspective, the allocation between trading stock and depreciable property is generally irrelevant, since it will be taxable either way (unless the amount allocated to depreciable property exceeds its original cost). 9 Suppose then that B Co believes a greater amount should be allocated to depreciable property and receivables, and less to goodwill. If this allocation was required for A Co, the tax payable for A Co would be: Allocation A Co Cost A Co Profit A Co Tax ($000) ($000) ($000) ($000) Land and buildings 3,000 2,000 1,000 0 Depreciable property 9,000 6,000 3,000 (840) Receivables 1,200 1,200 0 0 Trading stock 1,500 1,400 100 (28) Goodwill 300 0 300 0 Total 15,000 10,600 4,400 (868) This allocation would decrease A Co’s after-tax return from the transaction by $896,000. It would increase B Co’s after-tax return from the transaction by the present value of the additional deduction for depreciable property and trading stock. This will be less than $896,000, by reason of the time value of money reducing the value of the depreciation deductions. Generalising from the example 2.4 Vendors are better off after tax if the global consideration in a mixed supply is allocated so that it is not taxable. This will generally mean allocating it to capital assets or goodwill, rather than to revenue account assets such as inventory, timber, patents or consumables. Of course, if all of the vendor’s assets are on capital account, or they are all on revenue account, or if the vendor is tax exempt, there is no tax advantage to the vendor fro m the allocat ion. 2.5 Purchasers benefit if the consideration is allocated so that it is deductible as soon as possible. This will generally mean allocating it: • first to revenue account assets such as trading stock which will be sold within a short period or to depreciable assets with a short depreciable life; • then to revenue account assets which may be sold after a longer period or depreciable assets with a longer depreciable life; • away fro m non-deductible items like land, buildings and goodwill. 2.6 It is generally assumed that the natural commercial tension between the parties ensures that in an arm’s length sale, an agreed allocation, that must be fo llo wed for tax purposes, will reflect market values. The tax status of depreciable property means that this will not always be the case. The special case of depreciable property 2.7 Depreciable property raises an additional issue. Consider the vendor’s position first. 2.8 To the extent that the allocation does not exceed the cost price of the asset to the vendor, the vendor should view an allocation to a depreciable asset in the same category as an allocation to a revenue account asset, such as timber or trading stock. On sale, the vendor will be taxable on the amount allocated to the asset up to the amount of the original cost (with a deduction for any remaining undepreciated cost). 10 2.9 Any excess of the amount allocated over that original cost is not taxable to the vendor. 4 Accordingly, allocation to depreciable property in excess of the vendor’s original cost has the same effect for the vendor as an allocation to land held on capital account or goodwill. 2.10 The purchaser’s position is not bifurcated in this way. Provided the purchaser is not associated with the vendor, it will be entitled to a deduction over time for the whole of the consideration, including the amount that is not taxable to the vendor because it exceeds the vendor’s original cost. 2.11 Accordingly, an allocation to a depreciable asset of an amount in excess of its original cost to the vendor gives a tax deduction to the purchaser at no cost to the vendor (to the extent of the excess above cost). It may be beneficial, for example, in the sale of land, buildings and fit -out, for the parties to allocate to the fit -out an amount more than the cost of the fit -out to the vendor, since that amount would be deductible to the purchaser and not taxable to the vendor. 2.12 In the example considered above, suppose that the original cost of the depreciable assets to the vendor was $8 million. If the vendor agrees to accept the purchaser’s allocation of $9 million to that property, rather than insisting on its own $6 millio n valuation, the effect will be to: • increase the vendor’s income from sale by $2 million; and • increase the purchaser’s deductions by $3 million. 2.13 It is therefore likely that the $9 million allocation will result in less tax being paid overall than the $6 million allocation, though the benefit will accrue entirely to the purchaser and the cost will be incurred entirely by the vendor. It is possible that the vendor might be more willing to adopt the purchaser’s allocation if the purchaser is prepared to share some of the benefit of the allocation in the form of an increased purchase price. 2.14 The possibility of depreciable property having a value greater than cost has increased considerably since fixed life intangible property and software became depreciable. Such property is often self-created, which tends to produce a very low cost-base due to a failure to accurately capitalise expenditure. However, it can have a very high value. The asymmetry between the vendor’s treatment (on capital account, to the extent it exceeds cost) and the purchaser’s (depreciable, sometimes over a relatively short period) means that the parties may have a common interest in overstating the amount allocated to such property. 2.15 There may also be other situations when the vendor is agreeable to accepting an allocation that is tax favourable for the purchaser because there are no implications for them, such as when the vendor is exempt from income tax. 4 There is an exception for patents, where the whole amount payable is taxable to the vendor – see the Income Tax Act 2007 section CB 30. 11 Inconsistent allocations 2.16 The discussion to date assumes that only one allocation applies, to both the parties. However, if each party can adopt its own allocation, there is no tension. In the example, the vendor can treat itself as having sold depreciable property for $6 million, while the purchaser treats itself as having acquired the same property for $8 million. This is good for the vendor and purchaser, but not so good for the rest of the community, since the effect of the inconsistent allocations is that the sale of the property reduces total taxable income by $2 million over time. Concluding remarks on the significance of allocation for tax 2.17 The discussion so far has made the point that while an allocation of the global consideration is of little or no commercial significance in most sales of business assets, the allocation adopted by a party in its tax return will often have tax consequences. Chapter 3 considers the law governing how an allocation should be made. 12 CHAPTER 3 Current law 3.1 Chapter 2 considered the commercial and tax significance of purchase price allocations. This chapter considers the legal constraints on allocations for tax purposes and the degree to which there is a requirement for consistent allocations. Statute 3.2 Several provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 require the amount allocated to taxable assets, by either or both of the vendor and purchaser, to be determined on the basis of market values. Trading stock (broadly defined) 3.3 Section EB 24 applies to a person who sells trading stock along with other assets. It requires the amount apportioned to trading stock to reflect the respective market values of the trading stock and the other assets. It also treats the purchaser as adopting the allocation of the vendor. This ensures consistency in the allocation. 3.4 Trading stock for this purpose is broadly defined. It includes livestock, timber, anything acquired for the purpose of disposal, and land the sale of which is subject to tax. It does not include depreciable property or financial arrangements. Wit h those exceptions, it seems to cover most if not all property the sale of which is subject to tax. Depreciable property 3.5 Subsection EE 45(10) provides that an amount a person derives from the disposal of a depreciable item when that disposal occurs along with a disposal o f other items (for example, in a sale of a business or a commercial property) is its market value. This requirement only applies to the vendor. Purchasers are entitled to claim depreciation for the cost of depreciable property, with no explicit statutory rule applying in the case of a mixed supply. Financial arrangements 3.6 Sections EW 38 and EW 42 in the financial arrangements rules state that all disposals of financial arrangements for inadequate consideration are deemed to be for market value for the vendor and purchaser respectively. Therefore, neither party can allocate less than market value to financial arrangements in their tax returns. There is no explicit constraint on them allocating a greater amount, and no requirement for their allocation to be the same. Case law 3.7 As a general proposition, taxpayers bear the onus of proof in relation to an allocat ion of the price in a mixed supply. There are a number of New Zealand cases dealing with such allocations: 13 • Buckley & Young Ltd v CIR (1978) 3 NZTC 61,271. This case involved a single payment for the dual purpose of obtaining the employee’s resignation and for a restrictive covenant. The question for the Court was whether the expenditure should properly be treated as deductible or on capital account. The case established a number of relevant apportionment principles: - The onus is on the taxpayer to justify an apportionment if challenged by the Commissioner. - Such a justification is likely to require some reference to market value. - The apportionment should be objective. Absolute precision/scientific process is not required, but there has to be sufficient evidence to justify a conclusion that a particular part is actually attributable to a particular item. - It is not a question of what a reasonable and prudent taxpayer would have expended; it is what this particular taxpayer in fact paid. This implies that under the current law the taxpayer is not free to adopt whatever value they please, even if there is no specific statutory requirement to use market values in the circumstances. • Rusk v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,128. This case involved a challenge by a taxpayer to the Commissioner’s allocation of value to timber in a sale of forestry land by the taxpayer where the allocation of the price between land and timber was not agreed between the parties. The taxpayer was successful in arguing that the Commissioner’s allocation gave too high a value to the timber, though the amount substituted by the Court appears to have been higher than that argued for by the taxpayer. It seems likely from the case that the value adopted by the purchaser was different from that approved by the Court. • Edge v CIR \[1958\] NZLR 42. This case involved a mortgagee sale to the taxpayer of a farm as a going concern, with no agreed allocat ion o f the purchase price. Included in the assets sold was livestock which had been valued a week before the sale at £6,471. The taxpayer sought to treat this amount as the purchase price of the stock. The Commissioner successfully challenged this, on the basis that the sale was at a discount, and the discount needed to be applied to the trading stock, just as it applied to the land and plant. Accordingly, the purchaser was only allowed a deduction for trading stock of £4,711. • Hansen v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 483. This case involved a sale of a farm as a going concern, where the parties had agreed an allocation of £27,750 to livestock. The purchaser nevertheless obtained a valuation of the livestock which showed a value of £82,645. The vendor returned £27,750 as income from sale of the livestock, but the Commissioner challenged this figure (under a predecessor to current section EB 24) on the basis that it was not market value. The Privy Council upheld the Commissioner’s assessment that the vendor should be taxed on £82,645. 14 3.8 The Hansen case is particularly useful in demonstrating that in determining the sale value of the items sold in a mixed supply for tax purposes, an agreed allocation of a global price between arm’s length parties is not accorded the same respect as a series of individual and independent sales of the same items. Summary 3.9 There are statutory provisions for the allocation of the price in a mixed supply to trading stock, depreciable property and financial arrangements, requiring market values to be used by at least the vendor, and some requiring consistency between the vendor and purchaser. However, there is no consistency of rules across the asset categories. 3.10 Several principles have emerged from case law that highlight the important considerations in determining the validity of an allocation in relation to trading stock. 3.11 Although these principles are helpful, the lack of consistency in the statutory language has given rise to some problems in practice, as discussed in the next chapter. Officials therefore consider that the existing provisions alone cannot be relied on to achieve the desired policy outcomes. Feedback Officials seek feedback on: • Whether this chapter correctly summarises the relevant law and practice. • Are there relevant legal or practical considerations our summary has omitted? 15 CHAPTER 4 Issues arising in practice 4.1 In many mixed supplies the vendor and purchaser agree an allocation to depreciable property, financial arrangements and trading stock using relative market values and, fo llo w it in their respective tax returns. Discussions with advisors suggest that this is best practice. Officials expect that it will become more common if the proposals in this paper are enacted. 4.2 However, there is also no doubt that this practice is far from universal. The parties may prefer not to agree an allocation, on the basis that this gives them freedom to make their own assessments of value, and scrutiny from the Commissioner is unlikely to occur or, if it does occur, to result in any adjustment even where there is inconsistency. Inconsistent valuations 4.3 In some cases, for example, vendors treat depreciable fit -out as sold for its depreciated value, whereas purchasers treat it as acquired for a much higher value. In others the lower vendor valuation of depreciable property may result from the parties employing separate valuers. The difference in valuation of the fit -out is compensated for by the parties taking correspondingly different views on values for the land or building, which generally has no impact on tax. 4.4 In other instances, the Commissioner is aware of a purchaser in a mixed supply agreeing to an allocation, but then taking the view that the allocation should not be followed for tax purposes because it was much lower than indicated by relative market values the purchaser could point to (similar to the purchaser in the Hansen decision referred to above). Unless the purchaser seeks the Commissioner’s guidance, this kind of behaviour is difficult for the Commissioner to detect, and almost certain again to lead to a loss of revenue, since the vendor will be relying on the agreed allocation. Resolving the inconsistency may be impossible if the vendor is liquidated after the sale takes place. 4.5 Where the vendor and purchaser adopt different allocations based on separate valuation advice it can be difficult for the Commissioner to resolve the difference, particularly given that outside of trading stock, there is no requirement for consistency of allocation. Even though the vendor’s and purchaser’s use of different valuations will almost always be to the detriment of the Revenue, it may be difficult for the Commissioner to determine which valuation to challenge or decide whether to challenge both. This is particularly true where the property is not frequently traded. For example, the Hansen and Edge decisions, where the Commissioner was successful in challenging an allocation to trading stock, both involved livestock for which reliable values were available. In Rusk, where the property at issue was timber, issues relating to the unique and non-fungible nature of standing timber and land were more significant, and the result of the case appears to have been a decision that meant the taxpayer vendor was treated as selling for a lower value than that adopted by the purchaser as the cost price of the trees. 16 4.6 Valuation is a matter of judgement, and in many mixed supplies, there will be a range of values for taxable property which can reasonably be said to be based on relative market values. So long as the parties each choose within this range, it may be difficult or impossible for the Commissioner to eliminate any gap and thus there is revenue leakage. The closer two valuations are to each other, the less inclined the Commissioner will be to expend resources on pursuing a challenge, and this will be especially true if two separate disputes are required. Consistent valuations not within a market range 4.7 Generally, where two non-associated parties agree to an allocation and have opposing interests in the amounts allocated to different assets, the Commissioner will accept this is the product of natural tensions and represents market value. However, there have been instances when the Commissioner has not accepted that an agreed allocation is in line with market value. The Hansen decisio n makes it clear that when the property is trading stock, the Commissioner has power to challenge an agreed allocation on the basis it does not reflect market values. No law change seems to be required in this respect. No explicit market value requirement for a purchaser of depreciable property 4.8 The argument is sometimes made that a purchaser of depreciable property in a mixed supply is not subject to a requirement to treat themselves as having acquired that property for an amount based on relative market values at all. This is on the basis that while section EE 45(10) explicitly requires the vendor to treat depreciable property disposed of with other assets as sold for its market value, there is no such provision applying to the purchaser. Using this argument, a purchaser might argue that it could rely on an inappropriately high allocation, based on agreement with the vendor. Place of anti-avoidance rules 4.9 From a policy perspective, anti-avoidance provisions should not be relied on to address the issue. Such rules are a backstop to clear black-letter law. Amending the law creates more certainty than relying on anti-avoidance provisions as specific cases of avoidance need to be identified and the outcomes are subject to litigation uncertainty. Moreover, an anti-avoidance provision cannot be generally used to require parties to use the same allocations when the law does not require consistency other than in specific situations. Feedback Officials seek feedback on: • The issues arising in practice set out in this chapter – in particular, whether there are aspects or issues that have not been taken into account. • Whether there are any additional issues arising in practice with respect to purchase price allocations in mixed supplies. 17 CHAPTER 5 The proposed solutions 5.1 This chapter sets out the proposed solutions. Policy framework 5.2 Officials’ policy framework is that in all cases: • allocations should be based on relative market values, and the Commissioner should have the power to adjust an allocation that is not so based; and • the parties to a mixed supply should adopt the same allocation in their returns, and the Commissioner should be able to readily determine whether or not they have done so. 5.3 This framework is designed to both protect the revenue base and to be fair on the parties to the transaction. As noted in the previous chapters, these outcomes will not necessarily arise in the absence of specific legislative requirements. Outline of proposals 5.4 Officials do not see any need to change the existing substantive rule for trading stock. This rule requires consistency between the vendor and purchaser and allows the vendor to determine the allocation. Obviously, the transaction documents can specify an agreed allocation. This rule covers all assets held on revenue account other than depreciable property and financial arrangements. 5.5 However, discussions with advisors suggest that it may well be necessary to provide some encouragement to purchasers to comply with the existing law in this respect. Many advisors seem unaware of the existence of section EB 24, and current practice in many cases appears to be that purchasers adopt their own allocations of a global price to trading stock with no regard to those adopted by the vendor. 5.6 To increase taxpayer certainty, prevent vendors and purchasers from engaging in allocation practices that adversely impact tax revenue, and minimise administrative costs, we propose to: • extend this consistency requirement to depreciable property and financial arrangements; • provide that purchasers are not entitled to claim any deduction for items acquired in a mixed supply unless they have either followed an agreed allocation or requested the vendor’s allocation. If the vendor has not provided its allocation on a timely basis, then the purchaser may use its allocation, which must also be provided to and adopted by the vendor. 5.7 Prima facie, the vendor would use relative market values to determine the allocation to depreciable property and financial arrangements as with the trading stock rules. 18 Possible alternatives for depreciable property are to use the vendor’s depreciated cost or original cost. 5.8 In all cases, the allocation should be able to be challenged by the Commissioner on the basis that it does not reflect relative market values. There is no need for a challenge by a taxpayer, since taxpayers can decline to enter into an agreement unless and until they are prepared to accept the outcome of the application of the proposed allocat ion rules to their transaction. 5.9 In the remainder of this chapter, we provide more detail about this proposal and how it might work. We also seek feedback on whether there is a better way to achieve consistency. Agreed allocation 5.10 Agreed allocations are commonly adopted in asset sale agreements. The allocat io n may be specified in the agreement, either in specific figures or by way of a formula. Alternatively, the agreement may contain some mechanism for an allocation to be determined (for example, the use of a particular valuer, or some form of arbitration), either before or after the transaction has been agreed to or settled. Whatever mechanism is chosen, if parties agree on an allocation, we propose that the legislation specifically provide that they must follow that allocation in filing their tax returns. This will ensure consistent filing positions. No agreed allocation 5.11 If there is no agreed allocation, the Income Tax Act 2007 already provides that the allocation to trading stock and depreciable property must be determined by the vendor on the basis of relative market values, and in the case of trading stock that it must be adopted by the purchaser. 5.12 We propose that this law be amended in a number of respects, in order to ensure that the consistency clearly envisaged in relation to trading stock is actually achieved, in relation to all of the taxable assets sold. Allocation to depreciable property 5.13 For depreciable property, if there is no agreement as to market value, the treatment of trading stock suggests that the vendor should determine the market value, which the purchaser would be required to follow. However, it may be that the degree of uncertainty as to the market value of depreciable property is greater than it is with most forms of trading stock, and that as a result, leaving the valuation to the determination of the vendor is less acceptable. 5.14 In a situation where the parties are in fact negotiating the allocation, this concern does not seem to stand scrutiny. At the end of the day the allocation is about the post-tax value of the transaction, and any disagreement can be dealt with by an adjustment to price (for example, if the purchaser is concerned that the value allocated to trading stock or depreciable property is too low, it may reduce the price it is prepared to pay). However, in a situation where the parties have agreed the transaction without negotiating the allocation (which is likely to be less common 19 than it is now if there is an explicit consistency requirement), it is more likely that giving the allocation power to the vendor would put the vendor in a much better tax position than the purchaser. 5.15 If this is a concern, a possible alternative for depreciable property where the allocation is not agreed would be to treat it as sold for either its cost to the vendor, or its depreciated value to the vendor. 5.16 Treating the property as sold for original cost would give rise to full depreciation recapture income to the vendor, and depreciation for the purchaser based on the original cost of the depreciable property. It would thus be relatively vendor unfriendly but would ensure that there is no revenue loss from the transaction. 5.17 Treating the property as sold for its depreciated value would give rise to no depreciation recapture adjustment for the vendor. The transaction would have little or no effect on the depreciation claimed on the transacted assets – that is, the amount of depreciation claimed by the purchaser would be the same or similar to the amount the vendor would have claimed if the transaction had not occurred. This is a similar approach to that taken to a sale of depreciable assets between associated parties (section EE 40). The depreciated value would in most cases be a more accurate measure of the value of the assets than original cost, so might be seen as striking a more appropriate balance between the parties, particularly where they did not turn their minds to the allocation before agreeing on the transaction. 5.18 It is not intended that these three alternatives (vendor determination subject to a market value requirement, original cost or depreciated cost) should be optional in any way. Because they are intended to apply if the parties cannot agree, it would not be sensible for some choice to be able to be made between them. We propose that if the parties do not agree an allocation, there would be only one method for allocating the consideration to depreciable property. 5.19 Whichever method is chosen, the Commissioner would retain the ability to challenge a valuation on the basis that it does not reflect relative market values. The purpose of having a single method is to ensure consistent reporting positions, not to provide a safe harbour. Allocation to financial arrangements 5.20 For financial arrangements, the value is likely to be within a relatively narrow range. It may therefore be appropriate to adopt the same approach as is taken for trading stock, that is, relative market value as determined by the vendor. It would not be appropriate to treat financial arrangements as sold for the amount outstanding, as this would not take into account the risk of default by the debtor. Valuer appointed by Commissioner? 5.21 Some submitters suggested that the problem of vendor bias in transactions with no agreed allocation could be addressed by having the Commissioner appoint a valuer to determine the allocation. The cost of this would need to be borne by the parties. 20 5.22 Issues with this suggestion include: • the potential difficulty in finding a qualified valuer prepared to provide a valuat ion. For some assets there is not a wide choice of valuers, and many may see a commercial conflict in acting in such cases; • the risk of judicial review or other forms of litigation by a dissatisfied party; • the need to create a legislative and administrative framework to deal with such a process; and • the cost involved, in cases which may not merit a valuation. 5.23 Official’s judgement is that in cases where the issue is sufficiently material for a valuation by the Commissioner to be justified, it is likely that the parties will have agreed their allocation. Ensuring consistent allocations 5.24 As discussed above, a simple legislative requirement for consistent allocations does not seem to have been entirely effective in the case of trading stock. In order to ensure consistent allocations are actually adopted where there is no agreement between the parties, we propose the following process. 5.25 First, there should be a legislative requirement on the vendor to provide its allocation to the purchaser, with a copy to Inland Revenue. This allocation should have to be provided within a specified period, for example, wit hin three months o f the time when the assets are treated for tax purposes as disposed of by the vendor. This will give the vendor time to complete the allocation, and also give the purchaser time to use the allocation to complete its tax return for the year of the transaction. 5.26 It is necessary to make some provision for what happens if no allocat ion is provided. In that case, we suggest that the purchaser should first be required to request an allocation from the vendor. If no allocation is provided within a defined period from when the request is made, for example, one month, the purchaser would be entitled to make its own allocation on the basis of relative market values, and to provide that allocation to the vendor with a copy to the Commissioner. The purchaser and the vendor would then both be required to use that allocation. The purchaser would not be entitled to a deduction for any element of the purchase price unless and until it first requested an allocation from the vendor, and then (if no vendor allocation was provided) provided its allocation to the vendor and the Commissioner. Contest rights Contest by the Commissioner 5.27 If the Commissioner believes that an allocation does not reflect market values, the Commissioner may decide to issue a NOPA to whichever of the parties has an increased tax obligation as a result of the NOPA. No change is proposed with respect to this process. Suppose that the NOPA is issued to the vendor. If the result of the dispute were an increase in the amount allocated to depreciable property, 21 trading stock or financial instruments, the purchaser should be entitled to request an amended return reflecting that increased amount. Similarly, if the dispute were with the purchaser, the vendor would be entitled to request an amended assessment reflecting the benefit of any decrease in the amount allocated to taxable items. This should all be possible under existing law. Contest by a party 5.28 There will be no need for contest rights if the parties have agreed to an allocation. Where there is no agreement, and the vendor makes the allocation, it is possible that the purchaser may believe that the allocation does not reflect market value. The question that arises is whether it is necessary to provide the purchaser with any right to contest that value, if the Commissioner does not wish to do so. 5.29 There is a strong argument that no such right is needed or appropriate. If the purchaser was concerned about the allocation, it would have ensured that it was agreed. By failing to require agreement, the purchaser has accepted that the vendor is entitled to make the allocation. 5.30 If some contest right is appropriate, there does not seem to be any need for it to involve the Commissioner. The Commissioner is, in this scenario, content to accept the vendor’s allocation. However, she is not well placed to defend that allocation in a dispute process and will often be largely indifferent as to whether the purchaser’s or the vendor’s allocation is adopted, so long as one allocation only is adopted by both parties. Accordingly, officials propose that the parties to a mixed supply would not have the right to issue a NOPA challenging the allocation which is required to be adopted in their returns. 5.31 However, it may be appropriate for the legislation to provide for an implied term, which would give the non-allocating party a contractual right against the allocating party. For example, the allocating party could be under a duty to act reasonably in making its allocat ion. That would give the other party a right to claim damages against the allocating party for any additional tax payable by it as a result of an unreasonable allocation. 5.32 There is precedent for such an implied term in section LP 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. When a company or unit trust pays a supplementary dividend, it is making a non-pro rata payment as between its foreign and its resident shareholders (or unitholders). Ordinarily, this might be a breach of company law, the terms of the shares or the terms of the trust. Section LP 6 approves the payment regardless of these obstacles, unless in the case of a company the constitution specifically over- rides the section. 5.33 In this case, the legislation would effectively give a non-allocating party who wished to dispute an allocation the right to do so directly with the allocating party, rather than with the Commissioner. The outcome if the non-allocating party is successful would not be a change to the tax positions, but a payment for damages. 5.34 If such a term were implied, thought would need to be given as to whether or not it could be over-ridden by agreement. If the objective of implying such a term is to give purchasers (in the usual case of a vendor allocation) so me protection fro m unreasonable vendors, allowing an over-ride would allow that objective to be 22 defeated by vendors who insist on an over-ride. However, not allowing an over-ride would interfere more significantly with parties’ freedom of contract. De minimis 5.35 A concern that has been raised with requiring the purchaser to follow the vendor’s allocation is that some purchasers may not be aware of this requirement at the time they enter into a transaction and assume instead that they will be able to determine the allocation themselves. This might be a concern if the purchaser paid more for the relevant assets than it would have were it aware of the consistency requirement. Ignorance of the proposed statutory consistency requirement would be more likely in lower value transactions. 5.36 On one view, whether or not the purchaser is aware of the rule is unimportant. The loss of tax revenue created by inconsistent allocations is the key issue. While low value transactions may give rise to a lower loss of revenue, there will be more of them. The vendor will need to make an allocation in any case, and there should be little addit ional cost in providing it to the purchaser. The current rule requiring the purchaser to follow the vendor’s allocation in relation to trading stock does not have a de minimis. 5.37 Officials are of the view that it is unlikely that a purchaser sophisticated enough to factor the tax effect of an allocation into its determination of the purchase price would be unaware of a consistency requirement if one were introduced. Potentially relat ively low value sale transactions are already subject to numerous special tax related requirements which vendors and purchasers are required to be aware of, such as: • for residential property, the requirement on the vendor’s agent to pay residential land withholding tax if the vendor is a non-resident and the land is not a main home (subpart RL of the Income Tax Act 2007); and • for commercial property, the compulsory land zero rating rule in section 11(1)(mb) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 5.38 However, if there is a view that purchasers in low value transactions should be protected from an unexpected consistency requirement, the most obvious response is to adopt a de minimis. For example, mixed supplies where the total amount allocated by the purchaser to deductible or depreciable items is less than $50,000 could be excluded from the consistency requirement. This would not affect the obligation to allocate using relative market values. 23 Feedback Officials seek feedback on any aspect of these proposals, but in particular on whether: • a vendor should use relative market value, original cost or depreciated cost in making an allocation to depreciable property; • there is a better way to achieve consistent allocations than that proposed, or what improvements could be made to the proposal; • the proposal for an implied term giving a non-allocating party the right to contest an allocation is useful, and whether or not it should be able to be explicitly negated; • a de minimis would be useful, on what basis, and at what level. 24 CHAPTER 6 Issues to consider 6.1 This chapter discusses a number of issues to consider alongside this proposal: • The effect of the proposal on commercial behaviour. • How the allocation should work in the case of a sale for a bargain price. • How the allocation would work in the case of sales by way of auction or tender. • The degree of consistency that should be required. • Denial of a deduction for purchasers with no valid allocation. Effect of the proposal on commercial behaviour 6.2 An issue raised by the proposal is whether it places an unacceptable amount of discretion in the hands of a vendor. A vendor might, for example, allocate an unduly high amount to land and goodwill, and unduly low amounts to trading stock and depreciable property (though as suggested above, it would be possible to require use of depreciated cost for depreciable property). 6.3 The obvious response is that purchasers who are concerned about this possibility can insist on an agreed allocation. An objection that may be made to this response is that it makes the allocation a point of potential disagreement, and that it is not appropriate for a requirement that exists purely for income tax purposes to potentially impede commercial transactions. In a competitive process, purchasers may not want to raise the allocation issue, for fear that it will make their bid less competitive. 6.4 Officials do not believe that this concern stands up to scrutiny. It is true that as compared to the current position, the proposal will make it much more likely that the parties to a mixed supply will want to discuss the allocation, though this will depend on the materiality of the issue. However, any disagreement as to the allocation can easily be dealt with by an adjustment to the price. Suppose for example that a potential purchaser takes the view that a vendor’s allocation to depreciable property is too low. If the purchaser insists that the allocation be increased, the vendor can do so at no after-tax cost, by simply increasing its asking price, assuming that the allocation was material to the determination of that price. 6.5 The real problem is that under the current system where consistency is not required, the allocation issue is not dealt with. This allows the parties to a mixed supply to take inconsistent positions, to the benefit of themselves but the detriment of taxpayers as a whole. Requiring consistency will remove the tax subsidy that parties adopting inconsistent allocations currently enjoy. In marginal cases, this may mean that a transaction does not go ahead, because the seller and buyer cannot agree on a price in the absence of this tax subsidy. For example, a purchaser may be prepared to pay a certain price for a commercial building on the basis that it will be able to 25 claim depreciation based on a figure for fit-out which is 50% higher than the amount that will be returned by the vendor. If there is a requirement for consistency, the purchaser may reduce the price it is willing to pay, and the vendor may not accept that price. That does not seem an inappropriate outcome. The parties should not be able to use the tax system as a way to bridge the gap between the lowest price the vendor will accept and the highest price the buyer will pay. Sales for a bargain price 6.6 It has sometimes been suggested that adopting an allocation based on relative market values is not appropriate in a situation where there is a fire sale. It is possible for goods to be sold between arm’s length parties at a price that is below a normal market price. 6.7 Officials recognise that a straitened seller may agree to a price below arm’s length. However, they do not agree that a test based on relative market values fails to recognise this possibility. For example, suppose a business is sold in fire sale circumstances for $400,000, where a more orderly sale of the individual components would have yielded $500,000. In that case, depending on the facts it may make sense for the relative market values to be determined by applying a twenty percent discount to all of the values taken into account in arriving at the $500,000 figure. Alternatively, there may be some items that are more liquid, and for which a lower or no discount is appropriate, with a higher discount on others. 6.8 Edge is a good example of such a case, where there was no difficulty in discounting the value of the trading stock to recognise the fact that it was sold in a mortgagee sale. Auctions and tenders 6.9 Not all mixed supplies are a result of a negotiation process. For example, commercial property may be sold by way of auction or tender. It is important that any proposal can be integrated into these common methods of sale. Officials do not anticipate that this will present any significant difficulty. 6.10 Under current law, purchasers of a commercial property at auction or tender will usually not know, at the time they make a bid, precisely what the allocation to fit- out will be, as they will not have had the opportunity to undertake a sufficient ly detailed inspection of the property. This lack of knowledge does not prevent transactions taking place – uncertainty as to the allocation to fit-out is just one of many uncertainties that any purchaser of property inevitably faces. There is no reason to think that if the allocation is determined by the vendor in accordance with relative market values, or in accordance with the vendor’s depreciated cost, that the purchaser will be in a significantly worse position than it is in currently. 6.11 Nevertheless, if purchasers want more certainty about the allocation, it is likely that vendors seeking to maximise the price they can achieve will volunteer the necessary information as part of the selling materials. For example, they may specify that fit- out is estimated to constitute a certain percentage of the value of the property or may disclose the fit-out’s depreciated value. Alternatively, the terms of the auction 26 or tender could provide for an allocation mechanism, for example, for the allocation to be undertaken by an agreed valuer after the winning bidder has been determined. 6.12 Submissions are sought as to whether the proposal is likely to cause any difficulties for commercial transactions, and if so, how it might be modified to address these. Sales involving dealers or other revenue account holders 6.13 When the purchaser in a mixed supply is a dealer, acquiring the property with a dominant purpose 5 of resale, or otherwise ho lds the property on revenue account, prima facie there is no commercial tension in relation to the allocation. The revenue account purchaser is entitled to a deduction for the entire purchase price, so the consistency requirement is not relevant. 6.14 However, an issue arises when a revenue account purchaser acts as a conduit in a transaction that is, in reality, between two non-dealers. A specific anti-abuse rule may be required to ensure that the interposing of the revenue account purchaser is disregarded. Degree of consistency 6.15 There is a question as to the degree of consistency required between the parties. For example, in a sale of a commercial building, would it be adequate to agree an allocation between land, building and fitout, without specifying the allocation between the specific different items o f fit -out? 6.16 While agreement of this kind would be better than no agreement, it can still leave substantial scope for discrepancies. In particular, the vendor may allocate the price so that some depreciable items are sold for more than their cost so as to reduce depreciation recapture on other items. The purchaser may allocate the price in a different way, to items that depreciate at a faster rate. So long as the allocations are within a market value range, the discrepancy would not be able to be challenged. 6.17 Accordingly, officials suggest that to the extent that the vendor treats an item of property as a separate item for taxation purposes (mostly obviously, in a depreciation schedule, or in an IT system for recording financial arrangement income) the parties should be required to agree on the amount allocated to that item. This will not require any additional work for the vendor, since the vendor is separately identifying the item in any case and will have to allocate a portion of the consideration to it. It also should not require any additional work for the purchaser, who will have to set up its own records, or take over those of the vendor. 6.18 This approach should not preclude the purchaser taking a different approach from the vendor to the classificat ion of depreciable items. The issue is not the classification of the items, but the amount of the purchase price allocated to them. 6.19 For example, suppose that a vendor of a commercial building has made no distinction for depreciation purposes between items A, B and C, treating them as a single asset depreciated at a single rate. However, the purchaser intends to split out 5 Or, in the case of land, a purpose of resale. 27 item C, and depreciate it at a higher rate than items A and B. That should not be problematic in any way, so long as the total amount allocated by the purchaser to the three items is the same as the amount the vendor has allocated to them. Denial of a deduction for purchasers who disregard the law 6.20 It appears that many advisors were not aware of the existence of section EB 24 and the requirement for a consistent allocation of trading stock between the vendor and purchaser in a mixed supply. Even where there is an existing legislative requirement for a consistent allocation, purchaser tax returns have in many cases been prepared simply on the basis of the purchaser’s own allocation. This suggests a need to develop rules which not only require consistency as a matter of law but encourage voluntary compliance so far as possible. 6.21 We therefore consider there is a need for an explicit legislative rule that denies a purchaser in a mixed supply a deduction for any amount paid, unless that amount has been determined on the basis of the rules set out in this proposal. This means there would be no right to a deduction unless it was based on: • an agreed allocation; • in the absence of agreement, the allocation provided by the vendor, based either on the vendor’s assessment of market value, or the vendor’s original cost or depreciated value; • only if the purchaser has requested the vendor’s allocation and not received it, the purchaser’s allocation – in which case the vendor would also be required to use the purchaser’s allocation. 6.22 Such a rule would make it clear to those preparing tax returns that they need to actually obtain an allocation that ensures consistency and would enable them to make this requirement clear to their clients. It would also make it easier for the Commissioner to deal with situations where taxpayers have not attempted to comply with the law. 6.23 Such a rule would need to allow for the purchaser to claim a deduction in a later year once it has the vendor’s allo cation or has properly provided its own, and subject to continuity of ownership requirements. Feedback • Officials seek submissions on the issues discussed in this chapter, and whether there are any other issues that need to be considered in developing a proposal to require as much consistency as practicabl e between vendor and purchaser in mixed supply price allocations. 28 APPENDIX Other countries’ requirements Australia For tax and accounting reasons, the parties are encouraged by their advisors to agree in their sale and purchase agreement on an allocation of this price across the business assets being purchased/sold. For tax purposes the amount allocated to the asset is generally the allocation agreed by the parties. This is generally acceptable to the tax authorities because it’s recognised that there is a natural tension between the parties. There is an incentive for the vendor to allocate proceeds to CGT assets, and for the purchaser to maximise the amount allocated to plant and equipment which is depreciable. However, the tax authorities can replace this allocation by a “market value consideration” under the market value substitution rule, if they do not consider the value to be a fair reflection of market value. This might arise, for example, if the parties are related. The Australian Tax Office has provided general guidance on assessing market value for various tax purposes. If the parties cannot agree an allocation, they can apply to the Commissioner for Taxation for a private binding ruling on an acceptable market value. Canada In some cases, the sale and purchase agreement sets out the price for each asset, a value for the inventory and any goodwill. If there is no agreement then the purchaser has to determine how to allocate, and these amounts should coincide with the amounts the seller determined when reporting the sale. The amount allocated should be its fair market value. While purchasers and sellers will have their own preferences as to how the purchase price is to be allocated, both parties must ensure that any allocation is reasonable and based on the actual value of the assets included in the deal. Anti-avoidance rules in the Income Tax Act give the Canada Revenue Agency the authorit y to impose its own allocation of the purchase price such that the consideration paid is a reasonable reflection of the actual value in the circumstances. These are designed to overcome non-arms-length allocations. Where there is genuine bargaining between the buyer and seller the CRA will accept the parties’ allocation as prima facie proof that an allocation is reasonable. Accounting valuations may vary from allocations for tax purposes. United States Companies are required to complete a purchase price allocation for all transactions involving a change of control to determine the purchaser’s basis and the seller’s gain or loss. Section 1060 of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Code provides detailed procedures for 29 completing the allocation. This can vary from the accounting standards allocation through the exclusion of certain transaction costs, deferred taxes and accrued liabilities, and how assumed debt is measured. For tax law the assumed value of the property transferred is fair market value which is defined as the price at which property would exchange between a willing buyer and willing seller. Where the parties have agreed the allocation, or their fair market value, they are bound to use it for tax purposes unless the IRS determines that such an allocation, or fair market value, is not appropriate. There are prescriptive valuation requirements, such as when assets are acquired at bargain prices. For tax purposes the consideration paid is allocated amongst the net assets acquired based on a class system of asset categories in a process known as the residual method. If the aggregate purchase price allocable to a particular class of assets is less than the aggregate fair market value of the assets within the class (as would be the case with a bargain purchase), each asset in the class is allocated an amount in proportion to its fair market value, with nothing allocated to a junior class (goodwill is the most junior class). United Kingdom For tax purposes, it is necessary to apportion the total consideration of the transaction among the assets acquired. The parties to the transaction are encouraged by their advisers to specify the allocation in the sale and purchase agreement. That allocation is normally acceptable for tax purposes, provided it is commercially justifiable. Two statutory rules impact on the allocation. The first stipulates that the open-market value of trading stock must be substituted in calculating the profits of the seller unless the purchaser acquires the stock for their own trade. The second requires that the purchaser’s cost of acquisition and the seller’s disposal proceeds for capital allowance purposes be calculated through a just apportionment of the total consideration. Since 1 April 2014 the buyer of a building that contains fixtures can only claim plant and machinery allowances if the expenditure is pooled before the sale. The seller and the buyer must either formally agree a value for fixtures within two years of transfer or start formal proceedings to agree the value within that time. If the two parties cannot agree an apportionment, either can apply to the first-tier tribunal to decide the value of the fixture(s).

Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 3 of 32 1 3 December 2018 Minister o f Finance Minister of Revenue Options for taxing the digital economy Executive summary 1.The purpose of this report is to advise Minsters on options for taxing the digital economy, and in particular, whether New Zealand should adopt a digital services tax (DST). 2.There has been significant international concern over the ability of highly digitalised companies to derive significant income from a country without being liable for income tax there. This is mostly caused by deficiencies in the current international tax framework, which has not kept up with digitalisation and other modern business developments. This under-taxation of the digital economy threatens the sustainability of Government revenues and public perceptions of the fairness of the tax system. It also provides a competitive advantage to overseas digital companies compared to local businesses, which are subject to full income tax. 3.We currently consider that changing the international tax framework is the best option for taxing the digital economy in the long-term. Accordingly, New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD discussions on this, with a view to supporting an agreed solution (bear ing in mind its effect on our exporters). There are 3 proposals being considered at the OECD: •A limited proposal for digital services only, focussing on social media, digital advertising, multi-sided platforms and data. This is the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) proposal. •A broader proposal, which would allow greater taxing rights to market countries (such as New Zealand) based on certain “market intangibles” created there by multinationals ( including brands and trade names used in the country, customer data and customer relationships). This is the United States proposal and would apply beyond the digital economy. •A minimum tax proposal suggested by France and Germany. This proposal would apply beyond the digital economy and would be targeted at a multinational’s transactions with related parties in low tax jurisdictions. 4.The OECD is aiming to get G20 approval of its preferred proposals in June 2019 (we attach an article which has a good description of the OECD’s approach). We consider it more likely than not that the OECD will be successful in achieving an international solution, but there is no guarantee of this. Accordingly, we recommend the Government also consider whether a digital services tax (DST) might be appropriate as an interim measure. This DST would be like the one proposed by the UK and would apply to online advertising, social media, intermediation platforms (like Uber, eBay and Airbnb) and the sale of data. We note a DST does have significant downsides, which would need to be carefully assessed and explored. 5.To commence, we recommend the Government publishes a discussion document in the first half of 2019 to get public feedback on the options for taxing the digital economy (being the international solution discussed at the OECD and a DST). We recommend the discussion document make it clear that: Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 4 of 32 •th e Government has not yet decided whether it wants to introduce a DST, but is considering this as an option; •any DST would only be introduced if the OECD is unable to arrive at an international solution in a reasonable time-frame and a critical mass of other countries also adopt DSTs; and •the DST would be an interim measure that would cease to apply once an international solution was fully implemented. 6.The Australian Government has also issued a discussion document on options for taxing the digital economy, which takes a similar approach. 7.If you agree with this approach, we would aim to release a discussion document to seek public feedback in the first half of 2019 (following approval by Cabinet). We would report back to you on this feedback in the second half of 2019, together with final policy recommendations. At that stage we will be in a better position to provide a timeline for further steps, including legislation if the decision is made to proceed with a DST. 8.The current problem with taxing the digital economy only relates to income tax. The Government has already acted to ensure that the digital economy will be fully subject to New Zealand GST. GST has been applied to ‘remote’ services since 2016 (including digital services), and the Government has announced its intention to charge GST on low-value imported goods from 1 October 2019. Recommended action 9.We recommend that you: (a)Agree that New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD discussions, with a view to supporting a long-term solution to the taxation of the digital economy ( bearing in mind its effect on our exporters). Agreed/Not agreed Agreed/Not agreed (b)Agree that the Government should also start considering a possible DST as an option for taxing the digital economy, in case the OECD are unable to achieve an international solution in a reasonable timeframe. Agreed/No t agreed Agreed/Not agreed (c)Direct o fficials to draft a discussion document for release in the first half of 2019 to get public feedback on these options for taxing the digital economy (the international solution and the DST). In relation to the DST, the discussion document should state that: •the DST would be like the one proposed by the UK; •the Government has not yet decided whether it wants to introduce a DST but is considering it as an option; Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 5 of 32 •a ny DST would only be introduced if the OECD is unable to arrive at an international solution in a reasonable timeframe and a critical mass of other countries also adopt DSTs; and •the DST would be an interim measure that would cease to apply if an international solution was fully implemented. Agreed/No t agreed Agreed/Not agreed Matt Cowan Ca rmel Peters Team Leader, Tax Strategy Team Manager, Policy and Strategy The Treasury Inland Revenue Hon Gra nt Robertson Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue / /2018 / /2018 Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 6 of 32 Background 10.There has been significant international concern recently over the ability of highly digitalised companies to derive significant income from a country without being liable for income tax there. This is also an issue for New Zealand. 11.The value of cross border digital services provided to New Zealand consumers is estimated to be approximately $2.7 billion in 2018, and this market is expected to continue growing. For online advertising, the New Zealand market for 2017 was $923 million, which was 36% of New Zealand’s advertising market. The total size of New Zealand’s e-commerce market is hard to ascertain, but a rough estimate is $26 billion in total, with supplies from offshore worth $11.5 billion. 12.The current problem with taxing the digital economy relates to income tax, rather than GST. GST has been applied to ‘remote’ services since 2016 (including digital services), and the Government has announced its intention to charge GST on low- value imported goods from 1 October 2019. 13.We previously reported on the digital economy in IR2017/657 and IR 2018/200. The problem 14.The main problem is that the current international tax framework has not kept up with modern business practices, particularly digitalisation. In particular: •Digital companies can transact with customers over the internet without having the physical presence required by double tax agreements (DTAs) for income tax to be charged in the country. •Even if a digital company does have a taxable presence in a country, the profit allocation rules do not recognise the new kinds of value that are generated by digital companies in that country. •Much of the value of digital companies is attributable to intangible assets. These intangibles are hard to value. They are also mobile, meaning the income attributable to them can be easily moved to low tax jurisdictions. We note this is also an issue for the taxation of some non-digital companies. 15.The result of this is that digital companies can participate significantly in the economic life of a country, without being liable for any income tax there. 16.This under-taxation of the digital economy threatens the sustainability of Government revenues and public perceptions of the fairness of the tax system. It also provides a competitive advantage to overseas digital companies compared to local businesses, which are subject to full income tax. Options for solving the problem 17.There are two options for solving the problem. One is to change the current international income tax framework. The other is to apply a separate tax (usually called an equalisation tax, or a digital services tax) to digital transactions. Changing the international framework 18.Changing the international framework is generally agreed by countries to be the best long-term solution to the taxation of the digital economy. However, it requires changes to existing DTAs and international standards. Accordingly, New Zealand cannot change this framework by itself - it requires multilateral agreement. Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 7 of 32 1 9.Countries are currently discussing possible changes to address the problems with the international framework at the OECD. There are 3 proposals being considered: •A limited proposal for digital services only, focussing on social media, digital advertising, multi-sided platforms and data. This is consistent with how the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) have proposed addressing the issue. •A broader proposal, which would allow greater taxing rights to market countries (such as, New Zealand) based on certain “market intangibles” created there by multinationals. These are intangibles that relate to marketing activities in the country, or which aid in the commercial exploitation of a product or service or have an important promotional value (such as brands and trade names used in a country, customer data, customer relationships and customer lists). This is how the United States (US) has proposed addressing the issue. This approach would apply beyond the digital economy, but we expect it to be targeted at large companies with significant intangible value in market jurisdictions. •A minimum tax proposal suggested by France and Germany. This proposal would apply beyond the digital economy and would be targeted at a multinational’s transactions with related parties in low tax jurisdictions. This proposal addresses some remaining base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) issues and is not specifically directed at the digital economy (although it would also apply to digital companies). This proposal is independent of the first two, and so could apply in addition to one of them 20.Neither of the first two proposals would require a digital company to have a physical presence in a market country. Accordingly, both proposals should allow New Zealand to tax highly digitalised companies on their sales income here (with the second proposal also allowing us to tax other multinationals with significant local marketing intangibles). The OECD is also discussing whether the first two proposals could be combined. 21.The OECD’s proposals would potentially apply to the 124 countries forming part of its wider Inclusive Framework (which includes China and India), plus any other countries which elected to adopt them. 22.There is still disagreement at the OECD on what should be done. However, countries have committed to reaching consensus on an international solution by 2020 and the OECD is putting a significant amount of effort into achieving this. Progress is being made and there is a real possibility that the OECD will be successful, . But it is still too early to tell. 23.The OECD is aiming for G20 approval of its preferred proposals in June 2019 . If this occurs, it is likely that an international solution can be achieved in 2020. Accordingly, we should have a better idea of the likelihood of an international solution after the June G20 meeting. Even if an international solution is achieved in 2020, it could still take 3-4 years for the solution to be designed in detail at the OECD and implemented. A digital services tax 24.The other option for taxing the digital economy is to introduce a special tax, called a “digital services tax”, or DST. A DST is targeted at certain digital companies and is not an “income tax” for DTA purposes. This means a DST is not subject to the current international tax framework, and so it can be charged to digital companies regardless of whether they have a physical presence in a country. Consequently, Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 s 6(a) Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 8 of 32 c ountries can introduce a DST unilaterally, without the need for international agreement. 25.The UK recently announced it would introduce a separate 2% DST on the profits of certain digital companies that would apply from April 2020. Spain, Italy and India have also enacted or announced DSTs (although India’s has a much narrower scope than the others). The EU Commission has proposed a 3% DST for Europe, however it has not been able to achieve the support of all EU members. The EU’s original proposal has recently been replaced with a narrower DST only targeting online advertising, which EU members will consider early in 2019. This narrower DST is proposed to apply only in the event that an international solution cannot be achieved at the OECD. 26.The DST is quite controversial (it was not recommended by the OECD due to a lack of consensus), but we expect at least some additional EU countries to enact one even if the EU as a whole does not. In addition, Australia issued a consultation paper on taxing the digital economy in October 2018, which included discussion of a possible DST (among other options for taxing the digital economy). 27.The DSTs proposed so far (other than India’s, which was introduced before the recent international interest in taxing the digital economy) share a set of common features. They are flat taxes charged at a low rate (2%-3%) on gross revenues from certain digital platforms. These are digital platforms whose value is dependent on the size and active contribution of their user base – for example, intermediation platforms like Uber and eBay; social media platforms like Facebook; and content sharing sites like YouTube or Instagram (although the EU’s latest proposal only targets online advertising). 28.This means a DST is narrowly targeted at certain highly digitalised business models. It would not apply to sales of goods or services (other than advertising or data) over the internet. So, it would not apply to Netflix for example, or to goods sold online by Apple or Amazon. It also would not apply to the kinds of digital services typically exported by New Zealand (such as accountancy services). 29.A DST is levied by reference to where the users of the digital platform are located rather than where payments are made. To achieve this, an affected digital company’s consolidated global gross revenues are apportioned between the relevant country and the rest of the world by reference to the proportion of global users in that country. The revenue attributable to that country is then subject to the DST. 30.For example, suppose a digital company had $10 billion of total gross global revenue and 5% of its total global users in State A. The revenue attributable to State A would be $10 billion x 5% = $500 million. State A would then charge 3% tax on its allocated $500 million of revenues, for total tax of $15 million. In calculating this tax, it is only the location of the users that is relevant, not the location of the customers paying the digital company for its services. Therefore the $15 million DST would still be charged even if no actual payments were made to the digital company from State A. 31.For New Zealand, a DST would be a way of collecting some tax from some digital companies (but not all of them) that have been paying little tax either here or overseas. As a rough estimate, we expect a 3% DST would raise between $30m and $80m of tax 1 , depending in part on its scope and design. A DST would also significantly improve public confidence in the fairness of the tax system, which is an important factor underlying voluntary compliance. In addition, the size of the 1 This is based on a rough bottom-up estimate of what we think a DST would raise in New Zealand, combined with top down estimates based on what the EU and UK have forecast their DSTs to raise, adjusted for differences in GDP and exchange rates. Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 9 of 32 d igital economy is growing as a proportion of the total economy. Consequently, it will become increasingly important for New Zealand to tax it appropriately. 32.However, there are issues with a DST. These include: •The consistency of the tax with other tax settings. The DST may not mesh well with other elements of our tax system. This might result in some double taxation of compliant firms (including possibly some domestic firms) and taxation of businesses with losses. •The economic incidence of the tax. The issue here is whether the tax would be passed along by the non-resident suppliers to New Zealand customers. We expect around half of the cost of the tax could be passed on to customers, based on the limited evidence available. •The effect on New Zealand’s reputation as a good place to do business. New Zealand is a small open economy and we compete for capital with the rest of the world. That means we want New Zealand to be an attractive place for non-residents to do business. •The potential effect on our export sector. The implications of adopting a DST for our export sector would need to be considered. Some trading partners, , might raise concerns should New Zealand introduce a DST. Members of the US Congress and US technology industry have previously claimed DST proposals by the UK and the European Commission would lead to double taxation, and that proposed turnover thresholds would amount to discrimination against US companies in breach of World Trade Organization national treatment provisions. •The period of time for which a DST would be applicable. The OECD expects that any DSTs would be repealed once a multilateral solution is achieved. Other countries that have recently proposed DSTs have also agreed with this. Accordingly, if agreement was reached quickly at the OECD, then it may not be worth designing a DST that would only apply for a short period of time. •The administration and compliance costs of introducing a new tax. This is particularly an issue given that a DST is not expected to raise significant revenue. In addition, given a DST would be expected to (at least predominantly) apply to companies outside of New Zealand, there are fewer tools available to Inland Revenue to enforce the tax.

Continue participating in the OECD discussions 33.We currently consider that changing the international tax framework, if possible, would be the best option for taxing the digital economy in the long term. It would integrate the taxation of these companies into the income tax system, and so avoid the need for a separate DST with all its attendant issues (as discussed above). At this stage, we also expect this option to benefit New Zealand overall. This is because New Zealand imports more highly digitalised services than it exports. However, we will need to wait until the proposals are developed in more detail before we can come to any firm conclusions about this. 34.Therefore, we recommend New Zealand continue to participate in the OECD discussions, with a view to supporting an international solution (bearing in mind its effect on our export sector). Commence formal consideration of a DST in the interim 35.Th ere may be benefits in adopting a DST in the following circumstances: •the OECD cannot achieve an international solution in a reasonable timeframe (as any DST would need to be repealed once that solution was achieved); •a critical mass of other countries also adopts a DST, particularly Australia (to reduce the reputational risks of adopting a DST); •New Zealand companies are not unduly affected by the DST; and •the DST will not just be passed on to New Zealand consumers. 36.This evaluation is also consistent with the Tax Working Group’s recommendations on a DST in their interim report. 37.We recommend that the Government start considering a DST as another option for taxing the digital economy. T o commence, we recommend publishing a discussion document. This will also help to identify some of the advantages and disadvantages of a DST, and so will put the Government in a better position to subsequently decide whether it should introduce one. Contents of the discussion document 38.The discussion document should broadly outline the two options for taxing the digital economy – namely an OECD led international solution, and a unilateral DST. The DST proposed should include the common features discussed above. In addition, we understand that the OECD is planning to publicly consult on its proposed international solutions in February 2019. Accordingly, the discussion document can also describe the OECD’s proposed options in detail and invite feedback to the Government on them. We suggest the discussion document be framed as exploring the options (as with the Australian discussion document on the digital economy), rather than consulting on a preferred approach. 39.We also recommend that the discussion document make it clear that: •the Government has not yet decided to whether to introduce a DST, but is considering it as an option; Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 11 of 32 •th e DST would only be introduced in the event the OCED is unable to reach an international solution in a reasonable timeframe and a critical mass of other countries also adopt DSTs; and •The tax would be repealed when an international solution was fully implemented. Consultation 40.We consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on this report. 41. 42. Next steps 43.If you agree, we would aim to publish a discussion document for public consultation in the first half of 2019 (following Cabinet approval). We would report back to you on the consultation, together with final policy recommendations, in the second half of 2019. 44.The subsequent steps will depend in part on developments at the OECD (particularly whether the G20 endorse the OECD’s preferred proposals in June 2019), and on the work programme adopted by the Government following the Tax Working Group’s final report. We will be in a better position to provide you with a timeline for these subsequent steps when we report back in the second half of 2019.

That report recommended the preparation of a Government discussion document on the different options, including a digital services tax. The recommendation to prepare a discussion document requires approval by Cabinet. 2.We provided you with a first draft of the Cabinet paper requesting approval to prepare the discussion document on 25 January. Following feedback from you and your offices, we now attach an updated draft of the Cabinet paper. We also attach a version of the Cabinet paper showing the redactions we propose to make to it for its proactive release. Please let us know by Friday 1 February 2019 if you would like any changes made to this draft or the proposed redactions. 3.Since we reported to you in December, the OECD has agreed to consider another proposal for taxing the digital economy. This proposal seems to provide for formulary apportionment of a multinational’s profit to market countries, based on certain metrics such as sales and user participation. The proposal would require the multinational to have a significant economic presence in the country (which need not be physical) and could involve withholding taxes. We have included this pr oposal in the Cabinet paper. 4.The next steps are set out in the table below.

This discussion document could be released together with the Government’s response to the Tax Working Group’s final report, . Feedback from the discussion document will be used to help formulate the best policy for taxing the digital economy. Executive Summary 2.The Government will consider several measures recommended by the Tax Working Group (TWG) to improve the structure, fairness, and sustainability of the tax system. This includes a broad extension of capital income taxation, which will primarily affect New Zealand businesses and investments. However, it is important to also ensure that multinational companies pay their fair share of tax in New Zealand. 3.A major issue with the taxation of multinationals is the ability of highly digitalised companies to derive significant income from a country without being liable for income tax there. This is an issue both globally and in New Zealand. This issue is mostly caused by deficiencies in the current international tax rules, which have not kept up with digitalisation and other modern business developments. This under-taxation of the digital economy threatens the sustainability of Government revenues and the fairness of the tax system. It also provides a competitive advantage to overseas digital multinationals compared to local businesses, which are subject to full income tax. 4.We currently consider that changing the international income tax rules is the best option for taxing the digital economy in the long-term. These rules are contained in New Zealand’s double tax agreements and in various internationally agreed standards. This means New Zealand cannot change the international tax rules on its own – it requires international agreement. Accordingly, New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD discussions on this, with a view to supporting an agreed solution (bearing in mind its effect on our exporters). There are two broad measures being considered at the OECD: A measure to allocate greater taxing rights over a multinational’s profits to market countries. The measure would not require the multinational to have a 1 3yt93958al 2019-03-04 11:39:53 s 9(2)(f)(iv) 3. Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 19 of 32 IN CONFIDENCE physical presence in the country. There are 3 proposals being considered for this purpose (only one of which would be adopted): oA limited proposal for digital services only, focussing on social media, digital advertising, multi-sided platforms and data. This is the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) proposal. oA broader proposal, which would allow greater taxing rights to market countries (such as New Zealand) based on certain “marketing intangibles” created there by multinationals. This is the United States proposal and would apply beyond the digital economy. oA proposal which seems to provide for apportionment of a multinational’s profit to market countries under an agreed formula, which would be based on certain factors such as sales and user participation. This proposal could extend beyond the digital economy A minimum tax measure suggested by France and Germany. This proposal would apply beyond the digital economy and would ensure that multinationals pay a minimum level of tax on profits earned in low tax jurisdictions. 5.The OECD is aiming to obtain G20 approval of its preferred measures in June 2019. We consider it more likely than not that the OECD will be successful in achieving an international solution, but there is no guarantee of this. Accordingly, we recommend the Government actively consider introducing a DST as an interim measure. This DST should initially be designed to be like the one proposed by the UK (as the UK’s proposed DST is the most advanced and is likely to influence other countries’ DSTs, ) and would apply to online advertising, social media, intermediation platforms (like Uber, eBay and Airbnb) and the sale of data. We note a DST does have significant downsides, which would need to be carefully assessed and explored. We also see real benefits to aligning New Zealand’s position on a DST with Australia’s. 6.To commence, we recommend the Government publishes a discussion document to obtain public feedback on the options for taxing the digital economy (being the international solution discussed at the OECD and a DST). We recommend the discussion document make it clear that: The Government is determined to ensure that multinational companies pay their fair share of tax in New Zealand. The Government is actively considering introducing a DST in advance of an international solution. While New Zealand is committed to finding a solution at the OECD, if sufficient progress is not made this year, a DST is a credible option. The DST would be an interim measure that would cease to apply once an international solution was adopted. We would aim to design the DST so it is fully consistent with New Zealand’s international obligations (which we expect to be possible). 2 3yt93958al 2019-03-04 11:39:53 s 6(a) Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 s 6(a) Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 20 of 32 IN CONFIDENCE The Government sees real benefits in aligning New Zealand’s position on a DST with Australia’s. 7.The Australian Government has also issued a discussion document on options for taxing the digital economy, which takes a similar approach. Consultation closed for this on 30 November 2018. 8.We consider that measures to address this issue should be combined with the TWG measures adopted by the Government, so that the Government can present a comprehensive package of reforms to improve the New Zealand tax system. To this end, the digital economy discussion document could be released together with the Government’s response to the Tax Working Group’s final report, . We would report back to Cabinet on this feedback in the second half of 2019, together with final policy recommendations. At that stage we will be in a better position to provide a timeline for further steps, including legislation if the decision is made to proceed with a DST. Background 9.The Government commissioned the TWG to recommend measures to improve the structure, fairness, balance and sustainability of the tax system. The TWG provided its final report in January 2019. We are also reporting to Cabinet on the TWG report contemporaneously with this paper. 10. The concrete measures recommended by the TWG report are mostly focussed on the taxation of New Zealanders. However, the Government must also ensure that multinationals pay a fair share of tax in New Zealand. The Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act (BEPS Act) we enacted in 2018 prevented multinationals from using various strategies to avoid paying their fair share of tax in New Zealand. However, a significant outstanding issue is the taxation of digital multinationals operating in New Zealand. 11. The digital economy in New Zealand is significant and growing, with non-residents making up a large portion. The value of cross border digital services provided to New Zealand consumers was estimated to be approximately $2.7 billion in 2018, and this market is expected to continue growing. For online advertising, the New Zealand market for 2017 was $923 million, which was 36% of New Zealand’s advertising market. It is not clear exactly what proportion of online advertising is supplied by non-residents, but it is likely to be between 60% - 75%. The total size of New Zealand’s e-commerce market is hard to ascertain, but a rough estimate for 2018 is $26 billion in total, with supplies from offshore worth $11.5 billion. Analysis The problem 12. The main problem is that the current international tax framework has not kept up with modern business practices, particularly digitalisation. In particular: Digital companies can deal with customers over the internet without having the physical presence required by double tax agreements (DTAs) for income tax to be charged in the country. 3 3yt93958al 2019-03-04 11:39:53 s 9(2)(f)(iv) Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 21 of 32 IN CONFIDENCE Even if a digital company does have a taxable presence in a country, the current internationally agreed rules for attributing the digital company’s profit to the country do not recognise the new kinds of value that are generated by digital companies in that country. Much of the value of digital companies is attributable to non-physical, intangible assets, like patents and trademarks. These assets are hard to value. They are also mobile, meaning they can be used to shift income to low tax jurisdictions. This is also an issue for the taxation of some non-digital companies. 13. The result of this is that digital companies can participate significantly in the economic life of a country, without being liable for any income tax there. 14. This under-taxation of the digital economy is a significant problem. It threatens the sustainability of Government revenues and public perceptions of the fairness of the tax system. It also provides a competitive advantage to overseas digital companies compared to local businesses, which are subject to full income tax. 15. The current problem with taxing the digital economy relates to income tax, rather than GST. GST has been applied to ‘remote’ services since 2016 (including digital services), and the Government has announced its intention to charge GST on low- value imported goods from 1 October 2019. 16. A diverted profits tax, of the kind adopted by Australia and the UK, would not solve the current problems with taxing the digital economy. This is because a diverted profits tax (like our recent BEPS Act) basically prevents multinationals from avoiding a country’s existing income tax rules. However, taxing the digital economy requires a fundamental change to those rules. Options for solving the problem 17. There are two options for solving the problem. One is to change the current international income tax rules, which have been agreed to by countries. The other is to apply a separate DST to digital transactions. Changing the internationally agreed income tax rules 18. Changing the internationally agreed income tax rules is generally agreed by countries to be the best long-term solution to the taxation of the digital economy. However, it requires changes to existing DTAs and international standards. Accordingly, New Zealand cannot change this framework by itself - it requires multilateral agreement. 19. Countries are currently discussing possible changes to address the problems with the international income tax rules at the OECD. There are two measures being considered: A measure to allocate greater taxing rights over a multinational’s profits to market countries. The measure would not require the multinational to have a physical presence in the country. There are 3 proposals being considered for this purpose (only one of which would be adopted): 4 3yt93958al 2019-03-04 11:39:53 Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 22 of 32 IN CONFIDENCE oA limited proposal for digital services only, focussing on social media, digital advertising, multi-sided platforms and data. This is consistent with how the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) have proposed addressing the issue multilaterally. oA broader proposal, which would allow greater taxing rights to market countries (such as, New Zealand) based on certain “marketing intangibles” created there by multinationals. These are non-physical intangible assets that relate to marketing activities in the country, or which aid in the commercial exploitation of a product or service or have an important promotional value (such as brands and trade names used in a country, customer data, customer relationships and customer lists). This is how the United States (US) has proposed addressing the issue. This approach would apply beyond the digital economy, but we expect it to be targeted at large companies with significant intangible assets in market jurisdictions. oA proposal which seems to provide for apportionment of a multinational’s profit to market countries, based on a formula that would take into account factors like sales and user participation. The measure would require the multinational to have a significant economic presence in the country (which need not be physical) and could involve withholding taxes. This proposal could apply beyond the digital economy A minimum tax proposal suggested by France and Germany. This proposal would apply beyond the digital economy and would ensure that multinationals pay a minimum level of tax on profits earned in low tax jurisdictions. This proposal addresses some remaining base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) issues and is not specifically directed at the digital economy (although it would also apply to digital companies). 20. These measures should address the current problems with taxing the digital economy. 21. There is still disagreement at the OECD on what should be done. However, countries have committed to reaching consensus on an international solution by 2020 and the OECD is putting a significant amount of effort into achieving this. Progress is being made and there is a real possibility that the OECD will be successful, especially now that the US supports a solution. But it is still too early to tell. 22. The OECD is aiming for G20 approval of its preferred measures in June 2019 If this occurs, it is likely that an international solution can be achieved in 2020. Accordingly, we should have a better idea of the likelihood of an international solution after the June G20 meeting. If an international solution is achieved in 2020, it could take 3-4 years for the solution to be designed in detail at the OECD and implemented. 5 3yt93958al 2019-03-04 11:39:53 Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 s 6(a) Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 23 of 32 IN CONFIDENCE A digital services tax 23. The other option for taxing the digital economy is to introduce a separate DST. A DST is targeted at certain highly digitalised companies and is not an “income tax” for DTA purposes. This means countries can introduce a DST unilaterally, without the need for international agreement. A DST applies even if the digital company does not have a physical presence in the country. 24. The UK recently announced it would introduce a 2% DST from April 2020. Spain, Italy, France, Austria, and India have also enacted or announced DSTs (although India’s has a narrower scope than the others). The EU Commission has proposed a 3% DST for Europe, however it has not been able to achieve the support of all EU members. In addition, Australia issued a consultation paper on taxing the digital economy in October 2018, which included discussion of a possible DST (among other options for taxing the digital economy). 25. The DSTs proposed so far generally share a set of common features. They are flat taxes charged at a low rate (2%-3%) on gross revenues from certain digital platforms that are attributable to the users in the relevant country. The DSTs apply to digital platforms whose value is dependent on the size and active contribution of their user base – for example, intermediation platforms like Uber and eBay; social media platforms like Facebook; and content sharing sites like YouTube or Instagram (although the EU’s latest proposal only targets online advertising). 26. This means a DST is narrowly targeted at certain highly digitalised business models. It would not apply to sales of goods or services (other than advertising or data) over the internet. So, it would not apply to Netflix for example, or to goods sold online by Apple or Amazon. It also would not apply to the kinds of digital services typically exported by New Zealand (such as accountancy services). 27. For New Zealand, a DST would be a way of collecting some tax from some digital multinationals (but not all of them) that have been paying little tax either here or overseas. As a rough estimate, we expect a 3% DST would raise between $30m and $80m of tax, depending in part on its scope and design. The small size of this figure compared to the size of New Zealand’s digital economy as a whole (as discussed in paragraph 11) reflects the narrow scope of a DST – it is targeted at certain highly digitalised business models, and so does not apply to a large portion of the digital economy. 28. A DST may also improve public confidence in the fairness of the tax system, which is an important factor supporting voluntary compliance. In addition, the size of the digital economy is growing as a proportion of the total economy. Consequently, it will become increasingly important for New Zealand to tax it appropriately. Therefore, we consider a DST to be a credible option for taxing the digital economy. We also see real benefits in aligning New Zealand’s position on a DST with Australia’s. 29. However, there are issues with a DST that would need to be carefully worked through in deciding whether to adopt one, including consideration of consistency with New Zealand’s international trade obligations and double tax agreements as well as the potential reactions of trading partners, including with respect to treatment of New Zealand exporters under their domestic tax and other laws. 6 3yt93958al 2019-03-04 11:39:53 Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 24 of 32 IN CONFIDENCE The Tax Working Group 30. The TWG also considered the taxation of the digital economy. In its final report, the TWG concluded that New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD discussions on changing the internationally agreed income tax rules, but should also stand ready to implement a DST if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction, and it is reasonably certain the New Zealand’s export industries will not be materially impacted by any retaliatory measures. What should New Zealand do? Continue participating in the OECD discussions 31. We currently consider that changing the internationally agreed income tax rules, if possible, would be the best option for taxing the digital economy in the long term. It would integrate the taxation of these companies into the income tax system, and so avoid the need for a separate DST with all its attendant issues. We also expect this option to benefit New Zealand overall, however, we will need to wait until the OECD’s proposals are developed in more detail before we can come to any firm conclusions about this. Therefore, we recommend New Zealand continue to participate in the OECD discussions, with a view to supporting an international solution (bearing in mind its effect on our export sector). This was also the recommendation of the TWG in its interim report. Commence formal consideration of a DST in the interim 32. We need to ensure that multinationals are fairly-taxed in New Zealand. Therefore, while we prefer an international solution, we need to consider a DST as an option in case this cannot be achieved in a reasonable time frame. In this regard, there may be benefits in adopting a DST as an interim measure in advance of an OECD solution if: the OECD cannot make sufficient progress on an international solution this year; a critical mass of other countries also adopts a DST, particularly Australia (to reduce the reputational risks of adopting a DST); New Zealand companies are not unduly affected by the DST; and the DST will not just be passed on to New Zealand consumers. 33. This is broadly consistent with the TWG’s analysis of a DST. 34. We recommend that the Government publish a discussion document to commence its formal consideration of a DST (as Australia has done). This will also help to identify some of the advantages and disadvantages of a DST, and so will put the Government in a better position to subsequently decide whether it should introduce one. 35. The discussion document could be released together with the Government’s response to the TWG’s final report later in 2019. 7 3yt93958al 2019-03-04 11:39:53 Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 25 of 32 IN CONFIDENCE Contents of the discussion document 36. The discussion document should broadly outline the two options for taxing the digital economy – namely an OECD led international solution, and a unilateral DST. The DST proposed should include the common features discussed above. In addition, the OECD issued a public consultation document on its proposed international solutions on 13 February 2019. Accordingly, the discussion document can also describe the OECD’s proposed options in detail and invite feedback to the Government on them. 37. Although the OECD is consulting on its proposals, we recommend that the discussion document also seek feedback from stakeholders on them. This is so that the Government can understand the effect of the OECD’s proposals on New Zealand in particular (which is unlikely to be apparent from the OECD’s worldwide consultation). This understanding can be used to develop New Zealand’s own position on the OECD proposals, which we can then advance at subsequent OECD discussions, and on any potential unilateral options the Government might want to pursue in the face of insufficient progress on a multilateral solution. 38. The discussion document should be presented as part of a package of comprehensive tax reforms that includes any TWG recommendations adopted by the Government. 39. We also recommend that the discussion document make it clear that: The Government is determined to ensure that multinational companies pay their fair share of tax in New Zealand. The Government is actively considering introducing a DST in advance of an international solution. While New Zealand is committed to finding a solution at the OECD, if sufficient progress is not made this year, a DST is a credible option. The DST would be an interim measure that would cease to apply once an international solution was adopted. We would aim to design the DST so it was consistent with New Zealand’s international obligations (which we expect to be possible). The Government sees real benefits in aligning New Zealand’s position on a DST with Australia’s. Consultation 40. Inland Revenue, the Treasury and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade were consulted on the Cabinet paper and support the preparation of the discussion document. The discussion document will be used as a basis for consultation with the public. Inland Revenue and the Treasury will consult with other interested Government agencies in preparing the discussion document, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We will report back to Cabinet with a draft of the proposed discussion document prior to its release. 8 3yt93958al 2019-03-04 11:39:53 Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 26 of 32 IN CONFIDENCE Financial Implications 41. There are no financial implications for the release of the discussion document. The introduction of new measures to tax the digital economy would be fiscally positive, although by how much depends on what options are selected and how they are designed (whether by New Zealand or the OECD). Advice on financial implications will be provided when approval on the finalised package is sought. Administrative impacts 42. Officials will consider administrative impacts when they draft the discussion document. Advice on administrative impacts will be provided when approval on the finalised package is sought. Legislative Implications 43. The publication of the discussion document does not have any legislative implications. However legislative change will be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement the policy recommendations developed out of the discussion document. Impact Analysis 44. Elements of the regulatory impact analysis will be included in the discussion document at a level that is appropriate given the stage of policy development. A full regulatory impact analysis will be carried out later in the policy process, once officials have finalised their policy recommendations. Human Rights 45. There are no human rights implications associated with the release of the discussion document. Publicity 46. We will arrange the appropriate publicity for the release of the discussion document. This publicity could be combined with the publicity for the Government’s response to the TWG’s final report, so that together they form a comprehensive package to improve the New Zealand tax system. Proactive Release 47. We propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper in part, together with the associated Ministerial reports. These could be released at the same time as the papers for the Government’s response to the TWG’s final report. 48. Some parts of the Cabinet paper and associated Ministers’ reports will be redacted under the grounds contained in the Official Information Act, for example where it is necessary to prevent prejudice to New Zealand’s international relations. 9 3yt93958al 2019-03-04 11:39:53 Information release - Options for taxing the digital economy (April 2019)Page 27 of 32 IN CONFIDENCE Recommendations The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue recommend that Cabinet: 1.Note that the Government is considering measures recommended by the Tax Working Group to improve the New Zealand tax system. 2.Note that there is a problem with the current taxation of the digital economy, both in New Zealand and internationally. 3.Note that a number of countries, including Australia, are investigating or implementing digital services taxes (DSTs). 4.Agree that New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD discussions on the taxation of the digital economy, with a view to supporting a long-term solution (bearing in mind its effect on our exporters). 5.Agree that the Government should also actively consider a possible DST as an option for taxing the digital economy, in case the OECD are unable to achieve sufficient progress this year. 6.Direct officials to draft a discussion document to get public feedback on the options for taxing the digital economy (being the international solution and the DST). In relation to the DST, the discussion document should state that: The Government is determined to ensure that multinational companies pay their fair share of tax in New Zealand. The Government is actively considering introducing a DST in advance of an international solution.

Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet FINAL REPORT OF THE TAX WORKING GROUP Proposal 1. This paper informs Cabinet of the findings of the Tax Working Group’s Final Report. Executive Summary 2. This Government established the Tax Working Group (TWG) to find ways of improving the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. This includes whether the tax system promotes the right balance between supporting the productive and speculative economies. 3. We are pleased to advise Cabinet that the TWG has now provided us with its Final Report. The TWG intends to publicly release this report on 21 February 2019. 4. The key topics in the Final Report are:  extending capital income taxation – including detailed design proposal;  environmental taxes;  taxation of business and savings;  personal income taxation; and  revenue-neutral packages. 5. The Final Report also reaffirms the findings in the Interim Report on:  GST and financial transaction taxes; 8cqzdoj2q6 2019-03-08 14:50:20  corrective taxes;  the treatment of charities;  the administration of the tax system;  the integrity of the tax system;  international income taxation;  the future of work; and  housing. 6. All members of the TWG support extending capital income taxation, although there is disagreement about the scope of the extension. A clear majority (8 members) recommends a broad extension, applying to most assets. A minority (3 members) recommends a more limited extension, applying only to residential rental properties. 7. The TWG also makes 97 other recommendations in its Final Report. Many of these are recommendations that were also made in the TWG’s Interim Report. While the TWG’s Interim Report covered a wide range of issues impacting the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system, the Final Report focuses on just a few specific issues. 8. Decisions on how to respond to the TWG’s recommendations will need to be made by April 2019. However as stated previously, no changes from these decisions will come into effect until after the 2020 election. Background 9. In December 2017, this Government established the TWG. The TWG was tasked with recommending changes to improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. 10. The TWG provided its Interim Report to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue in September 2018. In response, we provided the TWG with a letter outlining what areas we would like it to further focus on in its Final Report. Key findings of the Final Report 11. The TWG has identified two key issues that weaken the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. These are the inconsistent taxation of capital income, and the treatment of natural capital. Its findings on these key areas are summarised below. 12. The TWG has also made a number of other recommendations for improving the tax system, particularly in the areas of business tax, the taxation of 8cqzdoj2q6 2019-03-08 14:50:20 savings, and personal income tax. These findings are also summarised below. Capital income taxation 13. All members of the TWG support extending capital income taxation, although there is disagreement about the scope of the extension. A clear majority (8 members) recommends a broad extension, applying to most assets. A minority (3 members) recommends a more limited extension, applying only to residential rental properties. One member of the minority is supportive of the limited extension also applying to vacant properties and second homes. Rationale for extending capital income taxation 14. The TWG has found that an important element of capital income – profits from the sale of capital assets – are not taxed on a consistent basis. This is one of the key issues impacting the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. 15. New Zealand’s tax system is based on a broad-base, low rate framework. A fair tax system should have two main features: i. A tax base that taxes a wide range of income, so that the tax paid is spread fairly – put simply, people earning the same amount of income should pay the same amount of income tax regardless of its source. ii. People with more capacity to pay should pay a greater share of their income in tax. This is what makes a progressive tax system. 16. The TWG believe that the current treatment of capital income fails the first test of fairness. This is illustrated in the example below. An example of unfairness in our current approach to taxing capital income Oliver and Judy have the same income, but pay very different amounts of tax. Oliver earned $50,000 in wages in 2018. He paid $8,020 in tax on this income. Judy earned $25,000 from part-time work. She also sold shares in a business, and received non-taxable income from a capital gain of $25,000 (Judy bought $100,000 of shares at the start of 2018, then sold those shares for $125,000 at the end of 2018). Under current law, Judy will pay $3,395 in tax. Judy pays $4,625 less tax than Oliver because she earns her income in different ways. 8cqzdoj2q6 2019-03-08 14:50:20 17. The TWG also finds that the current treatment of capital income undermines the second test – the progressivity of the tax system. 18. Overseas studies show that high-income earners derive a much greater share of their income from capital income than low- and middle-income earners. When capital income is not taxed, those on higher-incomes benefit the most. 19. There is evidence of this unfairness In New Zealand. Figure 1 below shows the distribution of wealth. A vast majority of wealth owned by New Zealanders is held by the wealthiest 20% of households. This suggests that a vast majority of untaxed capital income is also going to wealthy households. Figure 1: Total net worth (excluding owner-occupied housing) by net worth quintile (2015) 1 20. The TWG consider that extending capital income taxation will also improve the integrity of the tax system. It will prevent some high-income individuals from using complex tax planning to reduce the tax they pay. 21. Extending capital income taxation over a broad range of assets will also help level the playing field between different types of investments. High-level design 22. The TWG has also provided some details on what a broad extension to capital income taxation would involve. These are listed below. 1 Note: Net worth estimates exclude owner-occupied housing. Quintiles are based on household net worth, including owner-occupied housing -$0.1b $29b $54b $105b $602b $(100) $- $100 $200 $300 $400 $500 $600 $700 Quintile 1 Under $39,500 Quintile 2 $39,500 to $183,699 Quintile 3 $183,700 to $399,799 Quintile 4 $399,800 to $814,799 Quintile 5 $814,800+ $ billion Household net worth quintile 8cqzdoj2q6 2019-03-08 14:50:20 a. Taxing increases in value on a broad range of assets including residential, commercial and industrial property (but not the family home), shares, and business assets. b. Only collecting tax when an asset is sold or transferred (with some exceptions e.g. managed funds). c. Deferring tax in some circumstances (e.g. inheritance, relationship property transferred, sole trader putting business into a company). d. Treating capital income the same as other income, which means taxing it at appropriate income tax rates (e.g. 28% for companies and marginal rates for individuals) and with no adjustment for inflation. e. Only taxing gains that occur from after the tax is implemented (e.g. 1 April 2021) . 23 Disadvantages 24. The TWG has acknowledged that extending capital income taxation will lead to compliance costs for asset owners, particularly when the tax comes into effect and asset owners need to value their assets. However, the TWG has identified a number of options which could minimise these costs.  Some assets with clear market values (e.g. listed shares) will not need to be valued  There will be a set of default valuation rules for asset owners that do not want a valuation  Asset owners that do want a valuation would have up to 5 years to determine the value of their asset 8cqzdoj2q6 2019-03-08 14:50:20 \[33\] 25. The TWG also acknowledged that extending capital income taxation could also have some negative impacts on saving and investment. However, the TWG identified a number of complementary measures that could help offset this effect. These measures were considered as parts of a series of complementary packages of measures that could be considered alongside an extension of capital income taxation. Potential packages 26. Extending capital income taxation on a broad range of assets using the TWG’s proposed design would, according to preliminary estimates by the TWG, generate approximately $8.3 billion in its first five years (2021/22 - 2025/26). 27. The TWG has made it clear that a spectrum of choices is available when considering an extension of capital income taxation. These choices include which types of assets should be subject to the tax, and how best to stage the timing of introduction. The various choices will generate differing amounts of revenue. 28. The TWG has developed four illustrative packages for how this revenue could be allocated within the tax system. These packages include a mix of measures that focus on the following:  increasing progressivity in the tax system through changesto the personal income tax thresholds;  helping low-income taxpayers save for their retirement through changes to the taxation of KiwiSaver contributions and increasing the Government’s contribution, and  helping to offset any negative efficiency effects arising from extending capital income taxation through targeted measures for business and housing. Business/housing measures 29. The TWG has identified a wide range of opportunities to reduce compliance costs (especially for small businesses), remove investment distortions for New Zealand businesses, and support the Government’s housing affordability goals. Some of the key measures are: a. Allowing businesses to claim depreciation expenses on buildings – encourage more business investment (range of options) b. Allowing business to deduct expenses for “black hole” expenditure – encourage innovation and entrepreneurship 8cqzdoj2q6 2019-03-08 14:50:20 c. Allowing businesses to keep losses when the owner changes – make it easier for small companies to expand d. Removing residential loss ring-fencing – recognising that gains would be taxed and could reduce upward pressure on rents 30. The TWG also recommends maintaining the company tax at the current rate, and retaining the imputation system. The TWG recommends against moving to a progressive company tax system. 31. The TWG recommends retaining the current tax rate for Māori authorities, but also recommends that this rate should be extended to the subsidiaries of Māori authorities. Savings measures 32. Extending capital income taxation would also result in higher taxes for people who are saving for their retirement, including people who are using KiwiSaver. The TWG has identified some measures that would help compensate for these higher taxes. These measures are:  A KiwiSaver tax exemption – remove tax on employer KiwiSaver contributions to lower income KiwiSavers  Increase the KiwiSaver member tax credit – increase Government contributions to all KiwiSavers  Reduce KiwiSaver PIE rates – give lower income KiwiSavers the same benefit as those in the highest tax bracket 33. These measures could offset the impact of extending capital income taxation on KiwiSaver earnings. Environmental taxes 34. The TWG was asked to consider how the tax system could sustain and enhance New Zealand’s natural capital, alongside regulation and other policy measures. 35. The TWG has concluded that the environmental challenges ahead of us require profound change to existing patterns of economic activity. Taxation is one tool – alongside regulation and spending measures – that can be used to support and guide a transition to a sustainable economy. 36. The TWG has developed a framework for deciding when to apply taxes to address negative environmental externalities. By applying this framework, the Group believes there is scope for tax instruments to play a greater role in sustaining and enhancing New Zealand’s natural capital. Using this framework, the TWG has identified a number of short, medium and long term uses for environmental taxes. 8cqzdoj2q6 2019-03-08 14:50:20 37. The short term uses of environmental taxes recommended by the TWG are all currently being addressed by existing Government work programmes. Personal income taxation 38. The TWG has considered a range of options to increase the progressivity of the personal tax system, including the possibility of a tax-free threshold. The TWG’s preferred option is to increase the bottom threshold of income tax, with a potential increase in the second marginal tax rate. 39. The TWG notes, however, that choices around personal income taxation should depend on the objectives of the Government. The TWG concludes that if the Government wishes to improve the incomes of the very poorest members of society, then changes to benefit rates are likely to be a more effective policy tool than changes to tax rates. 40. The TWG also suggests that the Government consider increasing net benefits to match any personal tax changes. This would provide a fairer redistribution of revenue across individuals, and have a greater impact on poverty reduction. He Ara Waiora 41. Through the engagement process with Māori, strong support emerged for drawing on knowledge from Te Ao Māori to enhance our public policy frameworks, to improve outcomes for Māori and for all New Zealanders. This process has been named ‘He Ara Waiora - A Pathway Towards Wellbeing’. The Treasury is currently considering how it might take this work forward in the context of the Living Standards Framework. Other issues 42. The Group has commented on a wide range of other issues in its Final Report, including corrective taxes, GST, charities, and the integrity and administration of the tax system. These are all issues that the TWG addressed in its interim report. Some of the Group’s recommendations on these issues are summarised below. Corrective taxes 43. The TWG recommends that the Government review the rate structure of alcohol excise with the intention of rationalising and simplifying it. 44. The TWG also recommends that the Government prioritise other measures to help people stop smoking before considering further large increases in the tobacco excise rate (beyond those already scheduled). GST 8cqzdoj2q6 2019-03-08 14:50:20 45. The TWG has decided not to recommend a reduction in the GST rate, or the introduction of new exceptions. 46. The TWG also recommends that the Government monitor international developments in taxation of financial services, but does not recommend at this time that the Government apply GST to financial services or introduce a financial transactions tax. The integrity of the tax system 47. The TWG supports various measures to reduce the extent of the hidden economy (i.e. undeclared and cash-in-hand transactions). The TWG also recommends measures to improve collection and encourage compliance. The treatment of charities 48. The TWG has considered whether the tax exemption for charitable business income confers an unfair advantage on the trading operations of charities. The TWG’s view is that the underlying issue is more about whether policy settings are appropriately encouraging the distribution of funds for charitable purposes. The administration of the tax system 49. The TWG has made a number of recommendations to ensure that Inland Revenue collects the data it needs in order to effectively administer the tax system, and provides that data to the public, where appropriate. 50. The TWG recommends a number of changes that would improve interactions between taxpayers and Inland Revenue, including the establishment of a taxpayer advocate service to assist taxpayers in disputes with Inland Revenue. Next steps 51. After consideration by Cabinet, the Final Report will be released by the Group on 21 February 2019. 52. In order to deliver on election commitments and enact legislation before the next election, Cabinet will need to make key policy decisions in response to the Group’s recommendations in April 2019. These decisions will be based on consultation between coalition and confidence and supply parties. 53. The indicative timeline for responding to the Group’s findings remains as previously indicated \[CAB-17-SUB-0505 refers\] and is set out below: April 2019\* Cabinet decisions on Group’s recommendations 8cqzdoj2q6 2019-03-08 14:50:20 \*subject to consultation between coalition and confidence and supply parties April to August 2019 Consultation on government proposals (if any) October - December 2019\* \*additional time to incorporate legislative package Bill introduced July 2020 Legislation passed and enacted April 2021 Implementation 54. There will need to be consideration of an overall package of measures. After the TWG released its interim report, we directed it to consider measures that would result in a revenue-neutral package. 55. There are many options for the Government’s final package. The TWG itself says “the Government does not face a binary choice” to extend capital income taxation. There are a spectrum of choices for the coverage of assets, timing and phasing. 56. The Government is also not limited to the proposals in the Final Report. It will be important if we do consider proposals that are not in the report that there is time available to test them. Responding to the Final Report – key messages for Ministers. 57. The Government set up the TWG to improve the fairness and balance of the tax system, and encourage more productive investment. The final decisions will be based on an overall package that meets that goal. 58. The Government is currently considering the recommendations of the TWG. Decisions will be made in the coming months. No changes from these decisions will come into effect until after the 2020 election. 59. We propose that all requests for comment on the report be referred to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue. Consultation 60. The Treasury and Inland Revenue were consulted. 8cqzdoj2q6 2019-03-08 14:50:20 Financial Implications 61. There are no financial implications arising directly from this paper. Human Rights 62. There are no human rights implications arising from his paper. Legislative Implications 63. There are no legislative implications arising directly from this paper. Regulatory Impact Analysis 64. The regulatory impact analysis requirements do not apply to this paper. Gender Implications 65. There are no gender implications arising from this paper. Disability Perspective 66. There are no disability implications arising from this paper. Publicity 67. The TWG intends to release the Final Report on 21 February 2019. This will involve a release event with some selected members of the media and tax community, in which the Chair of the TWG will provide a summary of the contents of the Final Report. 68. We propose to publish a statement at the time that the Final Report is released. This will provide a wider context in terms of the changes we have already made to the tax system and areas where more work in underway (such as multinational taxation and the proposed changes to secondary tax). 69. The TWG is also planning to proactively release all materials that it received from the Secretariat to the Group, as well as other material that was considered by the Group at its meetings. It has already proactively released most of the material it received prior to the release of its Interim Report. Recommendations 70. The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue recommend that Cabinet: 1. Note the contents of the Final Report. 8cqzdoj2q6 2019-03-08 14:50:20 2. Note that the Tax Working Group intends to release the Final Report on 21 February 2019. 3. Agree that all requests for comment on the report will be referred to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue. 4. Note the next steps in the process after the TWG’s Final Report is released.

Treasury:4099414v1 1 SENSITIVE Sensitive Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Revenue Cabinet Chair Government Response to the Tax Working Group Proposal 1.This paper proposes the overall Government response to the recommendations of the Tax Working Group (TWG). 2.The table attached to this Cabinet paper outlines the proposed Government response to each of the TWG’s recommendations. Executive Summary 3.The TWG’s Final Report makes 99 recommendations. This paper sets out the Government’s proposed response to these recommendations. 4.In response to the TWG’s recommendations on capital gains taxation, after extensive consultation with coalition partners, the Government has been unable to reach consensus on its response to the TWG’s recommendations on capital gains taxation. Consequently the Government is not proposing to adopt any of the TWG’s recommendation on capital gains taxation. This means there will be no changes to the taxation rules on taxing capital income as a result of capital gains taxation recommendations in the TWG report and no further work on these recommendations is necessary. However, we intend to explore options for taxing vacant land, and to seek a review of the current rules for taxing land speculators with a view to tightening these rules. 5.The proposed responses to the TWG’s recommendations (other than those relating to capital gains taxation) are generally classified into five categories: 5.1. Endorse the TWG recommendation: The TWG recommended retaining the current tax settings and we agree with this recommendation. 5.2. Agree no further work necessary: We consider no further work is necessary. 5.3. Note work already underway: Work is already underway within Government to consider the recommendation 5.4. Consider for inclusion on work p rogramme: The recommendation should be considered for inclusion in the 2019/20 Tax Policy Work Programme (TPWP) 1. Treasury:4099414v1 2 SENSITIVE and/or other agency work programme. The tax policy work programme is jointly agreed by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue and this process includes taking the proposed programme to Cabinet. 5.5. Consider as a high priority for inclusion on work programme: The recommendation should be considered as a high priority for progression in the 2019/20 TPWP and/or other agency work programmes. 6. The table below provides a high-level summary of the TWG recommendations by key topic area. The table in the appendix provides the full set of recommendations and proposed Government responses. Topic Summary of TWG recommendations Response Capital gains taxation A majority of TWG members recommended that the Government tax capital gains at full marginal rates on a very broad range of assets. A minority of TWG members recommended a more limited extension of capital gains taxation. We propose to not adopt any of the recommendations on capital gains taxation. Consequently we agree no further work is necessary, but a review of the current rules for taxing land speculators should be considered as a high priority for inclusion on work programme (TPWP). We also intend to explore options for taxing vacant land including as recommended by the TWG, directing the Productivity Commission to include vacant land taxes within its inquiry into local government funding and financing. Environmental and ecological outcomes Adopt the TWG’s framework for deciding when to use taxation as a tool to deal with negative environmental externalities. Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP and other agencies). In the short term, pursue opportunities to strengthen existing policies. Note work already underway. There are no plans in this term of Parliament to introduce resource rentals for water or input-based instruments, including on fertiliser (i.e. a fertiliser tax). The Government will not be advancing new environmental tax proposals beyond current work programmes. In the medium-to-long term, consider broader opportunities for environmental taxation. Treasury:4099414v1 3 SENSITIVE The taxation of business The current approach to the taxation of business is largely sound. Accordingly, the TWG recommended that the Government retain the imputation system and the existing company tax rate. Endorse the TWG recommendation. Consider measures to support businesses and enhance productivity. These include: • reform of the loss continuity rules; • reform of the treatment of black hole expenditure; and • compliance cost measures. Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP). The reinstatement of building depreciation deductions including the treatment of seismic strengthening costs Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP) with the seismic strengthening work considered a high priority for inclusion on the work programme. Develop a regime that encourages investment into nationally- significant infrastructure projects. Consider as high priority for inclusion on work programme (TPWP). International income taxation Continue to participate in multilateral discussions on the future of the international income tax framework, but stand ready to implement a digital services tax if necessary. The Government has directed officials to draft a discussion document on the options for taxing the digital economy, including a digital services tax. We will report back to Cabinet with a draft of the discussion document in May. Retirement savings Increase the incentives for low income-earners to save through KiwiSaver. Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP). This work would sit alongside the Government’s broader work on KiwiSaver, which includes the default provider review and a consideration of options to increase KiwiSaver uptake and contributions. Future of work Ensure the tax system remains fit-for-purpose as technology and other forces reshape the labour market. Note work already underway. Integrity of the tax system Adopt a suite of measures to improve compliance and enhance tax collection. These include: • a review of the loss-trading rules; • tighter requirements on shareholders in closely-held companies; and • further action to discourage under-the-counter transactions. Consider as high priority for inclusion on work programme (TPWP). Personal income tax Consider changes to income tax and/or benefits to increase progressivity. The TWG advised against a reduction in the top rate of personal income tax rate. We propose to not adopt any of the recommendations on capital gains taxation. As a result there is no Treasury:4099414v1 4 SENSITIVE revenue to recycle. Consequently we agree no further work is necessary. Administration of the tax system Provide greater public access to data and information about the tax system. Consider for inclusion on work programme (TPWP). Improve the process for resolving tax disputes. Charities Conduct a periodic review of the charitable sector’s use of what would otherwise be tax revenue, to verify that tax exempt status for charities and their business activities is achieving its intended objectives. Note work already underway. Goods and Services Tax (GST) The TWG advised against any changes to GST. Endorse the TWG recommendation. The TWG advised against the introduction of a financial transactions tax. The Government should monitor international developments regarding GST on financial services. Corrective taxes Tobacco: Prioritise non-tax levers over further increases to tobacco excise (beyond those already contemplated). Note work already underway. Alcohol: Simplify the rate structure of alcohol excise. The Government has no intention to progress these changes in the current parliamentary term. Sugar and gambling taxes: The Government should develop a clearer articulation of its goals in these areas. Housing Some measures (such as vacant land taxes) may help at the margin. Consider options for taxing vacant land held by land-bankers as a high priority for inclusion on work programme (TPWP). We also intend to explore options for taxing vacant land including as recommended by the TWG, directing the Productivity Commission to include vacant land taxes within its inquiry into local government funding and financing. 7. This paper also outlines how the TWG’s work on He Ara Waiora / A Pathway Towards Wellbeing is being progressed. Background 8. On 23 November 2017, the Government established the TWG to consider measures to improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. The TWG was asked to report to the Government on whether: 8.1. the tax system operates fairly in relation to taxpayers, income, assets and wealth; 8.2. the tax system promotes the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy; Treasury:4099414v1 5 SENSITIVE 8.3. there are changes to the tax system which would make it more fair, balanced and efficient; and 8.4. there are other changes which would support the integrity of the income tax system, having regard to the interaction of the systems for taxing companies, trusts, and individuals. 9. The Group was also asked to consider, in particular, whether a system of taxing capital gains or land (not applying to the family home or the land under it), or other housing tax measures, would improve the tax system. 10. The TWG delivered its Final Report to the Government on 21 February 2019. The report contains 99 recommendations. The recommendations cover a broad range of areas, including: 10.1. Capital gains taxation – the majority of the TWG recommended a broad extension to the taxation of capital gains. A minority recommended a more limited approach. The revenue collected could then be used to offset tax in other areas, including lowering personal income tax; 10.2. Environmental and corrective tax– the TWG recommended the Government make better use of taxes to discourage activities that cause negative impacts. The TWG developed a framework for deciding when such taxes can be best applied; 10.3. International income taxation – the TWG recommended the Government stand ready to implement an equalisation tax on digital services if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction; 10.4. Future of work – the TWG was concerned about changes in the labour market and recommended current withholding taxes be extended as far as practicable to increase compliance; 10.5. Integrity of the tax system – the TWG was concerned about integrity risks associated with the use of closely held companies and recommended increased enforcement to address these risks; 10.6. Charities – the TWG recommended regular reviews of the charitable sector to ensure the tax concessions enjoyed by the businesses they run are being put towards the intended social outcomes. 11. The TWG considered the current tax settings in a number of areas to be largely sound and therefore no further action is required at this time. These areas include: 11.1. Capital and wealth – the TWG recommended against introducing a wealth or land tax; 11.2. The taxation of business – the TWG recommended against moving away from the imputation system, reducing the company tax rate, or considering an alternative method of taxing small businesses; Treasury:4099414v1 6 SENSITIVE 11.3. GST and financial transactions tax – the TWG recommended against reducing the GST rate or introducing any new GST exemptions. The Tax Working Group recommendations 12. The TWG’s recommendations can be broadly categorised into thirteen areas. This section of the paper outlines at a high-level the thirteen areas and the proposed Government response. The full list of recommendations and the proposed Government response is outlined in the table in the appendix. 13. The proposed responses are categorised as follows: 13.1. Endorse the TWG recommendation: The TWG recommended retaining the current tax settings and we agree with this recommendation; 13.2. Agree no further work necessary: We consider no further work is necessary; 13.3. Note work already underway: Work is already underway within Government to consider the recommendation; 13.4. Consider for inclusion on work programme: The recommendation should be considered for inclusion in the 2019/20 TPWP and/or other agency work programmes; 13.5. Consider as a high priority for inclusion on work programme: The recommendation should be considered as a high priority for progression in the 2019/20 TPWP, or other agency work programme. 14. A number of recommendations are proposed to be considered as part of the upcoming refresh of the 2019/20 TPWP, or other agency work programmes. This is appropriate – as the Final Report notes, many of the TWG’s recommendations should be read as opportunities to improve the tax system, not detailed proposals, and should therefore be progressed through the TPWP and the Generic Tax Policy Process. 15. We have identified a number of recommendations which should be given high priority for consideration in the upcoming refresh of the 2019/20 TPWP. The recommendations include measures to strengthen the integrity of the tax system and encourage investment into nationally-significant infrastructure projects. Capital gains taxation 16. The majority of the TWG (eight members) recommended a broad extension to the taxation of capital gains. All members support an approach that taxes gains from residential property: 16.1. The majority recommendation involves a tax on capital gains at full marginal rates on a very broad range of assets. This includes gains from all types of land and improvements (except for the family home), as well as gains from shares, intangible assets, and business assets. Gains on personal assets (such as cars, boats or other household durables) would not be included, on the basis that these types of personal assets generally decline in value and the loss on sale represents the cost of private consumption; Treasury:4099414v1 7 SENSITIVE 16.2. The minority agreed that gains from residential properties should be taxed. (One of the minority would not tax gains from holiday homes or second homes.) 17. The key benefits of broad capital gains taxation identified by the TWG are: 17.1. Improvements to the fairness and progressivity of the tax system. The tax would enhance fairness by taxing different sources of income more equally. It would increase the progressivity of the tax system because capital gains are earned predominantly by the wealthiest households; 17.2. Greater integrity and revenue sustainability. Without taxing capital gains, it is difficult to protect the integrity of the tax system if there is a large gap between the company tax rate and the top personal rate; 17.3. Greater neutrality in the treatment of investment decisions; and 17.4. An additional source of revenue to fund measures that promote Government priorities. 18. The key costs identified were: 18.1. Higher taxes on savings and investment; 18.2. Distortionary costs associated with taxing on a realisation basis (especially ‘lock-in,’ which occurs when asset-holders defer the sale or disposal of assets to avoid the realisation of their tax obligations); and 18.3. Complexity and administration and compliance costs. 19. In comparison, the minority recommendation to tax gains from residential property only would have a more limited effect. It would: 19.1. Improve the fairness and progressivity of the tax system; 19.2. Leave most of the economy unaffected, so there would be smaller aggregate impacts (positive and negative) on efficiency and productivity; and 19.3. Be substantially less complex than broad capital gains taxation. Government response 20. We have carefully considered the recommendations made by the members of the TWG. We note that the TWG did not achieve consensus on the merits of progressing broad capital gains taxation. After extensive consultation with coalition partners, the Government has been unable to reach consensus on its response to the TWG’s recommendations on capital gains taxation. Consequently the Government is not proposing to adopt any of the TWG’s recommendations on capital gains taxation. This means there will no changes to the taxation rules on taxing capital income as a result of the capital gains taxation recommendations in the TWG report and no further work is necessary. 21. The Government intends to explore options for taxing vacant land (discussed separately below) and to seek a review of the current rules for taxing land speculators Treasury:4099414v1 8 SENSITIVE with a view to tightening these rules. We have asked that this be considered as a high priority for the TPWP. Environmental and ecological outcomes 22. The TWG considered there is significant scope for the tax system to play a greater role in sustaining and enhancing New Zealand's natural capital – alongside regulation and spending measures. 23. As an initial step, the TWG developed a framework for deciding when to apply taxes to address negative environmental externalities, and recommended the Government build its environmental tax capabilities. Government response 24. We welcome the TWG’s work on the environment. Tax instruments can be an effective and efficient tool for addressing environmental challenges. 25. As the TWG notes, environmental tax should not be considered in isolation from other environmental regulatory measures. The Government is progressing several initiatives to ensure tax is appropriately used, complementing other regulatory responses: 25.1. Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) reforms are currently being considered as part of the Climate Change Response Act Amendment Bill. The Interim Committee on Climate Change is also considering the treatment of agricultural emissions. 25.2. The Water Taskforce is working to achieve improvements in water quality as well as efficient and fair allocation of freshwater and nutrient discharges. 25.3. The Government has already invested an additional $5 million into OVERSEER to improve the scope and accuracy of estimated discharges into water. 25.4. The Ministry for the Environment is currently reviewing the scope and rate of the Waste Disposal Levy. 25.5. There is ongoing work to consider certain tax measures in place in New Zealand – the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) and Inland Revenue are currently providing advice on the 7 year spreading provision for petroleum development expenditure. 25.6. There is an existing project (“The Congestion Question”) between Government and Auckland Council to investigate whether or not to introduce congestion pricing in Auckland. 26. The question of what role the tax system should play to address environmental issues is an area where further cross-agency work is required and will be considered for the TPWP (alongside other specific environmental recommendations made by the TWG). The Government will also consider the merits of revenue recycling in future policy work on environmental taxation. Treasury:4099414v1 9 SENSITIVE 27. This Government will not be advancing new environmental tax proposals beyond current work programmes. The Government remains committed to the Coalition Agreement, and therefore does not propose to introduce resource rentals for water in this term of Parliament. We also have no plans to introduce this term input-based instruments, including on fertiliser (i.e. a fertiliser tax). The taxation of business 28. The TWG considered that the current approach to the taxation of business is largely sound. The TWG did not see a case to: 28.1. move away from the imputation system; 28.2. reduce the company tax rate; 28.3. introduce a progressive company tax; or 28.4. introduce an alternative basis of taxation for smaller businesses, such as cash flow or turnover taxes. 29. The TWG also recommended a number of tax measures that could lower compliance costs and enhance productivity for businesses. These recommendations include changes to the loss continuity rules, expanding deductions for ‘black-hole' expenditure, restoring building depreciation deductions, and aligning the Māori authority rate for wholly-owned subsidiaries of Māori authorities. Government response 30. We endorse the TWG recommendation to broadly retain the current settings for the taxation of business. 31. We propose that a number of the recommendations targeted at lowering compliance costs and enhancing productivity be considered for the TPWP. These include: 31.1. compliance saving measures, such as increasing the threshold for paying provisional tax and assisting businesses to use cloud-based software to improve their business; 31.2. removing a number of requirements that impose costs on businesses for little benefit, such as removing the requirement to obtain approval to issue GST buyer created invoices; and 31.3. measures to improve productivity and encourage entrepreneurship, such as reviewing the loss continuity rules and the treatment of black-hole expenditure, and aligning the Māori authority rate for wholly-owned subsidiaries of Māori authorities. 32. These measures could complement existing TPWP initiatives, such as consideration of the removal of incremental penalties, which could benefit thousands of small businesses. Treasury:4099414v1 10 SENSITIVE 33. We propose that the other recommendations, such as considering depreciation deductions for buildings will be considered for inclusion in the TPWP. The issue of seismic strengthening will be a high priority for us. 34. Beyond this work, we will consider as a high priority the development of a tax regime that encourages investment into nationally-significant infrastructure projects. International income taxation 35. The TWG noted that New Zealand is currently participating in discussions at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on the future of the international tax framework. In its final report, the TWG concluded that New Zealand should continue to participate in OECD discussions on changing the international tax framework, but should also stand ready to implement a Digital Service Tax (DST) if a critical mass of other countries move in that direction, and it is reasonably certain that New Zealand’s export industries will not be materially impacted by any reciprocal measures. Government response 36. There is a problem with the current taxation of the digital economy, both in New Zealand and internationally. We agree with the TWG that New Zealand should continue to participate in the OECD discussions on the taxation of the digital economy, with a view to supporting a long-term solution (bearing in mind its effect on our exporters). 37. We also agree that the Government should actively consider a possible DST as an option for taxing the digital economy, in case the OECD cannot achieve sufficient progress this year. 38. We reported to Cabinet on this in February 2019. Following Cabinet approval, we have directed officials to draft a discussion document to get public feedback on the options for taxing the digital economy (being the international solution being discussed at the OECD and the DST). Feedback from the discussion document will be used to help formulate the best policy for taxing the digital economy. 39. We will report back to Cabinet in May with a draft of the discussion document. Retirement savings 40. The TWG noted that New Zealand offers few tax incentives for retirement savings but does not see a case to significantly reform the taxation of retirement savings. Despite this, the TWG recommended an increase in the tax benefits for low and middle-income earners provided through KiwiSaver to encourage people to put more away for their retirement. 41. The TWG also recommended that: 41.1. there is a case to exempt the New Zealand Superannuation Fund (NZSF) from New Zealand tax obligations, and Treasury:4099414v1 11 SENSITIVE 41.2. the Government should simplify the determination of Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) rates (which would apply to KiwiSaver). Government response 42. We propose to consider the simplification of the determination of PIE rates for inclusion in the TPWP. Many KiwiSaver members are on an incorrect PIE rate, typically the default rate of 28%. As part of its Business Transformation programme, Inland Revenue will start to receive more frequent income information. This information could be used to help ensure taxpayers are using the correct PIE rate. 43. This work would sit alongside the Government’s broader work on KiwiSaver, which includes the default provider review and a consideration of options to increase KiwiSaver uptake and contributions. 44. We propose to consider the recommendation to exempt the NZSF in the TPWP. The economic and fiscal impacts of these measures would be significant, but have not yet been estimated, and should be a factor in further consideration of the recommendation. Future of work 45. The TWG was concerned that the effectiveness of the pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) withholding system will reduce if labour market changes increase the proportion of self-employed workers in the future. Therefore, the TWG supported expanding the use of withholding taxes to increase compliance and recommended that withholding be extended as far as practicable (including to platform service providers) so long as this does not impose unreasonable compliance costs. Government response 46. The nature of work is changing in New Zealand, with new technology already having an impact across many industries. It is important that the tax system continues to evolve, so it remains fair and equitable in the future. 47. Work across multiple government agencies is currently underway, with Inland Revenue officials undertaking targeted consultation on a number of proposals to expand the scope of the schedular payments rules and address non-compliance by self-employed workers. The TWG supported this work. We will receive an update on this work in the second half of 2019. Integrity of the tax system 48. The TWG noted that the integrity of the tax system requires constant vigilance. Tax avoidance not only erodes social capital, but is also fundamentally unfair, as compliant taxpayers must pay more to make up for the lost revenue. 49. The TWG raised some specific integrity risks and recommended measures to address these risks including: Treasury:4099414v1 12 SENSITIVE 49.1. The misalignment of the company and top personal tax rates: The TWG recommended there is a need to strengthen enforcement of the rules for closely-held companies. 49.2. A review of the loss-trading rules, potentially in tandem with a review of the loss continuity rules for companies. 49.3. Undeclared and cash-in-hand transactions (sometimes known as the ‘hidden economy’): The TWG recommended to increase the reporting of labour income and even the removal of tax deductibility if a taxpayer has not followed labour income withholding or reporting rules. 50. The TWG also recommended that tax collection could be enhanced by increasing the remedies available to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, specifically: 50.1. the use of departure prohibition orders; and 50.2. the introduction of a similar regime to Australia's Director Penalty Notice for serious cases, where the directors are the economic owners of the business and there has been persistent or intentional non-compliance. 51. The TWG also recommended the creation of a single Crown debt collection agency, to achieve economies of scale and more equitable outcomes across all Crown debtors. Government response 52. We agree with the TWG that the issue of integrity should be a priority for the Government. 53. Tackling the hidden economy continues to be a focus for Inland Revenue, with time- limited operational funding being put towards increasing investigations capability, public awareness campaigns, and new policy initiatives. Australia has recently introduced new policy initiatives to combat the hidden economy, including removing tax deductibility from non-compliant taxpayers. Officials are monitoring the progress of these initiatives and the impact on the Australian hidden economy. 54. We also note that: 54.1. The expanded use of departure prohibition orders needs to be carefully considered to ensure they are used as a tool of last resort. 54.2. While having the ability to pierce the corporate veil and impose personal liability on directors may result in more tax debt being collected, it may adversely impact on individuals choosing to establish a business or who elect to become an independent director. These and other potential trade-offs will need to be worked through before this measure can be progressed. 55. We propose that the integrity measures recommended by the TWG be considered as a high priority for inclusion in the TPWP. We will need to consider the merits of progressing these recommendations alongside other opportunities for enhancing the integrity of the tax system. Treasury:4099414v1 13 SENSITIVE 56. We have also noted the TWG’s recommendation for a single Crown debt collection agency. The objectives of a single agency may be better achieved through greater alignment of agency policies on debt prevention and collection. Further cross-agency advice would need to be sought on how this could be developed. Personal income tax 57. The TWG noted that any changes to personal income taxation will need to reflect the objectives of the Government: 57.1. If the Government wishes to improve incomes for very low-income households, the best means of doing so will be through welfare transfers. 57.2. If the Government wishes to improve incomes for certain groups of low-to- middle-income earners (such as full-time workers on the minimum wage), then changes to personal income taxation may be a better option. 58. The TWG’s preferred approach was to increase the bottom tax threshold, which could potentially be combined with an increase in the second marginal tax rate. Alongside these tax changes, the TWG recommended increasing net benefit payments to ensure beneficiaries would receive the same post tax increase as other people on the same income. 59. The TWG noted that many submissions called for increasing the top personal tax rate to make a material reduction in income equality through the personal tax system. However, consideration of such an increase was precluded by the TWG’s Terms of reference and therefore the TWG did not undertake any further analysis. Government response We propose to not adopt any of the recommendations on capital gains taxation. As a result, there is no revenue to recycle. Consequently we propose that no further work is necessary. Administration of the tax system 60. The TWG made several recommendations with regard to the administration of the tax system. These recommendations included: 60.1. providing greater public access to data and information about the tax system; 60.2. establishing an independent taxpayer advocacy service and a truncated tax disputes process to assist taxpayers in disputes with Inland Revenue; 60.3. continuing to invest in the technical and investigatory skills of Inland Revenue staff and for the Treasury to play a strong role in the development of tax policy; and 60.4. following a set of principles with regards to public engagement (engage with a wider range of stakeholders and with a great variety of methods, engage earlier and more frequently, greater transparency and accountable, and engage in good faith). Treasury:4099414v1 14 SENSITIVE Government response 61. There is a significant amount of anonymised tax information available through Statistics New Zealand’s integrated data infrastructure (IDI), which can be used by researchers in certain circumstances. A number of the areas the TWG suggested more information would be helpful to researchers are not currently collected by Inland Revenue on a regular basis, such as information around wealth. Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme is expanding the extent and type of information collected. This information could potentially be contributed to the IDI. 62. Officials have provided us with some initial advice on an independent tax advocate service as suggested by the TWG. At this stage, we do not propose any further work on the issue, as it is not clear how such a service would resolve the matters raised by the TWG. A truncated disputes process would require further work to consider any issues with the current processes before recommending any changes. This work could be considered for inclusion on the TPWP. 63. Officials have also provided us with a public engagement framework which incorporates the principles recommended by the TWG. Following decisions on the Crown/Māori Engagement Framework by Cabinet in September 2018, officials will work with Te Arawhiti to ensure the framework reflects the special Māori-Crown relationship in its approach to engagement. We will then explore release of the tax engagement framework. 64. Inland Revenue continues to be committed to investing in the technical skills and capability of its investigations staff. The Business Transformation programme will also help to free more Inland Revenue staff from transactional work to focus on identifying non-compliance. Charities 65. The TWG raised four areas of concern in respect of charities and the not-for-profit sector: 65.1. The first area of concern involved business activity in the tax-exempt charitable sector. The TWG was concerned about the extent to which charities are distributing or applying the surpluses from their activities for the benefit of their charitable purposes. The TWG recommended that the Government periodically review the charitable sector's use of what would otherwise be tax revenue to verify that the intended social outcomes are actually being achieved. 65.2. The second area of concern involved the income tax treatment of private charitable foundations and trusts. The TWG recommended the Government consider whether to apply a distinction between privately controlled foundations and other charitable organisations, with a view to removing concessions for privately controlled foundations or trusts that do not have arm's length governance or distribution policies. Treasury:4099414v1 15 SENSITIVE 65.3. The third area of concern involved the income tax rules for de-registered charities. The TWG recommended the Government consider whether to amend the de-registration tax rules to more effectively keep assets in the sector or to ensure there is no deferral benefit through the application of these rules. 65.4. The fourth area of concern involved the treatment of GST concessions for not- for-profit organisations. The TWG recommended the Government review whether it is appropriate to treat some not-for-profit organisations as if they were final consumers or, alternatively, to limit GST concessions to a smaller group of non-profit bodies, such as registered charities. Government response 66. The Government has already commissioned the Department of Internal Affairs (DIA), on behalf of the Minister for the Community and Voluntary Sector, with modernising the Charities Act 2005. The Government also added a review of charities and non- profit organisations to the Tax Policy Work Programme in 2018, which the TWG supported in its final report. That review is focussed on: 66.1. the appropriateness of the tax exemption for significant businesses associated with charities; and 66.2. the level of compliance costs experienced by small charities. 67. Some remedial measures to reduce compliance costs experienced by small charities have been made by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019. Further remedial measures will be included in a 2019 omnibus tax bill. 68. The ongoing DIA work will shed further light on the issues of accumulation and distribution within the charitable sector. DIA’s findings will be relevant when considering whether the charitable tax exemption for businesses, private charitable foundations and trusts are appropriate. 69. Tax policy officials will continue to liaise with DIA throughout their consultation and policy process. At the conclusion of DIA’s review, which is expected to be late 2019, officials will report on the related tax issues (including any interactions with the TWG’s recommendations). GST and financial transactions tax 70. The TWG received many submissions calling for a reduction in the GST rate, or for the introduction of new GST exceptions, to reduce the impact of GST on lower-income households. 71. The TWG acknowledged the public concern about the regressive nature of GST but decided not to recommend a reduction in the GST rate, or the introduction of new GST exceptions. This is because other more targeted measures, such as increases in transfers or changes to the personal tax system, will increase progressivity more effectively than reductions to GST. Treasury:4099414v1 16 SENSITIVE 72. The TWG also considered whether to remove the GST exemption on financial services. The TWG considered a number of options for taxing the consumption of financial services, but has not been able to identify a means of doing so that is both feasible and efficient. However, the TWG recommended that the Government monitor international developments in this area. 73. The TWG also did not recommend the introduction of a financial transactions tax. Government response 74. We consider that no further work is required at this time in relation to GST or financial transactions taxes, other than monitoring international developments on taxing financial services. Corrective taxes 75. A corrective tax is a tax that is intended to influence behaviour and lead to better health and wellbeing outcomes for New Zealanders. Outside of the environmental sphere, New Zealand currently levies corrective taxes on alcohol and tobacco. 76. The TWG recommended that the Government: 76.1. develop a framework for deciding when to apply corrective taxes; 76.2. simplify the schedule of alcohol excise rates; 76.3. prioritise other measures to help people stop smoking before considering further large increases in the tobacco excise rate beyond the increases currently scheduled; and 76.4. develop a clearer articulation of the Government’s goals regarding sugar consumption and gambling activity. Government response 77. Following the release of the Interim Report, we wrote to the relevant agencies drawing their attention to the TWG’s findings for their policy work programmes. 78. Work is already underway to progress some of these measures. The Ministry of Health is leading cross-agency work on tobacco policy, including follow up to a 2018 EY report (Evaluation of the tobacco excise increases as a contributor to Smokefree Aotearoa 2025). This work is looking at both tax and non-tax measures to support Smokefree Aotearoa 2025, and the TWG’s recommendations on tobacco will be considered in this context. Officials will report back to Cabinet on these issues in June 2019. 79. We do not intend to progress the TWG’s recommendations on alcohol excise, sugar taxes and gambling taxes in the current parliamentary term. Housing 80. The TWG found that tax is not the primary driver of house prices (although aspects of the tax system have probably exacerbated the house price cycle). Within this context, however, the TWG recommended: Treasury:4099414v1 17 SENSITIVE 80.1. that the Productivity Commission include vacant land taxes within its review of local government body financing. The TWG’s view is that vacant land taxes are best levied at the local rather than the national level; 80.2. the repeal of the time limit in the ten-year rule regarding selling for a gain contributed to by changes in land use regulation; and 80.3. requiring disclosure of the IRD number on the Land Transfer Tax Statement when transferring a main home. Government response 81. We intend to explore options for taxing vacant land held by land-bankers. We have asked that this be considered as a high priority for the TPWP. 82. In addition as part of this work, we accept the recommendations of the TWG and intend to direct the Productivity Commission to specifically consider the issue of vacant land taxes as part of its inquiry into local government funding and financing. The Commission is due to report back to Government on its findings in November 2019. 83. Repealing the time limit in the ten-year rule, and requiring the disclosure of the IRD numbers of transacting parties, will also be considered as a high priority for the TPWP. 84. Housing-related infrastructure is another priority for the Government. Treasury and DIA are already leading a programme of work on infrastructure funding and financing within the Urban Growth Agenda. The aim is to improve housing affordability by enabling responsive infrastructure provision and appropriate cost allocation. This programme involves the investigation of alternative funding and financing models that will enable access to capital and better align charges for infrastructure with the beneficiaries of that infrastructure. It may ultimately involve the use of new special purpose vehicles with the ability to set charges and raise finance. He Ara Waiora / A Pathway Towards Wellbeing 85. Through a planned engagement approach with Māori, the TWG developed a framework drawing on principles from Te Ao Māori to inform a more holistic view of wellbeing in tax policy development. This work, He Ara Waiora / A Pathway Towards Wellbeing, was co-designed through a series of wānanga with Māori which included submitters, academics, iwi leaders, and industry leaders, and received broad support through the Māori engagement process. The Group heard in a consolidated response from this process that the intent of He Ara Waiora represented a meaningful reflection of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, reflecting our continuing maturation as a nation. 86. The view was also expressed that a tikanga framework should have a broad ambit, rather than just focus on tax, and could appropriately be progressed by the Treasury in the context of the Living Standards Framework. The Treasury is continuing to work with some of the Māori academics, iwi leaders, and industry leaders that helped inform the framework, and are exploring how He Ara Waiora could inform the ongoing evolution of the Living Standards Framework. This work will also be developed in consultation with Te Puni Kōkiri and Te Arawhiti. Treasury:4099414v1 18 SENSITIVE Engagement with Māori 87. Elements of any future TPWP will be of interest to Māori. Officials will work with Te Puni Kōkiri and Te Arawhiti on how to develop an appropriate engagement strategy, including how to approach engagement may be led by different agencies. Consultation 88. The following agencies have been consulted on TWG recommendations 3-99: Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, Ministry for the Environment, Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, New Zealand Customs Service, Ministry for Primary Industries, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Department of Internal Affairs, Te Puni Kōkiri, and Te Arawhiti. 89. As recommendations progress, ongoing engagement with agencies and public stakeholders will be required. Financial implications 90. Recommendations progressed on the TPWP and other Government work programmes may have financial implications. These implications will be reported to Cabinet separately as they progress. Inland Revenue comment 91. Given the likelihood that Ministers will decide to include the priority TWG recommendations in the current TPWP, and that additional tax policy advice resources will be required to deliver a much larger work programme, Inland Revenue recommend that a tagged contingency to fund this additional tax policy advice be set up now to allow funding to be drawn down when such recommendations are added to the work programme. If funding is not provided, reprioritisation of the existing TPWP will need to occur. Legislative Implications 92. There are no immediate legislative implications. Impact Analysis 93. A regulatory impact assessment is not required for this Cabinet paper as it does not contain regulatory proposals Human Rights 94. There are no human rights implications associated with this paper. Gender Implications 95. There are no gender implications associated with this paper. Disability Perspective 96. There are no disability implications associated with this paper. Treasury:4099414v1 19 SENSITIVE Publicity 97. The Government has indicated that it will respond to the TWG recommendations in April 2019. This paper will form the basis of that response. Proactive Release 98. We propose to release this paper proactively within 30 business days subject to redaction as appropriate under the Official Information Act 1982. Recommendations 99. We recommend the Committee: 1. note that this paper reports to Cabinet on the recommendations made in the Tax Working Group Final Report provided to Government on 21 February 2019; 2. note the appended table outlining each Tax Working Group recommendation and the proposed Government response; Capital gains taxation 3. agree to not implement an extension of capital gains taxation; 4. note that, consistent with the appended table, the Government intends to explore options for taxing vacant land held by land-bankers and seek a review of the current rules of taxing land speculators as a high priority for the work programme (TPWP); 5. note that as part of this work, we accept the recommendations of the TWG and intend to direct the Productivity Commission to consider the issue of vacant land taxes as part of its inquiry into local government funding and financing.

Rec TWG Final Report Recommendation Response Capital gains taxation 1, 2 The majority of the TWG recommends a broad extension of the taxation of capital gains. If a broad extension of capital gains taxation was adopted, the TWG recommends that it have the characteristics detailed in Volume II of the TWG report. Agree no further work required on these recommendations. The Government intends to explore options for taxing vacant land including as recommended by the TWG, directing the Productivity Commission to include vacant land taxes within its inquiry into local government funding and financing and seek a review of the current rules of taxing land speculators as a high priority for the work programme (TPWP).

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION RELATED KIWISAVER POLICY CHANGES FOR INCLUSION IN THE NEXT OMNIBUS TAXATION BILL Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to the Cro wn funding the payment of employer contribution amounts passed to KiwiSaver scheme providers until these amounts are received from the employer, as well as a number of other measures which would increase the administrative efficiency of KiwiSaver and enhance members’ experience with the scheme. Executive Summary 2.As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the administration of KiwiSaver is scheduled to be transferred into a new administrative system on 1 April 2020. Business Transformation provides the opportunity to enhance the administration of KiwiSaver and improve the KiwiSaver member experience. Ensuring that members receive the correct contribution amounts and facilitating the faster transfer of contributions would assist in achieving these outcomes. 3.The main change this paper recommends is to allow Inland Revenue to pass employer contribution amounts to KiwiSaver scheme providers, before the contribution amount has been received by Inland Revenue (essentially acting as a Government guarantee of these contributions). This would improve the administrative efficiency of KiwiSaver, as it would facilitate earlier transfers of contributions to KiwiSaver scheme providers; meaning members would receive the benefit of their contributions being invested with scheme providers sooner. It would also be consistent with the existing treatment of employee contributions and other PAYE deductions, such as those made for student loans and child support. 4.This paper also proposes the following technical policy changes to KiwiSaver set tings: 4.1 change the date the calculation of interest on employer and employee con tributions commences, to align with the pay date a member’s employer has reported; 4.2 reduce the KiwiSaver provisional period (during which individuals who are automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver are provisionally allocated to a default KiwiSaver scheme) from 3-months to 2-months; 4.3 reduce the maximum period an old scheme provider has to share information an d transfer funds to a new provider when a member transfers schemes, from 35-days to 10-days; 1 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:13 IN CONFIDENCE 1. 4.4 allow members to change contribution rates through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue, rather than only through their employer; 4.5 remove the 3-month grace period for members who have been incorrectly au tomatically enrolled in KiwiSaver, to gain New Zealand residence; and 4.6 require employers to provide Inland Revenue with KiwiSaver information ab out a member’s employer superannuation contribution tax rate and the income their contributions are calculated from. 5.All the changes proposed would be phased in so that system changes are aligned wi th Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation timelines. This would mean the proposals would apply from 1 April 2020. 6.If Cabinet agrees, necessary legislative amendments to give effect to the changes wo uld be included in the next omnibus taxation Bill, which is scheduled for introduction in mid-2019. Guarantee of employer contributions 7.Under current KiwiSaver settings, where an employee contribution has been de ducted from a member’s salary or wages but has not been paid, the amount is treated as having been received by Inland Revenue and is passed to the member’s KiwiSaver scheme provider. The effect of this is the Crown funds the payment of the employee contribution until the amount is received from the employer, it also means in situations where the amount is never received by the employer these Crown funds are not recovered (effectively creating a Government guarantee of employee contributions and for simplicity will be referred to as such throughout the rest of the paper). This approach was adopted as it aligns with the treatment of other PAYE deductions, including for child support and student loans. 8.There is currently no comparable arrangement with employer contributions. This mea ns that where an employer fails to pay an employer contribution amount, no contribution is paid to the member’s KiwiSaver account and the member’s savings would be adversely impacted as a result of their employer’s late payment or non- payment. 9.The decision not to guarantee employer contributions when KiwiSaver was first in troduced, is attributable to the fact they were considered an additional benefit “on- top” of a member’s salary and wages. However, as the KiwiSaver regime has be come more established, there has been a decline in any conceptual distinction between employer and employee contributions. The KiwiSaver Act 2006 now explicitly allows for employer contributions to form part of a total remuneration package (so long as the employee is receiving at least the minimum wage excluding the employer contribution in the total remuneration package). Employer contributions are also now generally understood by employees to be their money, similar to the way employee contributions deducted from salary or wages are. 10.The current state (with no guarantee of employer contributions) results in employer con tribution taking on average 5-days longer to be transferred to scheme providers than employee contributions. This gap would increase once payday filing reforms, requiring employers to file employment income information with Inland Revenue 2 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:13 IN CONFIDENCE 11. 12. 13. 14. within 2 days of a payday (or within 10 days for employers with annual PAYE deductions of less than $50,000), become compulsory from 1 April this year. As Inland Revenue would have KiwiSaver contribution information sooner, these reforms would allow employee contributions to be passed to scheme providers sooner after a member’s payday. However, as the date that actual payments must be made to Inland Revenue is not changing, if a guarantee was not introduced, employer contributions would still be unable to be passed until the contribution amount was received. Inland Revenue is also required to allocate resources to time consuming a dministrative reconciliation processes as a result of employer contributions not being guaranteed. These include allocation of part payments of employer contributions to employees’ KiwiSaver accounts and employer contribution refund requests to KiwiSaver scheme providers (where an amount was incorrectly identified as an employer contribution and must be returned to Inland Revenue from the provider). These complex transfer processes also make it difficult for members to reconcile the amounts in their KiwiSaver account with the contribution amounts listed on their payslips. I propose that the existing approach for employee contributions be extended to e mployer contributions – that is employer contributions would be guaranteed. This would mean these contributions would be able to be passed to scheme providers as soon as information from an employer had been filed with Inland Revenue, rather than having to wait until the contribution amount had been paid. This would facilitate the faster transfer of employer contributions to scheme providers, which would have flow on benefits for members, as contributions would be subject to market investment returns sooner. As contributions could be passed to scheme providers in full, it would also reduce confusion caused by complex reconciliation processes. The guarantee would need to apply to both compulsory and voluntary employer co ntributions. A guarantee that only covered compulsory employer contributions would not recognise that voluntary employer contributions are generally understood by members as forming part of their remuneration, nor would it create the same administrative efficiencies (as it would require Inland Revenue to still hold some contributions until the contribution amounts were received). Given the number of employers making voluntary employer contributions is small, with voluntary employer contributions estimated to make-up only approximately 2% of all employer contribution in the year ending 30 June 2018, this would not have a significant impact on the proposed change. Total levels of employer and employee contribution debt are comparable (as at 30 Ju ne 2018, $18 million in employer contribution debt and $24 million in employee contribution debt, since the commencement of KiwiSaver in 2007). This suggests that the existing guarantee of employee contributions has had limited behavioural impact on employers. Based on this precedent, as employer contributions are generally treated as forming part of an employee’s remuneration, it would be expected that guaranteeing employer contributions would have a similar minimal behavioural impact on employers. That is, employers would not be less likely to pay these amounts. Inland Revenue monitors levels of unpaid employee and employer contributions and has existing recovery mechanisms and penalties that can be applied in relation to these debts. These would remain in place if a guarantee of 3 IN CONFIDENCE 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:13 employer contributions was agreed to and could be used to maintain employer compliance levels. Date calculation of interest payments commences 15.Once Inland Revenue has received notification that an employer has deducted Ki wiSaver employee contributions or paid employer contributions, these contributions are held in Inland Revenue’s KiwiSaver holding account. Inland Revenue pays interest on contributions that are held in this account, until they are forwarded to the member’s KiwiSaver scheme. 16.When KiwiSaver was introduced it would not have been possible for Inland Revenue t o collect the information necessary to calculate interest from the date of the payday deductions were made or employer contributions paid, without imposing significant compliance costs on employers. As a result, for the purposes of calculating the interest due, employee contributions are treated as received into Inland Revenue’s holding account on the 15th day of the month in which the deduction is made by the employer. Employer contributions are treated as received on the first day of the month in which the money is actually received by Inland Revenue. These approaches result in the under and over payment of interest on employee contributions and the underpayment of interest on employer contributions. 17.As part of the payday filing reforms, outlined above in paragraph 10, Inland Revenue w ill receive employment income sooner after an employee’s payday (this information would include KiwiSaver employee and employer contribution information). Based on the improved information available with payday filing, I propose that interest calculations on KiwiSaver employee contributions held by Inland Revenue should now be calculated from the pay date the employer has reported. If the proposal to guarantee employer contributions is agreed to, it is also proposed that interest on employer contributions is calculated from the member’s payday. If a guarantee of employer contributions was not introduced, it would not be appropriate to commence interest calculations on these amounts from the member’s payday. Under current settings, as employer contributions can only be passed to scheme providers when the amount has been received, if interest was calculated from a member’s payday and there was delay in the contribution amount being received by Inland Revenue, this would create a risk that Inland Revenue would be required to pay interest on contributions for significant periods of time. Reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period 18.When automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver, members are provisionally allocated to a d efault KiwiSaver scheme provider. If the member does not make an active choice to join a different KiwiSaver scheme within their first 3-months of membership, they will be treated as having offered to become a member of the default scheme to which they were provisionally allocated. This 3-month period is referred to as the provisional period and is distinct from the KiwiSaver opt-out period (which is between weeks 2-8 after a person is automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver). 19.Inland Revenue does not transfer the member’s contributions to scheme providers u ntil the end of the 3-month provisional period, meaning providers are unaware they have been allocated the member during this period. A consequence of this is providers are unable to contact these members until 3-months after they are enrolled 4 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:13 IN CONFIDENCE in KiwiSaver. Feedback from KiwiSaver scheme providers indicates by this time these members (who will be default allocated to a conservative fund type) have often become disengaged about decisions relating to KiwiSaver investment options. 20.I recommend the provisional period be reduced from 3-months to 2-months. This would allow KiwiSaver scheme providers to engage with members about investment options earlier, while retaining a 2-month provisional period would ensure that members wanting to actively choose a scheme still had the option to do so. 21.Reducing the provisional period from 3-months to 2-months, would mean that the p eriod Inland Revenue would be required to hold members’ initial KiwiSaver contributions could also be reduced from 3-months to 2-months. As a result, member’s contributions would be invested with scheme providers sooner and the amount of interest on initial contributions paid by Inland Revenue would also reduce. Members would still have the opportunity to transfer between schemes after the provisional period ended. Timeframe for transfer of member’s information and funds to new scheme provider 22.When a KiwiSaver member decides to transfer schemes, the new scheme is re quired to notify the member’s old scheme about the transfer. Arrangements with default KiwiSaver scheme providers require them to transfer information they hold on the member and the member’s funds to the new scheme within 10-days. However, for non-default schemes the KiwiSaver Act 2006 provides that they have 35-days to fulfil this transfer process. I propose that this transfer period should be reduced to 10- days for all KiwiSaver schemes. Reducing the legislatively mandated period to 10- days would align timeframes for the transfer of information across all KiwiSaver sch eme providers. Changing employee contribution rates 23.Currently, members can only change their employee contribution rate by giving notice to their employer. However, employers may not be members’ first point of contact on matters relating to their KiwiSaver account – this will often be their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue. This includes when members are considering what rate they should be contributing at to achieve their preferred retirement savings outcomes. 24.As contribution rate change applications cannot be made through a scheme provider o r Inland Revenue this imposes unnecessary compliance costs on members (following a discussion with their scheme provider or Inland Revenue members would then have to contact their employer to change rates). These compliance costs may mean members will not follow through on contribution rate changes, that would have been in their financial interests. 25.I recommend, that in addition to existing processes, members should be able to ch ange their contribution rate through their KiwiSaver scheme provider or Inland Revenue. 5 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:13 IN CONFIDENCE KiwiSaver invalid enrolments – residence grace period 26.Where a person who does not meet all the KiwiSaver enrolment criteria has been incorrectly enrolled, generally the KiwiSaver invalid enrolment rules apply and the person’s membership will be terminated. However, there are some limited exceptions to the invalid enrolment rules. This includes situations where a person does not meet the criteria of being a New Zealand resident when enrolled in KiwiSaver, but gains New Zealand residence in the 3-month period subsequent to their enrolment. 27.This 3-month grace period was intended to reduce compliance costs for members an d administrative costs for Inland Revenue, as individuals who became a New Zealand resident during the 3-month period would not have their account closed and then have to re-enrol again soon after (when they did meet the membership criteria). 28.However, in practice members who are invalidly enrolled on the basis of the resi dence ground, will not become a New Zealand resident within the requisite 3- month grace period. For example, non-residents enrolled in KiwiSaver are often in dividuals with temporary work visas, who have no intention of becoming New Zealand residents in the short-term. Being required to keep these accounts active during the 3-month grace period imposes an additional administrative burden on Inland Revenue and there is no benefit to the member (as their account will be closed at the end of the 3-month period). 29.As it has not operated as intended, I recommend the 3-month grace period for an in dividual to gain New Zealand resident status after being invalidly enrolled in KiwiSaver be removed. When a person does not meet the New Zealand resident requirement their account would immediately be closed, and they would have the opportunity to open a new account on gaining New Zealand residence. This would help ensure a consistent approach was adopted for people who were incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver. KiwiSaver income and ESCT rate information 30.As part of the KiwiSaver on-boarding process, employers are required to provide In land Revenue with information about new employees who have been automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver or existing employees opting-in to the scheme (this includes their personal information and IRD number). 31.To improve Inland Revenue’s ability to ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving the correct KiwiSaver contribution amounts and that these amounts are being taxed at the correct rate, I propose that employers should also provide the following information to Inland Revenue about new employees or existing employees where this information has changed: 31.1 any difference between an employee’s income for PAYE purposes and their in come for the purpose of calculating KiwiSaver contributions (some amounts that are treated as income for PAYE are exempt from the definition of KiwiSaver salary and wages); and 31.2 the employee’s employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rate. 6 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:13 IN CONFIDENCE 32.Under current settings (where Inland Revenue is not provided with this information), if it appears amounts received from an employer may be incorrect, Inland Revenue will contact the employer to obtain this information. This imposes compliance costs on Inland Revenue and the employer. As it can take up to six weeks for contact to be made, where the employer has undercalculated the amount, this can also mean the employer will be subject to penalties. If this information was already provided by the employer, the number of contacts would decrease. Inland Revenue would also be able to be more accurate and efficient in detecting potential miscalculation of contributions and ESCT amounts. This would help ensure that member’s savings were not impacted due to miscalculations and employers would be less likely to be subject to penalties. 33.To accurately calculate a member’s contributions and deduct the correct amount of ta x from employer contributions, employers already need to hold information on an employee’s ESCT rate and their KiwiSaver salary and wage income. Therefore, the only change would be that employers would now be required to communicate this information to Inland Revenue. It is expected that any compliance costs associated with doing so would be minimal. 34.For new employees this information would be provided as part of the existing Kiw iSaver new employee process. It is expected that updates to this information for existing employees would be infrequent (and would be provided using the same form as is used for new employees). Consistent with PAYE tax, members are subject to the same ESCT rate for the full income tax year, so this information would be provided once a year (or less frequently if the employee stayed on the same rate). And any differences between income for PAYE purposes and for KiwiSaver purposes, generally do not change during the course of an employment relationship (some examples of amounts not treated as income for KiwiSaver purposes include the value of accommodation, a benefit from an employer share scheme or a redundancy payment). Consultation 35.The Treasury and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment have been con sulted on this paper. The Financial Markets Authority and KiwiSaver scheme providers have also been consulted on the proposals and support them. Financial Implications Guarantee of employer contributions 36.Introducing the guarantee is not expected to have an additional impact on the op erating balance. Inland Revenue already recognise an expense for any write-offs and impairment in relation to KiwiSaver employer contributions - for the fiscal year ending 30 June 2018 the write-off was $2.6 million (including interest and penalties). This is because the KiwiSaver employer contributions are currently treated as a receivable asset until paid, which is the same treatment as all other taxes and payments collected by Inland Revenue. The only change is that there may be a cash impact to the Crown if the receivable is uncollected, which would impact on net core Crown debt. 37.Employer contributions would be treated as public money for the purposes of the Pub lic Finance Act 1989, to enable the transfer of employer contributions to scheme 7 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:13 IN CONFIDENCE providers prior to Inland Revenue receiving the contributions. Public money requires a permanent legislative authority, which is currently provided for in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 in respect of employee contributions only. If a guarantee of employer contributions is agreed to, this would need to be extended to employer contributions. 38.A single appropriation would be established for both employer and employee contributions to report public money spending. The Public Finance Act 1989 requires a permanent legislative authority to be managed and accounted for in the same way as an annual appropriation. Currently, there is no appropriation covering amounts of employee contributions paid out of public money. This new appropriation will be reported on in the 2019/20 Supplementary Estimates. 39.The KiwiSaver Act 2006 will also be amended so that the permanent legislative au thority only applies to KiwiSaver contributions passed by Inland Revenue to KiwiSaver scheme providers from public money, not to the total amount of employee and employer contributions Inland Revenue passes to KiwiSaver scheme providers. Other proposals 40.Financial implications related to aligning the calculation of interest on employee con tributions with a member’s payday would be expected to be negligible, as current over and under payments of interest should broadly offset. Calculating interest on employer contributions from a member’s payday would increase interest payable. However, this would be more than offset by the faster transfer of employer contributions to scheme providers, resulting in an overall reduction in KiwiSaver interest payable of under $400,000 per year. 41.As the proposal to reduce the provisional period from 3-months to 2-months would al low Inland Revenue to pass initial employee and employer contributions to scheme providers a month earlier, this would reduce the amount of KiwiSaver interest payable by Inland Revenue by under $100,000 per year. 42.No other proposals in this paper are expected to have financial implications. Compliance and Administrative implications 43.Although the proposals would improve the efficiency of Inland Revenue’s ad ministration of KiwiSaver and reduce compliance costs for KiwiSaver members, the changes would require communication to employers, KiwiSaver scheme providers, and some staff training. There would also need to be updates to public communications material. 44.The proposals would be phased in so that system changes are aligned with Inland Re venue’s Business Transformation timelines which would improve efficiency. This would mean the proposals would apply from 1 April 2020, to align with the transfer of KiwiSaver into its new administrative system (START). Legislative Implications 45.Implementing these proposals would require changes to the KiwiSaver Act 2006. 8 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:13 IN CONFIDENCE 46.If approved, I propose including the legislative changes resulting from these recommendations in the next omnibus taxation Bill scheduled for introduction in mid- 2019. Impact Analysis 47.The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Bus iness Transformation related KiwiSaver refinements RIA prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIA meets the quality assurance criteria. Human Rights 48.The changes I am recommending in this paper are not inconsistent with the New Ze aland Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. Gender Implications 49.There are no gender implications arising from the proposals in this paper. Disability Perspective 50.The proposals do not affect people with disabilities any differently. Publicity 51.I will make an announcement on the contents of the proposed omnibus taxation Bill, in cluding these proposals, when the Bill is introduced in mid-2019. A commentary on the Bill will also be released at this time. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Proactive Release 52.I propose to delay the proactive release of this Cabinet paper in full and associated min utes until the introduction of the proposed omnibus taxation Bill, which necessary legislative changes to give effect to these changes will be included in. The expected introduction date for this Bill is mid-2019.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with policy changes to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Timing To maximise the administrative efficiencies of the proposals, changes need to align with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation timelines for transferring KiwiSaver into its new administrative system. KiwiSaver is scheduled to be transferred into START on 1 April 2020. To ensure that policy decisions are taken, and legislation passed in this timeframe, this has created a constraint on the time available to analyse options. Despite this, officials are confident that the proposed approach would be the most effective option to address the problem definition. Consultation and testing Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with KiwiSaver scheme providers. However, as a result of time constraints, wider public consultation has not been carried out. Due to the largely technical administrative nature of the changes proposed, they are unlikely to have generated public interest. Moreover, taken as a whole, the package of options proposed would be beneficial to KiwiSaver members. There would be some compliance costs for employers, although these are expected to be small (they would be required to communicate information that they already hold to Inland Revenue, on a one-off or infrequent basis). While not consulted on directly, the RIA has been informed by employer feedback generated as part of public consultation undertaken on similar requirements that were introduced as part of the wider Business Transformation work programme. Assumptions underpinning impact analysis In relation the proposal to guarantee employer contributions, additional funding is not expected to be required. The primary caveat to this is that it assumes static behaviour. If the introduction of the proposal created a behavioural change amongst employers (that is it results in more unpaid employer contributions), this would increase the fiscal cost of the proposed approach. However, given that levels of employer contribution debt are currently comparable to levels of employee contribution debt (which are already guaranteed), this suggests that the proposal should not have a significant impact on employer’s behaviour. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 2.

As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the administration of KiwiSaver is scheduled to be transferred from its current system to its new administration system on 1 April 2020. This provides an opportunity to make refinements to KiwiSaver settings to improve administrative efficiency and enhance members’ experience with the scheme. The following are areas that would assist in achieving these outcomes: •facilitating the faster transfer of contributions from Inland Revenue to KiwiSaver scheme providers (and between scheme providers); and •improving information flows between members, employers, scheme providers and Inland Revenue. Transfer of contributions Part of Inland Revenue’s role as the central administrator for KiwiSaver, involves receiving KiwiSaver employer and employee contributions from employers and then forwarding these contributions on to KiwiSaver scheme providers. A reduction in the time taken to transfer contributions would improve the efficiency of the central administration of KiwiSaver. Payday filing reforms, which become compulsory from 1 April 2019, will result in Inland Revenue having employer information sooner after a payday (within 2 days of a payday for large employers and with 10 days for smaller employers). This will include information about KiwiSaver employee and employer contributions. The reforms will allow KiwiSaver employee contributions to be passed to scheme providers sooner after a member’s payday. This is because current KiwiSaver settings permit the use of Crown funds to pay employee contributions to scheme providers before contribution amounts have been paid to Inland Revenue by employers (effectively creating a Government guarantee of employee contributions). This Government guarantee does not currently extend to employer contributions. To ensure that the benefits of Inland Revenue being in receipt of earlier payday information are fully realised in relation to KiwiSaver, this RIA considers how to enable Inland Revenue to forward employer contribution amounts to scheme providers as soon as payday reporting information from employers has been received, rather than having to wait until the employer has actually paid the amount of the contribution to Inland Revenue (the current state). This RIA also considers other refinements that would facilitate the faster transfer of contributions. Improving information flows Inland Revenue is in the unique position of having on-going contact with KiwiSaver scheme providers and employers. This means Inland Revenue is able to facilitate the flow of information between relevant KiwiSaver parties (employers, providers and members) and also should have access to information to ensure that members are receiving the correct KiwiSaver contribution entitlements. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Currently, in some instances, Inland Revenue does not have access to sufficient information to effectively police the accuracy of contribution amounts received from employers. For example, Inland Revenue does not receive information from employers about the employer superannuation contribution (ESCT) rates they are taxing employees at (ESCT is the tax payable on employer contribution amounts). However, based on ESCT amounts paid to Inland Revenue, potentially up to 63% of employers could be incorrectly calculating their employees’ ESCT rate. 1 This RIA considers refinements that could be made to improve existing KiwiSaver information flows, to help ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving their correct contribution entitlements. Consideration is also given to how information flows could be utilised to give members increased flexibility (for example whether the application process for changing an employee contribution rate could be simplified for members). 2.2 Who is affected and how? KiwiSaver members Taken as a whole, KiwiSaver members would benefit from the package of proposals – the changes would result in them earning market investment returns on contributions sooner, help ensure they are receiving the correct contribution amounts and give them additional flexibility in respect of how they can change their contribution rate. KiwiSaver scheme providers KiwiSaver scheme providers would benefit from the faster transfer of contributions, as it would result in them having more funds under management. Schemes have also indicated enabling KiwiSaver contribution rates to be changed through providers, would enhance member-provider relationships. Employers Helping to ensure members are receiving correct contribution amounts, would result in employers being required to communicate some additional information they should already hold to Inland Revenue. Employers would not be directly affected by any other proposals. Inland Revenue The proposals would enhance Inland Revenue’s central administration of KiwiSaver and create administrative savings. As implementation of the proposals would be aligned with Business Transformation, there would be no additional implementation costs. 1 Figure based on analysis of early adopters of payday filing reforms for the month of June 2018. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 5 IN CONFIDENCE 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making?

The following criteria were used to assess the options considered: •Compliance: compliance costs should be minimised as far as possible. •Administration: administrative costs should be minimised as far as possible. •Equity: the option should ensure that KiwiSaver members are receiving the correct contribution amounts. •Sustainability: the option should be consistent with wider KiwiSaver settings. Option One: Status quo Administration: The status quo would not reduce administrative costs. Compliance: The status quo would not reduce compliance costs. Equity: The status quo results in some KiwiSaver members not receiving employer contributions that other members are receiving (as a result of employers not paying the correct contribution amounts or not paying employer contribution amounts at all). Sustainability: As far as practical, the KiwiSaver regime settings are intended to facilitate administrative efficiency. The problem definition identifies that there are some aspects of the regime that would be more efficient if subject to further refinements. Option Two: build on payday filing reforms This option would build on the improved information available through payday filing reforms to facilitate the faster transfer of employer contributions to scheme providers and to improve the accuracy of contribution entitlements passed to scheme providers. Specifically, it would involve passing employer contribution amounts to scheme providers based on payday information received by employers, before Inland Revenue had received the contribution amount (essentially a Government guarantee, that would align with the existing treatment of employee contributions). Based on the improved information received through payday filing, this option would also align the commencement of interest paid while contributions are held by Inland Revenue with a member’s payday. 2 Administration: This option would increase administrative efficiency, as employer contributions could be passed to scheme providers sooners. However, as it does not include other administrative enhancements to KiwiSaver, savings may not be maximised. Compliance: This option should make it easier for members to reconcile the amounts in their KiwiSaver accounts with the KiwiSaver contributions recorded on their payslips (as employer contributions would be passed in full to KiwiSaver providers sooner after the member payday). Consequently, this should also reduce the level of contacts from members to scheme providers. Equity: This option would ensure that all KiwiSaver members receive the employer 2 Currently, interest on employee contributions commences on the 15 th of the month the amount was deducted from the member’s salary or wages and interest on employer contributions commences on the 1 st of the month the contribution amount was paid to Inland Revenue. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 7 IN CONFIDENCE contributions amounts they are entitled to. It would also improve the accuracy of interest paid on contributions by Inland Revenue (the current rules result in under and over payment of interest on employee contributions and under payment of interest on employer contributions). However, this option would not address situations where a member’s employer is incorrectly calculating contributions amounts. Sustainability: This option would ensure that the benefit of information obtained via payday filing reforms were fully utilised in the KiwiSaver context. It would also align the treatment of employer contributions with employee contributions and other PAYE deductions (which are guaranteed). Option Three: Additional transfer, information and administrative refinements In addition to the changes proposed under option 2, this option would use the opportunity created by Business Transformation, to make further refinements to KiwiSaver settings. Refinements aimed at facilitating faster transfers would be to reduce the initial KiwiSaver provisional period from 3-months to 2-months (this would mean initial contributions could be transferred to providers a month earlier) and to reduce the period schemes have to send funds and member information, when a member decides to transfer to a new scheme from 35 to 10 days. The later change would only impact non-default providers, as arrangements with default providers already require them to complete transfers in 10-days. Information flows would be utilised to ensure members were receiving their correct contribution amounts, by requiring employers to provide information to Inland Revenue about the income KiwiSaver contributions have been calculated from 3 and the ESCT rate used. This information would be provided in respect of new employees and existing employees where the information had changed. To recognise that members will have different first points of contact for information on their KiwiSaver account, this option also proposes that members should be able to apply to change their contribution rate through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue (in addition to their employer). As a further administrative refinement, is also proposed that the 3-month grace period – that a person who has been incorrectly enrolled in KiwiSaver has to gain New Zealand residence before their account is shut – be removed. This period has not operated as intended and is not utilised by members. The below analysis of this option against the assessment criteria, identifies impacts that are additional to those set out in the analysis of option 2 above. Administration: Reducing the provisional period and the removing the 3-month grace period would increase administrative efficiency. Compliance: The option would reduce compliance costs for members looking to change contribution rates. There would be some additional compliance costs for scheme providers and employers (relating to the proposals to reduce the period schemes have to send funds and information to a new provider when a member transfers schemes and the additional employer information requirements, respectively). These compliance costs are expected to 3 Some amounts that are treated as income for PAYE are exempt for the purposes of calculating KiwiSaver contribution amounts. Examples includes the value of accommodation and a benefit from an employer share scheme. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 8 IN CONFIDENCE be small. Equity: The additional employer information should make it easier for Inland Revenue to identify situations where contribution amounts have been calculated or taxed incorrectly. Based on this information it would be possible to follow-up with employers, so these issues could be resolved sooner and would not arise again. Sustainability: This option identifies enhancements to KiwiSaver administrative settings in addition to the changes proposed in option 2 – to maximise improvements to KiwiSaver it would be logical to implement all changes. Implementing a package of changes is also more sustainable in terms of the legislation (as opposed to making singular refinements to KiwiSaver legislative settings on an on-going basis). Other options not considered Aligning payment of KiwiSaver contributions with an employee’s payday As part of the work on the payday filing reforms, consideration was given to the option of employers being required to pay PAYE and other deductions from salary or wages (including KiwiSaver employee and employer contributions) to Inland Revenue to align with an employee’s payday. If employers were required to pay KiwiSaver contribution amounts to Inland Revenue sooner after their employees’ payday, this would facilitate the faster transfer of these contributions to scheme providers. However, the decision was made only to require employers to file information sooner after a member’s payday, as feedback from employers was that requiring them to pay the actual monetary amounts of deductions (including KiwiSaver contributions) in a shorter timeframe would be too onerous comply with. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 9 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option 3. This package of refinements is comprised of the following proposals: • the Crown funding the payment of employer contribution amounts passed to KiwiSaver scheme providers until these amounts are received from the employer (essentially a Government guarantee of employer contributions); • changing the date the calculation of interest on employer and employee contributions commences, to align with the pay date a member’s employer has reported; • reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period from 3-months to 2-months; • reducing the maximum period an old scheme provider has to share information and transfer funds to a new provider when a member transfers schemes, from 35-days to 10-days; • allowing members to change contribution rates through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue, rather than only through their employer; • removing the 3-month grace period for members who have been incorrectly automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver, to gain New Zealand residence; and • requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with KiwiSaver information about a member’s employer superannuation contribution tax rate and the income their contributions are calculated from. Of the options considered this package would be most effective in facilitating the faster transfer of contributions to (and between) KiwiSaver scheme providers, and reducing on- going administrative costs for Inland Revenue. It is also the most coherent and equitable option for KiwiSaver members as it will help ensure members are receiving the correct contribution amounts and these contribution entitlements are being passed to scheme providers. The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits 4 A decrease in interest payable on employee contributions would be expected to be offset by an increase in interest on employer contributions for employees with a payday between the 15 th and 23 rd of the month. Affected parties Comment Impact Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (KiwiSaver members, scheme providers and employers) KiwiSaver members Aligning KiwiSaver interest payments to a member’s payday would result in a reduction in interest paid on employee contributions for some members with paydays after the 15 th of the month. The impact of this would be small given interest is paid at a rate of 0.91% per annum and would be offset by their contributions earning market investment returns sooner and an increase in interest on employer contributions in many cases. 4 Scheme providers Reducing the time scheme providers have to send members’ information and funds to a new provider in scheme transfer situations from 35-days to 10- days would have compliance costs for non-default providers, who are not already required to comply with the 10- day transfer time. Feedback from providers indicates this would be manageable and would align with industry best practice. Employers Employers would need to provide information on KiwiSaver income and employee’s ESCT rates to Inland Revenue. Compliance costs should be small, as employers would already need to hold this information to accurately calculate contribution amounts and the information would only need to be provided about new employees or existing employees where the Low.

There is the potential that the proposal to guarantee employer contributions could have a behavioural impact on employers - that is employer’s may be less likely to pay employer contributions. (While only $2.6 million in employer contribution debt was written-off for the financial year ending 30 June 2018, approximately $2 billion in employer contributions were passed to KiwiSaver scheme providers during this same year). Current levels of employer and employee contribution debt are broadly comparable (as at 30 June 2018, employer contribution debt since the commencement of KiwiSaver was $18 million, while employee contribution debt was $24 million). This suggests that the existing guarantee of employee contributions has had limited behavioural impact on employers and that introducing a guarantee of employer contributions would also have a minimal behavioural impact. Moreover, Inland Revenue has processes to monitor and recover unpaid amounts of employer contributions from employers, which would remain in place after the introduction of this proposal. These include interest and penalties available under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Sec tio n 5: Stak e h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment and the Treasury have been consulted on the proposals and support them. The proposals also reflect feedback on the operation of the KiwiSaver regime from the Financial Markets Authority. Inland Revenue has undertaken targeted consultation with KiwiSaver scheme providers (in the form of Business Transformation focused co-design workshops). Providers are supportive of the proposals. General consultation with KiwiSaver members has not been undertaken. On a whole, the package of changes should be beneficial for KiwiSaver members and given the technical nature of the proposed changes, they are unlikely to have generated public interest. The only proposal to directly impact employers would be for them to communicate to Inland Revenue the income amounts a member’s KiwiSaver contributions are calculated from and the member’s ESCT rate. This is information the employer already needs to hold, and they would only be required to provide it to Inland Revenue in relation to new employees or existing employees where the information has changed. While consultation with employers has not been carried out on these specific requirements, the proposal has been informed by the extensive public consultation that has been undertaken as part of the wider Business Transformation programme. In particular, feedback on the discussion document Making Tax Simpler – Better administration of PAYE and GST: a Government discussion document which was released in November 2015 and sought feedback on the payday filing reforms. This included, proposals aimed at refining the new employee on-boarding process, by merging PAYE and KiwiSaver reporting requirements and requiring employers to provide Inland Revenue with additional information about new employees – such as date of birth and other employee details. Although not universally supported, in consultation these new information requirements received majority support from employers. The additional 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 14 IN CONFIDENCE information requirements proposed in this RIA, would support the shifts in employee on- boarding processes. Before the proposals are implemented there will be the opportunity for public consultation, as employers and KiwiSaver members would be able to make submissions on the omnibus taxation Bill the legislative changes are included in. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 15 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals would require amendment to the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Amendments would be included in the next available omnibus taxation Bill. To align with the transfer of the administration of KiwiSaver from its current operating system into its new operating system, the changes would come into effect from 1 April 2020. The Minister of Revenue would make an announcement, on the contents of the proposed omnibus taxation Bill (including these proposals) when it is introduced in the House. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the on-going administration of the new arrangements. Aligning implementation of the proposals with Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, would mean the cost of system changes would be absorbed into Business Transformation. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 Treasury:3720848v3 Impact Summary T emplate | 16 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes of the proposals pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTTP) to confirm that they match the policy objectives. Inland Revenue collects KiwiSaver data which could be used to assess the effectiveness of the changes in facilitating the faster transfer of employer contributions and enhancing information flows. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? No formal review is planned. However, the final step in the GTTP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Post-implementation review is expected to occur around 12 months after implementation. All KiwiSaver scheme providers have an on-going relationship with Inland Revenue, which includes an annual meeting to discuss policy and operational issues that have arisen over the past year. This would provide an opportunity for scheme providers to give feedback about the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 9m5hl7xpqb 2019-06-11 11:28:27 I N C O N F I D E N C E DEV-19-MIN-0038.01 Cabinet Economic Development Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

Hon Stuart Nash, Minister of Revenue Information Release Overseas donee status: new additions for inclusion in the next available taxation bill Cabinet paper and minute July 2019 Availability This information release is available on Inland Revenue’s Tax Policy website at http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2019-ir -cab-dev-19-sub-0058/overview .

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee Overseas Donee Status: New Additions for the Next Available Taxation Bill Proposal 1 This paper seeks the agreement of the Cabinet Economic Development Committee to gr ant overseas donee status to four New Zealand charities who provide charitable activities overseas, with effect from the 2019–20 income year (starting 1 April 2019). Monetary donations to overseas donee organisations are eligible for tax benefits, such as the donation tax credit. Executive Summary 2 I recommend that the four New Zealand charities with overseas charitable purposes di scussed in this paper are granted overseas donee status and listed in the Income Tax Act 2007, with application from the start of the 2019–20 income year. The necessary amendments would be included in the next available taxation bill, scheduled for introduction in mid-2019. The charities are discussed in paragraphs 8 to 11. The purposes and activities carried on by the charities listed above fall within Cabinet’s approval criteria (CM 78/14/7) as described in paragraph 6 and are involved in the relief of poverty, or delivery of humanitarian aid and development. Background 3 New Zealand charities that support activities overseas and want their donors to be eligible fo r tax benefits (such as the donation tax credit) must be approved for overseas donee status and listed in the Income Tax Act. Monetary donations to listed organisations entitle individual New Zealand taxpayers to a tax credit (donation tax credit) of 33 1 / 3 % of the amount donated, up to the level of their taxable income. Companies and Māori authorities are eligible for a deduction for cash donations up to the level of their net income. 4 Generally, the availability of tax benefits to donations is limited to charities with New Ze aland purposes only. Overseas donee status is therefore an established exception for a specific class of charity. Giving overseas donee status requires legislative change adding the charity to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act. Advice from the Legislative Design and Advisory Committee in 2016 to the Inland Revenue Department has confirmed that the use of legislation to implement decisions to give overseas donee status is appropriate. There are 152 organisations listed in schedule 32. 5 Decisions to grant overseas donee status complement the Government’s overseas de velopment efforts. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-06-11 11:28:11 IN CONFIDENCE 1. 6 Cabinet has established criteria for granting overseas donee status. (i) the funds of the charity should be principally applied towards: the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the ravages of war or natural disaster; or the economy of developing countries\*; or raising the educational standards of a developing country\*; (ii) charities formed for the principal purpose of fostering or administering any religion, cu lt or political creed should not qualify; \* developing countries recognised by the United Nations. \[CM 78/14/7 refers\] Charities to be Granted Overseas Donee Status 7 I recommend that the charities named in paragraphs 8 to 11 be granted overseas donee s tatus. The purposes of the recommended charities come within the criteria in paragraph 6. All the charities recommended in this paper have adequate procedures for the accountability of funds applied to projects and can demonstrate a track record of activity. All are registered under the Charities Act 2005. LittleBrothersandSistersInternational 8 Little Brothers and Sisters International has been set up to support and work in p artnership with Alongsiders International, the latter has a mentorship programme in 15 Asian and African countries which is directed at keeping potentially at-risk children in established education programmes. PartnersRelief andDevelopment –New Zealand 9 The Trust was established in 2017 and works in association with the wider Partners Relief a nd Development network carrying out emergency relief and community development work in the developing world. It is active in South East Asia (Myanmar and Thailand) and the Middle East (Yemen and Syria). ProjectMoroto 10 Project Moroto was established in 2011 with the purpose of providing safe housing, u pbringing, education and advancement of life to vulnerable or orphaned children in Uganda or other impoverished regions of Africa. UNWomenNationalCommitteeAotearoaNew ZealandIncorporated 11 The UN Women National Committee Aotearoa New Zealand supports the work of the U nited Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women through 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-06-11 11:28:11 IN CONFIDENCE contributing funds raised in New Zealand for UN Women projects in developing countries worldwide, but particularly those in the Pacific region. Consultation 12 The Treasury, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Pacific and Development Group) and the Department of Internal Affairs – Charities Services have been consulted as part of the preparation of this report. Consultation with these agencies did not identify any concerns with the charities recommended in this paper. The New Zealand Police’s vetting service was also used for the trustees of the charities recommended in this report. 13 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Pacific and Development Group) notes that apart from the UN Women National Committee Aotearoa New Zealand Incorporated, it does not have any direct knowledge of the activities carried out by the other three charities discussed in this report, and none of the charities are accredited for its various partnership funds. 1 Fiscal Implications 14 The estimated financial implications of granting overseas donee status to the four charities recommended in this report are shown below. The financial implications will be treated as a forecasting change and reflect the increasing cost of the decision to allow donations to New Zealand-based charitable overseas aid organisations to be eligible for tax benefits. The revenue estimates are based on projections made by the charities about the monetary donations they expect to receive for the forecast period. $million – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2018–19 2019–20 2020–21 2021–22 2022–23 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue (0.000) (0.106) (0.143) (0.197) (0.223) Legislative Implications 15 Granting overseas donee status to the named charities will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. I recommend that the necessary amendments are included in the next omnibus taxation bill scheduled for introduction in mid-2019 with effect from the 2019–20 income year (starting 1 April 2019). Impact Analysis 16 The Treasury confirms that a Regulatory Impact Statement is not required for this proposal because it does not alter current tax policy settings. 1 For example, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade’s New Zealand aid programmes: the New Zealand Partnerships for International Development Fund (Partnerships Fund), the Sustainable Development Fund, the New Zealand Disaster Response Partnership (NZDRP), and thePacific Island Countries Participation Fund (PIC Fund). 3 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-06-11 11:28:11 IN CONFIDENCE Human Rights 17 The changes I am recommending in this paper do not have any implications in relation to the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. Publicity 18 I will make an announcement about the four charities as part of the content of the relevant t axation bill when it is introduced into the House. Inland Revenue will publish details of the new legislation ina Tax Information Bulletinonce the tax bill containing the amendments is enacted. Once Cabinet has made its decisions on granting overseas donee status, officials will inform each organisation of the relevant decision. Proactive Release 19 I propose to delay the proactive release of this Cabinet paper, without redaction, and a ssociated Cabinet minutes until the introduction of the proposed omnibus taxation bill which contains the necessary amendments to give effect to the proposal. The expected introduction date for this bill is mid-2019. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: 1.Agree that the following charities are granted overseas donee status and listed in sch edule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007: 1.1 Little Brothers and Sisters International 1.2 Partners Relief and Development – New Zealand 1.3 Project Moroto 1.4 UN Women National Committee Aotearoa New Zealand Incorporated 2.

This paper seeks your agreement to refer the attached Cabinet paper and draft discussion document to the Cabinet Office by 10:00 a.m., Thursday 2 May 2019 for the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV) to consider at it’s meeting on 8 May 2019. Discussion Document 2. On 18 February 2019 Cabinet agreed to issue a discussion document to consult on options for taxing the digital economy (CAB-19-MIN-0041). That Cabinet paper noted you would report back to Cabinet with a draft of the discussion document prior to its release. We provided you with a draft of the discussion document on 11 April 2019, together with our policy report IR2019/208, T2019/1045. 3. An updated draft of the discussion document (Discussion Document), entitled Options for Taxing the Digital Economy, is enclosed, together with a draft Cabinet paper seeking approval to release it. This version is very similar to the version we provided you on 11 April. The main change is to the structure of the document. Chapter 3 and parts of Chapter 2 have been moved to the appendices. Chapter 3 is now concerned with the possible adoption of a digital services tax (DST) as an interim measure, and previous chapter 4 has been merged into it. We attach a marked-up version of the Discussion Document showing the changes we made (other than where we have just moved the text around). 4. If Cabinet approves the Discussion Document, we will issue it on 30 May 2019 (i.e . Budget Night). In consultation with your offices, officials would appreciate the ability to make minor editorial and technical changes to the Discussion Document before its public release. Options for taxing the digital economy 5. We remain of the view that the under-taxation of the digital economy poses risks to the sustainability of Government revenue and the fairness of the tax system. There are two options for addressing this issue: • a DST, which could be adopted as an interim measure (i.e. subject to an appropriate international solution being reached at the OECD); or • a multilateral solution, which is currently being discussed at the OECD. 6. The advantages and disadvantages of each course of action are set out and explained at length in the Discussion Document. However, for convenience, a brief summary of these is provided below. T2019/1187; IR2019/217 Cabinet Paper: Options for Taxing the Digital Economy Page 2 IN CONFIDENCE Advantages and Disadvantages of a DST 7. Adopting a flat, targeted, low rate DST would result in a tax which is relatively simple to calculate and administer. Most importantly, it would improve the fairness of the tax system by collecting revenue from businesses which have historically paid little tax either in New Zealand, or overseas. A DST could also increase economic efficiency and welfare by helping address the current favourable international tax treatment of the digital sector in comparison to more traditional businesses. 8. A DST does have some disadvantages, however. For example, as a DST would apply in addition to income tax, it could subject firms to double taxation (including possibly some domestic firms). Some of the burden of a DST (we estimate between 30% and 50%) would likely be passed on to New Zealand consumers rather than borne by the digital firms themselves. Internationally, there is the risk that a DST could affect New Zealand’s reputation as a place to do business and place pressure on New Zealand’s relationships with its trading partners. 9. As a rough estimate, we expect a 3% DST would raise between $30m and $80m of tax 1 , depending in part on how it is designed. Advantages and Disadvantages of a Multilateral Solution 10. A multilateral solution at the OECD would integrate the taxation of the digital economy into the income tax system and would avoid double taxation, by allowing any income tax payable in New Zealand to be creditable overseas. There are two measures under consideration at the OECD for changing the internationally agreed income tax rules. These are: • A measure to allocate greater taxing rights over a multinational’s profits to market countries. The measure would not require the multinational to have a physical presence in the country. There are three proposals being considered for this purpose (only one of which would be adopted): o A limited proposal for digital services only, focussing on social media, digital advertising, multi-sided platforms and data. This is the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) proposal. o A broader proposal, which would allow greater taxing rights to market countries (such as New Zealand) based on certain “marketing intangibles” created there by multinationals. This is the United States proposal and it would apply beyond the digital economy. o A proposal which provides for apportionment of a multinational’s profit to market countries under an agreed formula, which would be based on certain factors such as sales and user participation. This proposal could extend beyond the digital economy and is supported by a group of 24 developing countries (the G24). It is possible that the OECD may adopt an option that incorporates elements of more than one of the three proposals, or an alternate proposal not yet considered. • A minimum tax measure suggested by France and Germany. This proposal would apply beyond the digital economy and would ensure that multinationals pay a minimum level of tax on profits earned in low tax jurisdictions. 1 This is based on a rough bottom-up estimate of what we think a DST would raise in New Zealand, combined with top down estimates based on what the EU and UK have forecast their DSTs to raise, adjusted for differences in GDP and exchange rates. s 6(a) T2019/1187; IR2019/217 Cabinet Paper: Options for Taxing the Digital Economy Page 3 IN CONFIDENCE 11. However, there is a risk in waiting for a multilateral solution to emerge from the OECD. Further, even if a common approach could be agreed, there would be some delay between the agreement being reached and its implementation, costing the Government in revenue foregone and leaving multinationals unfairly taxed in the interim. 12. We expect the OECD measures to all raise revenue. However the proposals are not detailed enough for us to estimate the revenue impact yet. Next Steps 13. As you have agreed to a 30 May 2019 release date, the next steps will be as follows: • 2 May 2019: the Cabinet paper and the Discussion Document is lodged with Cabinet Office • 8 May 2019: the Cabinet paper goes to the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV). • 13 May 2019: the Cabinet paper goes to Cabinet for its approval to issue the Discussion Document. • 30 May 2019: The Discussion Document is released.

BUDGET-SENSITIVE Office of the Minister of Finance Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet OPTIONS FOR TAXING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY Proposal 1. This paper seeks Cabinet agreement to publish the attached tax policy Government discussion document Options for taxing the digital economy. This discussion document will be released as part of Budget 2019. Feedback from the discussion document will be used to help formulate the best policy for taxing the digital economy. Executive Summary 2. A major issue with the taxation of multinationals is the ability of highly digitalised companies to derive significant income from a country without being liable for income tax there. 3. There are two options for solving the problem. One is to change the current international income tax rules, which have been agreed to by countries. This option is currently being discussed at the OECD. The other option is to apply a separate digital services tax (DST) to certain revenues earned by highly digitalised multinationals in New Zealand. 4. The Government supports an internationally agreed solution at the OECD, but it will seriously consider a DST if the OECD cannot make sufficient progress this year. 5. On 18 February 2019 Cabinet agreed to issue a discussion document to consult on options for taxing the digital economy (Cabinet Minute CAB-19-MIN-0041 refers). The 18 February Cabinet paper noted that we would report back to Cabinet with a draft of the discussion document prior to its release. 6. We attach a draft of this discussion document (Discussion Document) to this paper for approval by Cabinet. Background 7. There has been significant international concern over the ability of highly digitalised companies to derive significant income from a country without being liable for income tax there. This is also an issue for New Zealand. The issue is mostly caused by deficiencies in the current international tax rules, which have not kept up with digitalisation and other modern business developments. This under-taxation of the digital economy impacts the sustainability of Government revenues and the fairness 1 BUDGET SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-06 11:26:55 of the tax system. It also provides a competitive advantage to overseas digital multinationals compared to local businesses, which are subject to full income tax. 8. On 18 February 2019 Cabinet agreed to issue a discussion document to consult on options for taxing the digital economy (Cabinet Minute CAB-19-MIN-0041 refers). Analysis Content of the discussion document 9. We have drafted the Discussion Document as outlined in the February Cabinet paper. The Discussion Document explains the problems with taxing the digital economy. It then outlines the two options for taxing the digital economy – imposing a DST or changing the internationally agreed tax rules at the OECD – and invites public feedback on those options. Some information about the size of the digital economy in New Zealand and globally is included as well. Option 1 – imposing a DST 10. The Discussion Document states that:  The Government is determined to ensure that multinational companies pay their fair share of tax in New Zealand.  While the Government supports an internationally agreed solution at the OECD, it will seriously consider a DST if the OECD cannot make sufficient progress this year  The DST would be an interim measure that would cease to apply once an international solution was adopted.  We would aim to design the DST so it was consistent with New Zealand’s international obligations. 11. The DST proposed in the Discussion Document is based on the DST announced by the UK, and shares a set of common features with other DSTs. It is a flat tax charged at a low rate (3%) on gross revenues that are attributable to the users in the relevant country. The DST would apply to digital platforms whose value is dependent on the size and active contribution of their user base – for example, intermediation platforms like Uber and eBay; social media platforms like Facebook; and content sharing sites like YouTube or Instagram. 12. This means the proposed DST is narrowly targeted at certain highly digitalised business models. It would not apply to sales of goods or services (other than advertising or data) over the internet. So, it would not apply to Netflix for example, or to goods sold online by Apple or Amazon. It also would not apply to accountancy services delivered via the cloud. 13. Countries which have introduced or announced DSTs so far are Austria, the Czech Republic, France, India, Italy, Spain and the UK. The European Commission proposed a 3% DST for the EU but it could not achieve the support of all EU members. 2 BUDGET SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-06 11:26:55 14. The Discussion Document explains the benefits of a DST and its issues. These issues include the consistency with New Zealand’s international trade obligations and double tax agreements as well as the potential reactions of trading partners, including with respect to treatment of New Zealand exporters under their domestic tax and other laws. The Discussion Document also considers how much of a DST may be passed on to New Zealand consumers, amongst other things. Option 2 -Changing the internationally agreed income tax rules 15. The Discussion Document describes two measures being considered at the OECD for changing the internationally agreed income tax rules. These are:  A measure to allocate greater taxing rights over a multinational’s profits to market countries (such as New Zealand). The measure would not require the multinational to have a physical presence in the country. There are three proposals being considered for this purpose (only one of which would be adopted): o A limited proposal for digital services only, focussing on social media, digital advertising, multi-sided platforms and data. This is the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) proposal. o A broader proposal, which would allow greater taxing rights to market countries based on certain “marketing intangibles” created there by multinationals. This is the United States proposal and it would apply beyond the digital economy. s 6(a) o A proposal which provides for apportionment of a multinational’s profit to market countries under an agreed formula, which would be based on certain factors such as sales and user participation. This proposal could extend beyond the digital economy and is supported by a group of 24 developing countries (the G24). It is possible that the OECD may adopt an option that incorporates elements of more than one of the three proposals, or an alternate proposal not yet considered.  A minimum tax measure suggested by France and Germany. This proposal would apply beyond the digital economy and would ensure that multinationals pay a minimum level of tax on profits earned in low tax jurisdictions. 16. The OECD is aiming to obtain G20 approval of its preferred measures in June 2019 and countries have committed to working towards a consensus solution in 2020. Conclusion 17. The Discussion Document concludes that the Government supports an internationally agreed solution at the OECD, but it will seriously consider a DST if the OECD cannot make sufficient progress this year. Factors to be considered in making this decision are: 3 BUDGET SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-06 11:26:55  whether the OECD can make sufficient progress on an international solution this year;  whether a critical mass of other countries also adopts DSTs (to reduce the reputational risks of adopting a DST);  whether New Zealand companies would be unduly affected by a DST; and  whether the cost of a DST would all be passed on to New Zealand consumers. 18. This is broadly consistent with the Tax Working Group’s analysis of a DST. Australia’s announcement that it would not proceed with a DST at this time 19. Australia announced on 20 March 2019 that it would not adopt a DST at this time. Instead it will focus on achieving a multilateral solution at the OECD. The announcement follows Australia’s recent consultation on options for taxing the digital economy (which included a DST). The announcement noted that:  the Australian Government firmly believes that digital firms, like all firms, must pay their fair share of tax;  the submitters overwhelming supported Australia continuing to engage in the ongoing multilateral process at the OECD; and  many submitters raised significant concerns about the potential impact of an Australian DST across a wide range of Australian businesses and consumers. 20. Australia’s announcement should not affect New Zealand’s decision to consult on a DST. The Government was clear when it announced the Discussion Document in February that it prefers a multilateral solution, but wants to consider a DST now in case the OECD does not make sufficient progress. So the Government shares Australia’s preference for an OECD-led multilateral solution, but wants to be ready to implement a DST in case this cannot be achieved in a reasonable time-frame. Next steps 21. If Cabinet approves the Discussion Document, then we would release it as part of Budget 2019. We would report back to Cabinet on the feedback from the Discussion Document in the second half of 2019, together with final policy recommendations. At that stage we will be in a better position to provide a timeline for further steps, including legislation if the decision is made to proceed with a DST. 22. Some minor editorial and technical changes may need to be made to the Discussion Document following its approval by Cabinet including changes to reflect any updates to the OECD proposals prior to the release of the Discussion Document. This is because there is a possibility that the OECD will update its proposals before the Discussion Document is released. If this occurs, we will update the description of those proposals in the Discussion Document. 4 BUDGET SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-06 11:26:55 Consultation 23. We consulted with the following on this Discussion Document: Inland Revenue, The Treasury, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Enterprise, The Ministry for Culture and Heritage, and The New Zealand Customs Service. We have incorporated their feedback into the Discussion Document and they support the preparation of the Discussion Document. 24. The Discussion Document will be used as a basis for consultation with the public. Financial Implications 25. There are no financial implications for the release of the Discussion Document. We expect the introduction of new measures to tax the digital economy to be fiscally positive, although by how much depends on what options are selected and how they are designed (whether by New Zealand or the OECD). As a rough estimate, we expect a 3% DST would raise between $30m and $80m of tax, depending in part on how it is designed. Advice on financial implications will be provided when approval for our final policy recommendations is sought. Administrative impacts 26. There are no administrative impacts from the publication of the Discussion Document. A DST and an OECD solution would have administrative impacts. We have designed the proposed DST in the Discussion Document to minimise these. Advice on administrative impacts will be provided when approval for our final policy recommendations is sought. Legislative Implications 27. The publication of the Discussion Document does not have any legislative implications. However legislative change will be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement the policy recommendations developed out of the Discussion Document. Impact Analysis 28. Elements of the regulatory impact analysis have been included in the Discussion Document at a level that is appropriate given the stage of policy development. A full regulatory impact analysis will be carried out later in the policy process, once officials have finalised their policy recommendations. Human Rights 29. There are no human rights implications associated with the publication of the Discussion Document. Publicity 30. We will arrange the appropriate publicity for the release of the Discussion Document. The release of the Discussion Document will also be included in the publicity for the 2019 Budget. 5 BUDGET SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-06 11:26:55 Proactive Release 31.

Some parts of the Cabinet paper and associated Ministers’ reports will be redacted under the grounds contained in the Official Information Act, for example where it is necessary to prevent prejudice to New Zealand’s international relations. Recommendations The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue recommend that Cabinet: 1. Note that there is a problem with the current taxation of the digital economy, both in New Zealand and internationally. 2. Note that a number of countries are investigating or implementing digital services taxes (DSTs). 3.

This paper seeks your agreement to refer the attached Cabinet paper and draft discussion document to the Cabinet Office by 10:00 a.m., Thursday 2 May 2019 for the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV) to consider at it’s meeting on 8 May 2019. Discussion Document 2. On 18 February 2019 Cabinet agreed to issue a discussion document to consult on options for taxing the digital economy (CAB-19-MIN-0041). That Cabinet paper noted you would report back to Cabinet with a draft of the discussion document prior to its release. We provided you with a draft of the discussion document on 11 April 2019, together with our policy report IR2019/208, T2019/1045. 3. An updated draft of the discussion document (Discussion Document), entitled Options for Taxing the Digital Economy, is enclosed, together with a draft Cabinet paper seeking approval to release it. This version is very similar to the version we provided you on 11 April. The main change is to the structure of the document. Chapter 3 and parts of Chapter 2 have been moved to the appendices. Chapter 3 is now concerned with the possible adoption of a digital services tax (DST) as an interim measure, and previous chapter 4 has been merged into it. We attach a marked-up version of the Discussion Document showing the changes we made (other than where we have just moved the text around). 4. If Cabinet approves the Discussion Document, we will issue it on 30 May 2019 (i.e . Budget Night). In consultation with your offices, officials would appreciate the ability to make minor editorial and technical changes to the Discussion Document before its public release. Options for taxing the digital economy 5. We remain of the view that the under-taxation of the digital economy poses risks to the sustainability of Government revenue and the fairness of the tax system. There are two options for addressing this issue: • a DST, which could be adopted as an interim measure (i.e. subject to an appropriate international solution being reached at the OECD); or • a multilateral solution, which is currently being discussed at the OECD. 6. The advantages and disadvantages of each course of action are set out and explained at length in the Discussion Document. However, for convenience, a brief summary of these is provided below. T2019/1187; IR2019/217 Cabinet Paper: Options for Taxing the Digital Economy Page 2 IN CONFIDENCE Advantages and Disadvantages of a DST 7. Adopting a flat, targeted, low rate DST would result in a tax which is relatively simple to calculate and administer. Most importantly, it would improve the fairness of the tax system by collecting revenue from businesses which have historically paid little tax either in New Zealand, or overseas. A DST could also increase economic efficiency and welfare by helping address the current favourable international tax treatment of the digital sector in comparison to more traditional businesses. 8. A DST does have some disadvantages, however. For example, as a DST would apply in addition to income tax, it could subject firms to double taxation (including possibly some domestic firms). Some of the burden of a DST (we estimate between 30% and 50%) would likely be passed on to New Zealand consumers rather than borne by the digital firms themselves. Internationally, there is the risk that a DST could affect New Zealand’s reputation as a place to do business and place pressure on New Zealand’s relationships with its trading partners. 9. As a rough estimate, we expect a 3% DST would raise between $30m and $80m of tax 1 , depending in part on how it is designed. Advantages and Disadvantages of a Multilateral Solution 10. A multilateral solution at the OECD would integrate the taxation of the digital economy into the income tax system and would avoid double taxation, by allowing any income tax payable in New Zealand to be creditable overseas. There are two measures under consideration at the OECD for changing the internationally agreed income tax rules. These are: • A measure to allocate greater taxing rights over a multinational’s profits to market countries. The measure would not require the multinational to have a physical presence in the country. There are three proposals being considered for this purpose (only one of which would be adopted): o A limited proposal for digital services only, focussing on social media, digital advertising, multi-sided platforms and data. This is the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) proposal. o A broader proposal, which would allow greater taxing rights to market countries (such as New Zealand) based on certain “marketing intangibles” created there by multinationals. This is the United States proposal and it would apply beyond the digital economy. o A proposal which provides for apportionment of a multinational’s profit to market countries under an agreed formula, which would be based on certain factors such as sales and user participation. This proposal could extend beyond the digital economy and is supported by a group of 24 developing countries (the G24). It is possible that the OECD may adopt an option that incorporates elements of more than one of the three proposals, or an alternate proposal not yet considered. • A minimum tax measure suggested by France and Germany. This proposal would apply beyond the digital economy and would ensure that multinationals pay a minimum level of tax on profits earned in low tax jurisdictions. 1 This is based on a rough bottom-up estimate of what we think a DST would raise in New Zealand, combined with top down estimates based on what the EU and UK have forecast their DSTs to raise, adjusted for differences in GDP and exchange rates. s 6(a) T2019/1187; IR2019/217 Cabinet Paper: Options for Taxing the Digital Economy Page 3 IN CONFIDENCE 11. However, there is a risk in waiting for a multilateral solution to emerge from the OECD. Further, even if a common approach could be agreed, there would be some delay between the agreement being reached and its implementation, costing the Government in revenue foregone and leaving multinationals unfairly taxed in the interim. 12. We expect the OECD measures to all raise revenue. However the proposals are not detailed enough for us to estimate the revenue impact yet. Next Steps 13. As you have agreed to a 30 May 2019 release date, the next steps will be as follows: • 2 May 2019: the Cabinet paper and the Discussion Document is lodged with Cabinet Office • 8 May 2019: the Cabinet paper goes to the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV). • 13 May 2019: the Cabinet paper goes to Cabinet for its approval to issue the Discussion Document. • 30 May 2019: The Discussion Document is released.

This discussion document will be released as part of Budget 2019. Feedback from the discussion document will be used to help formulate the best policy for taxing the digital economy. Executive Summary 2.A major issue with the taxation of multinationals is the ability of highly digitalised companies to derive significant income from a country without being liable for income tax there. 3.There are two options for solving the problem. One is to change the current in ternational income tax rules, which have been agreed to by countries. This option is currently being discussed at the OECD. The other option is to apply a separate digital services tax (DST) to certain revenues earned by highly digitalised multinationals in New Zealand. 4.The Government supports an internationally agreed solution at the OECD, but it will seri ously consider a DST if the OECD cannot make sufficient progress this year. 5.On 18 February 2019 Cabinet agreed to issue a discussion document to consult on op tions for taxing the digital economy (Cabinet Minute CAB-19-MIN-0041 refers). The 18 February Cabinet paper noted that we would report back to Cabinet with a draft of the discussion document prior to its release. 6.We attach a draft of this discussion document (Discussion Document) to this paper fo r approval by Cabinet. Background 7.There has been significant international concern over the ability of highly digitalised comp anies to derive significant income from a country without being liable for income tax there. This is also an issue for New Zealand. The issue is mostly caused by deficiencies in the current international tax rules, which have not kept up with digitalisation and other modern business developments. This under-taxation of the digital economy impacts the sustainability of Government revenues and the fairness 1 BUDGET SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-06 11:26:55 2. of the tax system. It also provides a competitive advantage to overseas digital multinationals compared to local businesses, which are subject to full income tax. 8. On 18 February 2019 Cabinet agreed to issue a discussion document to consult on options for taxing the digital economy (Cabinet Minute CAB-19-MIN-0041 refers). Analysis Content of the discussion document 9. We have drafted the Discussion Document as outlined in the February Cabinet paper. The Discussion Document explains the problems with taxing the digital economy. It then outlines the two options for taxing the digital economy – imposing a DST or changing the internationally agreed tax rules at the OECD – and invites public feedback on those options. Some information about the size of the digital economy in New Zealand and globally is included as well. Option 1 – imposing a DST 10. The Discussion Document states that:  The Government is determined to ensure that multinational companies pay their fair share of tax in New Zealand.  While the Government supports an internationally agreed solution at the OECD, it will seriously consider a DST if the OECD cannot make sufficient progress this year  The DST would be an interim measure that would cease to apply once an international solution was adopted.  We would aim to design the DST so it was consistent with New Zealand’s international obligations. 11. The DST proposed in the Discussion Document is based on the DST announced by the UK, and shares a set of common features with other DSTs. It is a flat tax charged at a low rate (3%) on gross revenues that are attributable to the users in the relevant country. The DST would apply to digital platforms whose value is dependent on the size and active contribution of their user base – for example, intermediation platforms like Uber and eBay; social media platforms like Facebook; and content sharing sites like YouTube or Instagram. 12. This means the proposed DST is narrowly targeted at certain highly digitalised business models. It would not apply to sales of goods or services (other than advertising or data) over the internet. So, it would not apply to Netflix for example, or to goods sold online by Apple or Amazon. It also would not apply to accountancy services delivered via the cloud. 13. Countries which have introduced or announced DSTs so far are Austria, the Czech Republic, France, India, Italy, Spain and the UK. The European Commission proposed a 3% DST for the EU but it could not achieve the support of all EU members. 2 BUDGET SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-06 11:26:55 14.

T is ~~~\\'eks agreement to draft legislation that will broaden the refundability !!O isi re. We propose that from the 2020/21 income year, refundability is broadly o:Y~ ifaJi le . This broader refundability would be subject to a cap based on the amount o t'payro11' 1 taxes paid by a firm in each year (proposed cap). The proposed cap would not apply to tax credits resulting from payments to approved research providers, and would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. 5. We have considered whether tax exempt organisations should be eligible for refundability. We believe that all tax exempt organisations, except organisations receiving tax exempt income under section CW 9 and 10 2 of the Income Tax Act, should be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Background 6. The R&D Tax Incentive provides tax credits to firms undertaking R&D. Reducing the amount of income tax paid by these firms lowers the cost of their R&D, thereby incentivising firms to undertake more R&D. This is a key policy to support the 1 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT). 2 CW 9 applies to dividends derived from foreign companies and CW 10 applies to dividends within New Zealand wholly­ owned groups. 1 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    Government’s goal of raising the amount of R&D undertaken and grow a more innovative economy. 7. The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill has been enacted and the R&D Tax Incentive scheme has commenced from 1 April 2019 for most businesses 3 . 8. The R&D Tax Incentive was developed under tight timeframes. Consequently, there was insufficient time to resolve some complex issues before the legislation was drafted. The major issue requiring further consideration was refundability of tax credits. 9. Refundability refers to paying out R&D tax credits if a business has insufficient income tax liability. That is, if a business has made a tax loss or its income tax liability is less than the R&D tax credits it has earned. An alternative to refunding the credit is to allow firms to carry their surplus credits forward and use them when they move into a tax paying position. 10. Cabinet agreed to a limited approach to refundability for the first year of the R&D Tax Incentive. We committed to review the policy that would apply from the second year. 11. This paper seeks agreement to a proposal for broader availability of refundability of tax credits that will apply from the 2020/21 income year. 12. This proposal also addresses the position of organisations that receive tax exempt income (tax exempt organisations). Because these organisations generally do not have an income tax liability, the only way they will benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive is if their credits are refunded. In general, we propose that tax exempt organisations should not be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive, but we consider an exception should be made for levy bodies. Refundability is an important feature in the R&D Tax Incentive 13. Providing a refund ensures that all firms doing R&D are able to immediately benefit from the tax credits they are eligible for under the R&D Tax Incentive. For instance, an established business can apply its tax credits to offset tax it would pay on profits generated in other parts of the business. Similarly, a large conglomerate can support a loss-making R&D division through profits from other parts of a business. By contrast, an early stage R&D intensive firm may not be able to benefit from the tax credit until a much later date, if at all if it never attains profitability or experiences a breach in shareholder continuity. 14. Refundability provides the financial incentive for R&D when it is most needed. In most cases, a firm will incur R&D expenditure prior to receiving revenue from commercialising its product. Therefore, not only are early stage R&D-intensive firms more likely to be in loss, they are also more likely to be cash constrained. For these firms, cash today will be much more valuable than a credit that is carried forward, 3 The R&D Tax Incentive applies from the beginning of the 2019/20 income year, which means the date from which it applies depends on the balance date of each individual claimant. For most standard balance date (31 March) claimants, the R&D Tax Incentive will apply from 1 April 2019. 2 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    especially as they risk losing their credits if they breach the R&D tax credit shareholder continuity rules 4 . 15. Enabling firms in tax loss to have their credits refunded provides a more powerful incentive for them to undertake R&D. 16. However, paying out to businesses, rather than reducing the amount of tax they pay, increases the risk of fraud. This could destabilise the R&D Tax Incentive and has been an issue in other jurisdictions 5 . The risk is not particular to R&D tax credits and arises in other parts of the tax system such as donor tax credits and GST refunds. 17. Refundability also increases the likelihood that firms will claim the R&D Tax Incentive, which will result in a higher fiscal cost. In countries where credits are refunded, growth in the amount of R&D claimed, and hence fiscal cost growth, is faster amongst those firms getting refunds. Discussions with officials in Australia and the UK suggest that some of this increased R&D is of marginal quality. Cash payments for small, start-up firms are highly attractive for some firms so encourage reclassifying other expenditure as R&D or claiming for activity that is not R&D. 18. These conflicting drivers are reflected in how refundability is treated in other countries. Across the OECD, though most countries have an R&D tax credit, only half provide refundability. Of those that do, almost all apply further constraints. Australia, for instance, only has refundability for small to medium sized firms and has introduced legislation to cap the amount that is refunded. The UK is also consulting on a proposal to cap the refund for small and medium sized firms. 19. We note that New Zealand’s R&D Tax Incentive contains features to promote integrity of the scheme and ensure its sustainability over the long term. These include the requirement for R&D activity to primarily occur in New Zealand, the system of in-year approval (starting in 2020/21), and the exclusion of claims if a firm’s R&D expenditure is below a $50,000 threshold. Nonetheless, we consider it sensible to be aware of how risks have emerged in other countries and therefore how we can build safeguards into the New Zealand scheme. Proposals for refundability for firms in loss 20. Our starting point is that refundability is a desirable policy because it will encourage more firms to undertake R&D. However, to ensure the scheme’s long-term sustainability, we consider it prudent to constrain how much can be refunded. 21. The principles we have applied in developing the proposals in this paper are: 21.1 The policy should be simple for firms to understand and comply with. 4 The R&D tax credit shareholder continuity rules are very similar to the tax loss shareholder continuity rules. They require businesses to maintain shareholder continuity of 49% or more to carry forward their R&D tax credits from one period to the next. 5 For instance the UK Treasury and HMRC have released a consultation document ‘Preventing abuse of the R&D Tax Relief for SMEs’. 3 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    21.2 Consistent with the underlying approach to the R&D tax incentive, refundability should be broadly available rather than applying selectively to particular types of firms. 21.3 We have avoided situations where a change in a firm’s circumstances alters its eligibility for refundable tax credits. In Australia, if a firm’s turnover grows to exceed $20 million per year, it is no longer eligible to have its credits refunded. 22. The recommended proposal on refundability for firms is: 22.1 All firms should be entitled to a refund of their R&D tax credits, to the extent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid by a firm in the relevant income year (proposed cap) 6 . 22.2 The proposed cap would not apply to limit refundability of tax credits resulting from payments to approved research providers. 22.3 The proposed cap would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. 23. The proposed cap is designed to prevent refundable tax credits being paid out to firms who are fraudulently claiming the tax credit. Some overseas jurisdictions counter this risk by limiting R&D tax credit refunds to the amount of PAYE paid by the firm. This is a simple and unobtrusive test but overlooks that some firms may legitimately pay little PAYE 7 . Consequently, we propose that additional payroll- related taxes paid and payments to approved research providers be included to reduce the impact of this constraint. 24. Nonetheless, we anticipate that some firms may not be able to receive a full refund of their tax credits in the year in which they are earned as a result of this policy. 25. We note that the R&D Tax Incentive is not the only instrument that can assist the early stage firms that may be affected by this policy. MBIE, in conjunction with Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation, is leading a programme of work to review our interventions for R&D intensive start-ups in light of the shifting R&D funding environment. This includes: a review of Callaghan Innovation’s R&D Project Grants; reviewing the R&D tax loss cash out scheme; and a commitment to a refreshed and more ambitious Technology Incubator Programme. MBIE is also leading work, through the New Zealand Venture Capital Fund, to deepen capital markets to support high-growth/scale-up firms involved in disruptive technology. Tax exempt organisations 26. There are different types of tax exempt organisations, including charities, some levy bodies, public authorities and local authorities, sports promoting bodies, and science 6 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT). 7 For instance, many start-up firms will limit their financial risk by employing staff on contract rather than recruiting them as permanent members of staff. These staff employed on contract may choose to have withholding tax (WT) paid by the firm on their behalf. 4 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    and industrial research promoting bodies. A common feature is that they do not pay income tax, so have no income tax liability against which to offset their R&D tax credits. Therefore, these organisations will only benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive if their credits are refunded. 27. There are arguments for and against these types of organisations having their tax credits refunded. In general, the argument for is that the R&D they undertake is potentially valuable and enabling them to benefit from the tax credit could stimulate them to do more R&D. 28. The argument against is that these organisations are outside the tax system so should not benefit from incentives provided from within the tax system 29. However, the specifics of these arguments vary with the type of tax exempt organisation, so it is useful to consider each type separately. Levy bodies 30. Levy bodies receive levy payments from their members, which are generally taxable businesses. These payments are then used to fund levy bodies’ R&D activities, which are performed for the benefit of levy body members. The R&D performed by and funded through levy bodies is fundamentally business R&D. 31. Levy bodies are not by definition tax exempt organisations, but some may receive tax exempt income. A carve-in is proposed for them, as these entities do not receive the same tax concessions as charities (such as donee tax credit status, GST and FBT concessions) 32. We propose that levy bodies would have fully refundable R&D tax credits 8 . Charities 33. Charities also undertake valuable R&D. However, we propose that charitable organisations be ineligible for refundable tax credits, even though they are not currently excluded from receiving the Growth Grant. 34. Charities do not pay income tax, they receive GST concessions 9 , and are exempt from FBT. Also, they benefit from the donor tax credit regime (which provides tax credits to those who donate to charities), as these credits incentivise individuals and businesses to donate to charities. In short, charities receive Government support. These benefits mean that charities’ cash flow is enhanced by provisions in the tax system, and they do not have their profits top-sliced as a tax paying organisation does. Therefore, we do not consider it appropriate to extend further benefits to charities through the tax system. 35. Charities are currently treated as carrying on a business in New Zealand for the purposes of determining eligibility for the R&D Tax Incentive. We propose removing 8 Levy bodies that receive other Government funding for some of their R&D activities would only be eligible for R&D tax credits to the extent their R&D activities are not already subsidised by the Government. 9 The current GST treatment of charities is concessionary, relative to other organisations, because it allows charities almost full input tax deductibility even if very few taxable supplies are made. 5 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    this rule for consistency and excluding them from being eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. 36. Excluding charities means that businesses wholly-owned by charities are excluded, because these are also considered charities. However, we are not proposing to include broader association rules. This means if a tax paying business donates to a charity, even a business controlled by that charity, this would not invalidate the business’s access to the R&D Tax Incentive. It would also mean that a charity could set up a partially controlled business entity, subject to the rules within the constitution of the charity, that could be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Māori businesses 37. Māori businesses may structure their affairs differently from non-Māori businesses for a variety of reasons. The R&D Tax Incentive has broader eligibility for different forms of business entities than the Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant regime, which required specific entity eligibility rules to allow some Māori businesses to qualify. 38. Māori authorities are not tax exempt - they pay tax at 17.5% rather than at the company rate of 28%. Māori organisations that carry out R&D activities should be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. A small number of post-settlement governance entities have registered as charities, but businesses that are partially controlled by these entities would not be charities so would be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Other tax exempt organisations 39. For the avoidance of doubt, we propose that other tax exempt organisations including local authorities be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. This was the original policy intent, established as part of the initial policy development of the Incentive, but this exclusion was not included in the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill. Local authorities have the ability to raise the revenue required to perform R&D activities through rates. The R&D tax incentive should not be required to incentivise R&D activities by local authorities. 40 Within the Income Tax Act, there is provision for income from dividends in certain circumstances (CW 9 and CW 10) to be tax exempt. In the original legislation we provided for receipt of such income to not affect eligibility for the tax incentive or refunds. We propose this should continue to be the case. Anticipated further work 41. Establishing a robust policy on refundability rounds out the work programme for establishing the R&D Tax Incentive, but we anticipate other refinements and developments in the years ahead. These include, but may not be limited to: 41.1 Changes to make the R&D Tax Incentive more attractive for recipients. An important issue for many firms is when they will receive R&D tax credit payments. Growth Grant recipients receive payments quarterly, and during stakeholder engagement, firms raised the lack of quarterly payments as a negative aspect of transitioning from Growth Grants to the R&D Tax Incentive. At present, Inland Revenue systems only allow for end of year payments but, once Inland Revenue’s Business 6 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    Transformation is more advanced, a system of in-year refundability may be possible 10 . 41.2 There is also a commitment for further policy work to be undertaken as part of the Tax Incentive to simplify administrative processes for small to medium enterprises. This work will ensure that the compliance costs for applicants are commensurate with the benefits they receive. Examples of this could be allowing small firms to use a ‘labour cost plus mark-up’ approach to establishing their eligible expenditure. 41.3 A review of complementary policies, including the R&D tax loss cash out and Callaghan Innovation Project Grants. With the R&D Tax Incentive in place, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation will undertake further work to ensure other instruments in the system of government support for R&D are complementary to the R&D Tax Incentive. 41.4 There will be ongoing monitoring of the R&D Tax Incentive, plus a formal review once it has been in place for five years. We anticipate these processes will identify areas for improvement. Stakeholder engagement 42. This refundability policy has benefited from input from a wide array of organisations. 43. The importance of broad refundability in incentivising business investment in R&D was a strong theme from the consultation conducted by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Inland Revenue, and Callaghan Innovation following the release of the Government Discussion Document on the R&D Tax Incentive in mid-2018 The need for broad refundability was also emphasized in submissions received by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee on the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill, and through additional stakeholder meetings. 44. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation have discussed the refundability proposals with the Corporate Taxpayers’ Group; Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand; representatives from PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY; approximately 25 representatives from R&D performing businesses in tax loss or with insufficient taxable income to fully utilise non-refundable R&D tax credits; some large established R&D performers; levy bodies; charities; cooperatives; Federation of Maori Authorities; and Māori business representatives. These discussions have helped shape the refundability proposals and have highlighted the desirability of broad eligibility and an accessible process. 45. As part of the broader refundability discussions, stakeholders were asked to consider the impact of a PAYE cap. A PAYE cap, which would limit the amount of R&D tax credits refunded to a firm to the amount of PAYE paid by the firm in the relevant year, was seen as problematic. 10 Though other pre-conditions are likely before in-year refundability can be offered.. 7 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    46. Stakeholders advised that a PAYE cap could constrain the benefit loss-making early stage R&D intensive firms would derive from the credit. Many of these firms use contractors over employees because of the flexibility afforded by contracting arrangements. R&D intensive start-ups may have fewer non-R&D employees (compared with larger firms), and may also have a higher proportion of non- employee R&D expenditure (such as expenditure on capital assets or consumables). 47. As a result of this stakeholder engagement, a broader range of taxes paid by firms have been included in the proposed cap, along with any tax credits resulting from payments to approved research providers. Consultation 48. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation prepared this Cabinet paper. 49. The following agencies have been consulted during the development of this paper: Treasury, Te Puni Kōkiri, Department of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Primary Industries. 50. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet was informed. Financial implications 51. Broadening the policy on refundability will make the policy more attractive and therefore incentivise firms to undertake and claim more R&D under the Tax Incentive. A consequence is that the cost of the R&D Tax Incentive will be higher than what it otherwise would be under the limited refundability that will apply in the first year. 52. However, this does not require any additional appropriation from that which Cabinet approved for the R&D Tax Incentive in September 2018. 53. In the paper that approved the appropriation, Cabinet agreed to limited support for businesses in tax loss starting April 2019 and noted that the design features for refundability would be broadened in subsequent years (DEV-18-MIN-0174). Therefore, the broader refundability policy proposals fall within the scope of what Cabinet has already agreed. 54. The fiscal cost estimates that were used to justify that appropriation were based on the assumption that from the Incentive’s inception all firms, including those in loss, would claim and receive the full amount of the tax credits in the year in which they are earned, even without full refundability. Therefore, the appropriation has already allowed for the costs associated with the policies we are proposing. 55. As a sensitivity test, officials have also considered the possibility that the broader approach to refundability will drive faster growth in R&D and therefore higher costs of the Incentive than is predicted on the standard assumptions. There is a large degree of uncertainty around these estimates but they nonetheless suggest that even with this additional cost, the estimated cost of the R&D Tax Incentive would still fall within the current appropriation. 8 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:22:34 IN CONFIDENCE    Legislative implications 56. Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. 57. If approved, we propose developing draft legislation for changes resulting from these recommendations in the Taxation (1st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial Matters) Bill, scheduled for introduction in June 2019. We also anticipate this drafting will include some minor remedial matters relating to the Tax Incentive legislation already enacted. Impact Analysis 58. MBIE’s Regulatory Impact Analysis Review Panel has reviewed the attached Regulatory Impact Statement prepared by MBIE. The Panel considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Statement meets the criteria necessary for Ministers to make informed decisions on the proposals in this paper. Human Rights 59. There are no human rights implications arising from the proposals in this paper. Gender Implications 60. There are no gender implications arising from the proposals in this paper. Disability Perspective 61. There are no specific disability considerations arising from the proposals in this paper Publicity 62. We will make an announcement on this policy once Cabinet decisions have been made. We will also make an announcement when the Taxation (1st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial Matters) Bill is introduced. A commentary on the Bill will be released at this time. Details will be posted on the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation websites. Proactive release 63. We propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions.

Why is Government intervention required? The Taxation (Research and Development ! r~ ~t-s~ Act (the Act), implements an R&D Tax Incentive in New Zealand. The ~ !.iJ Tax Trrcentive applies from 1 April 2019 for most businesses. Under the sche ~ firm an receive a tax credit equal to 15% of their eligible R&D expenditur,i~.~ tc.~ firms will be able to use this tax credit to reduce their income tax liabi .J.it.y.Ji~::.~ allows for certain firms that have little or no income tax to pay t~ oec · ~~D cax credit refund of up to $255,000 per income year. Credits that are o r ll1ndefd can be carried forward to future income years provided sharehold on(~ i criteria are met. The limited ref j1bGl,a'S"11r:t 1 rules in the Act are based on the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out scheme~ J;:.i eh~~ ~ rules, eligibility for refunds is restricted to unlisted companies !hat me tf'a'ri ~,(9} R&D wage intensity test and do not derive non-dividend exempt 1nc\\.~ v , ~~+teria mean that many businesses will not be eligible for refundable tax its under the R&D Tax Incentive. Partnerships, trusts, listed companies, and c rnpanies who receive some exempt income or do not meet the wage intensity test will be excluded. Additionally, certain atypical organisations, such as levy bodies, some Maori entities, charities, and local authorities, will be excluded. It is desirable to ensure the law provides clarity as to whether these entities should benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive through the design of a more comprehensive refundability policy. The limited timeframe for developing the Act meant it was not possible to design broad refundability rules for year one. The Government has committed to developing a more comprehensive policy for refundability to apply from year two of the Tax Incentive. The rationale for the R&D Tax Incentive and the importance of raising business expenditure on R&D (BERO) was explained in the previous Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) for the R&D Tax Incentive (http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2018-ria-rdtc-bill/overview ). This RIS is focused on options to broaden the refundability of the R&D Tax Incentive. If refundability is not broadened, it is expected that the Tax Incentive will not be as effective as intended at incentivising additional R&D. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? Broadening eligibility for refundability The proposed approach is to change the existing limited refundability rules so that R&D tax credit refunds are available to more businesses. It is proposed that all businesses would be eligible for refundability, irrespective of their legal form or whether they are listed. The 20% wage intensity test would~ :~ e removed. (2 \\V We expect that making the tax credit available to more R&D-perfor~~~f~ ~ nd higher incentives for firms to engage in R&D) will increase t~ a~~~~R&D undertaken , which will in turn result in an increase in kli~t~ ~ creation, employment, and labour productivity growth. Knowledge~l(('bY R&D flows between firms because of worker mobility, product im~ :\\.\\~~rse engineering. This means firms do not capture the full b~ l:t ~~ir R&D and so they underinvest relative to the socially optimal level \\Qi~~ most governments have a policy that will stimulate firms to undert~ ~or ra'&,D.

Broadening th~ ·~.tJ...~lity available from that provided for year one of the R&D Tax Incentive J;la:\\c~ 9'~ been the intent, and will broaden the reach and effect of the R&D Ta~ ~l' ~ - En~~rity and managing fraud risk i©~a,;~ to extending refundability to all businesses, it is proposed to remove the 1 ting $255,000 cap on refundability. Instead, it is proposed to limit the amount of creaits refundable to businesses through a cap based on the amount of payroll taxes paid by each business. This payroll cap would include PAYE, fringe benefit tax (FBT), employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT) paid by a business. A payroll cap will help ensure the integrity of the scheme is maintained. It is necessary to reduce the risk of fraudulent claims for R&D tax credit refunds which have been problematic (along with an associated fiscal risk) in other jurisdictions with refundable R&D tax credits. The payroll cap would not apply to limit refundability of R&D tax credits resulting from payments to Approved Research Providers because it will be easy to verify that these payments have been incurred by a business. The payroll cap would not apply to limit the R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. Levy bodies are empowered to collect levies by statute, definitely have an economic presence in New Zealand, and consequently pose a reduced risk that refunded R&D tax credits will be unrecoverable. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 2 Exempt income recipients Recipients of exempt income are currently ineligible for limited refundability, unless the only exempt income they receive is from dividends. Without refundability, entities that only derive exempt income, such as charities, are unable to receive any cash benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive. This is because they do not have any income tax to pay. As these entities are outside the tax system, it is proposed that they should not benefit further from incentives provided from within the tax system and that they should be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. It is proposed that an exception apply for levy bodies, however, which do not receive the same tax concessions as charities (such as donee tax credit status, q:~~d FBT concessions). The R&D performed by and funded through le~ o's; s ~ s fundamentally business R&D. Accordingly, it is proposed that levy bo~ :~~~~~ble for the R&D Tax Incentive (including refundability), even if they (;ei ''Q)(empt income. ~ Further details and the implications of this proposal~ j) ' rt1cular atypical organisations (including charities, Maori businesse ~df ~ authorities) are discussed further at 3.2. :> ~ 0 y; Section B: Summary impacts - be 6lus"' ~--------------0.,--~ ~'-------------~ Who are the main expected ben(ific!a.-,~~ 3nd what is the nature of the expected benefit?

Under current rules only 350-650 f i ~ r e ½~~ ted to qualify for refu ndabi lity, and of those 65-130 are expected to hit t~ o refundability. P~ tnerships, trusts, listed companies, companies who receive some exempt income or do not meet the wage intensity test, and atypical organisations such as levy bodies and some Maori business entities will also benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive through the design of a more comprehensive refundability policy. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 3 Where do the costs fall? Fiscal costs The budget for the Tax Incentive provides for the fiscal cost of full refundability. In Budget 2018 the Government appropriated $1 ,020 million over the first four fiscal years for the R&D Tax Incentive. On 1O September 2018, Cabinet agreed to reprioritise the remaining funding ($528 million) already allocated for Growth Grants over the same period \[CAB-18-MIN-0434 refers\]. We anticipate that allowing broad refundability will increase the take-up of the Tax Incentive compared to limited refundability. This in turn will increase t~ !:3.,.&D expenditure performed by firms, and the amount claimed under the Ta~ "~ftii\_y­ These fiscal costs will be borne directly by Government and indir~~ ~ e taxpayer. ~i~ Additional fiscal cost due to broader refundability, compar~ ~~ e limited refundability available in year one of the R&D Tax incentiv~ J\\~e5 or the below reasons: ~\\{:::::>\\) • Increased R&D activity from existing R&D perfor~ ~ • Firms new to R&D enter the scheme <ol...\_~ We have estimated the fiscal costs of the R~ D T'~~entive with full refundability to be approximately $1 ,345 million over t~ i\\ st fo'cl'r fiscal years for the R&D Tax Incentive (from when it comes into~ H i'{>~ pril 2019 through until 30 June 2022). The model used to prepare thesi ' t~~assumed that firms claim the full amount of the eligible R&D expendi~~~ ~ h they are entitled in the year in which it is incurred. More specific~ ~~~a~ 1p es that firms in loss claim the full amount of the Tax Incentive, eve it~~etundability. nif Anecdotal evidenc , rot}\\ ~ erseas jurisdictions shows that those that have allowed more generou~ ~~lity have experienced much greater rise in the costs of their R&D tax )Jfice ~~n Australia, R&D in the part of the scheme that was refundable (which ~ lie~ tb} small-and-medium enterprises) grew at approximately 15 percent per~ ¥ 1 reas R&D in the non-refundable part experienced no growth. "v°'e u~ not extrapolate exactly from the Australian experience to New Zealand ~e-5ause in New Zealand broad refundability will be available to all businesses, regardless of size (subject to exclusions discussed above). Moreover, without further analysis, it is not possible to conclude that the presence of refundability drove all the higher growth in Australia; a number of other factors are likely to have also contributed. Nevertheless, if New Zealand were to experience R&D growth equivalent to the refundable part of the Australian scheme, we have estimated that it might add approximately $40 million (over the period of the appropriation) to our estimates of the fiscal costs of the R&D Tax Incentive. Administration costs The increased attractiveness of the regime will increase legitimate claims but may also increase fraudulent claims. The increased risk of fraudulent claims may mean more administrative costs to ensure the legitimacy of claims. However, as the R&D Tax Incentive scheme has already been designed with relatively thorough checks on the R&D activities that are the subject of the claims, it is expected that any increase in administrative costs resulting from broader refundability will be negligible. Compliance costs Com ared with the limited refundabilit rules in ear one, com liance costs to firms ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 4 under broader refundability should either decrease or stay the same. The year one refundability rules use the existing corporate eligibility and wage intensity criteria from the R&D tax loss cash-out rules, which are relatively complex. The proposed eligibility rules from year two are simpler, so compliance costs could decrease under the proposals. In addition, more firms will have their credits fully refunded rather than carrying them forward. This reduces the complexity of tracking historic credits and testing for continuity breaches. 9.Jr What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Risks ~\\ There are three main risks associated with broader refundability Mtfi'j~~st be considered as part of the design. These are fiscal risk, fraud risk, ~~~ity risk. Fiscal risk ~i".'

To mini~~~~ of fraudulent claims, the proposed 'payroll' cap ensures the exi~ ~~t3usiness and its economic presence1.1~ are verified before a R&D tax cr- 0 t!~v~ef!--I cJ S paid to the business. ~ ... of fraudulent claims will also be mitigated through the following steps: • An in-year approval process (included in the Act), which requires claimants to obtain approval of their R&D activities before they file a claim for their R&D tax credits. • A $50,000 minimum threshold of eligible expenditure 1 (included in the Act). Experience in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, indicates that without a minimum threshold there can be a flood of smaller, lower-quality tax credit claims. Integrity risk This is the risk that compliance with the R&D Tax Incentive scheme may deteriorate if it is perceived to be abused by some claimants. This risk can be mitigated by ensuring the Tax Incentive is seen to be robust. In-year approval (included in the Act) and the proposed 'payroll' cap should help mitigate this integrity risk. Learning from overseas experience Most overseas R&D tax credit schemes with refundabilit have some constraints, 1 There is an exception for R&D activities carried out by an Approved Research Provider. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 5 such as capping the amount of refundable tax credit to the amount of other taxes paid by a business (such as PAYE paid on behalf of employees). Appendix 1 summarises the policies applied in other OECD countries that provide refunds and describes the strengths and drawbacks of each policy. There is no uniformity as to how constraints are applied, but some broad observations are: • Some constraint on refundability is the norm. A system with no restrictions on refundability would be an outlier amongst OECD countries. • The different ways in which refundability is limited often reflect differences in the underlying tax incentive scheme. • Some countries limit refundability to SMEs and start-ups. • It is relatively common to limit refunds by reference to other taxes paid by the firm. A common approach in other jurisdictions is to limit refunds to the amount paid in other taxes such as PAYE. 2 This ensures a firm has a tangible economic presence in the country where the claim is being made, the amount refunded is commensurate to activity in the jurisdiction and it reduces the risk that the claim is made by a non­ existent entity. Considering the risks associated with refundability and learnings from overseas, we propose broadening the refundability available in year one but having some constraints to mitigate risk. Constraints to mitigate the risks associated with broader refundability The proposal to broaden eligibility for refundability includes a ‘payroll’ cap on refunds to mitigate the fraud, fiscal, and integrity risks associated with paying out cash. It is proposed that all firms are entitled to a full refund of their R&D tax credits, to the extent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid by a firm in the relevant income year (proposed payroll cap). 3 The proposed payroll cap would not apply to limit tax credits resulting from payments to Approved Research Providers. The proposed payroll cap would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. The proposed payroll cap is designed to prevent refundable tax credits being paid out to firms who are fraudulently claiming the tax credit. Limiting R&D tax credit payments to the amount of PAYE paid by a firm, as is done in many overseas jurisdictions, is a simple and unobtrusive measure but overlooks that some firms may legitimately pay little PAYE. 4 Consequently, it is proposed that additional payroll taxes paid be included to reduce the impact of this constraint. Payments to Approved Research Providers will not be capped as it will be easy to verify that these payments have actually been incurred by a firm. That is, R&D credits generated from eligible expenditure on Approved Research Providers will be refundable, even if a business has not paid any payroll taxes. Levy bodies may have low ‘payroll’ taxes where R&D is largely contracted out, but 2 For most firms, the amount of PAYE they pay on behalf of employees will exceed 15% of the amount of R&D they undertake because all employees in the firm will contribute to the PAYE total whereas R&D is usually only one part of the firm’s activities. There will, however, be some firms that (quite legitimately) do not pay PAYE. 3 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT). 4 For instance, many start-up firms will limit their financial risk by employing staff on contract rather than recruiting them as permanent members of staff. These staff employed on contract may choose to have withholding tax (WT) paid by the firm on their behalf. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 6 they are not subject to the cap due to reduced risk that refunded R&D tax credits will be unrecoverable. Conclusion The above constraint is not anticipated to restrict refunds for the vast majority of R&D performers. It means that all firms would have some immediate benefit and a few would have less than full refundability. Given the R&D Tax Incentive scheme is relatively broad and accessible, the proposed refundability restrictions do not fundamentally alter the incentives of the scheme. Overall, and compared with most other jurisdictions, the proposed policy for New Zealand represents a comprehensive approach to refundability.

New Zealand has a low overall expenditure on R&D 5 primarily due to low business investment in R&D in New Zealand. New Zealand's low business investment in R&D can be explained, in part, by its industrial structure. New Zealand firms have low R&D intensity (Mazoyer, 1999); the size of traditionally R&D intensive industries (such as pharmaceuticals and aircraft manufacturing) in New Zealand is small (Di Maio and Blakeley, 2004); and there are few very large firms, who tend to be more research-active (OECD, 2017). Evidence suggests that there are other reasons for the low business investment in R&D. These include returns to innovation being relatively low in New Zealand 5 New Zealand's R&D spending in 2018 was equal to 1.37 percent of gross domestic product. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 8 (Wakeman and Conway, 2017), which means New Zealand firms do not have the same incentive to invest in activities that will increase their innovative output. The average rate of public support for business R&D is also "well below the socially efficient level indicated by international empirical studies" (OECD, 2017). This evidence indicates that there is scope for productivity gains from increasing the overall level of support for R&D expenditure. The Government announced a goal of increasing New Zealand's R&D expenditure to 2 per cent of GDP by 2027. To reach this target, a significant amount of the growth in R&D expenditure is expected to come from business. New Zealand BERO is relatively low and remains concentrated among a sm~ e~ f firms. To achieve a further boost in BERO, as well as to transform thei~~· 'o become more knowledge intensive, requires broadening the base of R& ~h~~ g firms within New Zealand while continuing to increase the R&D~~e of existing R&D-performing firms. ~'2} R&D performing firms, particularly at the early phase of the(~ v~~~ nt, will often be loss-making. Therefore, providing refundable tax ere~~ tl~\\\_~l?.-esses in tax loss is a key element of the effectiveness of the R8~ ~'\\v .eentive in achieving significant growth in BERO. Without a refundabl~ a ~~~~:v businesses in tax loss will have minimal incentive to invest in additiona, R& ....'\\1/" \\ \\5 2.2 What re ulato s stem, ors ~tmns, are alread in lace?

In addition to the R&D Tax Incentive, there are Callaghan Innovation grants which provide R&D subsidies. These grants include: • Growth Grants: A non-discretionary grant paid to all businesses that spend more than $300,000 and 1.5 per cent of revenue on R&D over the prior two years. The grant funds 20 per cent of a business R&D programme up to a limit of $5 million per year (i.e ., $25m of R&D spending), initially for a period of three years with automatic two-year extensions conditional on continuing to meet the criteria. The aim is to provide experienced R&D performers with the funding certainty and stability they need to grow their R&D spending in the long term. There were 316 recipients in 2017/ 18 at an (estimated) fiscal cost of $172.2M. The Growth Grant scheme will cease on 31 March 2021 . No new applications can be made, but existing Growth Grant recipients can extend their Growth Grants until the scheme end date. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 9 • Project Grants: A discretionary grant, allocated to less-experienced R&D performers that do not meet the conditions for a Growth Grant for R&D. It funds 40 per cent of the first $800,000 of the eligible costs of a pre-specified project and 20 per cent of the remainder. There were 344 recipients in 2017/ 18 at an estimated fiscal cost of $20.3M. There are restrictions on the availability of the R&D Tax Incentive for recipients of existing grants. New Zealand also provides support for businesses performing R&D through the R&D loss tax credit (also known as the R&D tax-loss cash out). New Zealand-resident businesses are able to apply for 28 per cent of their losses associated withf@.:g~ le R&D expenditure (up to a cap) to be paid out in cash, rather than carry~ (rw{;1Jd those losses until future years. 350 firms currently claim R&D loss tax ere'\\.~( ~V There are also tax deductions available for R&D expenditure, and th(<;b'~ 1tf./defer these tax deductions so as not to lose them due to a b~,yl\\areholder continuity rules.

Discussions of the proposals with levy boa ·,~ 1~ icated that should levy bodies be ineligible for refundable R&D tax 0 , rllt~ c~ 3 could lead to some levy body members preferring to fund their own R&D. •Jineentive is not intended to change business behaviour in this way. Limited refundability is also not available for listed companies, partnerships, or trusts. This is problematic, because it is likely that - without refundability - some of these businesses will have insufficient income tax liability to benefit from their R&D tax credits. The Tax Incentive is intended to have broad application and treat all businesses the same, irrespective of their legal form. However, excluding some types of firm from the Tax Incentive biases it toward firms in traditional arrangements (particularly, limited liability companies). Capped refundability Some businesses may be eligible for limited refundability but unable to cash out all of their R&D tax credits because of the $255,000 cap. These businesses will have to carry their R&D tax credits forward into future years until they have sufficient income tax liability to utilise their credits. The ability to carry the credit forward is subject to a shareholder continuity rule that requires a minimum of 49% shareholder continuity to be maintained in order for R&D tax credits to be carried forward. This is problematic, because R&D intensive start-ups are more likely to undergo a significant change in their shareholder base when they seek to raise capital through new investors. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 10 2.4 Are there an constraints on the sco for decision makin ? The Government has introduced the R&D Tax Incentive and indicated that it wants to expand the coverage of refundability. The Government has committed to developing a more comprehensive policy for refundability from year two of the Tax Incentive (corresponding to businesses' 2020/ 21 income year). There is a need to use existing legislative vehicles to achieve enactment of policy changes in time for them to apply from year two of the Tax Incentive. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? This proposal has been informed by input from a wide array o~ .l:\]~ c;ector organisations. ~'2) The importance of broad refundability in incentivising busi~,.}~{ ment in R&D was a strong theme from the consultation conducted m~~ B'iEv,Mnd Revenue and Callaghan Innovation following the release of the Gf~~ , i:frscussion Document on the R&D Tax Incentive in mid-2018. The nei {Qt.\_~pder refundability was also emphasized in submissions received by the ~~,se and Expenditure Select Committee on the Bill, and through additi~ f tak o laer meetings. MBIE, Inland Revenue and Callag~ ~ a~ iscussed refundability proposals with the Corporate Taxpayers' Grou~ · ~ 1 ~,~~ Accountants Australia and New Zealand; representatives from PwC, K~ 6.lwl te and EV; approximately 25 representatives from R&D performi ffi~ s c ' in ax loss or with insufficient taxable income tonb ~·~ fully use non-refunda t \\{{& a credits; levy bodies; charities; and Maori business representatives. Thf s-e d(s~u sions have helped shape the broader refundability proposals, an~ J~ lighted the desirability of broad eligibility and an accessible process. ~ Agencie(€\_~~fJ takeholders to consider the impact of a $5 million cap and a PAYE ca~ ~ proxy to test tangible economic presence). ~o~ k on $5 million cap s & eholder engagement revealed that there were a small number of established R&D performers who would be constrained by a $5 million cap. For example, a business in a loss making position undertaking around $80 million of R&D annually would be eligible for $12 million of R&D tax credits. Under a $5 million cap the business would receive a $5 million refund and would have to carry forward the remaining $7 million of R&D tax credits into future years. Because the business spends a large amount of R&D on an on-going basis they are unlikely to be able to fully cash out their accumulation of R&D credits carried forward. There were also a number of established R&D performers who valued the security refundability would bring to their R&D programmes. These businesses are mainly in a tax-paying situation but depending on market fluctuations they could be in a temporary loss-making position in future. Refundability would give these firms surety, allowing them to continue their R&D investment during market down-turns. Some of these established R&D performers would also be constrained by a $5 million cap. The proposal for broader refundability removes the previously proposed $5 million cap on refundability. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 11 Feedback on PAYE cap The PAYE cap, which would limit the amount of R&D tax credits refunded to a firm to the amount of PAYE paid by the firm in the relevant year, was seen as problematic. Stakeholders advised that a PAYE cap would significantly constrain the benefit that loss-making start-ups would get from the credit. Many start-ups that perform R&D have few employees and rely on contractors to develop their business because of the comparative flexibility afforded by contracting arrangements. R&D intensive start-ups may have fewer non-R&D employees (compared with larger firms), and may also have a higher proportion of non-employee R&D expenditure (such as expenditure on capital assets or consumables). Tangible economic presence test As a result of the stakeholder feedback on the two options above, officials explored a tangible economic presence (TEP) test. The TEP test developed would have allowed firms that did not satisfy a PAYE cap to be verified for TEP from either an external certifier (such as a chartered accountant or lawyer), or directly from Inland Revenue through additional checks. Stakeholders preferred the availability of alternatives to the PAYE cap, and thought that multiple ways of establishing tangible economic presence were preferable to a one-size-fits-all approach. Payroll taxes cap Discussions with United Kingdom (UK) officials found that the risks of fraud in relation to refundability are more pervasive than previously considered. 6 UK officials suggested that relying on a chartered accountant or practising lawyer for certification of TEP may not be robust, and that additional Inland Revenue checks might lead to administration resources being focused on audit rather than the approval of R&D activity. As a result of this feedback, we have included an option that would include a ‘payroll’ taxes cap based on PAYE and other taxes paid by firms (including fringe benefit tax (FBT), employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and tax voluntarily withheld from contractor payments (WT)) in order to lessen the impact on affected firms. It is also proposed that any tax credits resulting from payments to Approved Research Providers be fully refundable (so not subject to the ‘payroll’ taxes cap). Stakeholder engagement on including additional payroll taxes (such as FBT, ESCT and WT) in the cap indicated that this would be an improvement over a PAYE cap. Although only a small proportion of contractors have opted into the voluntary withholding scheme, more may decide to opt into it if the payroll taxes cap were implemented. Other mechanisms for providing support to R&D intensive start-ups will also be considered as part of further policy work, including reviewing the R&D tax loss cash- out and the Callaghan Innovation Project Grants. 6 In the UK, HM Treasury and HMRC have released a consultation document ‘Preventing abuse of the R&D tax relief for SMEs’, April 2019, which proposes that a PAYE-related cap is reintroduced to the R&D tax credit scheme for SMEs. This policy has been driven by a concern over growing levels of fraud within the scheme since the removal of the PAYE cap. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 12 Incentive. 'V Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likel im acts of the o tions under consideration? The framework for assessing the key policy elements and trade-offs of the options under consideration is captured by the following criteria: Criteria for which entities will be eligible for a refund • lncentivise business expenditure on R&D. • Tax-exempt organisations that sit outside the tax system (do not pay inco~ ax) should not benefit further from incentives provided from within the tax sy~ t ~ • Provide clarity about which organisations are eligible for the R&D Tax~ tt~ Criteria for constraining the amount that is refundable ~~ • Increased business R&D expenditure ~~'"2) • Mitigation of fraud risk/maintaining the scheme's integrit T • Minimise compliance costs for firms ~\\ • Maximise business certainty over time ~~ • Administratively feasible O ~ • Minimise fiscal costs/risk .--------------'°'---"----------------, 3.2 What o tions are available to ~dC:r~s!; bie roblem? There are a range of options.Jori , ~,9undability could be broadened, including the types of entities that are eJi~~~tMe constraints that are placed on the scheme to manage risks that r f maaQ)i Jty creates, particularly to the integrity of the Tax • Local authorities • Other tax-exempt organisations Status quo Under the status quo, limited refundability rules restrict eligibility for refunds to unlisted companies that meet a 20% R&D wage intensity test and do not derive non­ dividend exempt income. These criteria mean that many businesses will not be eligible for refundable tax credits, including partnerships, trusts, listed companies, and companies who receive some exempt income or do not meet the wage intensity test. Additionally, certain atypical organisations, such as levy bodies, some Maori entities, charities, and local authorities, will be excluded. General business entities This change would make listed companies, partnerships and trusts eligible for refundability, and there would be no wage intensity requirement. This change will allow most Maori organisations to be eligible. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 13 Levy bodies Levy bodies would be eligible for refundability under this option. Charities Under this option charitable organisations that perform eligible R&D activities would be ineligible for refundable tax credits. Charities are currently treated as carrying on a business in New Zealand for the purposes of being eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Excluding charities means that this rule would be removed for consistency to ensure they are excluded from being eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Excluding charities means that businesses wholly-owned by charities are excluded, because these are also considered charities. However, this option does not exclude other associated entities. This means if a tax paying business donates to a charity, even one controlled by that business, this would not invalidate the business’s access to the R&D Tax Incentive. It would also mean that a charity could set up a partially controlled business entity, subject to the rules within the constitution of the charity, which could be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. In relation to Māori organisations, a small number of post-settlement governance entities have registered as charities. As discussed above, businesses that are wholly- owned by these charitable entities would also be ineligible. Businesses that are partially controlled by these charities would be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Local authorities Under this option local authorities would be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. However, council controlled organisations would be eligible. Other tax-exempt organisations This option excludes tax-exempt organisations from being eligible to receive refunds. The exclusion would not apply to entities that receive exempt income from dividends (no change from the status quo) or to levy bodies. Options for constraining the amount that is refundable The main options available are: • The status quo • A PAYE cap • A tangible economic presence (TEP) test • A ‘payroll’ taxes cap Status quo The status quo limited refundability rules allow firms with eligible R&D expenditure that meet the corporate and wage-intensity eligibility rules to claim a maximum refund per year of $255,000. A PAYE cap A PAYE cap would allow firms with eligible R&D expenditure to have their R&D tax credits refunded up to a maximum amount equal to the amount of PAYE paid by the firm in the relevant income year. A TEP test A TEP test would allow firms with eligible R&D expenditure to have their R&D tax credits refunded as long as they satisfied a test of tangible economic presence, up to a maximum of $5 million per year. A TEP test would be designed to ensure that a ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 14 firm has 'skin in the game', and that it physically exists with premises and staff, rather than just existing on paper as a shell company. A TEP test would be met where at least one of the following applied: • A business's PAYE for the year is equal to or greater than their R&D tax credit claim. This ensures a proportionate TEP because the firm is paying tax on behalf of its employees and cannot take out more than it puts in to the tax system. • A chartered accountant or practising lawyer has certified that a business has TEP. The certifier would testify to the firm's TEP, having actually met the staff/seen the premises. • Inland Revenue has completed a review (for example, checking the ~ i~ g history of a business; visiting a business's site; and/or confirming tt("~) ~ f shareholders or directors) and is satisfied that a business has TEP~~ • A business's R&D tax credit claim only includes amounts ~ Q,\_~ approved research provider to perform R&D activities on their ~~ l~ vh:s> provides an easily verified audit trail to determine TEP. <\\.

Which entities will be eligible for a refund Based on the above analysis, the preferred combination of options is for general business entities and levy bodies to be eligible for refundability, and for charities, local authorities, and other organisations that receive (non-dividend) exempt income to be ineligible.

Businesses will e~eive the financial support of the R&O Tax Incentive earlier or, in some instances, w P{f actually get a benefit where they previously would not have. The key advantage to a refundable tax credit is it provides cash closer to the point when firms, particularly R&O intensive firms, are undertaking their R&O. Broader refundability will provide increased certainty to businesses, with broad and simple eligibility, and receipt of cash refunds each year rather than having to carry forward credits that may be lost due to continuity breaches. The refundability available in year one is expected to be limited to approximately 350­ 650 firms, and 65-130 of those are expected to hit the cap on refundability. The proposed broader refundability has simpler eligibility criteria, and would be available to a larger number of firms, estimated at 750-1200 firms in 2019 (or 550-1100 firms, after allowing for some firms to remain on the Callaghan Innovation Growth Grant). The wider coverage and increased cash flow to businesses performing R&O is expected to lead to increased R&D investment by those businesses. Increased coverage of R&D-performing firms (and higher incentives for firms to en a e in R&D is ex ected to result in an increase in innovative activit , ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 23 employment, and labour productivity growth, particularly among firms that did not qualify for limited refundability. A higher level of R&D expenditure will result in greater spillover benefits to other participants in the economy. The proposed constraint on refundability is not anticipated to restrict refunds for the vast majority of R&D performers. It means that all firms would have some immediate benefit and a few would have less than full refundability. Given the R&D Tax Incentive scheme is relatively broad and accessible, the proposed refundability restrictions do not fundamentally alter the incentives of the scheme. Overall, and compared with most other jurisdictions, the proposed policy represents a comprehensive approach to refundability. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 24 5.2 Summar table of costs and benefits of the referred a roach Comment: nature of cost or benefit, risks R&D performing Compliance costs firms Administration costs Impact I Evidence \_certainty Administering agency Wider government ~ I Higher fiscal costs because of wider co~~s +--P-o-te-n-ti\_a\_lly\_h\_i-gh\_e\_r\_f-is-ca\_l\_c\_o\_st\_s\_o\_f\_R\_&\_D\_T\_a\_x\_\_Lo\_w\_\_\_ and more incentive to claim.

There is a potential risk that by providing broader refundability, businesses are motivated to recharacterise non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure or make fraudulent claims. The Tax Incentive has been designed to reduce the likelihood of, and opportunities to recharacterise non-R&D expenditure. This includes requiring a close nexus between the R&D activity and the expenses claimed. The proposal to broaden eligibility for refundability includes a 'payroll' taxes cap on refunds to mitigate the fraud, fiscal, and integrity risks associated with p~air;:"'\\\\Ut cash. ~~L Businesses would be entitled to a full refund of their R&D tax cred~~~ ~ ~)~ ,tent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ·~pr~1¥-c-a ~ aid in the relevant income year. 13 \\) Payments to Approved Research Providers are not includ~o, t ~ cap as it will be easy to verify that these payments have actually been)-~ ~~'!tiffea firm.

There L .r ~'JleJTlpatibility between this regulatory proposal and the Government's ' Ex~ t ~ or the design of regulatory systems'. 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? Legislation will need to be enacted to give effect to broader refundability. It is proposed that broader refundability come into effect from businesses' 2020/21 income year. Therefore, it is proposed that the legislative changes needed to give effect to broader refundability be included in a tax bill scheduled to be introduced in June 2019, which would make changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Inland Revenue is leading implementation of the R&D Tax Incentive through the tax system, and will also be responsible for implementing broader refundability. Inland Revenue will identify and mitigate operational risk so that broader refundability can be delivered successfully. Inland Revenue has the necessary capabilities and capacity to implement broader refundability through its systems. 13 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, FBT, employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) and withholding tax on schedular payments (WT). ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 28 It is expected that broader refundability will pose minimal compliance and administrative costs. No material change is expected for the R&D supplementary return. Instead of carrying forward non-refundable R&D tax credits, most firms will be able to receive R&D tax credit refunds. Any increase in administrative costs would be negligible, because Inland Revenue intends to carry out checks and reviews on claims from year one. The existing core team of Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation officials will continue to work on claims after broader refundability is introduced. Inland Revenue, working with the other agencies, will develop guidance material on the broader refundability proposals and the impact of these on busines~ ~Q\_ce broader refundability expands on the new R&D Tax Incentive, therej re n ~~~~tar transition issues.

Feedback highlighted the need for !€ar guidance and education material. Businesses engaged with on the broader ref undability proposals reaffirmed the need for simple rules and low compliance costs. As mentioned above, the broader refundability proposals contain eligibility criteria that are simpler than the year one limited refundability criteria. The proposed broader refundability rules do not require corporate eligibility and wage intensity tests to be satisfied, and rely on the existing (easier) rules of the R&D Tax Incentive. Allowing for broader refundability also reduces the need for continuous tracking of shareholder continuity, because once refunded credits are no longer at risk of being extinguished through breaches of shareholder continuity rules. This is particularly beneficial for smaller, R&D intensive start-ups which may regularly seek new investors to boost funding for their R&D projects. Implementation risks arise where businesses re-characterise non-R&D expenditure as R&D expenditure in order to claim a larger tax credit. The incentive for re­ characterisation is greater with broader refund ability, because firms can receive cash refunds (rather than having to wait until they come into profit to utilise their R&D tax credits . The olic and le islation has been develo ed to mana e this risk, althou h ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 29 it cannot be eliminated. The proposed 'payroll' taxes cap on refunds will be backed up by existing administrative processes, such as in-year approval and IR audits. There needs to be strong uptake of the R&D Tax Incentive by businesses for the incentive to be successful. As indicated by the submissions received on the Bill, broader refundability is an important part of ensuring businesses transition to the scheme. Inland Revenue, Callaghan Innovation and MBIE officials have engaged with stakeholders on the broader refundability proposals. Guidance will also be developed by Inland Revenue, which will sit alongside the tax legislation, to provide claimants with more information about the broader refundability proposals.

RDAG had its first meeting in January 2019. Officials also have regular meetings and discussions with a broader range of stakeholders, at which policy and implementation issues are discussed. It is expected that RDAG and these regular stakeholder discussions will enable officials to conduct on-going monitoring and review of the impact of broader refundability. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 30 Bibliography Appelt, S., M.

Country Refundability policy Other relevant factors Australia Limits refundability to: • firms with turnover less than A$20m & • subject to a A$4m annual cap. The cap is proposed but legislation not yet passed. It is designed to reduce the costs of the scheme. The cap equates to A$10m eligible expenditure UK – SMEs Firms in loss can cash out their tax 14 credit at a discount to their value. The UK government is currently consulting on introducing a cap relating to PAYE payments. The SME scheme is more generous than the large firm scheme. SMEs must have: • fewer than 500 employees and • turnover less than EUR 100m. UK – large For non-SMEs, the tax credit is firms paid before tax, so loss making firms benefit equally with profitable firms, subject to not exceeding the amount of PAYE and National Insurance Contribution paid. Norway Full refundability for tax paying entities. The tax credit operates with a very low cap. The maximum credit is (approx.) NZ$2m, and in most cases is NZ$1m. The tax credit is not available to non-taxpayers. Ireland Full refundability, but paid in instalments over 3 years, and subject to limits relating to amounts of corporate income tax paid or amounts of payroll tax paid. Netherlands Full refundability but limited to a firm’s payroll tax liability. Canada The credit is fully refundable for Canadian Controlled Private Corporations up to an expenditure limit of CAD 3 million. Higher expenditure is only 40% refundable. The tax credit rate is 35% up to eligible expenditure of CAD 3 million, and 15% for higher amounts. 14 Firms in loss can cash out 14.5% of surrenderable losses (these are the lesser of their trading loss and 230% of the R&D spend). ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 32             The table above demonstrates different mechanisms can be used for constraining refundability. Here are some brief comments on each of them: Eligibility for refundability based on firm characteristic (generally a measure of size such as turnover) • can target refundability to firms that, potentially, benefit most from it – ie, smaller or early stage firms • creates boundaries which might disincentivise desired behaviours – eg, a firm may choose not to grow to keep turnover below the threshold • relatively simple to understand but measurement would introduce complexity Refundability applies up to a cap; credits above cap carried forward • refundability addresses cash flow needs • less of a boundary issue so less likely to impact on firm behaviours (though incentive to increase R&D spend may diminish above cap) • relatively easy to understand and apply Limit refundability based on other taxes paid • if based on PAYE paid, more like a backstop rather than a fiscal cap as for most businesses the amount of PAYE across the whole firm will exceed 15% of the cost of R&D • useful as a possible fraud deterrent as it should ensure a firm has a tangible economic presence, and may also prevent exploitation of a loophole if that involved claiming credits for high non-wage costs • operates as some form of integrity and fiscal constraint measure, in that a firm cannot “take out” more than it is “putting in” to the tax system. • some firms may not pay PAYE – eg, staff are not employees and are either shareholders who are paid a shareholder salary, contractors or provide sweat equity. This suggests either using a wider definition of taxes paid 15 or making a provision for firms to apply for an exemption • administratively easy to understand and apply (subject to exceptions for firms without employees) Refund credits at a discount • supports loss making firms while providing an incentive to become profitable • provides firms with a choice whether to refund the credit or carry it forward • perhaps less easy to understand but relatively easy to apply Spread refundability over several years • more complex to track a firm’s position • for a firm in a long-term loss making position, will produce similar results to full year refundability after a few years • creates a tail of Government liability Target refundability based on R&D intensity This mechanism is not used by any other country for targeting refundability (though in Australia R&D intensity influences the credit rate for large enterprises) but is worth considering as it is the basis of the year one scheme. • can target refundability to those most deserving of it 15 One possibility would be to include adding withholding taxes paid. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 33 • creates a boundary that might give rise to perverse behaviours • different measures of R&D intensity may favour different types of R&D performing firms • though relatively easy to understand, adds complexity to compliance and administration. ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 34 Appendix 2 The examples below provide a practical illustration of how without refundability, firms do not receive a cash benefit from a tax credit if they are in loss or have insufficient income tax liability. This table provides a simple example of how a profitable firm uses a tax credit to reduce the amount of tax it has to pay in a year: Income Expenses (includes 100 of eligible R&D) Net profit/(loss) Income tax liability (28% x Net profit) R&D tax credit (15% x eligible R&D) Net tax to pay 15 13 300 400 (100) come tax liability (28% x Net profit) 0 R&D tax credit (15% x eligible R&D) 15 Unused R&D tax credits to carry forward to future years 15 This table provides a simple example of a profitable firm that has insufficient income tax liability to receive the full benefit of a tax credit without refundability: Profitable firm with insufficient income tax liability (without refundability) Income 310 Expenses (includes 100 of eligible R&D) 300 Net profit/(loss) 10 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 35 Income tax liability (28% x Net profit) 2.8 R&D tax credit (15% x eligible R&D) 15 Unused R&D tax credits to carry forward to future years 12.2 This table shows how a loss-making firm receives an immediate benefit from a refundable tax credit: Income Expenses (includes 100 of eligible R&D) Net profit/(loss) Income tax liability (28% x Net profit) R&D tax credit (15% x eligible R&D) 0 15 15 ar3irldm3t 2019-06-17 14:29:36 36 • MINISTRY OF BUSINESS, llntand Revenue .

The Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill reflects the policy decisions taken to date by Cabinet for the R&D Tax Incentive as part of “Phase 1”. The tight timeframes has meant that some issues were deferred. These will be addressed under Phase 2. 2. Cabinet has agreed that by April 2020 a more comprehensive policy will be in place to support businesses in loss so they can better benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive. This followed from the advice provided on how to support loss-making firms \[MBIE 3950 17-18; IR2018/499 refers\]. 3. This paper provides further details on work to be undertaken in order to meet the commitment that a new policy on refundability will be in place by April 2020. It also sets out the work that will be done on the R&D tax loss cash out scheme in parallel. Supporting businesses in loss Refundability enables business in loss to benefit from the R&D Tax Incentive 4. Refundability refers to the policy of paying out in cash the tax credit for firms in loss. As part of the work around design and implementation of the R&D Tax Incentive, we have been considering further actions that need to be undertaken as part of “Phase 2” of the scheme, including on the issue of refundability. 5. The R&D Tax Incentive encourages businesses to perform R&D by reducing the amount of tax they have to pay when they have undertaken R&D. However, firms in loss do not pay tax. This is particularly a challenge for new and start-up business where the evidence suggests that R&D intensive firms typically spend their early years in a tax loss position. Such firms also have a lower probability of becoming profitable (at least in short term) so cannot use tax credits to improve their cash-flow position. 6. This issue also has resonance for atypical businesses, some of which are structured never to incur an income tax liability, and therefore would never be eligible for refunds of their tax credit. It is likewise an issue for businesses that do not make a stable profit. Refundability in Year One will be limited 7. The Government has already signalled that it recognises the importance of supporting businesses that undertake R&D but that are not yet making a profit, therefore having insufficient taxable income to effectively use any tax credits. 8. It has partially responded to the issue of providing support for firms in loss in the current design of the R&D Tax Incentive by providing a limited form of refundability from 1 April 2019 (the first year of the new scheme). To make this straightforward to administer and to meet legislative timeframes, officials have largely adapted the parameters operated under the existing R&D Tax Loss Cash Out scheme in order to help provide refunds under the new R&D Tax Incentive. 9. R&D Tax Loss Cash Out was introduced in 2015. It was designed to help R&D-intensive start- up or other small firms that might be struggling with cash flow issues, especially before they have been able to take products or services to market, by allowing them to “cash out” a proportion of their tax losses rather than carry them forward. As a condition of receiving this 1560 18-19; IR 2018/688 In Confidence 2 support, at least 20 percent of the firm’s labour costs must be R&D related, and the maximum eligible R&D spend that can be claimed is capped at $1.7m (in 2019/20). 1 10.The decision to mirror these provisions for the R&D Tax Incentive was a combination of expedience and cautiousness, in that the constraints with the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out are more restrictive than are likely to apply subsequently, and broadly it is easier to relax rather than tighten constraints over the longer term. In Year One of the R&D Tax Incentive at least 20% of claimant labour costs must be R&D related, and eligible businesses can “cash out” up to $225,000 of their R&D losses (or 15 percent of $1.7m). Parameters for Phase 2 11.Such eligibility constraints are unlikely to work effectively as a policy on refundability in the long term because they limit the amount of benefit that firms in loss can achieve from the R&D Tax Credit unless they carry their credits forward. The Government has therefore committed to putting in place a more effective policy from April 2020. It has also indicated that it will use this opportunity to review the operation of the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out scheme. 12.A number of countries in the OECD (such as the Netherlands, Norway, the UK and Australia) allow for a measure of refundability as part of their fiscal incentives to incentivise R&D investment. Therefore addressing the issue will ensure that the proposed New Zealand regime is competitively attractive in international terms. 13.Nevertheless, for a number of reasons we recommend that refundability be approached with some caution. Firstly the Government needs to protect against the risk of fraudulent claims. Where tax systems are based on self-assessment, as in New Zealand, there is a tension between processing returns in a timely way and investigating whether they are genuine. Tax administrators rely on being able to investigate returns after they have been processed. Where funds have been paid out, but the claim is fraudulent, the entity may have disappeared leaving no ability to recoup the funds. 14.Secondly, evidence from other jurisdictions suggests that the fastest growing portion of their costs relating to their R&D tax incentives has been refunds for small firms in loss. This has particularly been an issue of concern in Australia and has led to subsequent changes in design after concerns about increased affordability of the scheme. Discussions with officials in those countries suggest that this rapid growth is associated with more spurious claims, including some re-characterisation of non-R&D expenditure. Issues for further examination 15.There are a number of design features that officials need to consider in order to design an effective and sustainable refundable tax credit for the long term. These include: a. The safeguards that need to be built in to manage risk and ensure the integrity of the tax system while supporting the wider policy goals of the initiative: It is important to ensure that any ultimate policy reduces fiscal risks from illegitimate or uneconomic claims. This might be done, for example, through the use of caps, turnover and pre-approval measures, as well as refunds at a discount, deferral of receiving refunds, and the time-bound eligibility for refunds. b. What can be learnt from international comparisons: We need to consider the approaches used by other countries, particularly those within 1 The cap has been rising by $0.3M per year, starting from $0.5M in the 2015/16 year. 1560 18-19; IR 2018/688 In Confidence 3 the OECD; and how the NZ R&D Tax Incentive is positioned in relation to those. c. Whether entities not structured to derive taxable income should be refunded ( - atypical businesses including charities and levy bodies): There are a range of organisations of different types that might fall within this group – for example, atypical businesses, Māori-owned businesses, charities, levy bodies, and tolling operations. As well as considering whether such a policy would incentivise more or have little impact on the amount of R&D they currently conduct, we also need to consider whether it is reasonable to treat them the same as taxpaying businesses, despite them not being taxpayers in some cases. Other issues to consider within Phase 2 16.Alongside the question of refundability, we recommend undertaking a review of the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out scheme to avoid any misalignment between the two initiatives. Many of the firms currently eligible for the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out will also be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive so questions arise as to how each policy complements the other and how to reduce compliance burdens for applicants. This would include:  Considering how the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out has been performing over the past 3 years in areas such as take-up and fiscal cost, and what impact it has made on R&D activity. It would be useful also to consider its interaction with other policy areas such as loss continuity (as this impacts on desirability of cashed out losses), as well as to consider whether any further targeting or safeguards are required as part of its operation.  Reviewing policy goals for R&D Tax Loss Cash Out and whether these need adjusting in light of the R&D Tax Incentive’s introduction, so that overall budgetary costs can be managed sensibly while government provides support to where it is needed most. This might include harmonisation in areas such as eligible activity, R&D definitions, eligible entities, and eligible expenditure. 17.Finally, though it will be too early to have gained operational insights into the legislation, it is possible that issues will have been identified that require remedial attention. Potential Phase 3 issues 18.There are also additional measures that officials consider should be considered in “Phase 3” – that is they would be introduced from the third year of the Tax Incentive (April 2021) or later. This could include in-year payments for businesses in loss, and the development of software packages that could automate a firm’s claim for eligible expenditure. There are also other changes that could simplify firms’ compliance, such as alternate rules for calculating overheads. In addition, as experience is gained with the operation of the Incentive, there may be a need to make further adjustments to the scheme. Timelines and next steps 19.Legislation for the R&D Tax Incentive has now been introduced into Parliament with its First Reading on 1 November. Legislation associated with Phase 2 policy which would make changes to the R&D Tax Incentive could therefore not be practically introduced until the Phase 1 legislation has been enacted (not expected before the end of second quarter 2019). 20.However, we believe it is important to begin work now internally amongst officials to consider the issues in depth in order to help develop appropriate policy options. This would mean that changes to legislation can then effectively be carried out during the first quarter of 2019, and would ensure that revised legislation could be put forward as early as September 2019 (as soon as Phase 1 legislation is enacted). 1560 18-19; IR 2018/688 In Confidence 4 21. We also recommend consulting with public stakeholders to better understand the impacts of any proposed policy on businesses. One option is to conduct a full consultation alongside the lines of the earlier Discussion Document that was issued in April. This would require the agreement of Cabinet. 22. However, we think this may risk "consultation fatigue" as in November and December the Select Committee will already be seeking submissions from the public on the current round of legislation. Additionally, March 2019 will be close to the go-live date for Inland Revenue's Business Transformation Release 3, and so tax and professional services stakeholders will be busy supporting their customers. Instead we recommend a less formal but still structured approach. This would seek views from those represented on the R&D Tax AdvisoryA :;0up to be established by IR.

With legislation to introduce the Government’s R&D tax incentive progressing t hrough Parliament, officials are now considering the following policy issues tha t h ad been deferred to a secondary phase : •A comprehensive policy on refundability (the Bill currently provides for l imited refundability to loss-making and pre-profit businesse s) •T reatment of tax-exempt organisations (the first-year policy on re fundability excludes entities that receive tax exempt income ) •Op tion s for the future of the R&D tax loss cash out (this policy wa s i ntroduced in 2015 to address the effect of distortions in the tax system o n R &D intensive start-ups ) 2. A key aim of the Government’s R&D tax incentive is to expand access to R &D s upport to a wider and more diverse range of firms and to provide firms with th e c ertainty and confidence to increase their investment in R&D. The policy intent i s to create a regime that is accessible, internationally competitive and sustainable . 3. Th ese objectives have guided our thinking on the following proposals which w e p ropose form the basis of stakeholder engagement. The stakeholder engagemen t w ill be used to seek feedback on and test the implications of the options describe d b elow (noting that Ministers have not yet taken final policy decisions) . Re fundability and treatment of tax-exempt organisation s 4. W e propose that refundability of the R&D tax credit for firms in loss or wi th in sufficient profit should be widely available. This is consistent with the objectiv e o f providing broad-based support for R&D. However, in order to manage the risk s th at refundability creates to the sustainability of the scheme, officials propose tha t th e amount paid to an organisation in a single year would be limited by : •th e amount of PAYE paid (this ensures a firm has a tangible economi c presence and that what firms receive from the tax system does not exceed w hat they have contributed); an d •a cap on refunds of $5 million (this will ensure that Growth Grant recipient s a re not worse off by moving to the tax incentive ). 5 . We are aware that some firms legitimately do not pay PAYE and we will use th e s takeholder engagement to explore the extent of this issue and th e a ppropriateness of using alternative taxes paid as a constraint on refundability . 6 . The quality of, and positive externalities from, R&D under taken by tax-exemp t o rganisations is likely to be similar to that of taxable entities. Therefore, from th e p erspective of growing New Zealand-based R&D, it makes sense for the ta x i ncentive to be refundable for tax-exempt organisations with no furt her r estrictions than those that apply to taxable entities. However, we intend to us e IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 1 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence the stakeholder engagement as an opportunity to build a better understanding of the type and amount of R&D that is undertaken by tax-exempt organisations. The R&D tax loss cash out 7.The tax loss cash out is intended to mitigate distortions in the tax system that p articularly affect R&D intensive start-up companies. The policy allows qualifyin g f irms to receive cash for their losses that relate to R&D rather than waiting unti l th e firm is profitable to obtain the benefit of a tax deduction. About 350 fir ms have registered for the scheme. The introduction of the R&D tax incentive p rovides an opportunity to consider options for the future of the tax loss cash ou t i ncluding : •Re taining it as a separate instrument but with some amendments such a s a ligning the definition of R&D with the tax incentive and tightening i ts e ligibility criteria, o r •i ncorporating it as an additional support for start-up firms delivered via a n e xtension to the tax incentive, o r •ce asing the tax loss cash out . 8. T he engagement with stakeholders provides an opportunity to test ou r u nderstanding of the impact that the tax loss cash out has had on firms, to see k insights into administrative issues such as the value of aligning the R&D definition w ith the tax incentive, and to explore whether it would create confusion to retai n t he two separate instruments . 9. I f Ministers agree to these proposals, officials will commence a process o f s takeholder engagement. We anticipate providing you advice in April so tha t C abinet approval and legislation can follow later in the year . R ecommended action 10. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment and Inland Revenue re commend that you : 1 0.1 Agree that officials commence stakeholder engagement on phase 2 of th e R& D tax incentive 10.2 Agree that the proposals that will form the basis of this engagement are: 10.2.1 Refundability of the tax credit for firms in loss or with insufficient profit should be widely available, with the only constraints being that the amount paid to an organisation in a single year would be limited by the amount of PAYE paid and capped at $5 million. 10.2.2 No further restrictions would apply to tax-exempt organisations. 10.2.3 Options for the future of the R&D tax loss cash out could include: aligning it with the tax incentive and tightening its eligibility , i ncorporating it as an additional support for start-up firms delivere d v ia an extension to the tax incentive, o r ce asing the tax loss cash out . 10 .3 Agree to refer this report to the Minister of Finance IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 2 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence 10.4 Note that officials will report back to you following the stakeholder engagement.

The proposals relate to : •H ow refundability of the tax credit could apply from 1 April 202 0 •Whether there should be limits on refundability for non -tax paying o rganisation s •O ptions for the future of the R&D Tax Loss Cash O ut 12 . Your agreement to these proposals does not represent final Governmen t d ecisions. The proposals will form the basis of officials’ engagement wi th s takeholders. Officials will brief you following this engagement and recommen d p roposals you can take to Cabinet for final decisions . Co ntext and background 13.The R&D tax incentive was developed under tight timeframes. Consequently , t here was not time to resolve some complex issues before the legislation wa s dra fted . 14 . Cabinet agreed to provide limited refundability for firms in loss for the first year of th e tax incentive and you committed to review the policy that would apply f rom t he second year. The two-year transition for Growth Grant recipients meant firm s w ere not disadvantaged, relative to their current situation , in this delay t o e stablishing the longer-term policy . 1 5. The R&D tax loss cash out is a separate policy from the R&D tax incentive. But th e a dvent of the tax incentive and the high overlap between recipients under eac h p olicy means it is timely to review it . 16. You have previously agreed to the scope and timeframes for this Phase 2 policy w ork ( 1560 18-19; IR2018/688 refers). If you agree with these proposals, we w ill h old workshops with stakeholders to get their feedback. We anticipate providin g y ou advice in April so that Cabinet approval and legislation can follow later in th e y ea r. R efundability Why it is an issue 17.Refundability refers to paying out the tax credit if the business has insufficient ta x l iability. The alternative to refunding the credit is for firms to carry it forward an d u se it when they become profitable . 18.Providing a refund ensures that all firms doing R&D receiv e e qual support. Fo r i nstance, an established business can support R&D through profits from i ts e xisting products, and therefore can immediately benefit from a tax credit . S imilarly a large conglomerate can support a loss-making R&D division throu gh p rofit s from other parts of a business. By contrast, a start-up firm will not hav e o ffsetting profits from other activities and – unless its credits are refunded – ma y n ot be able to benefit from the tax credit until a much later date, if at all . 19 . Refundability provides financial support for R&D whe n it is most needed. In mos t cases, a firm will engage in R&D expenditure prior to receiving revenue from c ommercialising its product. Therefore, not only are R&D-intensive firms mor e l ikely to be in loss, they are also more likely to be cash constrained. For thes e IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 4 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence firms, cash today will be much more valuable than a credit that is carried forward until the firm becomes profitable. 20.Additionally, credits carried forward while a firm is in loss are at risk if the fir m breac hes shareholder continuity rules relating to the credit. This is more likely to oc cur where there is significant new equity investment in a firm before it reache s p rofitability . 21 . However, paying out to businesses, rather than reducing the amount of tax the y pay, increases the fraud risk for Inland Revenue. This is not particular to R&D tax c redits but is seen with other parts of the tax system such as donor tax credi ts a nd GST refunds . 22 . Refunds also increase the fiscal cost of a scheme. In countries where credits ar e re funded, fiscal cost growth is faster amongst those firms getting refunds . D iscussions with officials in Australia and the UK suggest that some of thi s i ncreased cost is associated with marginal quality R&D – cash payments for small , s tart -up fir ms are a powerful lure for some firms so encourage reclassifying othe r e xpenditure as R&D or claiming for activity that is not R&D. In those countries, a l arge number of claims has made it difficult to counter this risk through audi t. 23 . In summary, providing refundability generates positive net benefits but adds ris k to the tax incentive scheme. Therefore, the question is not whether to have r efundability or not but how to manage the risks associated with it . I nternational approaches 24.In developing a proposal for New Zealand, we have taken note of other countries ’ p olicies . 25. Across the OECD, most countries have R&D tax credits but fewer than half provide r efundability. Australia, being the country with which New Zealand businesse s mo st readily make com par isons , only has refundability for small to medium size d f irms . 2 6. Appendix 1 summarises the policies applied in other OECD countries that d o p rovide refunds and describes the strengths and drawbacks of each policy . 2 7. There is no uniformity as to how constraints are applied, but some broa d ob servations are : •S ome constraint on refundability is the norm; a system with no restriction s o n refundability would be an outlier amongst OECD countrie s •t he different ways in which refundability is limited often reflect difference s in the underlying tax incentive scheme •some countries limit refundability to SMEs and start-ups •i t is relatively common to limit refunds by reference to other taxes paid b y t he firm . Refundability in relation to other features of the R&D Tax Incentive 28.New Zealand’s tax incentive differs from most other countries through its lack o f targeting. The three countries we studied in most depth in designing the New Z ealand scheme either have higher credit rates for smaller companies (Australi a a nd UK) or have such a low cap the scheme is effectively limited to SME s ( Norway). New Zealand’s scheme has neither of these features . IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 5 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence 29.Another aspect of the R&D tax incentive is that it is replacing the Growth Grant. T hough not explicitly stated by the Government, Growth Grant recipients have a n e xpectation that they will not be disadvantaged by moving to the tax incentive . 30. Loss -making firms can receive up to $5 million per year from a Growth Grant. U nder the tax incentive this would equate to incurring around $33 million o f e ligible expenditure. This is a relatively high level of R&D expenditure. Based on G rowth Grant recipients, only 5 New Zealand organisations currently exceed it an d of these 2 are loss making. There will be some non-Gro wth Grant recipients wh o m ay also exceed this level but we are less certain of the number . 31 . By comparison, the maximum level of eligible expenditure for refundability i n Au stralia is around A$10 million . 32 . These factors suggest that targeting refundability ex clusively to small an d m edium -sized businesses would be incompatible with other features of the ta x i ncentive and that a cap for eligible expenditure under $33 million would b e p erceived as less generous than the Growth Grant . F raud and fiscal risks 33.One reason to constrain refundability is fraud risk. Despite efforts to restrain i t, d etermined organisations are frequently able to find ways to fabricate losses, an d once payments have been made it can be difficult if not impossible to recover the f unds . 3 4. A co mmon approach in other jurisdictions is to limit refunds to the amount paid i n o ther taxes such as PAYE 1 . This ensures a firm has a tangible economic presence, a nd therefore means it is less likely to be operating fraudulently. It also operate s a s something of an integrity measure for the tax system because it means wh at f irms receive from the tax system does not exceed what they have contributed . 35 . Administratively, checking how much PAYE is paid by a firm is straightforward . 36 . In-year approval of the R&D activity, which will apply from year 2, will provide a f urther element of robustness because it will potentially give an early warning of su spicious claims . S takeholder views 37.An indication of what stakeholders think is provided by their submissions on t he T axation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill to the Finance an d E xpenditure Committee . 3 8. All submitters who have commented on this issue think the tax credit should b e r efundable to a greater extent than it will be in the first year. Some of them argu e f or no limits on refundability. Others contemplate some form of refundability suc h as: •L imited by level of firm turnover or a tax incentive less than a certai n a mount (Corporate Taxpayers Group ) •A cap of $5 million on the amount of tax credit refunded (EY ). P roposals for refundability 39.In terms of establishing the p olicy on refundability, the key question is whether i t s hould be unrestrained or whether there should be some restrictions. On balance , w e think there should be some restrictions, for the following reasons : 1 For most firms, the amount of PAYE they pay will exceed 15% of the amount of R&D they undertake because all employees in the firm will contribute to the PAYE total whereas R&D is usually only one part of the firm’s activities. There will, however, be some firms that (quite legitimately) do not pay PAYE. IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 6 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence •Some form of constraint linked to other taxes paid can make fraud less l ikely . •T he R&D tax incentive is new and not all the risks are well understood . Maintaining some constraint will be useful until there is a bette r un derstanding of how the scheme is operating . •G iven the proposed R&D tax credit is relatively broad and accessible, th e p roposed refundability restrictions do not fundamentally alter th e incentives of the scheme. •O ther countries offering R&D tax incentives have generally put constraint s o n refundability in place . •If the c onstraints are relatively light-handed they are unlikely to have a m aterial impact on the amount of R&D encouraged by the tax incentive . 40 . It is therefore recommended that the proposals on refundability with whic h o fficials will engage externally are : •The amount of tax credit refunded in any one year cannot exceed the a mount of PAYE the firm has paid in the same year, an d •T he maximum tax credit paid out in any year is $5 million . •Excess credits that are not refunded in a particular year can be carried f orward subject to the credit continuity rules and can be refunded in futur e y ears, subject to the above conditions . 4 1. Framing the constraints in this way is not anticipated to restrict refunds for th e m ajority of R&D performers. It means that all firms would have some refund an d a few would have less than full refundability. This differs from the Australia n a pproach where there is a hard boundary in the form of a turnover threshol d w hich means that if a firm grows, it switches from receiving refunds to n ot re ceiving any . 4 2. Overall, and compared with most other jurisdictions, the proposed policy for Ne w Ze aland represents a comprehensive approach to refundability. We therefor e co nsider it will be reasonably well received. Issues that might be contentious, a nd w hich we would want to explore with stakeholders, include : •So me firms may pay little or no PAYE. For instance, their staff are n ot e mployees and are paid a shareholder salary or provide sweat equity. W e a re interested in understanding how prevalent this issue might be amongs t R &D performers and whether an alternative definition of taxes paid 2 woul d b e more appropriate . •The impact of the $5 million cap. We think some cap on refunds would be p rudent as a backstop but this would have to be balanced against an y e vidence that it would disincentivise firms from expanding their R&D . T ax exempt organisations Which organisations are tax-exempt 43.Within the Income Tax Act, there are different types of tax-exempt organisations , in cluding charities, public authorities and local authorities, sports promotin g bodies, and science and industrial research promoting bodies. In some cases, the l egislation deems these bodies to be tax-exempt and in other cases th e 2 One possibility would be to add FBT, withholding tax on scheduler payments (WT) and employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) paid. IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 7 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence organisation elects to have the tax-exempt status. These categories include levy bodies . 4 4. Māori authorities are not tax-exempt (they pay tax at 17.5% rather than at th e company rate of 28%), but some post-settlement governance entities have re gistered as charities and Māori organisations often have charitable entitie s w ithin their structures. Consequently, tax-exempt organisations includ e o rganisations considered Māori organisations . Why it is an issue 45 . T he first-year policy on refundability excludes entities that receive exemp t i ncome. They are eligible for the tax incentive but, because they do not have a n i ncome-tax liability, they will not benefit from the incentive without refundabilit y 46. Th e main argument for making the credit refundable for these organisations i s th at the quality of their R&D and the spillovers arising from it are not likely to b e a ny different from private-sector organisations. Therefore, from the perspective o f grow ing New Zealand-based R&D it makes sense to include them . 47. So me tax-exempt organisations, such as levy bodies, may already be receivin g g overnment financial support from a different programme 3 . However, the rules a pplying to the tax incentive mean that R&D that has been funded by anothe r g overnment grant is not eligible for the tax incentive, so providing fo r r efundability of the R&D that is eligible should not lead to double dippin g. 48. Finally, there is an argument that organisations that have chosen to be tax- exempt organisations should not subsequently receive benefits from the ta x sy stem . One concern is that organisations that are not paying tax can accumulat e a ssets faster than comparable taxpaying businesses so are better able to fun d investments including R&D. Another concern is that organisations may choose to p lace their profitable operations in a tax-exempt structure while treating thei r l oss -making parts as taxable entities . P roposal for tax-exempt organisations 4 9. O fficials are in the process of getting a better picture of the type and amount of R& D that is undertaken by organisations that are tax-exempt. We consider th e s takeholder engagement will be an opportunity to extend our knowledge . 50. H owever, we are conscious that these types of discussions could rai se e xpectations amongst tax-exempt organisations that they will be eligible fo r re funds of their tax credits if they are eligible for the tax incentive . 51. A lso, we consider there may be allegations of unfairness if organisations that a re u ndertaking R&D are shut out of the tax incentive as a result of not providi ng r efundability for tax-exempt organisations . 52. W e consider the arguments in favour of refundability for tax-exempt organisation s are stronger than the arguments opposing it. Consequently, the proposal is that t he stakeholder engagement would be based on the premise that tax-exemp t o rganisations would be eligible for the refund of their R&D tax credits, with onl y t he restrictions applying to taxpaying firms applying to them . 3 For example, the Endeavour Fund or Primary Growth Partnership IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 8 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence The R&D Tax Loss Cash Out Background 53.The R&D Tax Loss Cash Out was introduced in 2015 and allows some firms tha t perform R&D to cash out their losses, up to the amount of their R&D spend, s o t hey receive 28% of the relevant amount 4 . 5 4. The scheme has been designed to support R&D intensive firms. R&D intensi ty p rovides a way of targeting firms in the early phase of their development 5 . Thi s g roup of firms have been selected for support because : •T hey are likely to be cash-constrained. Their R&D might not yet hav e d eveloped a viable product so they will struggle to attract investors and th e a bsence of a commercial product means they are not earning revenue . •T hey are more likely to be at risk of breaching the loss continuity rule s w ithin the tax system so the losses are no longer available for the firm 6 . 55 . In terms of the immediate cash benefit provided by the policy, it functions like a 2 8% tax credit. However, an important difference from a standard tax credit or grant is that because the payment cancels an equal amount of the firm’s losses, t he tax -credit payments are more in the form of a loan from the governmen t w hich is “repaid” if the firm becomes profitable 7 . Other events (liquidation, sale of th e company or of IP) also trigger repayment obligations . 5 6. The scheme is tightly targeted to a subset of R&D -intensive firms throug h i mposing a wage-intensity test. This screens out many R&D performers and ha s m eant the scheme operates on a small scale. About 350 firms have registere d w ith slightly fewer actually applying for the credit. Its cost is about 10% o f e xpected expenditure on the tax incentive . 5 7. The advent of the R&D tax incentive has led Inland Revenue to review the R& D t ax loss cash out. This review is summarised as follows . Ho w is the R&D tax loss cash out working? 58.The tax loss cash out scheme was introduced in 2015 with effect from the 20 16 y ear. There are two full years of results (2016 and 2017) and one part yea r ( 2018) . 5 9. Uptake of the scheme has grown, with 350 firms now registered and the numbe r of approved firms slightly less than 300. In aggregate, the scheme has provide d $ 50m to firms undertaking R&D, over the past 3 years 8 . The average amount r eceived per firm has grown from $73,000 in year 1 to $105,000 in year 3. 60 . Recipients are generally smaller enterprises employing fewer than 20 employees . T here is a mix of stand-alone entities and firms that are part of a group. Of th e l atter, some have a foreign parent or are associated with a foreign entity tha t e xercises control over the functions and business activities of the firm . 4 Technically, it is the lesser of their R&D send or 1.5 x the amount spent on employees engaged in R&D. 5 The standard pattern is that as a firm’s R&D is successful and it commercialises its product, its R&D intensity will decline. 6 Generally, a firm loses it losses if there is more than a 50% change in ownership. This can be triggered either by the current shareholders selling or by an injection of fresh equity capital. Within the tax system there is a discretion for firms undertaking R&D to defer the recognition of their R&D expenditure so that the losses associated with their R&D expenditure are not lost. 7 Repayment occurs because a firm starts paying tax earlier than it would if it had carried losses forward. 8 $13.7 million was paid out for the 2016 tax year, $23.2 million was paid out for 2017, and – part year only - $16.3 million has been paid out for the 2018 year. IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 9 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Is the scheme achieving its objectives? 61.An assessment of the scheme’s impact is difficult because many recipients al so re ceive other forms of government assistance (such as Callaghan Innovatio n grants or support from the NZ Venture Investment Fund). It is not possible to d iscern the impact of this scheme alone on the amount of R&D that is bein g c arried out . 62 . IR officials administering this scheme indicate there is some evidence of th e scheme providing needed financial support. Some firms use the credit to pay i nstalments on tax debt or to offset debt not under arrangement. Inland Revenu e o fficials consider the credit has on occasion saved a company from liquidation o r re lieved the financial strain of tax deb t. 63 . The eligibility criteria are designed to target New Zealand-based firms that are : •C urrently loss-making firms but will potentially become profit making an d t ax payin g •Firms for whom R&D is a central feature of their operation s •I n the start-up phase because these firms are most likely to be ca sh c onstraine d •N ot otherwise readily able to tap into non-government sources of finance . 6 4. An analysis of recipients of the scheme suggests that the current criteria a re l etting in these types of firms but also letting in firms that don’t meet the criteria . F or instance, in the first year though the majority of recipients had incorporated i n 2012 or later, at least 20% were more than 10 years old, so could not be c onsidered still in the start -up phase. Additionally, firms within a wholly owne d g roup with a listed company have been eligible, despite their access to significan t n on -government finance . 6 5. A feature of the scheme is the obligation to repay the credit once the firm ha s b ecome profitable or other conditions are met. Howeve r: •B ecause the scheme has only been in operation for a short time, there i s n ot a clear picture of whether firms are moving to profitabilit y •S ome firms have become profitable but still have other losses carrie d f or ward so are not yet paying ta x •A very small number of firms have triggered the other repaymen t o bligation s •T hese other criteria are hard to monitor and Inland Revenue is reliant on s elf -reporting by firm s •Some corporate structuring arrangements can result in perpetual loss m aking companies, despite significant revenue arising f rom c ommercialisation of the research and development . D efinition of R&D 66.The scheme works off the accounting standard definition of R&D. This is differe nt f rom the definition used in the R&D tax incentive . 67 . The accounting definition was consciously chosen when the scheme wa s developed because, given the target recipient was a small start-up firm, it was c onsidered this would be the easiest concept for firms to apply . IR2019/005; 2296 18-19: R&D Tax Incentive: Phase 2 Policy Proposals Page 10 of 14 IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Appendix 1 – International Comparisons of Refundability policies 84. The following table sets out key features of how refundability is applied in key OECD countries. Country Refundability policy Other relevant factors Australia Limits refundability to: • firms with turnover less than A$20m & • subject to a A$4m annual cap. The cap is a recent feature aimed at fiscal affordability. The cap equates to A$10m eligible expenditure. UK – SMEs Firms in loss can cash out their tax credit at a discount to their value 11 . The SME scheme is more generous than the large firm scheme. SMEs must have: • fewer than 500 employees and • turnover less than EUR 100m. UK – large For non-SMEs, the tax credit is paid firms before tax, so loss making firms benefit equally with profitable firms, subject to not exceeding the amount of PAYE and National Insurance Contribution paid. Norway Full refundability for tax paying entities. The tax credit operates with a very low cap. The maximum credit is (approx.) NZ$2m, and in most cases is NZ$1m. The tax credit is not available to non -taxpayers. Ireland Full refundability, but paid in instalments over 3 years, and subject to limits relating to amounts of corporate income tax paid or amounts of payroll tax paid. Netherlands Full refundability but limited to a firm’s payroll tax liability. Canada The credit is fully refundable for Canadian Controlled Private Corporations up to an expenditure limit of CAD 3 million. Higher expenditure is only 40% refundable. The tax credit rate is 35% up to eligible expenditure of CAD 3 million, and 15% for higher amounts. The table above demonstrates different mechanisms can be used for constraining refundability. Here are some brief comments on each of them: 11 Firms in loss can cash out 14.5% of surrenderable losses (these are the lesser of their trading loss and 230% of the R&D spend).

This suggests either using a wider definition of taxes paid 12 or making a provision for firms to apply for an exemption • Administratively easy to understand and apply (subject to exceptions for firms without employees) Refund credits at a discount • Supports loss making firms while providing an incentive to become profitable • Provides firms with a choice whether to refund the credit or carry it forward • Perhaps less easy to understand but relatively easy to apply Spread refundability over several years • More complex to track a firm’s position • For a firm in a long-term loss making position, will produce similar results to full year refundability after a few years • Creates a tail of Government liability Target refundability based on R&D intensity This mechanism is not used by any other country for targeting refundability (though in Australia R&D intensity influences the credit rate for large enterprises) but is worth considering as it is the basis of the year one scheme. • Can target refundability to those most deserving of it • Creates a boundary that might give rise to perverse behaviours • Different measures of R&D intensity may favour different types of R&D performing firms Though relatively easy to understand, adds complexity to compliance and administration 12 One possibility would be to include adding withholding taxes paid.

Draft legislation introducing the R&D Tax Incentive from the 2019/20 tax year is currently before the House and provides for the R&D Tax Incentive scheme to commence from 1 April 2019 for most businesses. 1 2. Refundability of tax credits is an important part of the R&D Tax Incentive and will help incentivise R&D for firms in tax loss. Refundability refers to paying out the R&D tax credit to firm s who are in a tax loss position, or have insufficient income tax liability to off set the credit against. Providing a refund ensures that all firms doing R&D receive the benefit of the tax credits they are eligible for under the R&D Tax Incentive. 3. Cabinet agreed to provide limited refundability for firms in a tax loss position for the first year of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme and noted that the design features for refundability will likely change in subsequent years (DEV-18- MIN -0174 refers). 4. The limited refundability mechanism in the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill caps refundable tax credits available in the 2019/20 tax year to $255,000. The eligibility criteria are the same as in the R&D tax loss cash-out scheme. 5. Officials developed a longer term refundability proposal to use for discussion with key stakeholders (IR2019/005; 2296 18-19 refers). The basis of the proposal was that refundability would be widely available to firms in a tax loss position. This is consistent with the objective of providing broad-based support for R&D. However, in order to manage the risks that refundability creates to the sustainability of the scheme, officials proposed that the amount of credits refunded to firm in a year would be limited to the lesser of: • the amount of PAYE paid by a firm; and • a cap of $5 million. 6. Officials engaged on this proposal during February and March 2019, with a range of organisations including: • Corporate Taxpayers’ Group (and a selection of their members in a loss making position including Xero and Fisher and Paykel Appliances); Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand; representatives from PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY; • Approximately 25 representatives from R&D performing firm s in loss or with insufficient taxable income to fully utilise non-refundable R&D tax credits; • Other large established R&D performers, including Fonterra, Zespri, LIC Automation and Ballance Agri -Nutrients; • Levy bodies; charities; and Māori business representatives. Annex Two includes a list of organisations who took part in the stakeholder engagement process. Refundability 7. The draft Cabinet paper attached at Annex One sets out the design of the longer term refundability policy for inclusion in the Taxation (1 st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial 1 The R&D Tax Incentive applies from the beginning of the 2019/20 income year, which means the date from which it applies depends on the balance date of each individual claimant. For most standard balance date (31 March) claimants, the R&D Tax Incentive will apply from 1 April 2019. In Confidence 4 Matters) Bill. Incorporated in it are proposals developed as a result of the engagement process outlined above and additional policy analysis. 8. The draft Cabinet paper recommends the following refundability policy option for the Tax Incentive: • All firms would be entitled to a full refund of their R&D tax credits, to the extent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid by a firm in the relevant income year (proposed cap) 2 : i. The cap would not apply to R&D carried out by approved research providers; ii. The cap would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to statutory bodies. • All tax exempt organisations, except organisations receiving tax exempt income under section CW 49 of the Income Tax Act, will be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive; • All local authorities, as well as entities controlled by or associated with local authorities, will be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Existing measures to protect the integrity of the scheme 9. The R&D tax incentive scheme has a range of measures built into it to ensure its sustainability over the long term: • Qualifying for the R&D Tax Incentive requires R&D activity to be primarily undertaken in New Zealand. This closes off some of the fraud risks experienced in other jurisdictions associated to R&D occurring offshore. • The minimum R&D expenditure threshold of $50,000 reduces the risk of a large number of very small claims being submitted. This means that more resources can be focused on working with applicants during the in-year approval process. • The in year-approval system, with a single point of contact between business and the core R&D team within Inland Revenue, will help identify fraudulent claims through the flagging of unusual R&D applications and/or behaviour. 10. These measures will provide robustness and integrity for the scheme. However, given the experience of overseas jurisdictions, we are not confident they would be sufficient to manage the risks associated with refundability and consequently we have proposed a cap on payroll taxes. Cap based on payroll taxes 11. Our recommended refundability policy option, which involves a cap base d on payroll taxes 3 , means full refundability will not be as widely accessible as some firm s would like. Stakeholder engagement revealed early stage R&D intensive firms are disadvantaged by a PAYE cap, options to soften the impact were explored, including a tangible economic presence test 12. Some types of firm s would be disadvantaged by a PAYE cap for a number of reasons. This includes early stage R&D intensive firms who choose to have contractors over employees to reduce their financial risk, start-ups where people work on an unpaid basis in return for a stake in the company, and small to medium-sized software firm s where it is more common to 3 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, fringe benefit tax, employer superannuation contribution tax and withholding tax on schedular payments In Confidence 5 have flexible work arrangements 4 , and firms where capital is used over labour. Representatives from KPMG considered that flexible work arrangements are becoming more commonplace across all sectors and they expect the trend to continue in future. 13. As a result of the stakeholder engagement officials explored alternatives to a hard PAYE cap, specifically a tangible economic presence (TEP) test. The TEP test developed by officials required firms to choose one of the following measures to satisfy the test: • PAYE paid by the firm is greater than the amount of tax credit to be refunded; • Obtaining verification of TEP from a chartered accountant or practising lawyer; • Obtaining verification from Inland Revenue that a firm has TEP. 14. The TEP test is an attractive option that has broader reach and impact for firms who most need refundability support, but it is not sufficient to address the risks of fraud. Discussions with United Kingdom (UK) officials found that the risks of fraud in relation to refundability are more pervasive than previously considered. UK officials suggested that relying on a chartered accountant or practising lawyer for certification of TEP may not be robust, and additional Inland Revenue checks might lead to administration resources being focused on audit rather than the approval of R&D activity. Officials recommend including a hard cap on PAYE to address fraud risk, but recommend broadening it to ‘all payroll taxes’ to soften the impact 15. Early stage R&D intensive firms are important participants within the innovation system both as a source of value-add employment and the development of a more productive and diversified economy. To ensure these firms can benefit as much as possible from the scheme we have broadened the proposal to include: • all payroll taxes; • R&D tax credits resulting from payments to approved research providers. 16. Based on analysis undertaken by Inland Revenue, broadening the definition from PAYE to include fringe benefit tax and withholding tax on schedular payments does not have a large impact (around 1.5 per cent increase). However, a recent legislative change allows firms and contractors to enter into voluntary schedular arrangements and deduct withholding tax. We would anticipate that firms who would otherwise be disadvantaged by the cap based on payroll taxes paid could use this provision. 17. Offici als are investigating the impact of a payroll cap on firms. Officials will report to you on this , through its incorporation into the regulatory impact assessment (RIA). 18. The most consistently voiced theme during consultation is how crucial cash is to the survival of early stage R&D intensive firms. Therefore the recommended option will ensure refundability is available to most firms in a tax-loss position (either as a partial or full refund of tax credits). It will also be simple to administer. 19. It is a conservative approach with reduced benefits for some firms. On balance, we recommend this option because it manages the problems seen in other jurisdictions 5 . Officials consider this option to be a viable starting position for introduction of the legislation and we will continue to explore how other jurisdictions manage risks and enable refundability. 4 For example, staff may choose to be contractors rather than employees to give them maximum flexibility over their working arrangements 5 In the UK, HM Treasury and HMRC have released a consultation document ‘Preventing abuse of the R&D tax relief for SMEs’, April 2019, which proposes that a PAYE-related cap is reintroduced to the R&D tax credit scheme for SMEs. This policy has been driven by a concern over growing levels of fraud within the scheme since the removal of the PAYE cap. In Confidence 6 There are other mechanisms in the Research, Science and Innovation portfolio that are currently under review that can be used to further support R&D intensive start-ups 20. In addition to the Tax Incentive, the Research, Science and Innovation portfolio has a suite of other interventions that can be used to support R&D intensive start-ups. 21. MBIE, in conjunction with Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation, is leading a programme of work to review interventions for R&D intensive start-ups in light of the shifting R&D funding environment. T his includes: a review of Callaghan Innovation’s R&D Project Grants; reviewing the R&D tax loss cash out scheme; and a commitment to a refreshed and more ambitious Technology Incubator Programme. MBIE is also leading work, through the New Zealand Venture Capital Fund, to deepen capital markets to support high-growth/scale-up firms involved in disruptive technology. 22. There is also a commitment for further policy work to be undertaken as part of the Tax Incentive to simplify administration processes for small to medium enterprises. Removal of the $5 million cap 23. Our recommended option removes the previous proposed $5 million cap on refundability. A small number of large established R&D performers will be constrained by a $5 million cap on refundability 24. Stakeholder engagement revealed that there were a small number of established R&D performers who would be constrained by the $5 million cap. For example a company 6 in a loss making position undertaking around $80 million of R&D annually, would be eligible for $12 million of R&D tax credits. Under the proposed cap the company would receive a $5 million refund on its R&D tax credits and would have to shift the remaining $7 million credits into future years. B ut because the company spends a large amount of R&D on an on-going basis they are unlikely to be able to cash out fully their accumulation of carry-forward R&D credits. 25. There are a number of established R&D performers who valued the security refundability would bring to their R&D programmes. These companies are mainly in a tax -paying situation but depending on market fluctuations they could be in a temporary loss-making position in future Refundability would give these firms surety, allowing them to continue their R&D investment during market down-turns. Some of these established R&D performers would also be constrained by a $5 million cap. Removing the $5 million cap will incentivise large established R&D performers to undertake more R&D and increase the attractiveness of the scheme off-shore 26. The removal of the $5 million cap reduces inequity for large established R&D performers. While the number of New Zealand firms who would be constrained by a $5 million cap is small their contribution to the innovation system is significant. In 2016, 26 per cent of all BERD was carried out by six firms that spent $25 million or more on R&D. Removing the $5 million cap will help incentivise these firms to undertake greater levels of R&D. 27. Removal of the cap may also help attract R&D performing multi-national corporations (MNCs) to New Zealand. New Zealand currently lacks the very large MNCs which tend to drive R&D expenditure in other countries. The removal of the $5 million cap, while retaining the cap based on payroll taxes, will ensure that MNCs are contributing to New Zealand’s economy at a minimum through benefits such as providing employment opportunities in New Zealand. 28. The $120 million cap on R&D expenditure with discretion to exceed it through a pre- registration process would continue to apply to all R&D performers. 6 Details withheld In Confidence 7 29. Officials understand that Ministers might prefer the assurance that a maximum cap on refundability brings to the scheme in terms of fiscal budgeting and public perceptions. If Ministers choose to include a cap on refundability (additional to the cap based on payroll taxes), then we suggest it should be set at $5 million, on the basis that loss -making firms currently receive up to $5 million per year from Callaghan Innovation’s R&D Growth Grants. 30. If Ministers prefer to include a cap on refundability then officials will provide further advice on threshold options to ensure firms are not disadvantaged. Treatment of tax-exempt organisations 31. Our recommended option ensures that levy bodies, some of whom are tax exempt, are eligible for refundability but recommends that other tax exempt organisations are e xcluded from the R&D Tax Incentive. Levy bodies were intended to be part of the scheme and will only benefit from refundability 32. Cabinet agreed to include levy bodies in the R&D Tax Incentive (DEV-18- MIN -0174). 33. Levy bodies are not by definition tax exempt organisations, but some may be tax exempt because of section CW 49 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Section CW 49 provides that the income of certain entities is exempt income, if the entities are established for the main purpose of promoting or encouraging research. It is proposed that tax exempt organisations, such as charities, be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. However, a carve-in is proposed for entities that receive exempt income under CW 49, so that these entities are eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. Entities who receive income under section CW 49 do not receive the same tax concessions as charities (such as donor tax credit status, GST and FBT concessions), and are specifically established for the main purpose of promoting or encouraging research. The amount of R&D tax credits refundable to these entities would still be subject to the proposed cap based on payroll taxes, unless the relevant entity is established by statute As a result, levy bodies established by statute would have fully refundable R&D tax credits. 34. Engagement revealed that levy bodies undertake research projects independent of MBIE science investment funding. If levy bodies are eligible for refundable R&D tax credits, the amount they invest in independent research would likely increase. Charities sit outside of the tax system and should be excluded from the tax incentive but a charity with a partially controlled business entity is eligible in order to address post-settlement governance entities 35. Some charities, particularly in the health sector, undertake R&D that would qualify under the R&D tax incentive. But the estimated amount of R&D conducted in the charitable sector appears to be small 7 . Charities also sit outside the tax system giving them preferential tax treatment over firms. On this basis we do not consider it appropriate to extend further benefits to charities through the tax system as would be the case if they were eligible for the R&D tax incentive. 36. There are a small number of post-settlement governance entities (e.g. Ngāi Tahu) that are registered as charities. To ensure they are not unduly penalised for a governance structure imposed on them we propose not including broader association rules in relationship to charities. This would mean that a charity could set up a partially controlled business entity, subject to the rules within the constitution of the charity, which would not have tax exempt status and therefore be eligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. We understand that post- settlement governance entities generally have more scope to set up partially controlled 7 The 2018 R&D survey showed that $99 million of funds for internal R&D comes from ‘other funding sources’. Specific questionnaire wording is ‘Other funding sources (e.g. the Lotteries commission, cancer society and charities)’. In Confidence 8 business entities than standard charities. We also understand it is reasonably difficult for a charity to change the rules of its constitution without putting its charitable status at risk. Tax loss cash out Policy issues around the ‘tax loss cash out’ scheme are complex and further policy work is required before reform is possible 37. Our previous advice noted our intention to review the R&D tax loss cash out scheme. During stakeholder engagement we explored the value of this scheme to firms and the potential interactions it has with refundability of the R&D tax credit. 38. This provided useful information but also confirmed the issues are relatively complex and require consideration of the scheme itself, its interaction with the R&D Tax Incentive, and how it fits with other government policies both in the tax system (for instance the loss continuity rules) and with regard to government support for R&D intensive start-ups and innovative firms. 39. Because of time pressures associated with developing the broader refundability policy so that it can be incorporated in legislation in 2019, we propose it is sensible to decouple changes to the R&D tax loss cash out and refundability. Officials will continue to work on possible reform of the R&D tax loss cash out and anticipate discussing options with Ministers later in 2019. This will mean that policy changes are not likely to be implemented until the 2021/22 income tax year 8 . Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill supplementary order paper 40. We have identified we will need a supplementary order paper (SOP) for the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill. 41. The current Bill allows Inland Revenue to communicate information about tax credits to Callaghan Innovation. However, Inland Revenue’s legal department has indicated this is insufficient for Callaghan Innovation’s role as co-administrator of the tax incentive. The SOP will enable Inland Revenue to provide access to its systems so that Callaghan Innovation can function effectively as a co-administrator of the tax incentive. 42. The SOP will amend clause 37B of the Bill, which amends clause 39 of schedule 7 of the TAA 9 by adding a new 39(3). Subsection (3) provides for personnel from Callaghan Innovation to access the information necessary for administering the tax incentive. 43. The SOP also makes a small number of minor typographical corrections. Annex Three sets out the SOP for inclusion into legislation. Remedial legislative issues 44. We have identified a small number of issues where the legislation in the reported back version of the Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Bill does not fully achieve the policy intent. Issues identified relate to allocating R&D tax credits to members of joint ventures; the time available for businesses to complete the R&D tax credit claim disputes 8 From the 2020/21 income year most applicants for the R&D Tax Incentive will go through an in-year approval, while the R&D loss tax cash out is an end-of-year process. For customers that are eligible for both schemes this may result in a suboptimal claim experience. Officials will seek to make service improvements, until policy changes can be made. 9 Schedule 7 was inserted by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 (ARMTARM Act). The version of the Tax Administration Act 1994 published on the New Zealand Legislation website does not yet include schedule 7 because the ARMTARM Act received royal assent on 18 March 2019. In Confidence 9 process; and the R&D certifier regime. These issues will not have any practical impact until claims are submitted in respect of the 2019/20 income year. This means that they need to be corrected by 1 April 2020. Officials propose that rather than correcting these issues through a SOP, these issues would instead be corrected through remedial legislative changes included in the Taxation (1st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Regulatory impact assessment 45. The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) is being reviewed by officials from the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Changes will be made to the RIA to incorporate feedback from this review process. 46. The assessment will be finalised in time for submission of the Cabinet paper to the Economic Development Committee on 16 May . The RIA will be provided to your office before the end of April. Next Steps 47. We recommend you provide feedback to officials on the Cabinet paper by 15 April, or as soon thereafter as possible. We will incorporate your feedback and provide you with a revised draft Cabinet paper which you can use for consultation with your colleagues, coalition partner and confidence and supply partner. Officials will use the same draft Cabinet paper to undertake interdepartmental consultation. 48. In order to meet the legislative timetable, we recommend the Cabinet paper is lodged on 16 May 2019, for consideration at Cabinet Economic Development Committee on 22 May 2019. 49. Subject to Cabinet agreement, the expected introduction of refundability through the Taxation (1 st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial Matters) Bill will be June 2019.

Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) officials met with Minister Woods on Monday 29 April to discuss the draft Cabinet paper on the refundability proposal. Minister Woods suggested that she and her colleague Minister Nash meet to discuss the draft Cabinet paper, Extending Refundability for the Research and Development Tax Incentive (3068 18-19/IR2019/159 refers). 2. This brief provides you with additional information to support your discussions on the refundability proposal included in the draft Cabinet paper. The Cabinet paper proposes broad-based refundability 3. The draft Cabinet paper, Extending Refundability for the Research and Development Tax Incentive, outlined a proposal for the design of the longer term refundability policy to replace the limited refundability that applies for year one of the R&D Tax Incentive (Tax Incentive) scheme. 4. The Tax Incentive has been designed to be a broad based scheme, providing easily accessible R&D support for eligible businesses regardless of their size, revenue or profit or loss position. The refundability proposal as recommended by officials is consistent with this overarching policy objective. 5. Officials have proposed that refundability is broadly available to all firms in loss whose R&D activities qualify for the Tax Incentive. We propose that Levy bodies are eligible for the Tax Incentive but that charities, local authorities and other tax-exempt organisations are ineligible. 6. We are also proposing a cap based on payroll taxes to constrain how much of the R&D tax credit can be refunded in any one year. This is to manage the risks that refundability poses to the integrity of the scheme. A cap based on payroll taxes ensures the amount a firm receives from refundability is not more than the amount the firm puts into the tax system. It is also simple to understand and easy to administer. An alternative is to target refundability to SMEs, or to apply a cap Targeting refundability to small-medium-enterprises (SMEs) 7. Our analysis shows that two-thirds of Growth Grant recipients are in loss. It also shows that 73 per cent of Growth Grant recipients are not SMEs (i.e. they have more than 20 full-time- equivalents (FTEs)). This analysis indicates that there would be a significant number of Growth Grant recipients who would not receive the benefit of refundability if it were targeted to SMEs only. Limiting refundability by introducing a cap on the amount that can be refunded 8. If there was a less restrictive form of targeting, for example a cap on the amount of R&D tax credits that can be refunded then fewer firms would be impacted. Analysis shows there are between four to six New Zealand based R&D performers who are likely to be negatively impacted by a $5 million cap (i.e. they are in loss and also undertake more than $30 million worth of R&D activity per year). 9. If Ministers choose to limit refundability to a specific capped amount then officials consider that it would be necessary to provide further advice on threshold options or ways to treat atypical businesses such as cooperatives to ensure such firms are not disadvantaged. Additional policy options are likely to add further complexity to the scheme. In Confidence 5 Additional analysis of the proposed payroll cap 11. Our recommended refundability policy option limits the amount of the R&D tax credit that is refundable to the amount of payroll taxes 2 paid in the same tax year. In our previous briefing we undertook to investigate the impact a payroll cap has on firms and report back on this (3068 18-19, IR2019/159 refers). 12. We investigated the impact a payroll cap will have on smaller firms, by assessing how it would affect current Callaghan Innovation Project Grant recipients. Project Grants are designed for businesses new to or trying to expand their R&D. Officials selected Project Grants recipients for our analysis because we are able to identify Project Grant recipients in the Inland Revenue system and they are a proxy for early stage R&D intensive firms. However, no adjustment has been made for Project Grant recipients who have an estimated level of eligible R&D below the $50,000 per year threshold. 13. There are 326 firms in the Project Grant sample, of these: • 20 per cent are in profit, so would receive the benefit of an R&D tax credit • The remaining 80 per cent did not report income or are in loss. Of this 80 per cent: o 43 per cent did not report income or are in loss, but pay sufficient payroll taxes to get all or most of their R&D tax credits refunded o 18 per cent did not report income or are in loss and only pay a small amount of payroll taxes so would need to carry forward a relatively large proportion of their R&D tax credits o 39 per cent did not report income or are in loss and do not pay any payroll taxes so would be unable to receive any refund of their R&D tax credit, and would carry forward all their R&D tax credits 14. However, there are significant caveats 3 around this analysis which means it should only be considered as indicative for early stage R&D intensive firms. Nonetheless, it indicates that a notable proportion of early stage R&D intensive firms may not receive a full refund of their R&D tax credits This is consistent with feedback received from the stakeholder workshops. 15. The introduction of the Tax Incentive does not change firms’ access to Project Grants. And some firms receiving Project Grants will also have additional R&D expenditure that qualifies for the Tax Incentive. 16. As noted previously the Tax Incentive is not the only tool to support start-ups. Officials are in the process of reviewing Project Grants and the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out policy to identify improvements to these instruments. Changes to the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out policy will unlikely to be in place when the revised refundability policy will commence in April 2020, but changes to Project Grants could be. 2 Payroll taxes would include PAYE, fringe benefit tax, employer superannuation contribution tax and withholding tax on schedula r payments. It is also proposed that eligible payments to Approved Research Providers would not be subject to the cap. 3 The assessment of R&D expenditure could be an under estimate of the firm’s eligible expenditure under the R&D Tax Incentive. We have not taken into account any behavioural changes, for instance firms and contractors entering into voluntary schedular arrangements to deduct withholding tax or firms being able to adjust the level of net income they report so that the tax credit offsets any tax liability. Some firms will be part of a corporate group so the amounts of payroll taxes paid may be greater than what we have assessed. In Confidence 6 Feedback from agency consultation on local authorities’ eligibility f o r t h e Tax Incentive 17.The draft Cabinet paper recommends that all local authorities, as well as entities controlled by or associated with local authorities, are not eligible for the Tax Incentive. In its feedback on the draft Cabinet paper, the Department of Internal Affairs suggested that the underlying rationale for excluding local authorities was sound, but pointed out that companies minority owned by councils operated in the commercial sphere and therefore could be considered for eligibility. 18.We think this is a sensible adjustment, as it would bring these minority-owned entities of councils onto the same footing as minority owned entities of Crown Research Institutes, District Health Boards and tertiary organisations. Next Steps 19.We will incorporate your feedback and provide you with a revised draft Cabinet paper which you can use for consultation with other Ministers and their offices. 20.In order to meet the legislative timetable, we recommend the Cabinet paper is lodged on 16 May 2019, for consideration at Cabinet Economic Development Committee on 22 May 2019. 21.The regulatory impact statement is being assessed by the review panel. We expect to be able to provide this to your office next week. 22.The timetable for Cabinet and LEG approval on 24 June 2019 is dictated by other items that will be in the Tax Omnibus Bill.

Legislation has been enacted. •The current legislation only allows for limited refundability. The Government has committed t o a more comprehensive policy on refundability from year 2 of the Incentiv e. •T he R&D Tax Incentive has been designed to be a broad based scheme, providing easil y ac cessible R&D support for eligible businesses regardless of their size, revenue or profit o r loss position. •D elivering a broader refundability policy is important, or the Incentive will not be as effectiv e as int ended. Refundability proposal •The core proposal is that firms in loss can have all their tax credits refunded for expenditure w ith an Approved Research Provider, and all other tax credits can be refunded subject t o a c ap based on the amount of payroll taxes paid by a firm. Payroll taxes will primaril y c omprise PAYE (which includes withholding taxes on schedular payments to contractors) , but will also include payments for Fringe Benefit Tax and Employer Superannuati on C ontribution Ta x. •A ll businesses will be eligible for refundability, consistent with eligibility for the Incentive . Lev y bodies are included as the R&D they perform is fundamentally business R&D . •C harities and other tax-exempt organisations will be excluded from the Tax Incentive . Thes e organisations are outside the tax system so they should not benefit from incentiv es pr ovided from within it. In particular, charities already receive several tax concessions so i t i s not appropriate to extend further benefits to them . •B ecause these rules would not apply a broad association test, businesses that are partiall y ow ned by a charity, such as a post-settlement iwi organisation, would not be excl uded. Payroll cap •A payroll cap will help ensure the integrity of the Incentive through reducing the risk of f raudulent claims which have been problematic (along with an associated fiscal risk) i n ot her jurisdictions with refundable R&D tax credits . •A pay roll cap means firms do not get more from the tax system than they put in, whic h combats the use of shell companies. •T he UK had this policy in place for SMEs but removed it in 2011. The consequence was a s harp increase in the incidence of fraud. The UK Government has recently announced it s i ntention to reinstate the policy. 1 Next steps •Subject to Cabinet approval to the proposed refundability design, legislation will be introduced to Parliament in June 2019. 1 The UK Treasury and HMRC have released a consultation document “Preventing abuse of the R&D Tax Relief for SMEs’. 3482 18-19 In Confidence 4 Annex Two: Q&As Does the refundability proposal increase the fiscal cost of the Incentive? •No. The Incentive’s fiscal cost model assumes that firms in loss will claim the full tax credit. T reasury have confirmed that they are comfortable that allowing refundability as propos ed w ill have no further impact on the appropriation . •T he 2018 R&D survey results show higher growth in R&D than previously forecast. However, the updated fiscal cost estimates still fall within the existing appropriation. What impact will the payroll cap have on small companies? •A small proportion of companies, most often smaller ones, quite legitimately pay little or no P AYE. They may employ staff on contract rather than as employees or owners may tak e dr awings rather than a salary. On the surface, these firms may receive little initial benefi t f rom the proposed refundability policy . •However, the impact on small companies should be manageable: •Some of the firms that do not pay PAYE appear to do limited amounts of R&D so w ould not meet the $50,000 threshold . •Where a firm’s R&D is via a contract with an Approved Research Provider, all its tax c redit will be refunded . •Because the cap is based on all payroll taxes, there will be scope for firms to enter i nto an agreement with contractors and deduct withholding tax. Such payment s w ould increase the amount of tax credit that would be refunded . •There is, and will continue to be, other support that such firms could potentially ac cess rather than the Tax Incentive. Possibilities include project grants, the R& D t ax loss cash out, the Technology Incubator Programme, and the New Zeal and V enture Capital Fund . •Officials are continuing to investigate the impact this policy may have on smaller R&D i ntensive firms and will provide further advice prior to the policy being considered at Selec t C ommittee if it seems necessary . Why are large companies eligible for refundability? •Larger firms are less likely than smaller firms to be cash constrained so their need for r efunds may be less. However, the following reasons support refunding the tax credit for al l f irms (subject to the payroll cap) : •The policy provides for even handed treatment of firms in profit and loss, thereby i ncentivising all of them to undertake additional R&D . •Meeting the government’s target of growing R&D to 2% of GDP requires growth in R& D from large as well as small firms . •Some larger firms that are major R&D performers are in a tax loss position. These f irms would get no benefit from credits carried forward; the only way they will benefi t f rom credits is if they are ref unded. •In addition to performing R&D in New Zealand, these large companies would still hav e to be contributing to the New Zealand economy through payments t o em ployees or contractors, as the payroll cap prevents them from taking more out o f t he New Zealand tax system than they put i n. 3482 18-19 In Confidence 5 •If the Committee is unwilling to support full refunds for large companies, officials would r ecommend a cap on the amount that is refunded rather than any targeting to SMEs . •There is a default cap of $18 million (being 15% of the maximum eligible expenditure of $120m per year) . •We would suggest a cap should be at least $5 million if the Tax Incentive is to be perceived at least as favourably as the Growth Grant . Why are tax exempt organisations not eligible for refundability? •This position is based on these organisations being outside the tax system so they should not benefit from incentives provided from within it. In particular, charities already receiv e s everal tax concessions so it is not appropriate to extend further benefits to them . •B ecause these rules would not apply a broad association test, businesses that are partiall y owned by a charity, such as a post-settlement iwi organisation, would not be excluded. Are local authorities eligible for refundability? •Local authorities would be ineligible for the R&D Tax Incentive. However, council controlled or ganisations would be eligibl e. Why are levy bodies and payments to Approved Research Providers not subject to the cap? •Payments to Approved Research Providers will be easy to verify, posing a lower fraud risk. •Lev y bodies are empowered to collect levies by statute, definitely have an economi c pr esence in New Zealand, and consequently pose a reduced risk that refunded R&D t ax c redits will be unrecoverabl e. What other forms of R&D support does the government provide? •Over time we intend to have a full package of support for New Zealand’s innovation system. T he R&D Tax Incentive will be one support amongst many . •Oth er forms of current government support for business R&D include: R&D Project and S tudent grants, advice, and support in kind; and a limited R&D tax loss cash out . •O fficials are reviewing the R&D tax loss cash out and project grants to ensure R& D i ntensive start-ups have adequate R&D support. There is a commitment to a refreshed and m ore ambitious Technology Incubator Programme. MBIE is also leading work, through t he N ew Zealand Venture Capital Fund, to deepen capital markets to support high- growth/scale-up firms involved in disruptive technology . How does the refundability proposal compare internationally? •Most overseas R&D tax credit schemes with refundability have some constraints. A system w ith no restrictions on refundability would be an outlier amongst OECD countries . •T he different ways in which refundability is limited often reflect differences in the underlyi ng t ax incentive scheme. Some countries limit refundability to SMEs and start-ups . •I t is relatively common to limit refunds to the amount paid in other taxes such as PAYE . This ensures a firm has a tangible economic presence in the country where the claim is bei ng made, the amount refunded is commensurate to activity in the jurisdiction and i t r educes the risk that the claim is made by a non-existent entity . 3482 18-19 In Confidence 6 What are stakeholders’ views on the proposal? •This proposal has been informed by input from a wide array of organisations. •Many submissions on the Tax Incentive legislation were in favour of broader refundability. •Fur ther engagement undertaken specifically with smaller R&D performers indicated that a PAYE cap could restrict the tax credit refunds available to these firms. The proposed cap now brings in FBT and ESCT in addition to PAYE, as well as expenditure on Approv ed R esearch Providers . •T hese changes to the cap will reduce its impact for some of these firms. In addition, t he c urrent ecosystem of support (which includes project grants and the R&D tax loss cash out ) f or these smaller R&D performers will conti nue. •M BIE, Inland Revenue and Callaghan have discussed refundability proposals with t he C orporate Taxpayers’ Group; Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zeal and; r epresentatives from PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY; approximately 25 representatives fr om R &D performing businesses in tax loss or with insufficient taxable income to fully use non­ refundable R&D tax credits; levy bodies; charities; and Māori business representatives . •T hese discussions have helped shape the broader refundability proposals, and hav e hi ghlighted the desirability of broad eligibility and an accessible process . 3482 18-19 In Confidence 7 MINISTRY OF BUSINESS, INNOVATION & EMPLOYMENT HTKINA WHAKATUTUKI A Inland Revenue � If TeTariTaake R&D Tax Incentive -refundability and small innovative firms Date: 27 June 2019 Security In Confidence classification: Action sought Hon Dr Megan Woods Minister of Research, Science and Innovation Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue Kirsty Hutchison Priority: Medium Tracking 3584 18-19 number: IR2019/303 Action sou ht Note that most loss-making firms will benefit from the refundability proposal but the payroll cap will restrict access to refundable ta credits for some early stao. � \\ . m� with little or no PAYE. ?G;v Note that MBIE w � � rti� 1 her advice on the f-,,, mdn�4\_c., '.scape for small inno +i · firms) Telephone 049014131 04 901 4173 04 890 2808 1 st contact ✓ Senior Policy Advisor, IR04 890 3010 f™"'Yiif� Tth .ollowing departments/agencies have been consulted Callaghan Innovation Minister's office to complete: Comment D Approved D Noted D Seen D See Minister's Notes D Declined D Needs change D Overtaken by Events D Withdrawn .\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ....,,.\_N\_c\_QNEI.D\_EJiC , E \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ --J    BRIEFING R&D Tax Incentive – refundability and small innovative firms Date: 27 June 2019 Priority: Medium Security classification: In Confidence Tracking number: 3584 18-19 IR2019/303 Purpose This briefing provides additional information about the impact on small early stage firms of limiting R&D tax credit refunds by the payroll tax cap.

Minister Woods and Minister Nash met on 6 May 2019 to discuss the draft Cabinet paper, Extending Refundability for the Research and Development Incentive. At the meeting officials undertook to: • Continue to refine our analysis of the impact a payroll cap will have on small innovative businesses, including through engagement with selected stakeholders who work with startups. • Provide you with information on other R&D funding support available for these firms. The payroll cap addresses the risks that refundability creates for the integrity of the tax system 1. The objectives of the broader refundability proposal are to support as much genuine R&D as possible in a way that is simple to administer and that maintains the integrity of the tax system 2. The refundability proposal agreed by Cabinet is: • All firms are entitled to a refund of their R&D tax credits, to the extent their R&D tax credits are equal to or less than the amount of ‘payroll’ taxes paid by a firm in the relevant income year (payroll cap). • The payroll cap would not limit refundability of tax credits resulting from payments to approved research providers. • The proposed cap would not apply to R&D tax credits refunded to levy bodies. 3. The purpose of the payroll cap is to manage the risks that refundability poses to the integrity of the tax system, thereby supporting the sustainability of the R&D Tax Incentive scheme The refundability proposal is both generous and broad-based (does not target firms of a particular size) in comparison to other jurisdictions. 1 4. A payroll cap is simple to administer, ensures firms have tangible economic presence in New Zealand, and is used by some other jurisdictions 2 that provide refundable R&D tax credits. However, a payroll cap may limit refunds for businesses that have little or no PAYE. Most loss-making firms that qualify for the Tax Incentive will benefit from refundability 5. Our previous analysis on the impact of the payroll cap on small innovative businesses (3372 18-19 IR2019/233 refers) was based on 326 firms in receipt of a Callaghan Innovation Project Grant. Project Grant recipients are a proxy for certain types of firms that are most at risk of not benefiting from the refundability policy (i.e. startups), and we were able to gauge the impact of the refundability policy by using Inland Revenue and Callaghan Innovation data. 1 33 out of 46 international schemes do not provide refundability provisions. 12 out of 28 OECD governments currently offer preferential tax treatment to SMEs or young firms. 2 For example, the UK, Ireland, the Netherlands (2296 18-19; IR2019/005 refers). In Confidence IN CONFIDENCE 3    6. The initial analysis indicated that 101 of these firms either did not report income, or were in loss and may not receive a refund of their R&D tax credits because they did not pay any payroll taxes. There were a number of significant caveats around the initial analysis, including that it did not take into account the $50,000 minimum expenditure threshold which would have excluded many of these firms from being eligible for the Tax Incentive. 7. We have subsequently updated our analysis using more robust R&D expenditure values 3 and filtering for firms that did not consistently meet the $50,000 R&D expenditure threshold during the project grant period. 8. The revised results indicate that the number of firms whose access to refunds is restricted by the payroll cap is smaller than initially identified. 9. The results show 21 firms with possibly no refund. However, taking into account entities with holding companies (which may give group access to payroll taxes) would leave 12 firms (4% of the sample) with possibly no refund. These firms could still potentially use Approved Research Providers or withholding taxes from voluntary schedular arrangements with contractors to access refundability. More detailed analysis is provided in Annex One. Stakeholders had mixed views on the impact of the refundability proposal on startups 10. Building on our earlier engagement with stakeholders on the refundability policy, we met with selected stakeholders to test our understanding of the impact a payroll cap will have on small innovative businesses. 11. The discussions with tax advisors (EY, Deloitte, CAANZ, PwC, KPMG) suggest that early stage startups in the software or digital sectors in particular are unlikely to benefit from the refundability proposal due to their reliance on labour from founders or contractors, for which PAYE is not being withheld To benefit, these firms would need to enter into voluntary withholding arrangements or engage the services of an Approved Research Provider (ARP). 12. Voluntary withholding arrangements are simple to enter into but have only been available from 2017 and have perceived compliance costs, e.g. contractors may have pre-existing arrangements. Some firms may benefit from the ARP expenditure exclusion from the cap, e.g. businesses engaged in scientific-oriented R&D that work with universities or crown research institutes. Firms in the software or digital sectors are less likely to use ARPs. We are unable to estimate the proportion of businesses that may benefit from expenditure with an ARP being excluded from the cap. 13. In contrast, our discussions with other organisations that work with startups on a day to day basis (Astrolab, Level Two and Dotterel) suggest that the refundability proposal will benefit young innovative firms. These organisations observed that contractors are often used for temporary or specialist projects, and that most startups, particularly those building a company around deep technology, need to build a dedicated team of employees. 14. We expect submissions to the Select Committee to reflect the views above. We will report back to Ministers following the submissions process on feedback received and our proposed response. 3 This now includes additional R&D expenditure reported by firms to Callaghan Innovation. Not all firms choose to record additional data. Officials have used Project Grant R&D values in the absence of self- reported figures. In Confidence IN CONFIDENCE 4    Stakeholders generally understood that the Tax Incentive is not the only instrument available to support startups 15. The Tax Incentive is the centrepiece of government support for business R&D. However, there are a range of other mechanisms currently available and targeted to small innovative businesses and startups which address the needs of firms that do not qualify for the Tax Incentive (because of the $50,000 threshold or the definition of R&D), or who may be deterred because of compliance costs relative to the benefit they will receive. 16. A brief overview of other funding sources currently available is provided in Annex Two. These measures provide support to early stage innovative businesses to invest in, commercialise and scale up their R&D and to build entrepreneurial capability. 17. For example, firms that just meet the $50,000 R&D expenditure threshold would receive tax credits worth $7,500 (at a 15% tax credit rate). Firms spending less than $50,000 on R&D, may be better off accessing the Getting Started Grant (up to $5,000), the Capability vouchers (up to $5,000) and Project Grants (40% of eligible expenditure). These grants provide a stepping stone to either larger Project Grants or the Tax Incentive. 18. If a firm in a tax loss position qualifies for the Tax Incentive but does not pay any payroll taxes (including at a group level) and does not have any eligible expenditure with an ARP or contractors who agree to voluntary withholding arrangements, then it will be better suited to accessing the other support mechanisms available 19. At the current time, firms that meet the criteria for the R&D Tax Loss Cash Out scheme (generally small R&D-intensive firms) can also receive cash for up to 28% of their tax losses from R&D expenditure, subject to a maximum of $476,000 in the 2019/20 tax year. 4 We propose to undertake further work on the funding landscape for small innovative firms 20. As noted in some of our earlier briefings on the R&D Tax Incentive, the natural next step following the introduction of the Tax Incentive is to review the wider landscape of support for smaller innovative businesses, including startups. This review will complement the work underway on early stage capital markets (led by the Minister for Economic Development). A focus of this work will be how existing supports other than the R&D tax incentive can be shaped to ensure there is support for firms for whom the tax incentive may not be ideal. We will report back to you on the scope of this project and proposed terms of reference. Our intention is to have initial options explored prior to our response to submissions to Select Committee. Proactive release 21. We propose to include this briefing (with only information withheld to protect the privacy of natural persons) in the proactive release of the Cabinet paper Extending Refundability for the Research and Development Tax Incentive which is currently in process. Annexes Annex One: Analysis on the impact of the payroll cap Annex Two: Other sources of government funding for small innovative businesses 4 It is proposed to review this scheme now that the R&D Tax Incentive is in place. In Confidence 5 IN CONFIDENCE    Annex One: Analysis on the impact of the payroll cap 1. The table below summarises the results of both our previous analysis and our updated analysis that filters for the impact of the $50,000 threshold and which also benefits from more robust R&D expenditure values. 5 2. Based on the updated analysis, the number of firms that would not benefit from refundability due to the payroll cap is smaller than under the previous analysis. Project Grant sample (326 firms) Results from previous analysis Results from updated analysis (filtered for firms that consistently meet the $50,000 threshold) Did not report income or were in loss 260 firms 109 firms Did not report income or were in loss and paid sufficient payroll taxes 112 firms 45 firms Did not report income or were in loss and only paid a small amount of payroll taxes (limited refund) 47 firms 43 firms Did not report income or were in loss and did not pay any payroll taxes (no refund) 101 firms 21 firms 3. Under the updated analysis 21 firms would potentially get no refund. These firms may receive a refund if they have access to withholding taxes through the use of contractors, use an Approved Research Provider, or have a holding company with the potential to pay payroll taxes at the group level. 4. Expenditure on contractors was not available for firms included in the above analysis. However, analysis of data from the R&D Tax Loss Credit scheme (which includes information on R&D contractor spend) shows that withholding taxes from voluntary schedular arrangements with contractors could significantly reduce the number of firms affected by the payroll cap. 5. 9 of the 21 firms have holding companies, so may be able to access payroll taxes at a group level. This would potentially leave 12 firms (4% of the sample) without any refund. 5 This now includes R&D expenditure reported by firms. Not all firms choose to record this data. Officials have used Project Grant R&D values in the absence of self-reported figures.

In Confidence IR2019/235: Cabinet paper – Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes Page 1 of 5 IN CONFIDENCE 2 May 2019 Minister of Revenue Cabinet paper – Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes Introduction 1. This report asks you to consider the attached draft Cabinet paper Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes and, following any changes you wish to make, refer it to Cabinet office by 10 am Thursday 16 May so that it may be considered by the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV) at its meeting on Wednesday 22 May 2019. 2. This report seeks your agreement to the following: • Removal of the exemption for transfers by individuals of a main home from the requirements to provide IRD numbers (and if the person is tax resident in another country, the name of that country and their tax identification number (TIN) for that country) when transferring a property. • A remedial amendment to update the reference in the Tax Administration Act 1994 information collection, use and disclosure provisions; and to update the reference to the Land Transfer Act 1952 to the current section in the Land Transfer Act 2017. • Inclusion of the amendments in a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill at the Committee of the whole House stage. 3. These amendments follow the recommendation made by the Tax Working Group to require disclosure of IRD numbers on the Land Transfer Tax Statement when transferring a main home. The Government’s response to this recommendation was to consider as a high priority for inclusion on the tax policy work programme. 4. Amendments could be made to the Land Transfer Act 2017 to give effect to this recommendation in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. This could be achieved by introducing a SOP at the Committee of the whole House stage of this bill. 5. The inclusion of the proposed amendments in this current tax bill would allow for a swift response to the Tax Working Group’s recommendation and send a signal to property speculators that the Government will continue to act to improve compliance with the property tax rules. 6. Introducing these amendments by SOP at the Committee of the whole House stage carries some risk as the legislative amendments will not be subject to consultation as part of the select committee process. To help mitigate this, we propose to consult with key stakeholders on the drafting of the SOP. 7. A regulatory impact analysis on the proposal to require tax information upon transfer of a main home was undertaken as part of the original amendments to the Land Transfer Act in 2015. Inland Revenue’s preferred option in this analysis was not to have an exemption from providing IRD numbers and TINs when the transfer involves a main home. We are seeking an exemption from further RIA requirements. 8. We have consulted with the Treasury and Land Information New Zealand (LINZ). Due to time constraints we will consult with Statistics New Zealand and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner on the draft Cabinet paper attached to this report. In Confidence IR2019/235: Cabinet paper – Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes Page 2 of 5 IN CONFIDENCE Requirement to provide IRD number when the transfer involves a main home 9. The Land Transfer Act 2017 contains provisions requiring the completion of a Land Transfer Tax Statement by both the transferor (seller) and transferee (purchaser) before the transfer of a residential property may be registered. These provisions were introduced in September 2015. 10. There is an exemption for providing an IRD number and, if applicable any TINs for another country, if the transfer involves an individual’s main home. (Trusts need to provide their tax information when the transfer involves a main home). If the transfer meets the main home criteria the transfer will qualify as a “non-notifiable” transfer for the transferor and/or transferee. 11. The current exemption creates a gap in information provided to Inland Revenue and consequently reduces the enforcement benefits from collecting tax information at the point of property transfer. For example , this makes it more difficult to identify property speculators. 12. We consider that the transferor or transferee should still be asked if the property being transferred is their main home. This main home indicator allows Inland Revenue to identify taxpayers who should be sent follow-up information and correspondence advising of the property tax rules and those who are unlikely to have tax obligations arising from the property transfer. This is useful for both enforcement purposes, and also to ensure that the follow-up information is appropriately targeted to customers. Officials will consider whether the main home definition can be simplified for the purpose of this indicator. 13. However, we note that requiring transferors or transferees to provide this information will lead to a minor increase in compliance costs. We will work with LINZ to explore options for simplifying the main home definition and streamlining transfer forms to mitigate these costs. Requirement to provide TIN and information on overseas jurisdictions 14. Transferors and transferees who are tax resident \[1\] in another country must include on the Land Transfer Statement their TIN \[2\] and the name of the jurisdiction in which they are tax resident unless an exemption applies. 15. This information is reported to other countries to help prevent global tax evasion. 16. If a tax resident of another country claims the main home exemption, they do not need to provide their TIN and the name of the jurisdiction when transferring property except in limited circumstances (for example, if the person is not a New Zealand citizen nor a resident for immigration purposes then they cannot claim the main home exemption). 17. Requiring TINs will help ensure that data provided to treaty partners is easily able to be matched to the correct person. Requiring the reporting of TINs for property sales would go beyond current international requirements, but would be consistent with the AEOI/CRS financial reporting requirements that apply when individuals open new bank accounts, and would position New Zealand favourably as a leader in international efforts to combat tax evasion. \[1\] Generally, a person is tax resident in another country if that country imposes income tax obligations on the person’s worldwide income. \[2\] A TIN is the unique identifier that is given to a taxpayer by a jurisdiction’s tax authority. A person’s IRD number is a TIN in the context of New Zealand. In Confidence IR2019/235: Cabinet paper – Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes Page 3 of 5 IN CONFIDENCE Remedial amendment to references in the Tax Administration Act 1994 18. The Tax Administration Act 1994 includes an information disclosure provision which allows information to be disclosed between authorised persons for the purposes of the tax information provisions in the Land Transfer Act. The current legislation refers to the relevant provisions in the Land Transfer Act 1952, which has been superseded by the Land Transfer Act 2017. We consider this reference should be updated to reflect the current provisions in the Land Transfer Act 2017. Opportunities for process simplification 19. Removing the main home exemption will provide an opportunity to re-design and simplify the Land Transfer Tax Statement and other forms before the proposed amendments come into force. 20. We also consider that there are other opportunities for simplification of the process, such as: • Allowing direct provision of tax information from LINZ to Statistics NZ. (Statistics NZ publish quarterly property transfer statistics based mainly on Land Transfer Tax Statements) • Clarifying the provisions relating to citizenship and visa status in the Land Transfer Act 2017, as the present provisions create some uncertainty about what information is being sought. • Making all transfers by executors and administrators non-notifiable. • Considering whether transfers by foreign governments should be non- notifiable. 21. These potential improvements could be considered as a separate project over a longer period of time. Part of this work could also include consideration of whether the sale price could be collected as part of the Land Transfer Tax Statement. Legislative vehicle 22. We have drafted the Cabinet paper on the basis that the amendments should be included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill by way of a Supplementary Order Paper introduced at the Committee of the whole House stage. 23. Introducing the amendments as soon as possible will enable the Government to send an immediate signal that they are committed to addressing property speculation and will closely follow the Government’s announced response to the Tax Working Group’s recommendations. The amendments could have a commencement date of 1 April 2020. This delayed commencement date would allow time to consult with stakeholders, such as the New Zealand Law Society, on the design of the form and process implications before the legislation comes into force. In addition, this commencement date provides the required lead-in time of six months in order to made necessary changes to Landonline. 24. An alternative legislative option would be to include the amendment in an omnibus tax bill scheduled for introduction in June/July of 2019. The advantage of this option is that it would provide the opportunity for the proposed legislation to go through the select committee process and would reduce the risk of unintended consequences. However, this would delay the Government’s decision to legislate and act on the recommendation made by the Tax Working Group. If this legislative vehicle is chosen, the amendments could have a commencement date of 1 October 2020. In Confidence IR2019/235: Cabinet paper – Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes Page 4 of 5 IN CONFIDENCE 25. The key trade-off between these two options is the ability to bring the proposal into effect as soon as practicable (1 April 2020 compared with 1 October 2020 or later) and the opportunity for the proposed legislative amendments to go through consultation as part of the select committee process. Under both options, we would consult with key stakeholders on the design of the form before the amendment comes into force. 26. To mitigate the risk of unintended consequences that may arise due to including the changes by SOP, officials propose to consult with key stakeholders (such as New Zealand Law Society and Auckland District Law Society) on the drafting of the SOP at the earliest possible date. In Confidence IR2019/235: Cabinet paper – Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes Page 5 of 5 IN CONFIDENCE Recommended action We recommend that you: 27. agree to remove the exemption from providing a person’s IRD number and, if applicable, any tax identification numbers when a transfer of property relates to the person’s main home. Agreed/Not agreed 28. agree to include an indicator on the Land Transfer Tax Statement to identify whether it is the person’s main home. Agreed/Not agreed 29. agree to a related remedial amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to replace the reference to the Land Transfer Act 1952 with a reference to the current section in the Land Transfer Act 2017. Agreed/Not agreed 30. agree to include the amendments above in a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill at the Committee of the whole House stage. Agreed/Not agreed 31. agree that key stakeholders should be consulted on the drafting of the SOP. Agreed/Not agreed 32. authorise the lodgement of the attached Cabinet paper (following any amendments you make) with the Cabinet Office by 10 am Thursday 16 May for the Cabinet Economic Development Committee to consider at its meeting on 22 May 2019; Authorised/Not authorised Senior Policy Advisor Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2019 s 9(2)(a) In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee COLLECTION OF IRD NUMBERS FOR THE TRANSFER OF MAIN HOMES Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to re move the main home exemption from the requirements to provide IRD and tax identification numbers (TINs) when transferring a property. Executive Summary 2.Currently, transferors (sellers) and transferees (purchasers) must each complete a L and Transfer Tax Statement when a property is transferred. This statement collects tax information relating to property ownership for the purpose of improving compliance with the tax rules around property, including the rules targeting property speculation. 3.The tax information required for a Land Transfer Tax Statement includes the t ransferor or transferee’s IRD number and, if applicable, any overseas TINs and the jurisdiction of tax residence. The IRD number and property details are then supplied to Inland Revenue for use in its property tax compliance work. The TIN is reported to other countries to help prevent global tax evasion. 4.Transferors and transferees are not currently required to include their IRD number or T IN if the property sale qualifies as a “non-notifiable” transfer. The most common reason a property sale is a non-notifiable transfer is when the property being transferred is used as the transferor or transferee’s main home. 5.The exemption from providing an IRD number for the transfer of a main home means t hat Inland Revenue does not receive complete information regarding property ownership relevant to potential tax obligations. This impacts on Inland Revenue’s ability to enforce compliance with property tax rules, including making it more difficult to identify property speculators. The exemption from providing the TIN means that the current rules are not as effective as they could be at deterring global tax evasion. 6.The Tax Working Group recently reported to the Government with recommendations f or improving the tax system. One of the Tax Working Group’s recommendations was to require the disclosure of IRD numbers on the Land Transfer Tax Statement when the transfer involves a main home. The Government agreed that this recommendation should be considered as a high priority item for inclusion on the Tax Policy Work Programme. 7.In line with the recommendation made by the Tax Working Group, I propose to a mend the tax statement to require transferors and transferees to provide their IRD number and, if applicable, any TIN and jurisdiction of tax residence, when there is a 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:47 IN CONFIDENCE 2. property transfer involving their main home. The transferor or transferee should continue to be asked if the property is their main home. 8. I consider the proposal will enhance Inland Revenue’s ability to enforce the tax rules for property. By improving and aligning the information disclosure rules for property transactions with the rules for bank accounts, it helps to reduce tax evasion being facilitated through holding property. The proposal is likely to have minor compliance costs for transferors and transferees as more IRD numbers will be required to be collected as part of the land transfer process. 9. Further, I consider it is appropriate to respond swiftly to the recommendation made by the Tax Working Group and signal to property speculators that the Government wants to improve compliance with the property tax rules. 10. LINZ notes that the primary purposes of the land registration system are to record ownership of land and facilitate dealings with land. The efficiency of New Zealand’s land registration system is well regarded internationally (for example, New Zealand was ranked first for registering property in the World Bank’s “Doing Business 2019” report). Collecting information for other purposes does not fit within the core purposes of the Land Transfer Act 2017 and therefore the impact of any further information requirements must be carefully considered. I have asked my officials to work with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) with a view to streamlining the land transfer forms if possible. 11. To bring this proposal into effect, amendments to the Land Transfer Act 2017 will be required. I propose to include this in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Suppliers and Remedial Matters) Bill by way of a Supplementary Order Paper at the Committee of the whole House stage. I propose a commencement date of 1 January 2020; this would allow time to make required changes to Landonline. A consolidated and simplified form will be developed in consultation with key stakeholders. Background 12. On 1 October 2015, the Land Transfer Act 1952 was amended to require transferors and transferees to provide tax statements for all transfers of property. This was aimed at providing more useful information to Inland Revenue to assist in its enforcement of property tax rules and to support the bright-line test 1 . 13. Under these changes, transferors and transferees of real property are required to provide their IRD numbers unless an exemption applies. If they are not eligible for an exemption and are also resident in another jurisdiction for tax purposes, they must also provide their foreign TINs at the time of transfer. 14. This information is filled out by transferors and transferees and must be provided to LINZ in order for the property title to be transferred. This information is then provided to Inland Revenue to improve compliance with the tax rules around property. Relevant information is also provided by Inland Revenue to Statistics New Zealand, to enable the production of property transfer statistics. 1 In 2018, the bright-line test on residential property was extended from two years to five years to help ensure residential property speculators pay tax on gains from property sales. Accordingly, gains from the sale of residential property purchased on or after 29 March 2018 may be taxable if sold within five years of purchase. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:47 IN CONFIDENCE 15. Information required by the Land Transfer Tax Statement is prescribed in the Land Transfer Act 2017 and includes identity and property details and parties’ IRD numbers (and TINs if applicable). Currently a transferor or transferee is only required to provide their IRD number if there is no “non-notifiable” reason. The most common reason for a non-notifiable transfer is where the property being transferred qualifies as a main home. Trusts cannot claim the main home exemption and therefore must always provide their IRD number for property transfers. 16. There was a total of 179,178 property transfers during the year ended 30 June 2018. Data from the commencement of the Land Transfer Tax Statement to 28 February 2019 shows the main home exemption was claimed by sellers 27% of the time and by purchasers 37% of the time. 17. Initial analysis of property transactions by Inland Revenue to determine compliance with the bright-line rule has indicated that there is currently a level of non- compliance. The fairness of the tax system is undermined where taxpayers don’t comply with their tax obligations. Where Inland Revenue suspects instances of non- compliance with the property tax rules, it follows these up. However, having many transactions for which an IRD number is not supplied, based upon a non-notifiable reason which is self-determined makes it more difficult to detect and therefore remedy the true levels of non-compliance. 18. The Tax Working Group, which was established by the Government to examine further improvements in the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system, reported back to the Government on 21 February 2019 with recommendations to improve the tax system, including the recommendation to require the disclosure of IRD numbers on the Land Transfer Tax Statement when the transfer involves a main home. The Government released its response to the Tax Working Group’s recommendations in April and agreed that this recommendation should be considered as a high priority item for inclusion on the Tax Policy Work Programme. Removing the main home exemption for providing an IRD number 19. The main home exemption for IRD numbers creates a gap in information provided to Inland Revenue and consequently decreases the enforcement benefits from collecting tax information at the point of property transfer. 20. The sale of a property may be taxable even when a person acquired the property intending to use it as their main home. For example, the sale of these properties can be taxable if: 20.1 The person changes their use of the property from being their main home to being an investment property or similar (and the sale is taxable under the brightline test or other land-sale rules). 20.2 The person engages in a regular pattern of selling main homes (for example, habitual renovators). 21. Not requiring IRD numbers for people’s main homes means Inland Revenue does not have visibility of these situations and means Inland Revenue is unable to obtain a full picture around overall compliance with the property rules. This limits Inland Revenue’s ability to enforce the property tax rules. Further, we also consider that a 3 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:47 IN CONFIDENCE simple, clear rule to require an IRD number at the point of property transaction could have some deterrent effect on people who may be considering tax evasion through property. Removing the main home exemption for providing a TIN and overseas jurisdiction of residence 22. Transferors and transferees who are tax resident 2 in another country must include on the Land Transfer Tax Statement their TIN 3 and the name of the jurisdiction in which they are tax resident unless an exemption applies. 23. This information is reported to other countries to help prevent global tax evasion. It is well known internationally that the provision of TINs generally in third party reporting has a strong deterrent effect to tax evasion. 24. If a tax resident of another country claims the main home exemption, they are not required to provide their TIN and the name of the jurisdiction when transferring property except in limited circumstances (for example, if the person is not a New Zealand citizen nor a resident for immigration purposes then they cannot claim the main home exemption). 25. Requiring the provision of TINs when transferring main homes without exemptions will help ensure that data provided to treaty partners is easily able to be matched to the correct person. Requiring the reporting of TINs for property sales would go beyond current international requirements, but would be consistent with the Automatic Exchange of Information/Common Reporting Standard financial reporting requirements 4 that apply when individuals open new bank accounts, and would position New Zealand favourably as a leader in international efforts to combat tax evasion. Main home indicator 26. I consider that the transferor or transferee should still be asked if the property being transferred is their main home. This main home indicator allows Inland Revenue to identify taxpayers who should be sent follow up information and correspondence advising of property tax rules and those who are unlikely to have tax obligations arising from the property transfer. 27. If Inland Revenue does not receive indicators as to whether a property is the main home of a taxpayer, Inland Revenue will be unable to distinguish the taxpayers who should be included in property compliance campaigns from those who are unlikely to have tax consequences under the property tax rules. 28. However, I note that requiring transferors and transferees to indicate whether the property is their main home will involve some compliance cost. I have asked Inland Revenue and LINZ to explore options to simplify the definition of ‘main home’ for the purpose of this indicator to help reduce these costs. 2 Generally, a person is tax resident in another country if that country imposes income tax obligations on the person’s worldwide income. 3 A TIN is the unique identifier that is given to a taxpayer by a jurisdiction’s tax authority. A person’s IRD number is a TIN in the context of New Zealand. 4 AEOI/CRS is a global framework for the detection and prevention of offshore tax evasion, which involves the collection, reporting, and exchange of financial account information relating to people and entities investing outside of the jurisdiction in which they are tax resident. 4 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:47 IN CONFIDENCE Expected impact on compliance costs 29. Requiring tax information as part of a property transfer involves compliance costs for parties to the transaction. These compliance costs were considered alongside analysis of the policy introducing the requirements for tax statements in 2015. However, recent changes to the Overseas Investment Act have subsequently increased compliance obligations for property transfers and conveyancers and I am mindful that each additional compliance step must be viewed in the context of the overall process of the property transaction rather than in isolation. 30. The additional requirement to provide an IRD number for main home transfers would result in a minor increase in compliance costs. Data shows that as at 28 February 2019, 37% of purchasers and 27% of sellers have used the main home exemption since the commencement of the Land Transfer Tax Statement requirements in 2015. This shows that the majority are currently providing their IRD number as part of tax information requirements. Approximately a third of those claiming the main home exemption currently provide their IRD number even though it is not required. 31. For persons buying or selling their main home, the proposal would increase compliance costs as they would be required to provide their IRD number and any TINs. However, the vast majority of transferors and transferees will already have an IRD number prior to entering into a property transaction. There are many circumstances where taxpayers are required to provide their IRD number, for example, when starting employment, applying for social policy entitlements, or opening up a bank account or other accounts with financial institutions. IRD numbers are often provided on employment payslips, tax statements on interest bearing accounts and are included in a taxpayer’s information on their myIR account. 32. The cost for each person will vary depending on how readily available their IRD number is. However, I consider the overall increase in compliance costs is likely to be low for the reasons outlined above. 33. LINZ notes that the primary purposes of the land registration system are to record ownership of land and facilitate dealings with land. The efficiency of New Zealand’s land registration system is well regarded internationally (for example, New Zealand was ranked first for registering property in the World Bank’s “Doing Business 2019” report). Collecting information for other purposes does not fit within the core purposes of the Land Transfer Act 2017 and therefore the impact of any further information requirements must be carefully considered. 34. Several different information gathering requirements for transfers of property have been introduced in recent years, each with their own form to be completed. This increases the paperwork associated with every land transaction. There are three forms required for property transfers; the Land Transfer Tax Statement, the Residential Land Statement and the Residential Land Withholding Tax Declaration which create compliance costs for property transfers. For example, the Land Transfer Tax Statement has three pages to be filled out and is 10 pages long in total, including notes. 35. To mitigate any increase in compliance costs, there is merit in exploring how we can streamline and simplify the current process for providing information at the time of property transfers. I have requested Inland Revenue work with LINZ to explore 5 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:47 IN CONFIDENCE options for simplifying and combining these forms. This should also involve consultation with Statistics New Zealand given their role in providing property transfer statistics. 36. The proposed amendment would require changes to the Landonline workspace, including appropriate transitional arrangements. The changes might require a new Landonline release, which would necessitate up to a six month period for coding and testing, so sufficient time will need to be allowed to implement the changes. 37. Slight modifications would need to be made to the current LINZ/Inland Revenue data interface to reflect the changes in the data being collected, and Inland Revenue may also need to make some minor system changes to enable more efficient use of the data for compliance purposes; however, these are not expected to be significant. 38. Any new information requirements have the potential to affect processes. For this reason, it is important that key stakeholders, such as the New Zealand Law Society, are consulted to understand the practical implications of the changes. 39. Inland Revenue would need to ensure that the new requirements were adequately communicated to conveyancers ahead of the application date. Early passage of the legislation will enable this to occur. Implementation 40. It is proposed that these amendments should come into force from 1 January 2020. This would allow sufficient time to develop the required changes to Landonline. A consolidated and simplified form will be developed, in consultation with key stakeholders. 41. Transitional provisions will be necessary to allow for contracts that have been entered into but not settled at commencement. People will have contracted on the basis of the rules at the time of signing and there is the potential for the legislative amendments to affect existing contracts and therefore impose compliance costs if transitional provisions are not enacted. The transitional provisions in Schedule 1AA of the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 (which introduced the Land Transfer Tax Statements) could serve as a model. For example, it could provide that transfers entered into on or before 1 January 2020 and registered before 1 July 2020 are still eligible for the main home exemption. Consultation 42. The Treasury and LINZ have been consulted in the preparation of this Cabinet paper. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner and Statistics New Zealand have been consulted on this proposal. 43. I consider that further consultation on design of forms will be required with stakeholders including the New Zealand Law Society and Auckland District Law Society, before the legislation comes into force. Officials are undertaking consultation with these organisations on the details and drafting of the proposal. At the time of lodgement, officials had discussed the proposal with a major stakeholder who noted the proposal to remove the main home exemption would simplify the process because it would provide a standardised approach to transactions. This stakeholder also noted that the process would benefit from having the forms streamlined. 6 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:47 IN CONFIDENCE Financial Implications 44. There are no direct financial implications from this proposal. To the extent that the provision of IRD numbers improves compliance with the current rules there will be an increase in tax revenue collection; however this impact is unquantifiable at this stage. Legislative Implications 45. Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Land Transfer Act 2017. The Land Transfer Act includes provisions relating to the collection of tax information in the form of a Land Transfer Tax Statement. These provisions would require amendment to remove the use of the property as a main home from qualifying for a non-notifiable transfer. 46. If approved, I propose including the legislative changes resulting from these recommendations in a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill at the Committee of the whole House stage. 47. I propose the amendments to remove the main home non-notifiable reason should have a commencement date of 1 January 2020. Impact Analysis 48. A regulatory impact assessment has been prepared by Inland Revenue, and is attached to this paper. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIA partially meets the quality assurance criteria. 49. The Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis statement notes that due to time constraints a full consultation with external parties has not been undertaken. The RIA does note that consultation is intended to be undertaken on the legislative drafting and the views of submitters on the 2015 changes have been taken into account. While the RIA identifies that analysis of compliance with the brightline rule has detected some non-compliance, it does not identify how significant the level of non - compliance is that the proposed option is attempting to address. Publicity 50. I will make an announcement on the contents of the SOP, when the SOP is released. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Proactive Release 51. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: 1. note that the Land Transfer Act 2017 contains tax statement requirements which must be completed by both transferors and transferees when land is transferred. 7 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:47 IN CONFIDENCE 2. note that the Tax Working Group recommended the disclosure of IRD numbers as part of the tax statement when the transfer involves a main home. 3. agree to remove the exemption from providing a person’s IRD number and if applicable any tax identification numbers (and jurisdiction of tax residence) when the transfer of property relates to the person’s main home. 4. agreeto retain an indicator on the Land Transfer Tax Statement to identify where it is a person’s main home. 5. agree that the amendments giving effect to the recommendations 3 and 4 above should come into effect from 1 January 2020. 6. agree to a transitional provision to address situations where transfers have been entered into on the basis of the current requirements. 7. note that regulatory impact analysis on the proposal has been completed and is attached to this paper. 8. notethat this Cabinet paper, the associated Cabinet minute, and key advice papers will be released on Inland Revenue’s website. Authorised for lodgement Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue 8 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:47 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The Government decided to implement the Tax Working Group’s recommendation for the disclosure of IRD numbers on transfers of main homes as soon as possible. Therefore, there has been a relatively short time available to prepare this analysis, and consultation with key external stakeholders has been limited. There has however been previous analysis of the current proposal. The requirement for an IRD number and overseas tax information to be provided upon transfer of property (with an exemption for the main homes of individuals) was introduced in 2015. The proposal to require IRD numbers and tax information numbers from main home owners was the preferred approach of Inland Revenue, as stated in the Regulatory Impact Statement that was prepared for the 2015 change 1 . Further, this recommendation was made by the Tax Working Group in its final report. The Group’s recommendations to the Government to improve the fairness, structure and balance of the tax system were made following their consideration of public submissions. There has been limited consultation specifically on the current policy proposal. One of the important reasons for consultation is identifying likely impacts of a policy proposal. We consider that this is a less complex proposal than most tax policy proposals, and therefore unintended consequences are less likely to occur. We have also considered the comments raised by submitters who commented in 2015 on the Land Transfer Act Amendment Bill which introduced the requirement to provide IRD numbers and overseas tax information upon transfer of property. Some of those submissions noted disadvantages with the main home exemption, which included the fact that the exemption was relatively complex. We intend to consult with key stakeholders on the legislative drafting and the design of the forms. 1 The RIS prepared for the 2015 change can be found at: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2015-ris-liopi- bill/overview 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:54 3. Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Responsible Manager (signature and date): Peter Frawley Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 17 May 2019 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:54 Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? Currently, transferors (sellers) and transferees (purchasers) must each complete a Land Transfer Tax Statement when a property is transferred. The Land Transfer Tax Statement collects information relating to property ownership, for statistical purposes and the purpose of improving compliance with the tax rules around property, including the rules targeting property speculation. The tax information required for a Land Transfer Tax Statement includes the transferor or transferee’s IRD number and, if applicable, information about the person’s overseas tax residence (the person’s overseas tax information number (TIN) and the jurisdiction in which they are tax resident). The IRD number and property details are then supplied to Inland Revenue for use in its property tax compliance work. The overseas tax information is supplied to Inland Revenue to share with other countries in accordance with New Zealand’s tax treaties to help prevent global tax evasion. Transferors and transferees are not currently required to include their IRD number and overseas tax information if the property transfer qualifies as a “non-notifiable transfer”. The most common reason a property transfer is a non-notifiable transfer is because the property being transferred is used as the transferor or transferee’s main home. 2 However, trusts must still provide IRD numbers and overseas tax information, even if it is the settlor’s main home. Problem Initial analysis of property transactions by Inland Revenue to determine compliance with the bright-line rule 3 has detected some non-compliance. (The level of non-compliance cannot be accurately determined owing, in part, to the incomplete tax information collected for transfers of main homes.) The fairness of the tax system is undermined where taxpayers don’t comply with their tax obligations. Where Inland Revenue suspects instances of non-compliance with the property tax rules, it follows these up. However, having many transactions for which an IRD number is not supplied, based upon a non-notifiable transfer which is self-determined, makes it more difficult to detect and therefore remedy the true levels of non-compliance. The main home exemption for IRD numbers creates a gap in information provided to Inland Revenue and consequently decreases the enforcement benefits from collecting tax information at the point of property transfer. 2 A transfer cannot be a non-notifiable transfer if the transferor or transferee is an “offshore person” (for example, if they are a non-New Zealand resident and they do not have a residence class visa, or they are a citizen or hold a residence class visa but have not physically been in New Zealand for a certain period of time). 3 The bright-line rule was introduced in 2015 and originally deemed the disposal of residential land to be taxable if disposal occurred with 2 years of acquisition. It was amended in 2018 to now apply to residential property disposed of within 5 years of acquisition. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:54 Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 4 IN CONFIDENCE The transfer of a property may be taxable even when a person acquired the property intending to use it as their main home. For example, the sale of these properties can be taxable if:  The person changes their use of the property from being their main home to being an investment property or similar (and the sale is taxable under the bright-line test or other land-sale rules).  The person engages in a regular pattern of selling main homes (for example, habitual renovators). Not requiring IRD numbers for people’s main homes means Inland Revenue does not have visibility of these situations and means Inland Revenue is unable to obtain a full picture around overall compliance with, and ability to enforce, the property tax rules. The exemption from providing information about the person’s overseas tax residence means that the current rules are not as effective as they could be at deterring global tax evasion. It is well known internationally that the provision of TINs generally in third party reporting has a strong deterrent effect on tax evasion. 2.2 Who is affected and how? The affected parties are property conveyancers and transferors and transferees of main homes. Property conveyancers would be required to include their clients’ IRD numbers and any TINs on Land Transfer Tax Statements even if the property was or will be a client’s main home. Transferees and transferors of main homes will need to ensure their IRD number and any TINs are provided to their property conveyancer. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? Due to the timelines we have been only been able to undertake limited consultation with external stakeholders. Therefore, we are unable to consider additional options stakeholders may have raised before seeking a Cabinet decision on the proposal. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:54 Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 5 IN CONFIDENCE Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria have been used to assess the options:  Enforcement – the option should increase the effective enforcement of current tax rules relating to property transactions and help prevent non-residents from evading foreign tax on their transfer of New Zealand property.  Compliance costs – the option should not unnecessarily increase compliance costs for property conveyancers and transferees and transferors of properties.  Administration costs – the option should not unnecessarily increase administration costs for LINZ and Inland Revenue. Option 1: Status Quo Under the status quo, IRD numbers and overseas tax information (TINs and country of residence) are not required on the Land Transfer Tax Statement if the property was the transferor’s main home or will be the transferee’s main home. Option 2: Require IRD numbers and TINs to be provided on the Land Transfer Tax Statement with an indicator of whether the property was or will be a main home (proposed option). Under this option, IRD numbers and TINs would be required to be provided on the Land Transfer Tax Statement even if the property was or will be a main home. Under this option, transferees and transferors of property would still need to indicate on the Land Transfer Tax Statement whether the property was or will be a main home. However, it is intended to re-draft this test to make it simpler to apply than the existing “main home test”. This option would be the best from an enforcement perspective. The provision of IRD numbers on all property transactions means Inland Revenue will have visibility of situations in which a transaction may be taxable despite involving a main home. Furthermore, the requirement to provide an IRD number on the Land Transfer Tax Statement for main homes may have a deterrent effect on people who may be considering tax evasion through property. Requiring the provision of TINs when transferring main homes without exemptions will help to ensure that data provided to treaty partners is easily available to be matched to the correct person. The retention of an indicator on the Land Transfer Tax Statement for whether a property is a main home would allow Inland Revenue to identify taxpayers who should be sent follow up information and correspondence advising of property tax rules and those who are unlikely to have tax obligations arising from the property transfer. This option would result in a slight increase in compliance costs relative to the status quo as property conveyancers would need to obtain their client’s IRD number and any TINs and include these on the Land Transfer Tax Statement even if the property is a main home. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:54 Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 6 IN CONFIDENCE The RIS that was prepared for the 2015 change commented in relation to this option that: “The actual compliance costs likely to be imposed by the proposal have not been accurately determined, but are not expected to be high given that identity verification information is already supplied to LINZ. A conveyancer is likely to spend an additional 1-5 minutes entering information into Landonline, resulting in an additional cost of between $4 and $20 for purchaser and seller.” We do not have further information to suggest whether or not this assessment was correct. In the year ended 30 June 2018 there were 179,178 property transfers. Since the Land Transfer Tax Statement was introduced until 28 February 2019 the main home exemption has been claimed by transferors 27% of the time and by transferees 37% of the time. While this option would increase compliance costs for the 27% of transferors and 37% of transferees who claim the main home exemption (and their respective conveyancers), the provision of IRD numbers or overseas tax information is not an onerous compliance cost. We expect that the vast majority of individuals who own, or will own homes, will already have an IRD number, and be able to find it out relatively simply. Furthermore, the provision of IRD numbers is already required in many other situations such as when a person starts a new job, opens a bank account or switches KiwiSaver provider. Likewise, for homeowners who have a tax residence in another country, and who are not offshore persons, the provision of their TIN and country of tax residence is not expected to be an onerous compliance cost given that this information is now required in other circumstances when dealing with financial institutions (e.g. in order to open a New Zealand bank account). However, there is a risk that as IRD numbers and overseas tax information would be required in more circumstances there may be an increase in instances of property transfers being held up owing to this information not being provided. This option would result in a one-off increase in administration costs for Inland Revenue and LINZ compared to the status quo. These include updating relevant forms, changes to Landonline 4 and slight modifications to the data interface between LINZ and Inland Revenue. Inland Revenue may also need to make some minor system changes to enable more efficient use of the data for compliance purposes. The increased volume of IRD numbers provided will have a corresponding increase on the manual work required by Inland Revenue to correct any IRD numbers provided in error (which may involve checking with the conveyancer). The option may also result in some small one-off administration costs for Statistics New Zealand related to updating systems to handle the changes to the Land Transfer Tax Statement. Inland Revenue and Statistics New Zealand may also need to alter the interface used to transfer some additional or altered Land Transfer Tax Statement information. The total increase in administration costs from this option is not expected to be significant. Option 3: Require IRD numbers and TINs to be provided on the Land Transfer Tax Statement with no indicator of whether the property was or will be a main home. 4 Landonline is an online transaction centre where property professionals can securely search, lodge and update title dealings and survey data. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:54 Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Under this option, IRD numbers and TINs would be required to be provided on the Land Transfer Tax Statement even if the property was or will be a main home. However, unlike option 2, there would be no indicator on the form as to whether a property is or will be a main home. While this option would likely be better from an enforcement perspective than the status quo, the lack of an indicator of whether a property was or will be a main home would make it difficult for Inland Revenue to distinguish between taxpayers who should be included in property compliance campaigns from those who are unlikely to have tax consequences under the property tax rules. Like option 2, this option would result in a slight increase in compliance costs relative to the status quo as property conveyancers would need to obtain their client’s IRD number and/or TIN and include this on the Land Transfer Tax Statement even if the property is a main home. Where it is not clear whether a person’s property is a main home, this option would likely reduce compliance costs slightly relative to the status quo as property conveyancers would not need to determine whether a property is a main home. While in many cases it will be obvious whether a property was or will be a main home, it can be difficult to determine in cases when a person owns multiple homes. The administration costs of this option are comparable to option 2. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The proposed approach is option 2 as it would best enhance the effective enforcement of current tax rules relating to property. While this option would increase compliance and administration costs relative to the status quo, these increases in costs are likely to be low and are justified by the improvements to Inland Revenue’s enforcement of tax rules relating to property. The proposed approach is generally aligned with the Government’s expectations for the design of regulatory systems. However, there has been limited opportunity for affected parties to comment on the proposal before it is formally proposed. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:54 Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 8 IN CONFIDENCE Section 4: Impact Analysis (Proposed approach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Small increase in on-going compliance costs for conveyancers and transferees and transferors of main homes due to the requirement to include tax information on the Land Transfer Tax Statement even if the property is a main home.

Low Total Monetised Benefit N/A Non-monetised benefits Medium 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:54 Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 9 IN CONFIDENCE 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? There might be a small increase in the data quality available to Statistics New Zealand due to Inland Revenue’s improved ability to verify data that has been provided. Acquiring IRD numbers for more transferors and transferees may also improve the ability for additional data to be linked to information gathered from Land Transfer Tax Statements to provide further statistical insights. We do not anticipate that the proposed approach would have any other impacts. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The Government decided to implement the Tax Working Group’s recommendation as soon as possible. Limited consultation on this proposal has been undertaken on the proposed approach owing to these timelines. Feedback from stakeholders has been mixed but all acknowledged the rationale for removing the main home exemption. One stakeholder commented that the proposal would be an improvement on the current process by moving towards a standardised approach for transfers. Another stakeholder commented that the proposal would provide Inland Revenue with richer data on which to enforce the brightline property rules. One stakeholder noted that the current rules had bedded down and that there would be some compliance cost for conveyancing lawyers having to explain the change to clients who would now have to provide their IRD number. They commented that the increase in the number of IRD numbers received would also increase the compliance costs and time involved by Inland Revenue and lawyers to validate and correct any errors in the IRD numbers provided. One stakeholder commented that given the proposal requires more people to provide IRD numbers, this process should be simplified as much as practicable. Two stakeholders also commented that it would be desirable to have the current forms streamlined. A number of submissions were received when the requirement to provide IRD numbers to LINZ as part of the land registration process, but with an exemption for the main home, was being considered in 2015 by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee (FEC). Several submitters to FEC commented that the exemption from providing IRD numbers and overseas tax information for transfers of main homes was problematic. Reasons for this lack of support were that it would increase complexity of the rules and reduce the usefulness of the information for Government. No submitters to the 2015 Bill expressed support for the exemption from providing tax information for transfers of main homes. The proposed option would address those submitters’ concerns that the exemption for transfers of main homes reduces the usefulness of the information for Government. It would address submitters’ concerns around the complexity of the rules to some degree, as the 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:54 Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 10 IN CONFIDENCE main home indicator is intended to be less complex than the current question relating to whether a property is a main home. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:54 Impact Summary: Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? Following Cabinet approval of the proposed approach, the required amendments to the Land Transfer Act 2017 will be drafted for inclusion as a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill at the Committee of the whole House stage. The amendments to the Land Transfer Act 2017 would have a commencement date of 1 January 2020. The proposed option would require new forms to be developed in consultation with key stakeholders and for the required changes to be made in Landonline. Transitional provisions would be necessary to allow for contracts that have been entered into but not settled at commencement. People will have contracted on the basis of the rules at the time of signing and there is the potential for the legislative amendments to affect existing contracts and therefore impose unexpected compliance costs if transitional provisions are not enacted. The transitional provisions in Schedule 1AA of the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2015 (which introduced the Land Transfer Tax Statements) could serve as a model. For example, it could provide that transfers entered into on or before 1 January 2020 and registered before 1 July 2020 are still eligible for the exemption from providing IRD numbers and overseas tax information for transfers of main homes. Slight modifications would need to be made to the current LINZ/Inland Revenue data interface to reflect the proposed changes in the data being collected. Inland Revenue may also need to make some minor system changes to enable more efficient use of the data for compliance purposes. However, these changes are not expected to be significant. Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes to confirm that they match the policy objectives. Monitoring the impact of the new arrangements will be done through assessing how the additional data collected assists with the effective enforcement of the tax rules relating to property. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? Officials from Inland Revenue expect that, once the proposals are enacted, affected stakeholders will raise with them and/or LINZ any concerns they have with how the rules are working in practice. Any necessary changes identified as a result could be considered for addition to the Government’s tax policy work programme. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:18:54 I N C O N F I D E N C E DEV-19-MIN-0127 Cabinet Economic Development Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Energy and Resources Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee Extending tax exemption for non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel op e rators Proposal 1 At present, there is a temporary five-year exemption from income tax on the income of n on-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators which is due to expire on 31 December 2019. We propose that the exemption be extended for a further five years from 1 January 2020 until 31 December 2024. Executive Summary 2 At present, there is a temporary five-year exemption from income tax on the income of n on-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators which is due to expire on 31 December 2019. The exemption removes the incentive for rigs and seismic vessels to “churn”, that is, move in and out of New Zealand waters within 183-days to ensure income is exempt from income tax under many of our double tax agreements (DTAs). 3 In the absence of the tax exemption no company tax would be paid by the oil rig and seismi c vessel operators, while the increased costs from churning would be deductible to the New Zealand petroleum company and the reduced exploration and production may result in lower company taxes, petroleum royalties, and other taxes being paid over time. 4 A decision to extend the income tax exemption would be in keeping with the ann ouncement that there will be no new offshore petroleum exploration permits granted, which included maintaining the existing and subsequent rights of existing operators. Where further offshore petroleum exploration is undertaken under existing permits, it is in New Zealand’s interest for this to be done as efficiently as possible, without having policies that encourage churn. Background The tax exemption was introduced in 2004 to address an issue created by our DTAs, und er which operators are only taxable in New Zealand if they are present here for at least 183 days. The exemption was subsequently renewed in 2009 and again in 2014 on the basis that this provides a more sensible result from a tax policy perspective. As the exemption is due to expire again on 31 December 2019, a decision is required on whether the exemption should continue to apply. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:14 IN CONFIDENCE 5 1 1. 6 New Zealand generally taxes non-residents on income that has a source in New Zealand and if the non-resident has a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand. Many of our DTAs (such as the New Zealand/United States DTA) have a specific rule providing that a non-resident enterprise involved in exploring for natural resources only has a permanent establishment in New Zealand if they are present for a particular period of time, often 183 days in a year. Once a non-resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand, it is taxed on all its New Zealand business profits starting from its first day in New Zealand. 7 Before the exemption was introduced rigs and seismic vessels used in petroleum exploration and production were leaving New Zealand waters before the 183 day threshold was reached to avoid being subject to New Zealand tax. This meant that, in most cases, a rig or vessel would leave before 183 days and a different rig or vessel was mobilised to complete the exploration/production programme, if required. This increased the cost for companies engaged in exploration and production and delayed exploration drilling and any subsequent discovery/development of oil or gas. It also meant that there was no company tax revenue collected from rigs and seismic vessels. Due to the limited supply of offshore drilling rigs, and the significant mobilisation costs, it could also result in exploration activity not taking place when it otherwise would. Comment 8 Rigs and seismic vessels are used to drill for oil and gas and gather data on potential oil and gas finds. These rigs and vessels do not generally work offshore in winter weather for safety reasons. No New Zealand companies own these assets, and offshore rigs and seismic vessels owned by non-residents are covered by the current income tax exemption. 9 Between 2009 and 2017, there have been nine non-resident offshore drilling rigs operating in New Zealand. The average length of stay of these rigs has been 315 days. By contrast, between 2000 and 2005 (before the exemption was introduced), no rigs stayed in New Zealand waters beyond six months. At this stage it is anticipated at least one rig will operate within New Zealand waters in 2019-20. 10 Twelve seismic vessels have operated in New Zealand since 2009 with an average duration of 108 days with one high-value survey extending through to 200 days. Before 2005, the average length of stay was around four months. Maintaining the exemption removes a barrier for lengthier stays (which have been fewer but are typically more lucrative). 11 A consistent application of New Zealand’s tax policy framework would normally minimise any distortions caused by tax rules. However, with rigs and seismic vessels used for exploration or production work the normal tax rules do not provide the right outcome. This is because the normal tax rules create an incentive for rigs and seismic vessels to “churn”, that is, move in and out of New Zealand waters within a 183 day period where income is exempt under many of our DTAs. If rigs and seismic vessels churn in and out of New Zealand waters within the non-taxable period of 183 days it will reduce the revenue base, and increase unnecessary costs and greenhouse gas emissions. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:14 IN CONFIDENCE 2 12 Under the exemption, royalties, income tax and other indirect taxes would still be payable in relation to any petroleum discoveries (in addition to the direct and indirect economic benefits from the activity), as the exemption only applies to the non-resident rig and seismic vessel operators rather than the petroleum miner. 13 The 2015 APEC fossil fuel subsidy reform peer review of New Zealand noted that this exemption appears to prevent ‘churning’ or cycling of equipment which avoids unnecessary costs, including additional fuel consumption (i.e. wasteful consumption by drilling operators), and associated greenhouse gas emissions. The OECD lists this measure as a “support measure” but has attributed a zero fiscal cost to New Zealand for each year since 2006. Environmental impact, health and safety and security of supply 14 Offshore drilling for petroleum in New Zealand began in the 1960s. To date, over 200 offshore wells have been drilled in New Zealand, 10 of which have been in deep water, without any significant incidents. New Zealand also has high health and safety standards with respect to oil and gas exploration and production. This is evidenced in our tight regulation and monitoring of operators and our absence of oil and gas environmental disasters. However, we note that rig mobilisations, demobilisations, and other movements (that occur as a result of churn) increase health and safety risks due to the activities and large infrastructure assets involved. If the exemption is allowed to lapse we would expect increased churn, and therefore increased, but still a low probability of, health and safety risks. 15 New Zealand’s gas reserves are only sufficient to cover a decade of annual gas demand at current demand levels. To prevent the situation of gas reserve depletion interrupting our energy supply, new sources of gas may need to be found within the next few years. This may be by way of new gas finds, or extension of existing fields, but either of which will involve some lead-time to production. Consistency with recent Government announcement on no new offshore petroleum exploration permits 16 On 12 April 2018 the Government announced there will be no new offshore petroleum exploration permits granted. The Cabinet Minute \[CAB-18-MIN-0162 refers\] confirms this policy is not intended to affect the rights of current permit holders to continue production or exploration activities under existing permits. 17 A decision to extend the income tax exemption would be in keeping with the policy to maintain the rights of existing operators. Where further offshore petroleum exploration is undertaken under existing permits, it is in New Zealand’s interest for this to be done as efficiently as possible, without encouraging churn. 18 Instead of a further five-year extension we also considered making the exemption permanent. We consider a five year extension is more prudent as this will provide sufficient certainty for near-term investment decisions while allowing time to consider and develop the Tax Working Group’s recommendations, related to improving environmental and ecological outcomes. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:14 IN CONFIDENCE 3 Consultation 19 Targeted consultation has been undertaken with the oil and gas industry representative body, the Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand (PEPANZ), which supports extending the exemption. PEPANZ has also submitted in support of this exemption to the Finance and Expenditure Committee in their consideration of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 20 Inland Revenue, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Treasury and the Ministry for the Environment have been consulted and support the proposed 5-year extension. Financial Implications 21 This proposal would give rise to $16 million in tax revenue over the current forecast period. Based on the information available on rig activity, extending the exemption could reduce costs to the New Zealand purchasers of rig services of approximately $14 million per year with flow-on effects for the tax base. The flow on effects of reduced tax revenue from expiry of the exemption have already been included in the baseline tax forecasts. The table below shows the forecast revenue gains of instead extending the exemption. The final year of revenue impact is 2023/24, when the extended exemption expires. $m - increase/(decrease) Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue - 4.000 4.000 4.000 4.000 Vote Revenue 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Minister of Revenue Outyears 22 The revenue gain from this proposal can be accounted for on the tax policy scorecard. The implementation of this policy would increase the cumulate scorecard balance to $52 million 23 Officials’ best judgement is that if the exemption is not extended, rig and seismic vessel operators are likely to resume churning. In this case, no extra revenue would be collected from oil rig and seismic vessel operators while firms purchasing their services are expected to pay less tax. This is because the cost of these services (deductible to the New Zealand purchaser) could increase as a result of rigs and seismic vessels being churned. This expectation is already included in the baseline forecasts. Human Rights 24 The proposal is consistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:14 IN CONFIDENCE 4 Legislative Implications 25 Extending the exemption before the expiry of the current exemption on 31 December 2019 will require an amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. The only suitable bill is the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill which has recently been reported back by the Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC). 26 The FEC has accepted the PEPANZ submission to include an extension of the exemption in the Bill. Removing the oil rig exemption from the Bill after the second reading would require Cabinet and Parliamentary support for a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) at the Committee of the whole House stage. This would have the effect of delaying the progress of the Bill. Regulatory Impact Analysis 27 A Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) is attached. 28 The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Extending tax exemption for non-resident oil rig and seismic vessel operators RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. Publicity 29 The Minister of Revenue has issued a press release announcing that an extension has been included in the reported back version of the Bill, in response to submissions to the FEC. Inland Revenue will publish details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin once the tax bill containing the amendments is enacted. Proactive Release 30 We propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, together with the associated RIA. Recommendations The Minister of Energy and Resources and the Minster of Revenue recommend that the Committee: 1 Notethat there is an existing temporary income tax exemption for the income of non- resident offshore rig and seismic vessel operators that is due to expire on 31 December 2019. 2 Noteearly signalling of intentions is important for industry certainty and investment decisions. 3 Notethat maintaining the exemption would be consistent with the approach to maintaining existing settings taken in the offshore oil and gas exploration announcement made on 12 April 2018. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:14 IN CONFIDENCE 5 4 Notethat the Finance and Expenditure Committee has accepted that an exemption be included in the revision tracked version of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 5 Agreeto the exemption for the income of non-resident offshore rig and seismic vessel operators being extended until 31 December 2024. 6 Notethat agreeing to recommendation 5 above will have an estimated revenue gain of $16 million over the forecast period, which can be accounted for on the tax policy scorecard: $m - increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue -4.000 4.000 4.000 4.000 7 Notethe last year of revenue impact is 2023/24, when the exemption expires. 8 Notethat this Cabinet paper, the associated Cabinet minute, and Regulatory Impact Assessment will be proactively released on Inland Revenue’s website.

Why is Government intervention required? There is currently an exemption from New Zealand income tax for non-resident-owned oil rigs and seismic vessel operators. The aim of this exemption is to remove a tax distortion that incentivises operators to churn 1 rigs and vessels, thereby slowing resource development, increasing operators’ costs, and reducing tax and royalty revenue. This exemption was first introduced in 2004 for five years and was subsequently extended in 2009 and again in 2014. The most recent extension is due to expire on 31 December 2019. This RIA considers whether the exemption should be further extended. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? This exemption was introduced to discourage oil rigs and seismic vessels from leaving New Zealand before 183 days to avoid being treated as a New Zealand tax resident under a double tax agreement. Extending this exemption would prevent this churning reoccurring. Sec tio n B: Su mma r y Imp a c ts : Be ne fits a n d c o s ts Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The main beneficiaries are petroleum prospectors, explorers and miners with New Zealand petroleum permits, and the Crown. These miners would incur lower costs and undertake greater exploration which would have flow on benefits to the New Zealand economy and tax and royalty revenue. 1 Having one rig leave the country and another enter to complete the work. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 2. Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Where do the costs fall? Although the exemption will theoretically make the non-resident rig and seismic vessel operators exempt from tax, in practice they were not paying New Zealand income tax anyway as they were leaving New Zealand before 183 days. Extending the exemption has no fiscal cost. If the exemption is left to expire, a reduction in tax revenue forecasts would arise as a result of increased tax deductions from churning. Forecast baselines include an assumption that the exemption would be renewed. Absent that renewal, we anticipate a behavioural change toward churn of rigs and consequential reduction in tax revenue forecasts arising from the expense of that churn. Officials do not anticipate that the rigs would start paying tax if the exemption is not extended. There are also small one- off costs for regulators of extending the exemption. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? The proposal risks leading to increased domestic carbon emissions; however, the impact is expected to be minor, as carbon emissions from New Zealand’s oil and gas production are very small. Given New Zealand’s high environmental standards, the environmental footprint from developing oil, gas and mineral resources in New Zealand is likely to be less than many other countries we would otherwise source them from. As nearly all New Zealand oil is exported, increased New Zealand production will have no effect on the Government’s international commitments. The proposal carries some other environmental risks, but these are low due to New Zealand’s tight regulation and standards. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The proposal is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Sec tio n C: Ev id e nc e c er ta in ty a n d q u ality a ss u ra n ce Agency rating of evidence certainty? There is a degree of uncertainty on the future level of petroleum exploration as this is determined by a number of factors, including the future oil price and other discoveries. However, historical comparison before and after the introduction of the exemption in 2004 provides a high degree of certainty that the policy achieves its desired goal of eliminating tax-driven rig and seismic vessel churning. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Extending tax exemption for non-resident oil rig and seismic vessel operators RIA prepared by Inland Revenue and MBIE and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The reviewer’s comments on earlier versions of the Regulatory Impact Assessment have been incorporated into the final version. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 4 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption for non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue and MBIE are solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis A constraint affecting the consideration of the options is that of time – the existing tax exemption expires at the end of 2019. Accordingly, any extension of the exemption should be enacted before the end of 2019. A limitation concerning the analysis is that there is some degree of uncertainty regarding the behaviour of rig operators if the exemption were to be removed. This affects our ability to reliably estimate the fiscal impacts of removing the exemption. However, MBIE’s best judgement (based on the rig operators’ behaviour before the introduction of the exemption) is that if the exemption was removed, rig operators are likely to modify their behaviour and begin churning again.

Seismic vessels are used to gather data on potential oil and gas finds, and rigs are used to drill for oil and gas, in the exploration and development stages of petroleum mining. These are very specialist and expensive pieces of equipment that are owned by businesses that specialise in providing these services to petroleum miners who have permits for a specific area. These rigs and vessels do not generally work offshore in winter weather for health and safety reasons. While there is a worldwide industry in rigs and seismic vessels, no New Zealand companies own these assets, so any company seeking to explore natural resources in New Zealand waters needs to use a rig or seismic vessel provided by a non-resident owner. Offshore rigs and seismic vessels owned by non-residents are covered by an income tax exemption that is due to expire on 31 December 2019. Wells generally take between 30 and 90 days to drill and there is significant cost in bringing a rig or vessel to and from New Zealand. Because of this, operators often align their plans in order to conduct their work using the same rig or vessel in the same summer period. There is usually a programme of work that forms the core activities of the rig or vessel, and then there may be opportunistic wells or surveys added because the rig or vessel is already coming. These opportunistic wells or surveys are at particular risk from the expiry of the existing exemption as completing these could result in the rig or vessel being in New Zealand long enough to become a New Zealand tax resident and therefore taxable on income derived from exploration and development activities in New Zealand waters, including from already completed contracts for core activities. In the absence of an exemption these operators leave New Zealand before this time to prevent a New Zealand income tax liability arising. Between 2009 and 2017, there have been nine non-resident offshore drilling rigs operating in New Zealand. The average length of stay of these rigs has been 315 days. By contrast, between 2000 and 2005 (before the exemption was introduced), no rigs stayed in New Zealand waters beyond six months. At this early stage, we anticipate at least one rig to be operating within New Zealand waters in 2019/20. Twelve seismic vessels have operated in New Zealand since 2009, with an average duration of 108 days, and with one high-value survey extending through to 200 days. Before 2005, the average length of stay was around four months. Maintaining the exemption removes a barrier for lengthier stays (which have been fewer but are typically more lucrative). There have been 73 offshore wells drilled since 1 January 2009. Twenty of these wells have been exploratory in nature, with some hosting sub-commercial discoveries. All of these efforts, successful or not, improve our knowledge of the Crown mineral estate, which is critical to making economic discoveries. A substantial discovery has the potential to significantly benefit the economy and the Government’s fiscal position by way of direct economic benefits, royalties, increased tax revenue, and other indirect benefits (e.g. supporting goods and services and consumption). It is likely that a number of wells would not have been drilled without the tax exemption, as 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 6 IN CONFIDENCE the application of income tax would likely have created too large a barrier (due to the high cost of mobilisation and demobilisation and the associated delays caused) for discretionary wells. Mobilisation and demobilisation costs can exceed $750,000 per day and, depending on where the rig comes from, the transition time and associated cost can be significant and in the order of $14 million. Extending the exemption is likely to ensure oil and gas prospecting, exploration and production is not impeded compared with letting the exemption expire. This increases the chance of successful discoveries and consequentially oil and gas production, which increases economic development activity, and tax and royalty revenue. Increased oil and gas production could result in an increase in carbon emissions. However, given New Zealand’s high environmental standards, the environmental footprint from developing oil, gas and mineral resources in New Zealand is likely to be less than many other countries we would otherwise source them from. Therefore, from a global emissions perspective, developing some of these resources in New Zealand could provide better environmental outcomes. In the context of climate change, gas is internationally recognised as a transition fuel. In particular, natural gas emits 50 to 60 percent less carbon dioxide than coal when used to generate electricity. Thus, gas could play a role in New Zealand meeting its climate commitments in the short-term. Furthermore, New Zealand’s gas reserves are only sufficient to cover a decade of annual gas demand at current demand levels. To prevent the situation of gas reserve depletion interrupting our energy supply, new sources of gas would need to be found within the next few years. This could be by way of new gas finds, or extension of existing fields, but either of these would involve some lead-time to production. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? New Zealand generally taxes non-residents on income that has a source in New Zealand. However, our double tax agreements (DTAs) provide that non-residents are only taxable on their New Zealand-sourced business profits if they have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand. Many of our DTAs (such as the New Zealand/United States DTA) have a specific rule providing that a non-resident enterprise involved in exploring for natural resources only has a permanent establishment in New Zealand if they are present for a particular period of time, often 183 days in a year. Once a non-resident has a permanent establishment in New Zealand, they are taxed on all their New Zealand business profits starting from their first day in New Zealand. While this 183 day rule does not apply outside of DTAs, in practice, no rigs or seismic vessels come from non-DTA countries. Ordinarily, a broad-base, low-rate framework applies to the tax system. A consistent application of this framework will normally minimise any distortions caused by tax rules. However, with seismic vessels and rigs used for exploration and development work, the normal tax rules do not provide the right outcome. The exemption was introduced to address an issue caused by this DTA provision – rigs and seismic vessels used in petroleum exploration and development were leaving New Zealand waters before the 183 day threshold was reached to avoid being subject to New Zealand tax. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 7 IN CONFIDENCE This meant that rigs and vessels would leave before 183 days and a different rig or vessel was mobilised to complete the exploration programme, if it was completed. This increased the cost for companies engaged in exploration and delayed exploration drilling and any subsequent discovery of oil or gas. It also meant that there was no income tax collected from owners of rigs and seismic vessels. Because of the limited supply of offshore drilling rigs, it could also result in exploration activity not taking place when it otherwise would. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? If the status quo is maintained (i.e. the temporary exemption is left to lapse at the end of 2019), it is likely that rigs and seismic vessels would resume leaving New Zealand waters before 183 days, so that the operators are not subject to tax. This would mean that the cost of offshore exploration and development activity would increase for New Zealand companies that engage offshore rig and seismic vessel services, as a new rig would have to be engaged to continue exploration and development work. Mobilising and demobilising such rigs has a cost of around $14 million per rig. This would have flow-on effects for tax revenue, as the cost would be deductible to the New Zealand company. The churn would also cause a delay in any potential revenue from successful exploration and development activity, which would have an impact on the present value of royalties received. However, this would be partially offset by the delay in the deductions associated with that additional exploration and development activity. The underlying cause of the problem is that the normal tax rules increase costs for business by creating an incentive for seismic vessels and rigs to “churn”, that is, move in and out of New Zealand waters within a 183-day period where income is exempt under many of our DTAs. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? It is not possible to efficiently resolve this issue by renegotiating New Zealand’s DTAs. These DTAs are part of an international framework and it is not feasible to alter this particular article, particularly given this would require renegotiation of each of the DTAs which New Zealand is currently party to and would be dependent on our treaty partners being agreeable to such a change. New Zealand is a global advocate for fossil fuel subsidy reform. While there are a range of definitions of what constitutes a subsidy, the most widely internationally accepted definition is that adopted by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) under the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures. New Zealand has no fossil fuel subsidies as this term is defined by the WTO. The non-resident rig and seismic vessel income tax exemption has been in place since 2004 and is not considered a subsidy. This position was also confirmed in a 2015 peer review of fossil fuel subsidies by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Targeted consultation has been undertaken with the oil and gas industry representative body, the Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand (PEPANZ), which supports making the exemption permanent. The Treasury and the Ministry for the Environment support extending the exemption for a further five years to balance the need for business certainty while leaving scope for future changes at a time when tax and environmental policy is evolving. Sec tio n 3 : O p tio n s id e n tific a tio n 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? Three options have been considered: • Option 1 – Status quo: Do not extend the exemption. The current exemption will expire on 31 December 2019. After this date non-resident oil rig and seismic vessel operators will be subject to New Zealand income tax from the day they arrive if they are present in New Zealand for at least 183 days. • Option 2 – Temporary exemption: Extend the current exemption for a further five years. • Option 3 – Permanent exemption: Remove the expiry date from the current exemption so it applies permanently. Both options 2 and 3 address the problem by effectively removing the 183 day test so that non-resident operators do not face an incentive to churn rigs and vessels by leaving New Zealand prior to 183 days. These options are mutually exclusive and are the same options considered when the exemption has previously been due to expire in 2009 and 2014. No non-regulatory options are possible as the liability for income tax is determined through legislation. Option 2 and option 3 are both unique to New Zealand. Officials are not aware of any other country having a similar exemption due to a combination of factors, such as: not having an offshore petroleum industry; having a sufficiently large market to have domestic owned rig and seismic vessel operators; being closer to other countries, so that mobilisation costs are much lower; and having different wording in their applicable DTAs, so that the 183 day threshold does not apply. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The options have been assessed against the following criteria: 1. Economic efficiency and neutrality – The tax rules should generate funding for Government expenditure rather than influence whether a rig or seismic vessel remains in New Zealand. The use of tax instruments to implement non-tax outcomes should be approached with caution. The level of oil and gas exploration and development activity should be determined by what is economically efficient in conjunction with wider Government policies, and not by unintended consequences of tax rules. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 9 IN CONFIDENCE 2. Certainty of tax treatment – The tax rules should provide certainty of tax treatment. 3. Administration costs – Administration costs should be minimised as far as possible. In addition to costs arising to government agencies under the option, this includes policy and law-making costs. 4. Compliance costs – Compliance costs should be minimised as far as possible. Criterion one is the most important as tax should not be influencing petroleum miners’ decisions to act in ways that are economically inefficient, and care should be taken before using tax rules to implement non-tax policies, where other more direct, and transparent measures may be available. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? Renegotiating New Zealand’s DTAs to increase or reduce the number of days an operator can be in New Zealand without becoming a tax resident was not within scope. This would require individual renegotiation with each of New Zealand’s treaty partners and would be inconsistent with international norms. This could not be achieved before expiry of the current exemption if it could be achieved at all, therefore this option is considered impractical. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident offshore oil rig and seismic vessel operat ors | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4 : Imp ac t An a ly s is Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? Status Quo – Letting exemption expire Option 2 – Temporary exemption Option 3 – Permanent exemption Efficiency/neutrality 0 ++ An exemption will prevent tax rules incentivising operators to leave New Zealand prior to 183 days. The level of exploration and development will be determined by the market and specific Government policies rather than an unintended consequence of tax rules. Petroleum miners able to coordinate rigs and seismic vessels and incur lower planning costs, thus improving efficiency. ++ As with the temporary exemption. Certainty 0 + Petroleum miners and operators will have certainty of tax treatment for a 5-year planning horizon. ++ As with the temporary exemption, with the benefit of additional certainty for petroleum miners and operators planning beyond the expiry of a temporary exemption. Compliance costs 0 + No impact on tax compliance costs (as no tax obligation on operators with or without exemption) but reduction in costs of complying with other Government regulation for operators and petroleum miners. ++ As with the temporary exemption, with the benefit of less compliance costs for exploration and development near to expiry of a temporary exemption. Administration costs 0 + Consistent with current (pre-December 2019) treatment, so less update needed to internal and external knowledge bases and other guides. ++ As with the temporary exemption, as well as removing need for further update when the temporary exemption expired, and only one-off policy and law-making costs. Overall assessment 0 ++ This option is significantly better than the status quo, as tax will not be an impediment to operators acting in an efficient manner. This option will not impose any additional costs on government or taxpayers. However, it is not the preferred option as it creates less certainty for taxpayers and imposes costs on officials, Parliament and stakeholders in reconsidering the exemption each time it expires. ++ This is the preferred option. It has all the benefits of option 2 with the additional benefits of providing greater certainty for stakeholders and fewer administration costs as a result of not needing to periodically renew the exemption. Key: ++ Much better than doing nothing/the status quo - Worse than doing nothing/the status quo + Better than doing nothing/the status quo - - Much worse than doing nothing/the status quo 0 About the same as doing nothing/the status quo 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident of fshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 5 : Co n clu s io n s 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Having an exemption beyond 31 December 2019 is significantly better than letting the exemption lapse and both Inland Revenue and MBIE recommend that this exemption is permanent rather than for a further five year period. As these rigs are planned well in advance, the additional certainty of a permanent exemption is supported by the petroleum industry. An exemption removes a tax distortion that results in economically inefficient outcomes, and imposes no ongoing revenue cost to the Government, while negative environmental impacts are expected to be low. Removing the churn of oil rigs and seismic vessels has a number of benefits, including: • opportunistic exploration not being hindered by the lack of availability of rigs and vessels; • additional exploration increasing petroleum miners’ and the Government’s knowledge of the mineral estate; • reduced costs of petroleum exploration and development resulting in higher revenue from taxes and royalties; • increased domestic emissions from more production (but noting some reduction in carbon emissions as a result of fewer rigs and vessels travelling to and from New Zealand); and • rigs and vessels may stay in New Zealand beyond 183 days for repairs and maintenance which would increase output of supporting industries. There is a high degree of confidence in the assumptions and evidence used in this RIA as this exemption is already in place and data before and after its introduction can be compared. Making the exemption permanent will significantly reduce the policy and parliamentary resources required to be dedicated to this issue. As the exemption has been in place since 2004, fiscal forecasts include the ongoing impact of this exemption. If the exemption is not extended increased churn costs would result in forecast tax revenue needing to be reduced by approximately $4m per year. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident of fshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators | 12 IN CONFIDENCE 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach 2 $14 million cost / 0.06 (discount rate applied in RIA) = $233.33m rounded to $233 million. 3 $4 million tax cost / 0.06 (discount rate applied in RIA) = $66.67 million rounded to $67 million.

The preferred approach is likely to increase oil and gas exploration and development (or not decrease it) compared with the status quo. This increases the chance of successful discoveries and consequentially increased oil and gas production, which increases economic development activity, tax revenue and royalties. Increased oil and gas production risks increasing carbon emissions. However, nearly all of New Zealand oil production is exported, so this increased production would have no effect on the Government’s international commitments. Officials consider the impact of increased carbon emissions would be minor as the production in New Zealand of oil and gas has very little impact on consumption of oil and gas and, relative to international output, New Zealand production is so small that increases in production will not affect the world price. Other environmental risks are also low due to New Zealand’s tight regulation and standards which have seen over 200 offshore wells drilled since the 1960s without a significant incident. As New Zealand is a net importer of oil, any increase in domestic production is likely to reduce the balance of payments deficit. 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? The preferred option is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’.

The preferred option would involve amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 to remove the 31 December 2009 expiry date. This would continue the operation of the exemption, broadly as it has applied since 2004. As with other legislative changes this would be signalled in a Tax Information Bulletin shortly after the enactment of the bill containing the proposals as well as other documents published throughout the parliamentary process. Owing to the high mobilisation costs, the schedules for rigs and seismic vessels are frequently planned well in advance of the rig or vessel arriving in New Zealand. Thus, the industry would welcome timely advice of a Cabinet decision on the exemption. Cabinet approval of the preferred option would allow the necessary legislative changes to be included in the upcoming tax omnibus bill which is expected to be enacted in 2019. A press release is intended to be released after the Cabinet decision. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? There are no risks with implementing a temporary or permanent exemption as this would be effectively continuing the law as it has applied since 2004. If there are delays in announcing an extension of the exemption and inclusion in a bill, or if the Government decides not to extend the exemption, this risks creating uncertainty in the market which could result in reduced operation of non-resident rigs and seismic vessels in New Zealand. If the preferred option is supported by Cabinet but not included in the upcoming bill there may not be a suitable tax bill enacted before the end of 2019 that could include this amendment. This would require the amendment to either be included as a Supplementary Order Paper to another bill – which would not allow the same ability for public consultation – or for the amendment to be enacted retrospectively after the end of 2019 – which provides less certainty for the petroleum industry and is less desirable than prospective legislation. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 Impact Statement: Extending tax exemption f or non-resident of fshore oil rig and seismic vessel operators | 15 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lu a tio n a n d rev ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? MBIE monitors the number and duration of rigs and seismic vessels operating in New Zealand. Comparison of behaviour prior to and after the 2004 introduction of the exemption suggests that the exemption is successful in removing the incentive to leave New Zealand prior to 183 days. As the exemption is in place now, if extended we do not expect any change in behaviour. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? MBIE will continue to monitor the petroleum mining sector more generally. As the exemption has been working as intended since 2004, if the exemption is permanently extended it is not anticipated that further review will be necessary which will reduce administration costs compared with a temporary exemption, and reduce compliance costs compared with letting the exemption expire. Inland Revenue and MBIE have ongoing interaction with the petroleum mining sector which will provide that sector with the ability to raise concerns in the unlikely event they arise. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:14:21 I N C O N F I D E N C E DEV-19-MIN-0151 Cabinet Economic Development Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.
