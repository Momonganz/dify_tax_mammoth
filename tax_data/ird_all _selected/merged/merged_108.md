The fringe benefit tax (FBT) review was undertaken as part of Inland Revenue’s regulatory stewardship role. FBT was chosen for review because it has not been fully reviewed since the reforms nearly 20 years ago, and because over time, and increasingly more recently, stakeholders have raised problems with its design and operation. 2. The review has been approached primarily as a diagnostic exercise investigating three questions:  Does the design of FBT meet the policy intent?  What is the employer and business experience of complying with FBT?  How does Inland Revenue administer FBT? 3. In addition, the review team has explored whether FBT as currently constructed is fit for the future. This has extended the discussion of the robustness of FBT to take workforce trends into account – for example, working from home. 4. The purpose of this report is to convey the findings of that review and high-level recommendations for next steps. Officials’ findings and recommendations 5. FBT continues to perform its primary task of ensuring that remuneration from employment is taxed whether it is paid in cash or provided by way of a non-cash benefit. FBT’s role is therefore to support the tax system as a whole. 6. However, it is not clear that FBT is a tax that functions well. Consistently, views expressed to the review team were that FBT is complex and that it imposes a high administrative and compliance burden relative to the tax at stake. Although FBT was designed to tax employment-related benefits-in-kind, many interview participants felt that any intuitive connection with remuneration had been lost. 7. We also heard concern from submitters that they believe FBT is not complied with by all businesses nor enforced by Inland Revenue. This is seen as unfair by those who shoulder the compliance burden. Inland Revenue is unable to comment on the amount of non- compliance with the FBT rules using existing data, although the use of START will enable a more timely and targeted compliance approach. A regulatory risk is that if the view that non-compliance with the FBT rules is risk-free becomes entrenched, this perception Page 6 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review could undermine the integrity of the tax system as a whole. This risk should be addressed. 8. The review team notes that if change to current settings is considered desirable, the Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee (the Committee) could consider one or both of the following actions:  Commissioning a policy project to act on the findings of the review. The scope of any future project is scalable depending on resources, priorities and appetite. − At the upper end, the project could include enquiry into fundamental reform, for example, moving benefits into the PAYE system. We note that a move to PAYE was not generally supported by interview participants. Alternatively, the project could look at re-establishing connection to the remuneration of employees, perhaps by changing the structure of FBT to target specific benefits. − If a smaller scale or remedial project is sought, the project could focus on discrete matters, such as motor vehicles, modernising the tax treatment of benefits (particularly in light of the growth in flexible and agile working practices), or updating thresholds and reducing compliance costs.  Requiring operations to take steps to address the concerns raised regarding compliance and enforcement. This may include: − improving lnland Revenue’s understanding of current compliance and the size of the FBT tax gap, whether through enhanced data requirements or other means of analysis, − ensuring more regular communications with employers and businesses about FBT, − compliance campaigns or other enforcement action. 9. Our recommended approach would be to commission a policy project at the upper end of the spectrum with the aim of re-establishing the remuneration basis of the tax, modernising FBT and reducing compliance costs. This policy project would involve full consultation per the generic tax policy process. The rules should then be the subject of a comprehensive communications campaign and enhanced data capture so that failings can be more clearly identified. Finally, non-compliance should be addressed. However, if the immediate risk posed by non-compliance is central to the Committee’s concerns, greater focus on enforcement of existing rules is a valid option. 10. We also recommend any actions taken in response to the review are monitored after delivery of this report. Page 7 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Background 11. The purpose of a regulatory stewardship review is to monitor the ‘health of the system’ to ensure it is functioning as intended and, if not, to identify and prioritise significant issues. The approach to the FBT review is comprehensive – that is, it includes operational matters (administration, communication and enforcement) and business’s experience of compliance with FBT, as well as the policy and legislative considerations. 12. The FBT regime was last reviewed in the 2003 Discussion Document Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits. 1 An FBT scan was undertaken in 2014. Both the media reporting on FBT 2 and views expressed to officials 3 indicate that FBT is seen as a problematic tax. These factors were significant in selecting FBT for review. 13. This regulatory stewardship review has been approached primarily as a diagnostic review. Three basic questions lie at its heart:  Does the design of FBT meet the policy intent?  What is the employer and business experience of complying with FBT?  How does Inland Revenue administer FBT? A secondary consideration in the review has been to assess whether the current design of FBT is fit to meet future challenges in the medium term (defined for this purpose as the next five to ten years) or if changes may be required to ensure that it remains fit for purpose. 14. The review approached these questions by undertaking quantitative analysis (where data is available) and obtaining qualitative data via a series of interviews conducted both within and outside Inland Revenue. The interviews were undertaken on a confidential basis and aggregated to form the qualitative factors presented in this report. Appendix 1 contains a list of interview participants and an outline of our approach to the review. 15. Many participants in the interview process expressed an interest in the findings of the report. 1 Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits (ird.govt.nz) (December 2003) 2 See, for example, Government considered $36 million tax break for company cars | Stuff.co.nz; Fringe benefit tax -- it's not an optional thing | Stuff.co.nz; Govt cracking down on ute owners dodging fringe benefit tax – NZ Autocar 3 Fringe Benefit Tax in New Zealand, Customer Insight and Evaluation, Inland Revenue, (March 2021), p 4, 5; Environmental Scan: Fringe Benefit Taxation Rules and Policy Changes, Intelligence and Insights, Inland Revenue, IR/IN/210630, p 3, 4 Page 8 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Current law 16. FBT is charged on non-cash benefits provided by the employer to the employee in connection with the employment. The main benefits captured by New Zealand’s FBT regime are private use of motor vehicles; subsidised transport; low-interest loans; employer contributions to employee funds, insurance policies and superannuation schemes; and unclassified benefits (free, subsidised or discounted goods and services). The charge to tax is then subject to exclusions and limitations, such as a carve out for business tools. 17. FBT is paid by the employer and is excluded income for the employee. However, in limited circumstances fringe benefits may be taken into account for Working for Families purposes. Fringe benefits are also taken into account for student loans purposes, but they are not considered for child support purposes. The tax rate at which it is paid varies depending on the option for reporting and payment chosen – for example, at a single flat rate, or at the appropriate marginal rate for each employee (full attribution). FBT is paid quarterly; however, small businesses may pay annually or, if the employer is a close company, they may pay on an income year basis. 18. In some circumstances, an employer may bypass FBT and account for benefits in other ways – for example, by adjusting a shareholder’s account, treating a benefit as a dividend or, if the employer is a close company that provides only one or two motor vehicles, by a private use adjustment to a person’s motor vehicle expenditure. 19. Charities that provide benefits to employees are exempt from FBT where the employee has a role in carrying out the organisation’s charitable purposes. 20. Further details of the current FBT rules are provided in appendix 2. Other jurisdictions 21. The taxation of non-cash benefits derived from an employment relationship is a feature of many tax systems. Design details and administrative practices vary from country to country. However, it is possible to observe that in many other countries the value of the non-cash benefit is, in principle, included in the employee’s taxable income, and the employee pays the tax due. 22. The Australian FBT system is similar to New Zealand’s in that the tax due for a benefit is paid and borne by the employer. However, two key differences are that, in Australia:  fringe benefits are reported in the employee’s annual payment summary or income statement to enable their value to be taken into account for specific purposes (such Page 9 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review as determining eligibility for certain social security benefits and tax concessions), 4 and  exemptions and concessions are a notable feature of their FBT regime. 5 Policy intent and framework 23. The underlying intent of FBT was to address the inequity that resulted from an increasing amount of remuneration being provided in, what was then, un-taxed, non-cash benefits. 6 FBT widened the tax base and combated the effect of tax planning in designing remuneration packages. These features mitigated tax base erosion. 7 The decision to place the liability to pay the tax on the employer was based on an assessment that employer liability entailed a lower compliance cost. 8 Conclusions of the Discussion Document 24. The Discussion Document Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits 9 operated as a review of FBT. Ultimately, the review affirmed the objectives of FBT and resulted in several amendments being made, primarily to the rules concerning motor vehicles. 10 In particular, we note that the Discussion Document did not see merit in moving the taxation of benefits into PAYE. Neutrality of FBT 25. The discussion of the policy framework in Chapter 2 of the Discussion Document focuses on the tax neutral treatment of cash and non-cash remuneration. 11 FBT is neutral in that it ensures that remuneration is subject to equivalent tax whether it is paid in cash or in kind. FBT applies a grossed-up rate to achieve equivalent taxation, as it recognises that the non-cash remuneration is delivered at a gross value. Like PAYE, FBT is deductible for the employer. 4 Reportable fringe benefits - facts for employees | Australian Taxation Office (ato.gov.au) 5 See, for example: Reducing your FBT liability | Australian Taxation Office (ato.gov.au) 6 It was not possible to access the original reports due to the closure of the Asteron Centre. Secondary sources, quoted in this document, have been used instead to illustrate the reasons for enacting FBT. These sources may not perfectly reflect the policymakers’ considerations at the time. 7 Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform (1982) paras 6.182 – 6.188. 8 Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 18, No 5, (June 2006), pp 76-86. 9 Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits (ird.govt.nz) (December 2003) 10 Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 18, No 5, (June 2006), p 76. 11 Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits (ird.govt.nz) (December 2003) Page 10 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Findings of this review Does the design of FBT meet the policy intent? 26. By ensuring that non-cash benefits are taxed, FBT ensures the tax system does not favour cash or non-cash remuneration and to that extent the treatment of the remuneration can be said to be equal. Further, there is no serious disagreement that the taxation of non-cash benefits is a necessary feature of the tax system. 27. FBT continues to maintain a broad base for the tax system and combats the effects of tax planning. A view expressed by some in the private sector is that, unlike Australia where the tax implication of remuneration packages can be a main consideration for employers and employees, there is no aggressive marketing of tax efficient remuneration packages in New Zealand. 12 In addition, whether by design or not, there is a general view that New Zealand employers prefer to pay employees in cash, rather than provide benefits. 28. As it is clear that the original objectives have been met, and that FBT does influence how employees are remunerated, it is possible to say that FBT continues to perform its role of buttressing the PAYE system. 29. Employees and employers may prefer to retain FBT and not move the taxation of benefits into the PAYE system. As a tax paid by the employer, FBT has the advantage of not increasing costs borne by business via the PAYE system, such as KiwiSaver or ACC employer liabilities. For individuals, unless the benefit is grossed up, including non-cash benefits in PAYE would lead to an increased tax liability that would have to be paid from the same cash income. 30. In connection with the above concern that inclusion in PAYE will drive up business costs, we note that FBT is not wholly consistent in capturing non-cash remuneration. Employer- provided accommodation is captured in the PAYE system. 31. We also note that Working for Families, student loans and child support were introduced after FBT and that non-cash benefits are only included in those to a limited extent, and not at all in the case of child support. Given a person’s taxable income can be reduced through employer-provided benefits, it is important to understand the extent and the impacts of employer-provided benefits on these areas. 12 Australian concessional treatment of some non-cash benefits may account, at least in part, for this observation. See for example: Reducing your FBT liability | Australian Taxation Office (ato.gov.au) Page 11 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review 32. Neither of the above observations are inconsistent with the finding that FBT meets the original policy intent, but both demonstrate that the design of FBT is not necessarily consistent with the treatment of other forms of income in the tax and transfers system. How well does the administration of FBT support its objectives? 33. The effectiveness of FBT is hard to observe directly. Its main role is to buttress the PAYE system, not to collect tax revenue in and of itself. As such, FBT could work well and not collect any revenue, for example, if only cash remuneration was paid. However, it seems likely that if FBT did not exist, non-cash benefits would be preferred based on their tax efficiency, with the result that the tax base would be weakened and revenue leakage would occur. 34. It should be noted at the outset that there was a high level of agreement between Inland Revenue and external participants about FBT’s areas of strength and weakness across all areas of the stewardship review. The below discussion is based on the data available and the views expressed in interviews. Policy, design and legislation 35. FBT is generally seen as complex: being both difficult to understand and hard to comply with. This was the most frequently discussed point and was raised by most external participants interviewed. Based on the interviews conducted, it appears that FBT’s link to remuneration is only loosely understood – some interview participants indicated that employers and business see it only as a tax burden and a cost. Others described it as “a forgotten tax”, or as a tax that was difficult to discuss with employers and businesses. 36. There are two aspects to the design of FBT: the rules that give rise to the tax liability, 13 and the rules that provide for the administration of that tax. 14 Interestingly, FBT was seen as complex both within and outside Inland Revenue, and concerns were expressed that even specialists found it a difficult tax to apply. 37. In conformity with general New Zealand tax policy, FBT has a broad base. However, the broad base of FBT seems to drive complexity and compliance costs. Some interview participants indicated that they felt the design of FBT leads to over-reach, particularly when considering low-value items, such as funeral flowers, or when seeking to tax on the availability of the benefit, rather than its use or value to the employee. In contrast, 13 Sections CX 2 – CX 38 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 14 Subpart RD of the Income Tax Act 2007 and relevant provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994. Page 12 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review GST is generally believed to have benefited from a broad base as this has simplified compliance and reduced compliance costs. 38. The FBT liability rules interact with other taxes, such as PAYE and entertainment tax, giving rise to a number of boundary issues. Other issues that commonly arise include determining whether items are exempt, the valuation of benefits and the application of thresholds and de minimis amounts. These boundaries make it easy to be wrong, even where the taxpayer is trying to get it right. 39. The liability rules have been described as unintuitive and easily misunderstood. They include items that might not be viewed as a benefit or remuneration by the employee or the employer. Unclassified benefits, which is a wide definition, is particularly likely to capture non-remunerative items, such as flowers. Interview participants indicated that employers and managers may be surprised when they realise they have incurred an FBT liability. 40. Motor vehicles were identified as the most common area in which misconceptions arise. To be applied, the rules require further interpretation. Two interpretation statements have been issued since 2002. 15 IS 17/07 Fringe Benefit Tax – Motor Vehicles, which seeks to clarify the current law, runs to 57 pages. This may indicate that the underlying law is complex and in need of review. 41. By comparison, the administrative rules were less commented upon. Amongst other things, these rules provide for the options to calculate, report and pay FBT or to opt out of the FBT system. Generally, flexibility is welcome – however, interview participants noted that this flexibility adds to the complexity of the rules. 42. Two specific design areas were reviewed, as both raise special considerations in addition to those generally made about FBT. These are:  The charities and not-for-profit sector, which has an exemption from FBT unless the employment consists of business activities outside its charitable purposes. 16 Views were expressed that the exemption is inefficient and incoherent: the definitions that apply to charities and not-for-profits are unclear and inconsistent. Notably, in this context, others see a role for exemptions where they relate to social and environmental wellbeing.  In Te Ao Māori, points of cultural difference were raised. In particular, it is not always clear when an individual is acting as an employee rather than as a member of the community, for example, where a work-related vehicle is used to transport elders to a marae for meetings. 15 IS 17/07 Fringe benefit tax – motor vehicles and IS3448 - Travel by motor vehicle between home and work - deductibility of expenditure and FBT implications. 16 See section CX 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Page 13 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Business compliance 43. Although FBT’s design was intended to keep compliance costs low, many report that the cost of compliance is out of proportion to the amount of tax at stake. Some interview participants noted that, in their view, FBT compares unfavourably with the GST and PAYE regimes. 44. Most external interview participants noted that key areas giving rise to compliance costs were tracking of available days for motor vehicles and tracking of unclassified benefits. This work is necessary to determine the extent of applicable exemptions from FBT. 45. There is an inherent tension in the design of a policy that includes options and exemptions. Options and exemptions enable flexibility and are intended to reduce tax costs. However, access to those features of the tax imposes compliance costs, as the person who wishes to use them must ensure they fall within the legislative criteria. 46. It was observed that although Inland Revenue collects only a few key data points, 17 this does not reflect the reality of the work necessary to comply with FBT. That work involves identification of benefits, collation and manipulation of data, and interpretation of the rules. In addition, depending on the calculation method, allocation of benefits to employees may be required to ensure taxation at the most appropriate rate for each employee. As a result, technological solutions cannot resolve all the compliance issues with FBT. 47. Other participants noted that, in terms of its timing, FBT compliance is not well integrated with other tax systems, such as GST or PAYE. The lack of co-ordinated deadlines for filing and payment across tax types is seen as adding another compliance burden. 48. Finally, while Inland Revenue provides an FBT calculator, third-party software is reportedly preferred. The software solutions on the market offer a greater ability to organise data and prepare the FBT return, but they are not end-to-end solutions. The lack of co-ordination between online and paper filing, as well as the unavailability of gateway filing, also attracted unfavourable comment from some external interview participants. 49. Aside from the resource burden of FBT compliance, the other point that was brought to our attention was that compliance itself was a spectrum – from those taxpayers who sought to do everything by the book, through to those who do not try to comply at all. 17 These are the taxpayer’s name and IRD number, the total taxable value of benefits provided, the FBT rate applied by the employer and the amount of FBT calculated, the GST payable on fringe benefits provided and the total FBT and GST to be paid. Page 14 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Non-compliance was a recurring theme, touching on all aspects of the stewardship enquiry: FBT’s design, administration, education, and enforcement. 50. The underlying reason appears to be low engagement with FBT in the wider community. Anecdotally, a number of businesses and employers resent the cost of compliance and are not open to advice, whether provided by Inland Revenue staff or professional advisors. A clear message was that, due to FBT’s low status, few taxpayers were keen to incur the costs of advice to ensure fully accurate compliance with the rules. Instead ‘near enough’ is often seen to be ‘good enough’ in the FBT regime. Almost all participants were concerned that there was non-compliance with FBT. Administration – external view 51. External participants reported mixed experiences of Inland Revenue’s administration. Views on education, communication and enforcement are addressed separately below. 52. Interactions with Inland Revenue staff came from two primary sources, enquiries raised with compliance officers and other staff, and interactions in the course of making a voluntary disclosure. Some found staff to be helpful and well-informed, others that the person(s) they were dealing with did not fully grasp the complexities of FBT. Those who had poor experiences stressed the need for Inland Revenue to lift the capabilities in its administration of the tax. The need for additional basic and topical training and communication was reflected in internal interviews. Administration - internal view 53. Based on the amount of revenue raised, FBT is viewed as a low-value tax. Interview participants expressed the view that this perhaps explained a perceived lack of interest in it on the part of Inland Revenue. When viewed as supporting the PAYE system, the value of FBT’s role is more apparent. 54. A recurrent theme was the lack of data about FBT, whether in relation to type and value of benefits, use of concessions or aggregate information. This was particularly noted in internal interviews. The effect of this is that Inland Revenue is not easily able to assess the need for, and types of, intervention required to address deficiencies in FBT administration and compliance. It also means we have incomplete information when trying to understand the nature of income for tax policy purposes – for example, in designing and administering Working for Families. Data made available to us is summarised in appendix 3. Page 15 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review 55. The role of START in improving the ability to administer FBT is addressed in the section entitled “Smarter compliance risk management” below. Education and communication 56. Finding information on FBT can be daunting for taxpayers. Due to its complexity, taxpayers who do not take professional advice are particularly likely to struggle with FBT. Inland Revenue should be the first port of call for unadvised taxpayers whether they seek advice directly or from an internet search engine. These taxpayers may seek information on our websites 18 or from frontline and compliance staff. 57. Although the attempts to explain tax in ‘plain English’ are generally commended, some interview participants noted that the Fringe benefit tax guide (IR 406) does not necessarily cover specific issues or the correct treatment of benefits in enough detail (and there are no references to specific technical publications that could provide more information). If the taxpayer does not research further, they may find the treatment they have applied is incorrect. 58. Education and communication activities may also be run by the private sector. However, the professional bodies report that there is little interest in their member bases for training and other initiatives related to FBT. This may be because, outside of the recent 39% tax changes, it is not seen as topical. This is indicative of the low engagement reported for FBT. 59. Lack of awareness was a common interview theme. 19 The profile of FBT is likely to be raised by a forthcoming CCS marketing campaign that will focus on common errors. 20 Campaigns may combat the lack of interest in FBT in the wider community. However, what can be achieved through education and communication may be limited by the complexity of the tax regime. 18 These are: Inland Revenue - Te Tari Taake (ird.govt.nz); Tax Technical - Inland Revenue NZ (taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz); News and information about the Government's tax policy work programme | Tax Policy, Inland Revenue, New Zealand (taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz) 19 In this context we note that following the release of IS 17/07 Fringe benefit tax – motor vehicles, Introduction to FBT and motor vehicles was posted to YouTube, together with two other clips on FBT and motor vehicles. Views of the three clips range from 3.5K to 6.6K as at 19 January 2022. 20 CCS has prepared a marketing campaign that focuses on common errors in FBT/getting FBT right. This campaign is intended to launch in 2022 and will run for a four-week period. Particular attention will be drawn to FBT on motor vehicles. The primary audience for the campaign is businesses registered for FBT and tax agents. START information that indicates an FBT error will also be used to determine particular customers who may need to review their FBT position. Page 16 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Enforcement 60. Interview participants reported that FBT was not often raised in audits. Some had no experience of FBT enquiries being made at all. Where raised, FBT was typically brought up in conjunction with wider tax enquiries. FBT is not seen as an Inland Revenue focus for enforcement, with some participants speculating this is due to its relatively low status. 61. In addition, there is belief that FBT is not complied with—in particular, that the work- related vehicle exemption is misused or avoided. 21 Whether or not this is true, the perception of non-compliance, coupled with a lack of enforcement, poses a risk to the integrity of the tax system. 62. Data collected by Inland Revenue shows that, in the year ending 31 March 2020, employers with 501 or more employees accounted for 2% of FBT filers, but 41.4% of FBT paid. These employers account for 0.2% of PAYE filers and 39.3% of PAYE paid. 22 FBT paid drops steeply across the employee bands. 63. Currently, Inland Revenue does not collect data that helps to verify or refute the amount of non-compliance. It may be that smaller businesses make greater use of the options for accounting for fringe benefits. If so, that use fulfils the policy intent underlying that flexibility in the system. However, given the lack of data, arguments for or against compliance with the FBT regime are speculative. Is FBT fit for the future? Flexible working and changing workplace expectations 64. Since the introduction of FBT in 1985, employment practices have changed for many businesses and employees. In particular, technology has impacted on the way that many people work, particularly with their place of work. COVID-19 has accelerated these changes. Setting-up employees to work from home may require the employer to provide computer or office equipment and services, such as data charges, to support employees. 65. From an FBT perspective, the flexible working trend calls into question several rules that historically rested on the home/work boundary. For example:  the continuing fitness of the ‘on-premises’ and health and safety exclusions, 23 and 21 This belief is alluded to in media articles, for example: David Parker looks to close ute tax exemption, as Jacinda Ardern defends legitimate ute comment - NZ Herald; Is New Zealand subsidising utes? (newsroom.co.nz) 21 This belief is alluded to in media articles, for example: David Parker looks to close ute tax exemption, as Jacinda Ardern defends legitimate ute comment - NZ Herald; Is New Zealand subsidising utes? (newsroom.co.nz) 22 See appendix 3. 23 See sections CX 23 and CX 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Page 17 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review  the limitation of the business tool exemption. 24 A number of interview participants noted that practical compliance with the conditions of the work-related vehicle exemption was made more onerous by the blurring of the home/work boundary. Other participants felt that the work-related vehicle exemption required modernisation. 25 66. Participants also noted that employee expectations of their working conditions are changing, and that employers themselves are more interested in wellbeing. Benefits provided under the category of “wellbeing” include gym memberships, employee assistance programmes and health insurance. These benefits are more general than those falling within health and safety, which is more focused on harm. Digital administration of the tax and social policy system 67. There has been a significant shift towards digital services, with increasing options for online filing of tax returns as well as online payments. Digital contact channels (online, email, digital assistance) continue to increase while traditional channels (for example, in- person contacts) are decreasing. 68. There are several significant challenges to enabling greater e-administration of FBT:  The rules that underpin the FBT regime are complex and may require interpretation before application.  The work that enables FBT compliance is often manual and granular. Information must be pulled together and analysed to make an FBT return. The circumstances surrounding the provision of any benefit can determine whether the benefit is subject to FBT or PAYE, is caught under the entertainment rules, or is treated as a dividend.  Many external interview participants confirmed that generally no one business system captures all FBT information either within businesses or across the wider business community. In some cases, benefits will be accounted for in the payroll system, whereas in others, they will be accounted for in the business’s general ledger. These factors will undoubtedly create challenges for working with businesses and software developers further on the integration of accounting systems with the FBT rules. This suggests that the benefits of e-administration might not be achievable without a significant simplification of those rules. 24 See section CX 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 25 Inland Revenue data for the year ending 31 March 2020 shows that the greatest number of FBT returns is filed by businesses grouped under the ANZSIC code: Professional, Scientific and Technical Services. However, this group is only the third largest filer of PAYE returns. Page 18 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Smarter compliance risk management 69. Tax administrations are taking an increasingly proactive approach to compliance risk management, where possible seeking to intervene at earlier stages rather than after tax returns have been filed. The use of data to identify and enable interventions is key to this approach. The type and scale of intervention, and therefore the investment required, must take into account the amount of revenue at stake. 70. FBT comprised 0.6% of total tax revenue in the year ending 2020, whereas PAYE (including employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT)) comprised 37.4% of total tax revenue in the same period. 26 Additionally, the value of FBT as a proportion of PAYE and total direct income taxes has been steadily declining. 27 Figure 1 71. The decline in FBT as a proportion of total direct income tax supports the comment above that the effectiveness of FBT is not directly observable. A movement towards cash remuneration, which is subject to PAYE, and reduced collection of FBT supports the finding that FBT is acting to support the PAYE system. An alternative hypothesis would be that it could be indicative of falling compliance. 72. However, the declining importance of FBT as a revenue source relative to other tax bases, the high cost and the likelihood of low returns on compliance-related investment all combine to make decisions to increase spending on FBT compliance management difficult to sustain (if those are indeed the causes of no real growth in FBT revenue). 26 Fast Guide (IR 628) 2021 edition. 27 Inland Revenue Annual Reports 1990-2021; “Direct” taxes are individual and corporate income tax, resident withholding tax, non-resident withholding tax and employer superannuation contribution tax. Page 19 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review 73. Smarter risk management is also predicated on having data or other intelligence to identify the risks. START analytics is a platform that enables the profiling of customers by aggregate characteristics and key points so that clusters of non-compliance can be identified. START analytics is also able to work with third party data. The data sets created enable operational staff to query patterns, identify problems and design intervention strategies. 74. START analytics also supports campaign activity because it has delivery capability. Targeted communications can be sent to ‘at risk’ customer groups by, say, industry type, or by direct communications to tax agents. The combination of data and delivery technology is a smarter compliance management tool that enables “common errors” campaigns (as described in footnote 19). 75. Seeking more data from businesses is likely to increase compliance costs. It will, however, enable greater understanding of compliance and non-compliance and validate intervention strategies. Assessment of regulatory risk 76. FBT poses a risk to the tax system because the perception it is not being complied with or adequately enforced by Inland Revenue could undermine the integrity of the tax system as a whole. Aspects of this risk include a sense that some in the business community see non-compliance with the FBT rules as voluntary and concern that unchallenged non-compliance is unfair on those who comply. While Inland Revenue does have measures in place to support FBT compliance, those measures do not appear to have mitigated the perception that non-compliance is widespread at this stage. 77. To mitigate the risk of regulatory failure, our preferred approach would be to commission a comprehensive policy project, as described in the first two bullet points below, with the aim of restoring the intuitive connection to remuneration, modernising FBT and reducing compliance costs. The rules should then be the subject of a comprehensive communications campaign, as well as enhanced data capture so that failings can be more clearly identified. Once the new rules are embedded, a strategy for regular education and enforcement of FBT should be built into regular compliance activity. 78. Other policy and operations issues identified by the review are subsidiary to this risk. More detail is provided in the recommendations below. Page 20 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Recommendations 79. The review team has identified that both the design and the administration of FBT can be improved. Further detail and options for change are provided below. We also recommend that any actions adopted in response to the review are monitored after delivery of this report. Policy Legislation and Design 80. We recommend that FBT is included in a future policy work programme. This policy project would involve full consultation per the generic tax policy process. The aim of the project should be to simplify the rules where possible and reduce the compliance burden. There are three possible approaches to such a future policy project:  A full review of FBT, similar to that undertaken in 2002. The review team does not have a view on whether the taxation of non-cash benefits should be included in the PAYE system – there are good arguments for either approach. However, ways to make the link to remuneration and remunerative benefits more explicit must be considered. This is important for both tax and social policy purposes.  A lesser review of FBT, with the aim of updating legislative settings to reflect changes in working practices. This should include consideration of the settings for motor vehicles, business tools and the “on premises” exception. In addition, the review should consider the tax treatment of unclassified benefits and, in particular, whether there is a degree of over-taxation or overreach in the liability rules.  A remedial policy project, focused on updating thresholds and de minimis amounts. 81. In both the first two categories, it is desirable to involve Māori in the design of any changes. This may help address the cultural boundary issues identified. The extent of interest in FBT could be checked via the Māori Advisory Panel in the early stages of any policy project to ensure the degree of engagement is appropriate. 82. There is external interest in using the tax system to incentivise the provision of non-cash benefits supporting social and environmental wellbeing. We also note that many other tax systems include exemptions and incentives in their design. For the avoidance of doubt, the review does not recommend introducing incentives as an explicit objective. Any decision to move away from the standard framework would require a policy development process, which is outside the scope of regulatory stewardship. 83. In addition to the general point above, the sources surveyed in the review did not demonstrate a clear case for including incentives and concessions in the design of FBT. Updating FBT’s design to reflect workforce trends may be sufficient to address concerns raised. Further, in the long term, incentives may affect the sustainability of the tax base Page 21 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review and can be seen as incoherent when viewed against the overall framework. For example, reducing or removing tax on electric vehicles might promote the uptake of such vehicles, but it may be detrimental to the tax base overall. The alternative model of direct incentives, such as the ‘Clean Car Discount’ (a rebate administered by Waka Kotahi), is recommended. Operations 84. We recommend that FBT is included in a future operations work programme. This may comprise multiple workstreams to address particular findings. It may be necessary to gather more information, perhaps through the use of START analytics, about the FBT landscape before changing operational practices or adjusting the policy settings. For example, operations may be able to identify areas of non-compliance that are best addressed by legislation. The timing of any operations work programme will depend on whether a policy project is commissioned, as well as the scale and timing of that policy project. Education and communication 85. Education and communication with taxpayers require improvement to mitigate the tendency for FBT to be ‘the forgotten tax’ and to remind taxpayers of their obligations. There are several options that can be deployed separately or, ideally, in conjunction to ensure the widest possible audience.  One option is a traditional campaign, which could be targeted. 28 There is merit in regular reminders being pushed out, whether through traditional means, such as newsletters, or via social media. However, anecdotally, these campaigns are not thought to reach unadvised and indifferent taxpayers.  An alternative method could be to combat ‘set and forget’ by ensuring that employers are asked whether they need to register for FBT annually, rather than only when they are first set up as an employer, or to indicate which method they are using to account for FBT.  Other options for direct communication include working with professional bodies to drive communications. 86. In addition to direct communications, we recommend the Inland Revenue website be revamped to enable better linking between FBT and other employment taxes, such as PAYE, with a view to creating a ‘one stop shop’ for information. 29 28 CCS’s forthcoming marketing campaign, which focuses on common errors in FBT/getting FBT right, is an example of a traditional campaign. The campaign is intended to launch in 2022. 29 Webpages which specifically address FBT will be included in the 2022 CCS “common errors” campaign. We are unable to comment on whether these pages will assist in improving the visibility of FBT. Page 22 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review 87. Thought should be given to varying communications strategies for engagement with Māori. Face-to-face communications is preferred. We also note that, where policy consultation is undertaken, more time should be allowed to enable adequate feedback through Māori governance structures. At a minimum, Inland Revenue guidance should include Māori-specific examples. 88. Finally, the FBT capability of Inland Revenue staff must be improved to ensure a consistent experience and level of advice is provided. This may include further training or additional support being provided to staff, particularly at the front line, via digital means or through the Technical Specialists network. Compliance and enforcement 89. Modern tax systems use data as a key metric in measuring success. START analytics may assist with designing an enforcement approach. Data strategies could include:  Enhancement of data capture, which at a minimum should require employers and businesses to confirm annually the method they use to account for FBT. This will enable us to monitor the use of methods of accounting for FBT other than an FBT return. This data should be built into existing returns.  Internally, there is interest in obtaining a greater understanding of the benefits provided and income delivered in the form of non-cash benefits. There are different options if this is pursued – for example, obtaining third party data, such as car registration data from Waka Kotahi, or requiring employers to return further information. Whether this information is truly useful and should be captured as part of regular compliance, rather than as background to a campaign, will depend on policy settings.  Development of a tax gap analysis to ascertain the extent of the problem and weigh the value of different intervention strategies. This tool is used by other tax authorities to understand the size and nature of non-compliance. Methodologies differ and comment on the appropriate methodology is outside the scope of this report. 90. FBT is seen as imposing a high compliance burden. In addition to policy changes, which may lower that burden, there is scope to co-operate with third-party software and tools providers to ensure best fit with the systems and processes used by employers and businesses. However, we note there are potential barriers to smoothing administration: in particular, that no natural, widely used systems for the capture of data came to light. In addition, there remains a role for Inland Revenue to provide compliance tools for those (typically small) taxpayers who need them. Notwithstanding these barriers, we recommend considering whether systems improvement is possible. We also recommend enabling e-filing of the FBT return at the gateway to reduce double handling. Potentially, Page 23 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review depending on the data points included, e-filing could also improve our understanding of the FBT landscape. 91. Notwithstanding the need to keep costs low, perceived non-compliance with the FBT rules should be directly addressed. Education and communication may go some way towards raising the profile of FBT, but there is a valid concern that the perception of non-compliance undermines the integrity of the tax system as a whole. 92. Non-compliance takes a number of forms, from simple errors and mistakes to tax evasion. The area believed to be the most non-compliant is the small to medium business sector – the data strategies above may be able to validate this belief and whether this sector should be a key focus of future compliance strategies. 93. Finally, FBT enforcement is required. If a policy project is commissioned, enforcement should follow legislative change and communication of those changes. If policy work is not approved, or is only approved at a remedial level, a focus on enforcement of existing rules would need to continue and possibly be strengthened. 94. Targeted FBT auditing is resource intensive and for that reason is not a specific recommendation. However, FBT should be given more emphasis in the basic compliance package (BCP). Moreover, as the BCP is designed for significant enterprises, developing a similar approach for small and medium enterprises would be desirable. A possible strategy would be to build FBT compliance into a wider strategy of focusing on employment-related tax risks and issues. Page 25 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Appendix 1 – Approach to review Framework 1. The framework for regulatory stewardship in Inland Revenue is built on the overarching Public Sector framework and undertaken in accordance with the operational guidance provided by consultants, MartinJenkins: 30 “Regulatory stewardship ensures the health of key regulatory systems. Regulatory stewardship responsibilities for departments are currently embedded in the Public Service Act and its predecessor, the State Sector Act. This requires public sector agencies to adopt a whole-of-system, lifecycle view of regulation, and take a proactive, collaborative approach, to the monitoring and care of the regulatory system(s) within which they have policy or operational responsibilities.” “Inland Revenue has policy and operational responsibilities across legislation governing the tax and payment systems. In doing so it contributes to a variety of economic and social outcomes. Regulatory stewardship for IR means the Chief Executive needs ongoing assurance that each tax and payment system ‘product’, the delivery of these products, and the tax and payment system design and operation as a whole:  is effective and efficient to deliver on the policy intent  is operating as intended  achieves intended outcomes  remains fit for purpose, given the current and potential future environment. Effective regulatory stewardship means that potential regulatory failures are identified and addressed early, and regulatory systems are adjusted proactively as wider objectives and needs change over time.” Approach 2. In line with the overarching framework, regulatory stewardship requires a systematic review considering both policy and non-policy concerns. This review was primarily diagnostic, aiming to assess FBT’s current fitness for purpose. However, a portion of the 30 “Regulatory Stewardship in Inland Revenue: Operating approach” Final report of MartinJenkins, October 2020, p3. Page 26 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review review has been devoted to considering FBT’s fitness for purpose over the next five to ten years. In addition to an assessment of the health of the FBT system, the review team was also tasked with making recommendations to address any deficiencies identified during the review. 3. The approach to the FBT review was as follows:  Establish the initial policy rationale for FBT and its design.  Identify milestones in the history of FBT and what policy or design features, if any, changed over time.  Identify and analyse sources of quantitative data.  Undertake a programme of loosely structured, participant-led, interviews inside and outside Inland Revenue. − The questions covered the policy and design of FBT, the compliance experience, and the administration of FBT, particularly the role played by Inland Revenue in education, communication and enforcement of FBT. − Participant interviews were undertaken in confidence. Views presented in the report are representative of the views expressed, rather than attributed to particular participants. − Participants are listed below. Timeline 4. The review was commissioned in June 2021. The initial timeframe for completion of the review was six months, but this was slightly lengthened due to resource constraints. Most interviews took place during August and September 2021, although some were conducted as late as mid-November 2021. The review presents a point-in-time assessment as at 30 November 2021. 5. The review’s findings and high-level recommendations were delivered to the Enterprise Priorities and Performance Committee in February 2022.

Fringe benefit tax (FBT) is a tax on non-cash benefits that are provided by the employer to the employee in connection with employment. A fringe benefit is likely to have the following characteristics: 31 a. It is a substitute or supplement to salary or wages, and b. It provides a private benefit to the recipient unrelated to work performed. History 32 2. During the wage and price freeze of the 1980s, it became apparent that employers were providing non-cash benefits as a form of tax-free income. The Report of the Task Force on Tax Reform (1982) (often referred to as the McCaw report) laid out the case for taxing fringe benefits: a. Fringe benefits that reduced an employee’s need to meet private outgoings from income increased their capability to pay in the same way as the payment of extra salary or cash, yet this remuneration was untaxed. b. Employers who provided non-taxable benefits in lieu of salary or wages accessed a reduced total labour cost. c. \[The practice\] was a clear example of perceived unfairness in the system and a factor in developing a climate of avoidance and evasion. d. If not taxed, remuneration in that form would grow, with the result that the tax base would narrow at the expense of Government revenues. 3. The report went on to consider the design of the tax and specific issues that arose in connection with certain benefits, such as motor vehicles. 31 Carr, S., & Chan, C. (2004).

Secondary sources, quoted in this document, have been used instead to illustrate the reasons for enacting FBT. These sources may not perfectly reflect the policymakers’ considerations at the time. Page 30 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review 4. FBT was introduced in 1985. The reasons for its introduction, as explained in an information paper 33 to the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1984 (which contained the new tax), included: a. widening the existing tax base as some important forms of remuneration escape taxation and taxed income is subject to higher rates than would otherwise be necessary to raise a given total yield b. increasing revenue to facilitate either the lowering of the marginal income tax rate or reducing the fiscal deficit c. improving the equity of the system by ensuring the non-cash forms of remuneration are subject to tax d. contributing to improving the resource allocation in the economy, and e. encouraging employers to remunerate their employees in cash, rather than in fringe benefits. 5. In a 1984 Question for Oral Answer, the Associate Minister of Finance, on behalf of the Minister of Finance, stated: 34 “In introducing a tax on fringe benefits the Government had two basic choices. It could have levied the tax on the employee, or it could have levied the tax on the employer. The objectives of the tax are to restore equity in the tax system and to encourage employers who give fringe benefits to their employees to shift those benefits into taxable cash remuneration. If the later course is adopted the employee is then assessed for tax on the true value. Also, the tax is a great deal more simple to administer by assessing it on the employer.” 6. The reasons stated reflect New Zealand’s broad-base, low-rate tax framework, as well as the economic conditions prevailing at that time. Arguably, these considerations remain relevant to the taxation of non-cash remuneration and to questions around whether the New Zealand system is fit for purpose in a modern context. 7. FBT cast a wide net. 35 Its original focus included motor vehicles, low interest loans, insurances, and free, subsidised or discounted goods and services. FBT was also designed to be a single rate system. However, since its introduction, incremental, remedial changes have been made. 33 Fringe Benefit Tax Information Paper (December 1984). 34 Questions for Oral Answer – Fringe Benefits Tax, (22 November 1984) 459 NZPD 1949-1950. 35 The original provisions are in Part 10B of the Income Tax Act 1976. Page 31 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review 8. In 2000 a multi-rate system was introduced that attributed fringe benefits at the marginal tax rate of the employee deriving the benefit. This was intended to prevent the overtaxing of fringe benefits provided to low- and middle-income employees. 36 9. The 2003 Discussion Document Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits 37 operated as a review of FBT. Ultimately, the review affirmed the objectives of FBT but resulted in a few further amendments being made to the rules. The Discussion Document was chiefly concerned with changes to the valuation of motor vehicles for FBT, the valuation of employment-related loans and an expansion of the business tools and health and safety exemptions. 38 10. FBT was introduced in Australia in 1986 for similar reasons to New Zealand’s – that is, base broadening and to provide integrity to the personal income tax base. However, in Australia, FBT now appears to serve wider objectives – it operates to deter the provision of non-cash benefits and provide industry assistance through concessions. 39 FBT design 40 Who pays FBT? 11. Broadly speaking, in New Zealand (and Australia), FBT is borne and paid by the employer. The underlying rationale for this approach was that this method has a lower compliance cost when compared to a system that attributes the benefit to the employee receiving it. 12. Beyond the general approach to FBT, there are special rules for shareholder-employees, close companies and charitable organisations. These relate to either the extent of the liability to report and pay FBT, or how the benefit is accounted for outside the FBT system. 13. In contrast to the New Zealand model for taxing fringe benefits, other jurisdictions (for example, the UK and the USA) include non-exempt non-cash benefits in the employee’s total taxable remuneration. The resulting tax liability is paid by the employee. 36 Special Report - New multi-rate fringe benefit tax (FBT) (ird.govt.nz) (29 September 2000) 37 Streamlining the taxation of fringe benefits (ird.govt.nz) (December 2003) 38 Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 18, No 5, (June 2006), pp 76-86. 39 See, for example: Reducing your FBT liability | Australian Taxation Office (ato.gov.au) 40 The current key FBT provisions are in sections CX 2 to CX 38 and subpart RD of the Income Tax Act 2007. “FBT rules” is a defined term in section RD 25. The Tax Administration Act 1994 also provides for the operation of FBT. Page 32 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Benefits subject to FBT 14. The main types of benefit subject to FBT are: the private use of motor vehicles; subsidised transport; employment-related loans; employer contributions to superannuation schemes, sickness, accident and death benefit funds, and life or health insurance; and free, subsidised or discounted goods and services (unclassified benefits). These benefits are all required to be attributed to the employee unless they are below specified threshold amounts. 15. There are also several circumstances in which a benefit must be pooled. These include where the benefit: is provided to a former employee, cannot be attributed because it is used by more than one person, is below the relevant threshold, or is subsidised transport that meets certain criteria. 16. Noticeably, employer-provided accommodation is subject to PAYE, not FBT. This reflects the historic treatment of employee accommodation. 17. Charities are exempt from FBT on fringe benefits provided to their employees in connection with the carrying out of charitable activities. Benefits provided in connection with the business activities of a charity are not exempt from FBT, nor are “short-term charge facilities” – arrangements that enable employees to obtain third-party goods and services at the employer’s expense (for example, supermarket vouchers) and the value of those facilities is more than the lower of the two threshold amounts. What is the rate of FBT? 18. The rate applying to fringe benefits is determined by the employee’s “all-inclusive pay”; that is, cash pay after tax plus the value of all fringe benefits attributed to the employee in the year. 19. There are currently three basic approaches to determining the FBT rate and therefore liability: the single rate, the short-form alternate rate and the full alternate rate. An additional method for employers to calculate FBT, which takes into account the 39% rate, was included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, GST, and Remedial Matters) Act 2022. 20. Employers can choose which method they use and can change methods. The timing of changes is linked to their filing frequency (quarterly or annually). However, if the alternate rate is used in any return during the year, the employer must complete the alternate rate calculation process for quarter 4. Page 33 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Table 1 Method Explanation Single rate The employer pays the highest marginal FBT rate (currently 63.93%) for each quarter. The employer may ask the Commissioner to replace the quarter 4 value with the amount calculated under the alternate rate. Short-form alternate rate The employer pays the single rate (currently 63.93%) on all attributed benefits provided during the year. Non-attributed benefits are pooled and paid at a rate of either 49.25%, or 63.93% where the benefits are provided to major shareholder- employees. Pooled alternate rate The employer pays a flat rate of 63.93% on attributed benefits for those employees that earn more than $160,000 in gross cash pay or receive more than $13,400 in attributed benefits over the year. FBT is payable at a flat rate of 49.25% on benefits attributed to all other employees. The employer may choose to pay the 49.25% rate on benefits attributed to employees who receive less than $129,681 in all-inclusive pay, even if the employee receives more than the gross cash pay or attributed benefits thresholds above. Non-attributed benefits are taxed at either 49.25%, or 63.93% if the benefits are provided to major shareholder-employees. Full alternate rate The employer pays at the rate of either 49.25% or 63.93% 41 on all attributed benefits in quarters 1 to 3. In quarter 4, the benefits are fully attributed to each employee and the rate and liability is calculated for each employee. The amounts paid in quarters 1 to 3 are subtracted from the total to quantify the balancing payment or refund. Non-attributed benefits are taxed at either 49.25%, or 63.93% if the benefits are provided to major shareholder-employees. 21. The single rate and short-form alternate rate methods are likely to result in over-taxation given the top FBT rate of 63.93%. The full alternate rate imposes a greater compliance burden but achieves an accurate tax result. 22. The table below shows the marginal personal income tax rates and bands with their FBT equivalents. 41 Which rate an employer chooses will depend on their particular situation, such as the additional time required to complete alternative rate calculations, the impact of non-attributed benefits, and the amount employees earn annually. Page 34 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Table 2 Personal income tax Fringe benefit tax Cash income band Tax rate All-inclusive income band Tax rate $0-$14,000 10.5% $0-$12,530 11.73% $14,001-$48,000 17.5% $12,531-$40,580 21.21% $48,001-$70,000 30% $40,581-$55,980 42.86% $70,000-$180,000 33% $55,981-$129,680 49.25% $180,001+ 39% $129,681+ 63.93% How and when is FBT reported and paid? 23. Employers have the choice of filing on a quarterly, annual or income year basis. Quarterly filing is the default position unless employers meet the criteria for income year or annual filing and elect one of those options. Quarterly reporting 24. Quarterly returns are due 20 days after the end of the relevant quarter, except for the final quarter. The return periods and their relevant due dates are in the table below. Table 3 Quarter Return period Return due date 1 01 April to 30 June 20 July 2 01 July to 30 September 20 October 3 01 October to 31 December 20 January 4 1 January to 31 March 31 May Page 35 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Annual and income year reporting 25. Close companies that provide benefits to shareholder-employees can opt to file returns on an income year basis if certain criteria are met. 42 These criteria are that, in the preceding income year:  the annual gross PAYE and employer’s superannuation contributions tax (ESCT) deductions for the company were no more than $1,000,000  the company only provided a maximum of two motor vehicles for private use to shareholder-employees, or  the company had no employees. 26. Small businesses have the option of filing annual returns if, in the preceding income year, the annual gross PAYE and ESCT deductions were no more than $1,000,000 or the employer had no employees. 43 27. There are set dates by which employers must make an election to file yearly returns. These depend on the type of return (income year or annual) and whether the applicant is a current or new employer. FBT: other options 28. Shareholder-employees can account for fringe benefits in other ways. They may choose to adjust their current accounts, treat the value of the benefit as a dividend, or make a private-use adjustment. 44 FBT intersection with child support, student loans and Working for Families 29. Fringe benefits provided by an employer to an employee are sometimes included in that person’s family scheme income in Working for Families and their income for student loans. They are not included in their income for child support purposes. 30. Currently, fringe benefits may be included in family scheme income for Working for Families tax credits as follows:  For controlling shareholder-employees (a person who directly, or with associated persons, holds 50% or more of the voting interests), the grossed-up value of 42 Income Tax Act 2007, section RD 60. 43 Income Tax Act 2007, section RD 61. 44 Income Tax Act 2007, sections CX 17 and RD 54. Page 36 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review attributed fringe benefits to the employee are included in the person’s family scheme income.  For all other employees (including non-controlling shareholder-employees), the value of the following is included in the person’s family scheme income: − private use of an employer-provided motor vehicle where it is part of an explicit salary trade-off, and − an employer-provided short-term charge facility. 31. These fringe benefits are also included in a New Zealand-based borrower’s income for student loan repayment purposes. 32. By design, and as noted above, child support does not currently include fringe benefits in determining a person’s income for child support purposes. Broadly, the child support rules look to a person’s taxable income (and, from 1 April 2022, a person’s net income). While fringe benefits are taxed, they do not count as a person’s income. Page 37 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Appendix 3 – Data review 1. This appendix summarises the data considered in undertaking the fringe benefit tax (FBT) regulatory stewardship review. Available data comprises taxpayer-provided information held by Inland Revenue and data from external sources, including the results of a member survey on current FBT rules undertaken by the Corporate Taxpayer Group (CTG) and Australian FBT data. FBT returns 2. There are three different FBT returns:  The FBT quarterly return (IR 420). Each year these returns account for approximately 65% of all FBT returns and nearly 94% of reported FBT revenue.  The FBT income year return (IR 421). This return is for companies with shareholder- employees. Each year these returns account for about 20% of total FBT returns and 2% of FBT revenue.  The FBT annual return (IR 422). This return is for employers who qualify and have elected to file annual returns for the year. Each year these returns account for around 15% of total FBT returns and about 4% of annual FBT revenue. 3. Each of the different FBT returns follow the same basic structure. For the period of the return, the employer provides the following information:  The total taxable value of benefits provided.  The FBT rate applied by the employer and the amount of FBT calculated.  The GST payable on fringe benefits provided.  The total FBT and GST to be paid. 4. The data contained in the FBT returns provides a high-level picture of the total FBT revenue raised, the number of employers paying FBT and the average amount of FBT paid. The returns do not enable any further insights, for example, into the types of benefits currently provided by employers. 45 Active FBT registrations 5. There are 20,354 active FBT registrations for the most recent tax year (2020/21). This represents a 34% decline in registrants compared to the 30,887 FBT registrants Inland Revenue recorded in 2009/10. Almost all this decline (33%) occurred between 2009/10 45 From 1990/91 to 1998/99, information on broad categories of benefit types was collected by Inland Revenue. This is discussed later in the document.

Figure 1 FBT filers 6. There were 21,885 FBT filers in the 2019/20 tax year, of which 81% (17,834) filed non-nil returns. The breakdown of total filers and non-nil return filers, per return type, is shown in the two tables below.

Overall trends for FBT filers between the 2009/10 and 2019/20 tax years are:  A 29% decline in the total number of FBT filers.  An 18% decline in the number of FBT filers filing non-nil returns.  The portion of nil return filers as a proportion of total filers has been steadily reducing from nearly 30% of return filers in 2009/10 to 19% in 2019/20. Page 40 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review FBT revenue 8. Despite the gradual decline in the number of FBT return filers, FBT collected has increased overall during the same period. Inland Revenue collected $592 million in FBT in the 2019/20 tax year, a 24% increase from the $479 million collected in 2009/10 year. Most of this revenue is collected from entities that file quarterly returns. Figure 2 9. That said, FBT revenue has always been a small part of government revenue. In the early 1990s, the total amount of FBT revenue was close to 5% of PAYE revenue and around 3% of direct income tax revenue. Fast forward nearly thirty years, and total FBT revenue is equal to closer to 1.6% of total PAYE revenue and about 0.9% of total direct income tax revenue. 46 The proportional importance of FBT revenue may have implications for prioritising administrative efforts to enforce the current FBT rules. 10. Other insights from longer-run FBT return data is that FBT revenue increased between its introduction and 1989, and then significantly reduced between 1990 and 1995. Several factors are likely to have contributed to the 1990s decline. Some of the decline was due to certain elements being removed from the FBT net, such as the employer contributions to specified superannuation schemes. Other possible explanations include tax planning to reduce FBT and employers ceasing to provide fringe benefits so they would not be liable for the tax. 47 46 Inland Revenue Annual Reports 1990-2021. “Direct” taxes are individual and corporate income tax, resident withholding tax, non-resident withholding tax and employer superannuation contribution tax. 47 Carr, S.A. & Chan, C. (2004) New Zealand’s Fringe Benefit Tax 20 years on: An Empirical Investigation into Employers’ Perception. New Zealand Journal of Taxation Law and Policy, Vol. 10, No. 3, pp. 245-270 at p 252. 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 1234567891011 Total FBT Returned ($m) Page 41 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review 11. Carr and Chan’s 48 findings (based on 249 business responses) were that the introduction of FBT had no impact on staff remuneration for 44% of respondents. Other respondents did change remuneration practices: 34% of respondents removed some or all fringe benefits with compensating increases in cash, and 16% of respondents removed some fringe benefits. However, none of the respondents that provided benefits at the time of the survey said they had removed all fringe benefits in response to the introduction of FBT. Carr and Chan’s findings suggested to them that tax considerations were not the prime or only consideration when an employer decides whether to offer a fringe benefit. Other factors, such as “corporate policy” and “industry expectation”, are more influential in the decision-making process. Interestingly, these factors were reflected in comments made by interview participants in the current review. 12. After 1995, the role of FBT as a revenue collector flattens and the decrease in the proportion of FBT in comparison to PAYE or direct income tax as a whole is more subtle (see graph below). Figure 3 FBT payers 13. Matching FBT return data with other return data means that we can describe some of the other characteristics of employers returning FBT. The following provides a little more insight to the nature of employers who are paying FBT. 48 Carr, S.A. & Chan, C.

The bulk of FBT revenue is paid by a relatively small number of taxpayers – nearly 69% is paid by employers of 101 or more people. Data collected by Inland Revenue shows that employers with 501 or more employees accounted for 2% of FBT filers, but 41.4% of FBT paid in the year ending 31 March 2020. By comparison, employers with more than 500 employees comprise 0.2% of PAYE filers and account for 39.3% of PAYE. Employers of 101-500 employees pay 27.4% of FBT and 18.8% of PAYE. This suggests that fringe benefits may be more important in remuneration practices for this group of employers. As there may be other, or more, explanations for this disparity, this point may bear further investigation. Figure 4 15. A strong correlation between total FBT paid and number of employees seems intuitive. From the return data, the fewer the number of employees, the less likely the employer is to be an FBT filer within that employee band. For the 500+ employee band, 83% of employers were FBT filers, whereas for the 1-5 employee band, less than 4% of the employers were FBT filers. It is not clear why there might be a negative correlation between the number of employees and non-cash remuneration. During the review process, we heard comments that smaller businesses tended not to prioritise FBT compliance. Alternatively, these businesses may be less able to provide fringe benefits. Finally, the legislation provides options for FBT compliance in certain circumstances that may be attractive to eligible small businesses. 0.0 50.0 100.0 150.0 200.0 250.0 300.0 - 1,000 2,000 3,000 4,000 5,000 6,000 01-56-1011-2021-5051-100101-500501+ TOTAL FBT ($M) NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES Number of employees for employers filing FBT returns and value of FBT for year ending March 2020 Number of Employers filing FBTTotal FBT ($m) Page 43 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review 16. Inland Revenue also holds FBT data by ANZSIC industry. This data enables us to observe that the Professional, Scientific and Technical services category files nearly 20% of FBT returns, but accounts for 10% of FBT revenue. In contrast, Financial and Insurance Services comprise 3.5% of returns filed, but 9% of FBT collected. Both Manufacturing and Wholesale Trade file approximately 11% of FBT returns and pay around 16% of FBT collected. The data cannot provide the reasons for these observations. A better understanding of the types of fringe benefits provided may provide an explanation. Figure 5 What non-cash benefits are provided? 17. As mentioned above, the data Inland Revenue asks for in the FBT returns is only the total value of taxable benefits for the period. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a breakdown of what non-cash benefits employers are providing their employees. 18. In the 1990/91 to 1998/99 tax years, Inland Revenue collected data on five broad categories of taxable non-cash benefits. Table 4 below provides the proportion of FBT revenue for each of the five categories.

In their 2004 survey of employer perceptions of FBT, Carr and Chan reported the types of benefits that were provided to three broad employee groups. The private use of motor vehicles and employer contributions to superannuation funds and/or health insurance were the most frequently provided employer benefits. 49 49 Carr, S.A. & Chan, C.

The CTG surveyed its members and provided insights to Inland Revenue from respondents for the 2021 FBT year. The below table summarises the value of non-cash benefits (excluding values of less than one percent) provided by 24 CTG respondents to their employees for the 2021 tax year.

The CTG data suggests that the mix of benefits provided to employees may have changed over the last 30 years. Motor vehicle benefits may not be as significant as they were in the late 1990s. It also suggests that employers may be providing employees with more unclassified benefits. However, it is not possible to draw meaningful conclusions from the data the review team was able to source. It may be desirable to collect further data, from a wider range of employers and businesses, before reaching a conclusion on the current provision of non-cash benefits to employees. Compliance costs 22. Numerous changes seeking to reduce compliance costs for businesses have been made since the FBT rules were introduced in 1986. The changes have been both legal and administrative (for example, the provision of an online calculator). However, we have been unable to ascertain whether cost savings have been achieved. 50 23. Inland Revenue’s 2018 research on small businesses noted that “\[f\]ringe benefit tax performs the worst for customers when registering and managing change, especially around the ease, time and stress, and reassurance.” 51 The key compliance points for small businesses included that FBT can be time consuming and complex, vehicle FBT is tricky 50 See also Fringe Benefit Tax in New Zealand, Inland Revenue, (March 2021), p 12. 51 Small business landscape report (2018), p 51. Page 47 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review to calculate and burdensome, and FBT calculations are confusing. However, the 2021 Inland Revenue internal survey on business costs for small businesses showed that FBT does not incur the greatest amount of time or cost – other taxes, such as GST, are more significant. 52 In contrast, the private sector’s perception captured in this current review is that FBT imposes a high compliance burden. Why there is a difference between the reviews is not clear. It could be due to the focus on FBT separate to other taxes. 24. In interviews conducted during this review, participants commented that the task of sorting through expenses and possible payments of fringe benefits is time consuming. This view was shared by large and small business representatives. CTG survey respondents estimated that doing the calculations and preparing FBT returns takes around 3,745 hours per year (across 21 respondents) – averaging at 178 hours each per year. 25. CTG members also raised compliance cost concerns as part of their survey, including that:  motor vehicle benefits are being overtaxed in many instances due to the complex and burdensome nature of the current FBT rules, and  capturing and tracking unclassified benefits and vehicle use are the biggest cause of compliance costs when preparing FBT calculations and returns. 26. Another possible driver of compliance costs is the way in which the multi-rate calculation aims to impose FBT at a PAYE equivalent rate. The calculation results in more accurate taxation but requires attribution to each employee. This necessarily incurs compliance costs. The CTG survey indicated that 54% of respondents attributed benefits for all employees, while 17% used the single rate option. 27. There have been several independent reviews and comments on FBT compliance costs since its introduction. Carr and Chan (2004) reported business perception that the “administrative costs to the employer were often higher than the value of the benefits for the employee and the revenue for the Government”. 53 This point was reflected in discussions with the private sector in the current review. 52 2021 study on the time and cost of doing business taxes incurred by NZ small businesses (April to June 2021), Inland Revenue 53 Carr, S.A. & Chan, C. (2004) Ibid at p 257 and comments on limitations on data at p 261. See also Van Zijl, T. (1985) Is There Anything Good to Say About the Perks Tax?

(1992) The Compliance Costs of Business Taxes in New Zealand (Institute of Policy Studies, Victoria University of Wellington) Page 48 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review Australian data 28. Australia, like New Zealand, imposes an employer-paid FBT on non-cash benefits. As there are differences in the underlying policy (see appendix 2) and in the tax base, only broad observations can be made. In addition to being able to observe information regarding FBT filers and payments, the Australian Tax Office (ATO) also collects information on the types of benefits provided to employees. 54 This may enable a better understanding of both benefits provided and their relative popularity over time. Tax gap analysis 29. An approach used by some overseas tax administrations to assess FBT compliance, compliance risks and concerns involves estimating the tax gap for FBT. Evaluation of the appropriateness of a tax gap analysis in the New Zealand context and comment on tax gap methodology is outside the scope of this report. 30. We have briefly looked at the tax gap work of the ATO. 55 The Australian analysis for FBT 56 indicates that for 2018–19, the net FBT gap estimate was around 22.6%. However, when looked at in the context of Pay as You Go withholding and FBT together, the integrated gap was approximately 2.1%. 31. In the ATO’s view, the primary driver of its gap estimate is employers not participating in the FBT system where they are providing benefits to employees. It further estimated that almost a third of FBT adjustments resulted from a lack of awareness of FBT obligations by either the employer or the tax agent. 32. The ATO’s insights supported their views of the reasons for the FBT gap. These insights indicated that contact between tax agents and their clients for FBT matters was often on an ad hoc basis, and that some employers may be reluctant to engage a tax agent to undertake FBT work because of the additional cost of doing so. Echoes of these insights were heard in the interviews conducted in this review. Conclusions 33. At a high level, Inland Revenue can report on the amount of FBT revenue collected and the number of employers returning FBT and provide a broad description of the types of employers providing benefits to employees or shareholder-employees. However, there 54 Fringe benefits tax statistics | Australian Taxation Office (ato.gov.au) 55 Other tax authorities that undertake a tax gap analysis include Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the United Kingdom, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). 56 Fringe benefits tax gap | Australian Taxation Office (ato.gov.au) Page 49 of 49 Fringe benefit tax: regulatory stewardship review are major gaps in currently available information, particularly data that might inform Inland Revenue and the broader public debate on FBT compliance, risks and concerns. 34. The then Government’s stated purpose in introducing the FBT rules included restoring equity to the tax system and encouraging employers who give fringe benefits to their employees to shift those benefits into taxable cash remuneration. The Government also considered that FBT would be simpler to administer if it was assessed on the employer. 57 35. Having reviewed the available data, it is difficult to know whether these objectives have been achieved. What we can say is that:  The FBT rules may have improved the equity of the tax system. However, better evidence of employer compliance with the FBT rules would strengthen such a conclusion.  Notwithstanding the introduction of FBT, businesses have continued to provide non-cash benefits to employees. This suggests there may be other reasons that drive the provision of fringe benefits.  There continues to be costs for businesses in complying with the current FBT rules. Some of these costs undoubtedly arise from the structure of FBT, including the options for calculation and returns, which were intended to increase fairness or reduce compliance costs. 36. Based on the limitations of the data available to inform the current review, there is scope to improve our understanding of the FBT landscape. One option is to continue to use insights generated from ongoing Inland Revenue work. Another is to regularly capture more information from employers and businesses via returns. A third option may be to analyse the tax gap. Regardless of the approach, an understanding of the degree of compliance with FBT in New Zealand is likely to be particularly useful given the perception of non-compliance expressed in interviews during this review. 57 Questions for Oral Answer – Fringe Benefits Tax, (22 November 1984) 459 NZPD 1949-1950.

Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing (LTIB) on tax, foreign investment and productivity is available on its tax policy website. 1 T hese technical appendices provide some additional support for the analysis in the LTIB. They provide further analytical detail on the formal models being used and d iscussion on implications of the formal modelling. Following submissions from stakeholders and external reviews, these are an update of the technical appendices that accompanied the draft LTIB. 2 2. The technical appendices are as follows: • Appendix 1 provides two formal economic models of how taxes can affect costs of capital and effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs). The first of these is the main OECD model that is being used throughout the LTIB. A crucial assumption in this first model is that non- residents are marginal shareholders. This model may, or may not, be relevant for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) where non-residents own negligible amounts of the business. We also explore two variants of a second model where resident individuals are marginal investors in the business. • Appendix 2 provides a more detailed analysis of how New Zealand’s tax settings can impact on costs of capital and EMTRs. It considers how differences in the tax treatment of different asset types and firms financed in different ways can create tax biases that may reduce economic efficiency and productivity. While EMTRs in New Zealand may often be high relative to those in many other countries, at times they can be negative. The appendix explores the way inflation can increase tax imposts on assets that have high EMTRs in the first place and increase tax subsidies to assets with negative EMTRs. It considers how non-resident withholding tax on interest and approved issuer levy can affect costs of capital and EMTRs for foreign-controlled and other companies. It discusses how changes in assumptions about the marginal investor might affect the analysis. • Appendix 3 provides some cash flow examples illustrating the impacts of taxes and inflation on costs of capital and EMTRs for equity-financed and debt-financed investments. • Appendix 4 discusses risk and its likely impact on costs of capital and EMTRs. • Appendix 5 provides a simple cash flow example to show how some debt-financed investments can end up with negative EMTRs. Rather than investments being taxed, they can end up being subsidised, and higher rates of inflation will tend to lead to higher subsidies for these subsidised assets. • Appendix 6 examines how some tax changes, including changes to the company tax rate, depreciation rates and R&D tax credit, are likely to have affected costs of capital and EMTRs. There are other measures though, such as thin capitalisation rules and transfer pricing measures, that we have not been able to analyse. 1 Inland Revenue. (2022). Final long-term insights briefing. https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2022/2022-other-final-ltib 2 The draft LTIB and former technical appendices are available at: https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2022/2022-other-draft-ltib 5 APPENDIX 1 Cost of capital and EMTR estimates: two formal models 1.1 The OECD website provides estimates across OECD countries and some other countries for the cost of capital, the effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) and the effective average tax rate (EATR) for a set of assets. 3 Our focus is on the cost of capital (or the threshold real rate of return at which investment becomes profitable) and on the closely associated EMTR. Tax provisions will affect the cost of capital and incentives to invest. Changes in the cost of capital will lead to changes in New Zealand’s capital stock. 1.2 This appendix presents two variants of a formal model of how tax rules affect costs of capital and EMTRs. 1.3 The first of these is just a simple version of the OECD model. It allows us to analyse costs of capital when investment is being undertaken through companies in which non-residents are the marginal equity investors (the case that underlies the numerical estimates posted on the OECD website). It provides cost of capital results that are identical to the OECD’s analysis in this case. Our model is less general than the OECD’s. For example, the model cannot be as easily adapted to consider different possible marginal investors. At the same time, it is considerably simpler than the OECD model and allows varying levels of debt and their impact on costs of capital to be analysed directly. 4 We focus primarily on this variant and refer to it as the ‘OECD company tax model’. It is the model the OECD has used to benchmark different countries. 1.4 We also consider an alternative domestic small and medium enterprise (SME) variant. In this variant, foreigners are still the marginal suppliers of debt finance, but there is no foreign equity finance. All equity finance is supplied by resident individuals. There are two sub-variants. In the first, the individuals invest either through unincorporated enterprises or through companies that pay the maximum possible level of imputed dividends each year but no unimputed dividends. In either case, taxable income is assumed to be taxed at personal tax rates each year. This is only a ‘first cut’ way of analysing investment incentives for SMEs organised as companies. Under New Zealand’s full imputation system, corporate profits are eventually taxed at shareholders’ tax rates when they are paid as dividends. However, there can be important deferral benefits when the company tax rate is less than the marginal tax rates of shareholders (as will often be the case) and if profits are retained in 3 OECD. OECD.Stat. Public Sector, Taxation and Market Regulation > Taxation > Corporate Tax Statistics > Effective Tax Rates. https://stats.oecd.org/ 4 While our cost of capital measures are identical, there is a difference in our estimates of EMTRs because of the indirect way that the OECD calculates these. The OECD calculates its EMTR as a weighted average of the EMTRs for a fully equity-financed and a fully debt-financed investment. This can make their estimates appear inconsistent with their cost of capital estimates. Our EMTR is always given by = −(\*) / w EMTRprp where p is the cost of capital for the partially debt-financed investment and \* w r is the real weighted average cost of funds to the economy. For example, suppose =\*3% w r , the cost of capital for a 100% equity-financed investment is 4%, the cost of capital for a 100% debt-financed investment is 2% and the cost of capital for a 50% debt-financed investment is 3%. We would calculate the EMTR for a 50% debt-financed investment as being zero (because the cost of capital and cost of funds are both 3%). The OECD methodology would result in their estimate being -12.5% because the EMTR for a 100% equity-financed investment is 25% and the EMTR for a 100% debt-financed investment is -50%. 6 companies and reinvested for considerable periods of time. The second sub- variant assumes that profits are retained in companies forever, so the personal tax rate becomes irrelevant, and costs of capital depend solely on the company tax rate. OECD company tax model 1.5 Assume that foreign equity investors demand the real return, \* e r , on their equity finance and as much equity capital as wanted can be attracted at this fixed rate of return. Debt finance is attracted at a real interest rate, \* d r . A fixed proportion, b, is borrowed and the remaining 1b− is financed by equity. The OECD study ignores any levies or non-resident withholding tax on interest and, for the time being, we also ignore these levies and taxes. The asterisk denotes that these are world rates of return. Levies or non-resident withholding taxes on interest can increase domestic real interest rates above world real interest rates. 1.6 Let \* w r be the pre-tax real weighted average cost of funds to New Zealand so \* (1) \*\* wed rb rbr=−+ (1) 1.7 In the absence of any levies or withholding taxes on interest or on dividends paid abroad, the real cost of debt to companies operating in New Zealand will be \* dd rr= , the real cost of equity will be \* ee rr= and the real weighted average cost of funds will be \* ww rr= . 1.8 The real after-tax discount rate will be the weighted average of the real after- tax costs of debt and equity finance. This will be given by ' (1)' wed rb rbr=−+ where ' d r is the real after-tax cost of borrowing. As is discussed below, this will mean ' (1)(1) 1 wed rbr b r τπ τ π  =− + −−  +  (2) where τ is the company tax rate and π is the inflation rate. 1.9 The fraction of each dollar of investment that is equity-financed costs e r . As much debt finance as demanded can be attracted at the world real interest rate, d r . Debt finance is deductible. It would cost (1) d rτ − in the absence of inflation. But deductions are allowed for nominal, rather than real, interest, and the final term / (1)τππ+ reflects the deduction for the inflationary component of interest. 1.10 To see this, note that the nominal after-tax interest rate on borrowed funds is () '(1)(1)(1) ddd iir τππ τ= −= ++ − where d i is the nominal interest rate. 1.11 This means that the real after-tax interest rate on borrowed funds is () (1)(1) ' '(1) 111 d d dd r i rr ππ τπ π τπ τ πππ + + −− − = == −− +++ 1.12 We can write that the nominal after-tax weighted average cost of funds is 7 ' (1)(1) wed ib ibi τ=−+ − (3) where (1) ee irππ = ++ . 1.13 For a marginal investment, the present value of the after-tax benefits should be equal to the present value of the costs. The OECD modelling is examining how changes in tax parameters will affect hurdle rates of returns or costs of capital and EMTRs for these marginal investments. 1.14 Assume that a dollar invested in a project at the end of year 0 generates c in real revenue (net of any non-financing costs) at the end of year 1, (1)cd− at the end of year 2, 2 (1)cd− at the end of year 3 and so forth.

Let A denote the present value of the stream of tax savings from the future stream of depreciation deductions, together with any investment allowances or investment tax credits (such as the current R&D tax credit). Different rates of tax depreciation or other capital allowances will affect the cost of capital by changing the value of A. 1.16 The present value of tax reductions, A, will involve discounting any depreciation deductions at a nominal discount rate. This discount rate will be the nominal after-tax weighted average cost of funds, w i ’. 5 Suppose, for example, that there are no investment tax credits and an asset with an economic rate of depreciation of d can be depreciated at the diminishing value (DV) rate d\*.

A marginal investment is one that just breaks even for shareholders when cash flows are discounted at this rate. But a marginal investment will also be one at which the net present value is zero when all cash flows (inclusive of those associated with borrowing) are discounted at the weighted average cost of funds. We take this second approach, which simplifies the model. 8 1.18 The variable c is sometimes referred to as the ‘user-cost’ or the ‘implicit rental value of capital services’. 6 It is the equilibrium rental charge that would be needed to compensate a lessor for the costs of making a dollar of capital goods available to a lessee if there were no transaction costs of leasing. It is the return that would be required in equilibrium for a firm to acquire capital goods and then use them itself (which can be thought of as leasing capital goods to itself). 1.19 The cost of capital is the pre-tax rate of return on a marginal investment. This will be pcd= − . The asset provides a pre-tax gross return of c. However, each year the net revenue is falling by d, which leads to economic depreciation of this amount. The cost of capital (or minimum real pre-tax rate of return at which an investment becomes profitable) is () () 1' 1 w Ar d pd τ −+ =− − (5) 1.20 The OECD’s cost of capital expressions can be derived by substituting appropriate values of A into equation (5). 1.21 The OECD study examines the EMTR which is the proportion of the pre-tax rate of return on a marginal investment that goes in tax. When foreign investors are marginal investors into companies, this can be defined as \* w pr EMTR p − = (6) where \* w r is the pre-tax real weighted average costs of funds to a capital- importing economy given by equation (1). Domestic SME variant 1.22 An open question is how best to analyse investment incentives for domestic SMEs with no foreign shareholders. Incentives will depend on the opportunity cost of the capital invested in domestic SMEs, and there are different cases that can be considered. 1.23 One possible case is where the owners of domestic SMEs would otherwise invest in New Zealand listed companies. If these listed companies are ones where non- residents are marginal shareholders, cost of capital expressions from the OECD model above (as, for example, in equation (2) above) might be argued to continue to be relevant. 1.24 If, instead, the owners of domestic entities would invest in other assets, such as interest-bearing securities or foreign equities, different cost of capital expressions will arise. There is no obvious best way of modelling the different possible cases when domestic residents can own a variety of such assets. 1.25 Below we explore two possible variants. In both variants, the alternative asset is interest-bearing securities. Sub-v ariant 1: Full distribution sub-variant 1.26 In the first sub-variant, we assume that a corporate SME distributes all its taxable profits to shareholders each year so that the profits are fully taxed at the marginal tax rates of shareholders, m. We assume profits that are not taxed 6 See Hall, R.E. and D.W. Jorgenson (1967). 9 at the company level are not distributed as dividends but are instead retained in the company. 1.27 As a result of New Zealand’s full imputation system, taxable profits end up being taxed at the rate of shareholders. Imputation credits are available for company tax that has been paid, and company tax operates like a withholding tax. If the company tax rate is 28% and m is 33%, a company that earns $100 in pre-tax profits would pay $28 of company tax. When the $72 is paid as a dividend, the shareholder would be taxed on $100 (the dividend plus the $28 imputation credit). This leads to $33 of gross income tax, but this is offset by $28 of imputation credits. The shareholder is only required to pay $5 in net additional tax. This tops up the total tax rate on company profits to the shareholder’s marginal rate. Once profits are distributed, they are taxed at the tax rates of shareholders. 1.28 Equally, we might assume that income is owned through an unincorporated enterprise and the profits are taxed directly in shareholders’ hands. Whether profits are earned within an unincorporated enterprise or a company, the profits end up being taxed at shareholders’ marginal tax rates. 1.29 Taxpayers can borrow or lend at the nominal interest rate, i, or the real interest rate, r. The nominal after-tax interest rate is '(1)ii m= − , and the real after- tax interest rate is '(1)/ (1)r r mmππ =−− + . 1.30 For a marginal investment by an unincorporated investor, the present value of the after-tax costs must once more equal the present value of the after-tax benefits, so 2 (1)11(1) 11 1' 1'1'' cmddcm A rrrrd  − −−−   −=+ ++ =   + +++    where A is found by discounting depreciation deductions at the net-of -personal- tax interest rate. The cost of capital is given by () () 1' 1 Ar d pd m −+ =− − (5’) 1.31 This replaces equation (5). Sub-v ariant 2: Full retention sub-variant 1.32 In the second sub-variant, it is assumed that profits are earned by a domestic SME that retains and accumulates all profits. The company itself can borrow or lend at the nominal interest rate, i, or the real interest rate, r. In this case the cost of capital is given by (1) ( ') 1 Ar d pd τ −+ =− − (5”) where '(1)/ (1)rrτ τππ= −− + and depreciation deductions are discounted at a net-of -company-tax interest rate. 10 Augmenting the OECD model for approved issuer levy (AIL) and non-resident withholding tax on interest 1.33 In chapter 4 of the LTIB and in Appendix 2 below we augment the basic OECD model to take account of AIL and NRWT on interest. These levies and taxes may potentially lead to domestic real interest rates being higher than world real interest rates. We will consider two potential types of company with marginal foreign shareholders. 1.34 As is discussed in Appendix 2, for domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders, AIL is likely to be relevant and be increasing domestic interest rates while NRWT on interest is unlikely to be relevant. A IL is levied at a rate of 2.0% a t= on nominal interest payment paid abroad. Suppose that \*\* (1) dd ir ππ = ++ is the nominal interest rate that non-residents receive. The nominal interest rate that domestic firms will be paying inclusive of AIL will be \* (1) dda iit=+ and the real interest paid will be () \* (1)(1) \* (1) 111 da da dda rt it rrt πππ ππ πππ ++ + − − = == ++ +++ 1.35 To derive costs of capital and EMTRs for domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders in Appendix 2 we use this value of d r and equations (1) to (6) above. 1.36 For foreign-controlled companies, interest payments to related parties abroad will be subject to NRWT at a rate w t whereas interest payments to third parties are likely to be subject to AIL. Interest payments to related parties abroad are likely to need to be grossed up for NRWT on interest if NRWT is not creditable abroad but not if NRWT is fully creditable abroad. We introduce a dummy variable α which takes a value of 1 if NRWT is not creditable and 0 if NRWT is fully creditable. We denote the fraction of debt that is related party by θ . 1.37 The average nominal interest rate paid by these firms is assumed to rise to \*(1) (1) 1 dda w iit t θ θ α  =+− +  −  1.38 The real domestic interest rate will be 1 d d i r π π − = + 1.39 To derive costs of capital and EMTRs for foreign controlled companies with marginal foreign direct shareholders in Appendix 2 we use this value of d r and equations (1) to (6) above. 11 APPENDIX 2 A deeper look at costs of capital and EMTRs for New Zealand Introduction 2.1 The OECD benchmarking exercise discussed in chapter 3 of the LTIB rests on assumptions the OECD has made and applied to all OECD countries. In this appendix, we modify and extend the analysis in various ways. Some of the key results from this appendix are discussed in chapter 4 of the LTIB. 2.2 The OECD analysis provides a single estimated cost of capital and a single estimated EMTR for non-building tangible assets. However, there are different types of these assets, with different economic and tax depreciation rates. This will lead to a variety of costs of capital and EMTRs. Focusing on these different values allows potential tax biases between different types of these assets to be examined. The OECD analysis assumes a debt level of 35% and an inflation rate of 1% per annum. We rework this analysis to allow for a slightly higher debt level (which better reflects average debt levels in New Zealand) and a higher inflation rate of 2% (which is in the middle of the Reserve Bank’s target range). Currently, inflation is running at a significantly higher rate. CPI inflation over the year ending with the June quarter 2022 was 7.3%. However, over time, inflation is expected to move back towards the middle of the Reserve Bank target range. In its Budget and Economic Fiscal update 2022, the Treasury is estimating the CPI inflation will have been reduced to 2.2% by 2026. The OECD study ignores non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on interest and the approved issuer levy (AIL). In 2. 6 to 2.32 we rework the OECD analysis in a model that, like the OECD’s analysis, ignores both NRWT on interest and AIL. 2.3 In 2.33 to 2.64, we extend the analysis to take account of NRWT on interest and AIL. The OECD does not consider how thin capitalisation rules might affect the analysis. We also have some discussion of this issue. However, we are unable to provide a satisfactory way of allowing for changes in thin capitalisation provisions on costs of capital. We have also been unable to estimate how the restricted transfer pricing rules, which limited rates at which interest could be deducted for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018, will have impacted costs of capital. 2.4 In most of the analysis, we use the OECD assumption that non-resident marginal providers of debt and equity finance require a 3% real return on their capital, net of New Zealand taxes. 7 Some studies have assumed that marginal 7 One referee expressed concerns about our use of the OECD assumption that the real costs of debt and equity are the same. He commented that our assumption was incompatible with capital market equilibrium. In many countries income from abroad on debt instruments is taxed more heavily than income from abroad on equity instruments. This suggests that debt instruments should be required to generate higher risk-adjusted returns than equity instruments. A practical problem though is in deciding an appropriate premium for debt given differences of tax treatments in different countries. There are similar issues with modelling inflation. We assume that a fixed real return is required on debt instruments irrespective of the domestic interest rate. If interest receipts are taxed at income tax rates while exchange losses are deducted at a lower capital gains tax rate, it is possible for higher domestic inflation rates to push up the real interest rate the New Zealand is required to pay on its debt. These are complex issues which we ignore in this study. Boadway, Bruce and Mintz (1984) is a formal model which works through these issues. As is 12 investors require higher returns than this. Implications of higher required returns for costs of capital and EMTRs are explored in 2.65 to 2.67. 2.5 The analysis discussed so far rests on a variant of the OECD’s model of companies where non-residents are marginal shareholders. However, SMEs operating in New Zealand may often have negligible amounts of foreign equity capital. In 2.68 to 2.74 we also consider the domestic SME model that was outlined in appendix 1. In that model, domestic residents who borrow and lend on world markets are assumed to be the marginal shareholders. In this case, EMTRs may often be negative. Extending the OECD model to take account of New Zealand settings – no NRWT on interest and no AIL 2.6 In this section we make a start on extending the OECD model to take account of New Zealand settings. We consider a broader set of assets and examine how costs of capital and EMTRs can be affected by inflation. As in the OECD analysis we ignore non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on interest and the approved issuer levy (AIL). These taxes and levies will be considered later in this appendix. 2.7 The OECD analysis provides a single point estimate of a cost of capital for assets they describe as ‘tangible assets’, which are tangible assets other than buildings . For example, with a 3% real interest rate, and when debt is 35% of capital, New Zealand is estimated to have a cost of capital of 3.9%. 2.8 This single point estimate approach has some costs and benefits. Presenting a single point estimate can allow a comparison of costs of capital across countries. However, for our purposes, it is more useful to have a range of possible values. If there is a large range of different costs of capital for different tangible assets other than buildings, biases in the way different types of these assets are taxed may be as important as any biases between the average for these assets and other classes of asset. Different possible tax changes may either increase or decrease these biases. 2.9 In New Zealand, depreciation deductions are set in an attempt to reflect ‘economic depreciation’, namely, how assets will actually decline in value. However, there has been no attempt to take account of inflation in setting these values. In setting depreciation rates, inflation has been ignored (or taken to be zero). This was discussed in a 2004 New Zealand officials’ issues paper on depreciation. 8 In practice, New Zealand and most other countries have very poor information on how assets fall in value. The OECD’s estimates of economic depreciation are based on estimates by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) in the United States. 9 These appear to be the most widely used estimates of economic depreciation and have the benefit of being from an independent agency. 2.10 There are several difficulties in attempting to use these BEA estimates of economic depreciation for estimating costs of capital in New Zealand. An obvious concern is that the BEA estimates were derived for a different country discussed later, we do, however, check whether results are sensitive to the assumption that the real required returns on debt and equity are the same. Changing this assumption slightly has little effects on our estimates of EMTRs. 8 Inland Revenue and Treasury. (2004). Repairs and maintenance to tax depreciation rules – an officials’ issues paper. https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2004/2004-ip-depreciation 9 These BEA estimates are available at https://search.bea.gov/search?affiliate=u.s.bureauofeconomicanalysis&query=depreciation+rat es 13 (the United States) and reflect data that has been put together over a long period of time. The data can often be quite dated. However, another concern may be even more important. This is the fact that categories of assets used in the BEA study are often quite different from those New Zealand uses for tax purposes. It therefore becomes very difficult to match tax depreciation rates for tangible assets other than buildings in New Zealand against estimates of economic depreciation from the BEA study. This means that OECD estimates of costs of capital and EMTRs will be approximate at best. 2.11 To sidestep these problems as much as possible, we use an alternative approach. We examine what would happen if tax depreciation rates did successfully reflect how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation. We see that even if we were perfectly successful in hitting our target, some important distortions would arise with even minor levels of inflation. Because we are likely to be some distance from successfully setting depreciation rates to mirror how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation, New Zealand’s range of costs of capital is likely to be larger than our estimated range. 2.12 We also report results for a somewhat broader set of assets than the OECD considers, namely: • commercial and industrial buildings • plant, machinery and equipment that is assumed to have a variety of economic and tax depreciation rates • a zero-depreciation asset that is assumed to neither appreciate nor depreciate in real terms • inventories • appreciating assets, and • assets for which capital expenditure can be deducted immediately (or expensed). 2.13 Commercial and industrial buildings are assumed to have an economic depreciation rate of 2.69%, which is an OECD estimate of a weighted average of economic depreciation rates across these two types of buildings. The OECD assumes that commercial buildings depreciate at 2.47% per annum and industrial buildings depreciate at 3.14% per annum. This is in line with BEA estimates. 10 2.14 We also consider a broad class of depreciable assets other than commercial and industrial buildings. We refer to these assets as plant, machinery and equipment (PME) for want of a better term. While they are likely to be mainly plant, machinery and equipment, this class includes other depreciating assets as well, such as software and structures other than buildings, including dams, bridges and roadways. These assets can all be depreciated for tax purposes and are included in the PME category. 2.15 We also allow for a class of asset, zero-depreciation assets, that are assumed to neither appreciate nor depreciate in real terms. Land is an important asset in New Zealand and this zero-depreciation asset class might be thought of as 10 Treating buildings as being either commercial or industrial buildings with an economic depreciation rate of 2.69% is consistent with the approach the OECD used up until 2021. The OECD has recently updated their work to include a wider group of structures within their definition of buildings. This has led them to estimate a slightly higher average economic depreciation rate of 3.29%. Because we are continuing to use the OECD’s former approach, there is a slight inconsistency between how we define buildings and the OECD’s current definition. 14 including certain types of land. Other types of land might better be thought of as included in appreciating assets, which are also considered. 11 2.16 As in the OECD study, we allow for trading stock or inventories. Inventories are taxed on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis in New Zealand. They are assumed to be turned over at least once a year, which results in their full nominal economic income being taxed. This means the cost of capital and EMTR for inventories ends up equal to that of a very small group of PME assets that fully depreciate over their first year of life. 2.17 Some assets may appreciate in real value. We allow for appreciating assets that are expected to appreciate by 1% per annum in real terms. We assume that this gain is untaxed. 2.18 Finally, we consider investments in capital assets that can be immediately written off (or ‘expensed’). This includes investment in planting and growing a forest, mining exploration expenditure, and repairs and maintenance expenditure where this provides ongoing benefits for many years. It also includes investment by a firm in building up intangible assets if the costs of the investment can be deducted immediately, for example, as salaries and wages. Capital expenditure on many intangible assets that are created by a firm itself can be expensed, including building up good information and data, and establishing reputation and customer goodwill. 12 2.19 It should be noted that there is an important difference between the EMTRs we are calculating and the effective tax rates (ETRs) calculated in the McLeod Review. 13 T he McLeod Review assumed an underlying effective statutory tax rate equal to the company tax rate for all equity-financed corporate investments (see footnote 1 of page 139 of the Final Report). The implicit assumptions in the McLeod Review analysis are that tax depreciation for all assets reflects economic depreciation, and that either there is no inflation or tax rules are comprehensively indexed to take account of inflation. This means that some of the biases we are identifying, such as those produced when depreciation is accelerated or capital expenditure can be expensed, or those that can result from inflation, are ones that were not examined in the McLeod Review’s analysis of ETRs. Appendix 3 provides some cash flow examples which illustrate these issues. 2.20 As was noted earlier, the OECD analysis assumes that firms are financed with 35% debt and 65% equity (that is, the ratio of debt/(debt+equity) is 35%) and that the inflation rate is 1% across all the countries in their analysis. Inland Revenue data from its International Questionnaire suggests a higher book level of debt of 43.1% for foreign-controlled companies in 2020 (the most recent year for which data is available). This data excludes the banks. It also excludes a small number of firms that have negative levels of equity. Accounting information for NZX 50 firms in 2020 (excluding the two large banks included 11 Note that because land is in fixed supply, this will mean that a low EMTR for land is likely to produce little in the way of real investment distortions. It can, however, create ownership biases, with those on high marginal tax rates being attracted to investments with low EMTRs. 12 It should be noted that even for assets that depreciate extremely quickly and are fully depreciated over the year they are first used, an important difference exists between economic depreciation and expensing. An asset acquired at the end of year 0 that is subject to economic depreciation is assumed to be depreciable in year 1, whereas an asset that can be expensed is assumed to be depreciable in year 0, the year in which it is acquired. This is consistent with the OECD methodology. 13 McLeod Review. (2001). Tax Review 2001 – Final report. https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2007-11/taxreview2001-report.pdf 15 in the NZX 50, namely, ANZ and Westpac) results in a very similar estimate of 43.7%. 2.21 In examining costs of capital in New Zealand, we will often assume a debt ratio (which we denote by the symbol b) of 43%. This higher ratio will tend to reduce costs of capital and EMTRs somewhat, relative to the OECD estimates. 2.22 The OECD’s assumption of 1% per annum inflation also seems low for New Zealand, given that 2% per annum is in the middle of the Reserve Bank’s 1– 3% target range. In table A2.1 below, we consider two possible inflation rates, namely, 0% and 2%. An inflation rate of 0% is helpful in showing what would happen if economic depreciation were deductible for many assets. An inflation rate of 2% is likely to be a more realistic average inflation rate in the longer run. 2.23 Table A2.1 shows costs of capital, assuming, as in the OECD study, that non- residents require a real return of 3.0% net of New Zealand taxes on both debt and equity finance. We denote the common assumed real cost of debt and equity finance by r\* = 3%. The row labelled d denotes the economic rate of depreciation used and the row d\* denotes the tax depreciation rate allowed. We assume that tax depreciation is allowed on a diminishing value (DV) basis. In New Zealand, taxpayers are normally given an option of claiming tax depreciation on a straight-line or DV basis, with a higher rate of depreciation being allowed for those using DV. We consider PME with five different possible rates of economic and tax depreciation. Table A2.1: Costs of capital and EMTRs for companies with marginal foreign shareholders, r\* = 3%, no AIL or NRWT Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital Inflation = 0% b = 0% 4.33% 4.17% 4.17% 4.17% 4.17% 4.17% 4.17% 4.17% 3.78% 3.00% b = 100% 3.14% 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 3.00% 2.61% 2.16% b = 43% 3.82% 3.67% 3.67% 3.67% 3.67% 3.67% 3.67% 3.67% 3.28% 2.64% Inflation = 2% b = 0% 4.59% 4.93% 4.89% 4.70% 4.52% 4.39% 4.17% 4.93% 3.78% 3.00% b = 100% 2.69% 3.00% 2.97% 2.82% 2.65% 2.52% 2.24% 3.00% 1.85% 1.61% b = 43% 3.77% 4.10% 4.07% 3.89% 3.71% 3.58% 3.34% 4.10% 2.95% 2.40% EMTRs Inflation = 0% b = 0% 30.7% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 20.6% 0.0% b = 100% 4.4% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% -14.9% -38.9% b = 43% 21.4% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 18.1% 8.4% -13.7% Inflation = 2% b = 0% 34.6% 39.1% 38.7% 36.2% 33.6% 31.7% 28.0% 39.1% 20.6% 0.0% b = 100% -11.5% 0.0% -0.9% -6.5% -13.2% -19.2% -34.1% 0.0% -62.3% -86.2% b = 43% 20.4% 26.8% 26.3% 22.8% 19.2% 16.3% 10.1% 26.8% -1.8% -24.9% 16 2.24 We draw attention to the following points: • First, consider the case when there is no inflation and investment is fully equity-financed (so b = 0%). In this case, costs of capital for PME where economic depreciation is deductible, zero-depreciation assets and inventory would all be 4.17%. The fact that hurdle rates of return are the same for many assets suggests that tax settings would be treating many di fferent forms of investment neutrally. EMTRs for all these assets would be equal to 28.0%, the statutory company tax rate. • Suppose, instead, these investments were 100% debt-financed and inflation was still zero. While economic income is being fully taxed, interest expense is deductible, so costs of capital would all be equal to the real interest rate of 3.0%. EMTRs for these assets would all be zero. • If these investments were 43% debt-financed and inflation was still zero, the EMTRs for all these assets would be 18.1%. By contrast, consider commercial and industrial buildings. These would have a slightly higher EMTR of 21.4% because tax depreciation is assumed to be slightly less than economic depreciation (tax depreciation is 2% DV, whereas economic depreciation is assumed to be 2.69% DV in line with BEA estimates). By contrast, appreciating assets are tax preferred because capital gains are not being taxed. They would have an EMTR of 8.4%. Assets that can be expensed (where capital expenditure is immediately deductible rather than only being allowed as assets depreciate) would also be tax preferred. They would have a cost of capital of only 2.64% and an EMTR of -13.7%. These assets would be subsidised by the tax system. 2.25 To understand how investments that can be expensed end up with negative EMTRs, it is helpful to consider first the case of a fully equity-financed investment. If there were no company tax, the hurdle rate of return would be 3%. An investment that cost $10,000 and generated revenue of $300 per annum would be a break-even investment because this would provide the marginal foreign shareholders with the demanded 3% return on their funds. 2.26 Now consider what happens if there is a company tax rate of 28% and investments can be expensed. The same investment would now cost the company 72% of $10,000 (or $7,200) after taking account of the immediate deduction for the capital cost. The after-tax revenues would be 72% of $300 in each future year (or $216) . As costs and benefits are all reduced by 28%, this provides an after-tax return of 3% and so is still marginal on an after-tax basis. Thus, with expensing, company tax should not affect the cost of capital and the EMTR remains zero for equity-financed investment. For a fully debt-financed investment, not only does the cost of the investment and future revenues fall by 28%, but there is also a deductible interest stream. This reduces the cost of capital to 2.16% and the EMTR to -38.9%. With debt of 43%, the EMTR ends up being -13.7%. Appendix 5 provides additional cash-flow examples showing that these costs of capital and EMTRs apply to depreciating assets as well. 2.27 Now consider the impact of inflation. This will have two separate effects. 2.28 First consider a fully equity-financed investment that has a DV economic depreciation rate of 10% per annum. If the investment cost $10,000 at the end of year 0 and there was no inflation, it would be worth $9,000 (90% of $10,000) at the end of year 1, $8,100 (90% of $9,000) at the end of year 2 and so forth. Over the first year, economic depreciation of $1,000 is a true business cost and ne eds to be deductible for the company to be taxed on its economic income. Likewise, over the second year, $900 needs to be deductible, and so forth. 17 2.29 Now suppose, however, that there is 2% per annum inflation but, under New Zealand’s historical cost depreciation system, depreciation deductions are not adjusted to take account of inflation. Tax depreciation remains only $1,0 00 over the first year, $900 over the second year, and so forth, despite there being inflation. Inflation will be eroding the real value of depreciation deductions, which will tend to increase costs of capital and EMTRs. The value of money is falling by 2% per annum. To maintain the real value of depreciation deductions, the firm would need to be able to deduct $1,02 0 in the first year, $936.36 in the second year, and so forth. It is important to note that this is a problem only for depreciating assets. A zero-depreciation asset is not receiving any depreciation deductions, so the firm is missing out on nothing by not having these inflation-indexed. Thus, if investment is fully equity-financed, inflation will tend to push up costs of capital and EMTRs for investment in depreciable assets but not in zero-depreciation assets. This creates a tax bias. For assets with very low rates of economic and tax depreciation ( \*dd= ), the penalty from depreciation deductions being eroded by inflation has a much smaller effect on costs of capital than for assets with higher economic and tax depreciation rates. 2.30 For investments that are ful ly or partially debt-financed, inflation has a second effect. Firms are allowed to deduct nominal interest expense. With inflation, firms will be deducting more than their real interest expense, and this can subsidise debt-financed investment. If the real interest rate is 3% and inflation is 2%, so the nominal interest rate is approximately 5%, firms will be deducting 5% when only 3% is a true business expense. This is a balancing factor that will tend to lower costs of capital and EMTRs for partially debt-financed investments. From table A2.1 we see that if investment is fully debt-financed, costs of capital fall and EMTRs become negative for not only non-depreciating assets but also for depreciating PME with depreciation rates below 100%. 2.31 Finally, consider the impact of 2% inflation on EMTRs, as suming investment is 43% debt-financed. First, consider zero-depreciation assets. Firms with these assets are not facing any penalty from historical cost depreciation and inflation eroding depreciation deductions. In this case, the EMTR falls from 18.1% to 10.1% because of the over-deduction of interest. Similarly for appreciating assets, the EMTR falls from 8.4% to -1.8%. For assets that can be expensed, the EMTR falls from - 13.7% to -24.9%. Costs of capital and EMTRs fall for all these assets because more than the real interest cost is being deducted without any offsetting tax penalty. Inflation is not eroding the real value of depreciation deductions for these assets. By contrast, consider a depreciating asset with an economic and tax depreciation rate of 50%. The EMTR for this asset increases from 18.1% to 26.3% because the erosion of the real value of depreciation deductions has a bigger effect on the EMTR than the over-deduction of interest. Inflation tends to push up costs of capital and EMTRs for shorter-lived PME and for inventories. 2.32 Making tax depreciation rates as close as possible to economic depreciation rates would be attractive as a way of promoting neutrality in the absence of inflation. However, if the tax system is not adjusted to take account of inflation, significant biases may be introduced by relatively small levels of inflation. This is the ‘inflation bias’ issue discussed in several studies (see, for example, Auerbach (1979) or chapter 3 of the officials’ issues paper on depreciation, Inland Revenue and Treasury, (2004)). Non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), approved issuer levy (AIL), interest rates and thin capitalisation provisions 2.33 The OECD analysis does not take account of NRWT on interest or AIL. By contrast, these taxes and levies were included in the effective tax rates 18 calculated in the McLeod Review (2000). The OECD analysis also does not consider how thin capitalisation rules may modify the analysis. We begin by discussing NRWT on interest and the AIL and how these taxes/levies can affect the real interest rates that firms will need to pay. We then discuss how thin capitalisation rules may affect the analysis. 2.34 To keep the extent of the discussion manageable, we do not consider NRWT on dividends or New Zealand’s foreign investor tax credit system. Including these could sometimes lead to lower costs of capital than we analyse, but this is left for further work. 2.35 We also do not consider local authority rates in our analysis. It might be argued that these rates will also be adding to costs of capital and EMTRs and discouraging investment in real property. However, recurrent taxes on real property such as local authority rates are not normally included in international studies of costs of capital and EMTRs such as the OECD study or the work by Bazel and Mintz (2021). Some would argue that they are, at least in part, a charge levied by local authorities for the provision of public services including the provision of infrastructure as well as services such as water, sewerage and so forth. This is another issue which merits further consideration in the future. NRWT, AIL and real interest rates 2.36 In New Zealand, there are two different types of taxes/levies on interest paid to non-residents. NRWT is withheld at a rate of 10% for countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement or 15% for other countries. Most often it will be withheld at a rate of 10%, and we use this rate in our analysis. Where debt is from a related party (for example, a foreign parent company), NRWT must be withheld. However, an alternative exists when debt is from third parties. This alternative allows the borrowing firm to pay AIL at a rate of 2% in lieu of NRWT. 2.37 A difference between NRWT and AIL is that NRWT may give rise to tax credits overseas that reduce the amount of tax overseas lenders must pay on their interest income from New Zealand. By contrast, other countries do not provide their residents with tax credits for AIL. 2.38 Despite the rate of NRWT being higher than the 2% rate of AIL, it will generally be preferable for loans to be subject to NRWT if the foreign lender is able to make full use of tax credits for NRWT. However, very often foreign lenders may be non-taxpayers, in a tax loss position or unable to make full use of tax credits for other reasons. 2.39 Interest paid to third parties is most often subject to AIL, rather than NRWT, and we assume this is the case in our analysis. However, AIL could, on occasion, be waived if a New Zealand borrower thought the foreign lender would prefer NRWT to be withheld. This would lead to slightly lower costs of capital than we estimate. We assume that all related-party loans from abroad are subject to NRWT at a rate of 10% and all third-party loans from abroad are subject to AIL. 2.40 Third-party lenders are expected to require an after-tax return that provides them with the real return they could obtain from investing their money elsewhere. If there were no inflation, it would be expected that this would increase the real (and nominal) interest rate from (say) 3% to 3.06% so that, after AIL is levied, foreign lenders end up with the real return they require (3.06% = 3.00%x(1+0.02)). 2.41 With 2% inflation, AIL is levied on the full nominal interest rate. With 2% inf lation and a 3% real interest rate (and no AIL), the nominal interest rate will be 5.06%. Levying AIL at a rate of 2% a t= will raise the nominal interest rate 19 to 5.16% and the real interest rate to approximately 3.10%. 14,15 This will tend to raise costs of capital and EMTRs slightly for all firms that are partly debt- financed. 2.42 In table A2.2 below, we update the data presented in table A2.1 to consider the effects of AIL on costs of capital and EMTRs for domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders. By ‘domestic companies’ we are referring to companies that are not foreign controlled. Accordingly, NRWT on interest is not normally an issue because these firms prefer to pay AIL rather than NRWT. As in the earlier table, we assume there is a world real interest rate and a required real return on equity of 3.0% net of New Zealand taxes. We consider debt levels of 0%, 100% and 43% o nce more. Table A2.2: Costs of capital and EMTRs for domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders, r\* = 3%, AIL = 2% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital Inflation = 0% b = 0% 4.33% 4.17% 4.17% 4.17% 4.17% 4.17% 4.17% 4.17% 3.78% 3.00% b = 100% 3.20% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 2.67% 2.20% b = 43% 3.84% 3.69% 3.69% 3.69% 3.69% 3.69% 3.69% 3.69% 3.30% 2.66% Inflation = 2% b = 0% 4.59% 4.93% 4.89% 4.70% 4.52% 4.39% 4.17% 4.93% 3.78% 3.00% b = 100% 2.79% 3.10% 3.07% 2.91% 2.75% 2.61% 2.34% 3.10% 1.95% 1.68% b = 43% 3.81% 4.14% 4.11% 3.93% 3.76% 3.63% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% EMTRs Inflation = 0% b = 0% 30.7% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 28.0% 20.6% 0.0% b = 100% 6.3% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% -12.3% -36.2% b = 43% 22.0% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 9.1% -12.9% Inflation = 2% b = 0% 34.6% 39.1% 38.7% 36.2% 33.6% 31.7% 28.0% 39.1% 20.6% 0.0% b = 100% -7.6% 3.2% 2.4% -3.0% -9.2% -14.8% -28.4% 3.2% -54.0% -78.3% b = 43% 21.3% 27.6% 27.0% 23.7% 20.1% 17.3% 11.2% 27.6% -0.3% -23.3% 2.43 We draw attention to the following points: • As would be expected, AIL has no impact when investment is fully equity- financed. If b = 0%, costs of capital and EMTRs are the same as in table A2.1. 14 More precisely, with inflation at rate π , the domestic real interest rate will rise to ππ++ +(1)/ (1) aa rtt as was discussed in Appendix 1. 15 There is an exemption from AIL and NRWT for widely issued bonds. We assume the benefit of this concession is limited and that it cannot be used widely to step around AIL and negate any upward pressure on domestic interest rates. 20 • If there is no inflation, economic depreciation is deductible and investment is fully debt-financed, AIL increases EMTRs from the value of 0.0% reported in table A2.1 to 2.0%. This is, of course, just the rate at which AIL is being levied. • If we allow for 2% inflation, AIL ends up increasing EMTRs a bit more for fully debt-financed investment in assets that depreciate quickly and for inventory. For example, the EMTR for inventory rises to 3.3%. This is because AIL is levied on nominal, rather than real, interest expense. • But the general pattern of EMTRs is similar to that in table A4.1. With an average debt level of b = 43%, there are high EMTRs for short-lived PME and for inventories. There are negative EMTRs for assets that can be expensed. EMTRs fall as debt levels increase. 16 2.44 Foreign-controlled companies would normally be subject to AIL on their third- party borrowing. However, if they are partly financed by related-party debt, they will also be subject to NRWT. At one extreme, if NRWT is fully creditable abroad, there should be no increase in the real interest rate demanded on related-party lending because any higher taxes in New Zealand will lead to equal and offsetting lower taxes abroad. If, instead, NRWT is not creditable, it would be expected to push up the interest rate that borrowers must pay. The real interest rate on related-party lending would be expected to rise to 3.55%. 17 2.45 Data on firms from whom Inland Revenue collects information as part of its International Questionnaire (IQ firms) is presented in table A2.3. Table A2.3: IQ data on debt and equity Related- party interest- bearing debt Other interest- bearing debt Total interest- bearing debt Equity Debt + Equity $ billion 14.72 24.78 39.5 52.19 91.69 % of debt + equity 43.1% 56.9% 100% % of interest- bearing debt 37.3% 62.7% 100% 2.46 Table A2.3 indicates that related-party debt was 37.3%, and other debt was 62.7%, of total interest-bearing debt for the foreign-controlled firms in the IQ database. 16 These results rest on the OECD’s assumption that the real costs of debt and equity capital (net of any New Zealand taxes and adjusted for risk) are the same. One reviewer questioned whether this assumption might be creating an inconsistency as non- residents are often taxed more heavily on interest receipts than on equity returns. It could be argued that capital market equilibrium should require higher risk-adjusted returns on debt than on equity because in many countries debt is taxed more heavily than returns on equity. These sorts of issues could possibly be explored further in future work. For this LTIB, we are using the OECD’s assumption that the risk-adjusted costs of the two forms of finance are the same. We did examine a run where the required return on equity was 3.0% while the required return on debt was 3.5%, but this had very little effect on EMTRs. The broad conclusions of this appendix are unlikely to be very sensitive to the exact assumptions being made about whether costs of debt and equity are identical. 17 The real interest rate rises to \* /(1 )/ ((1 )(1 ))ππ−+ + − NNN rttt where N t is the rate of NRWT. 21 2.47 This allows us to consider how AIL and NRWT would affect costs of capital for three different types of companies with foreign marginal shareholders. In each case, we consider firms with average levels of debt: • For domestic companies that are not foreign controlled, it would increase the interest rate from 3% to 3.10% on the 43% of capital that is debt- fi nanced and subject to AIL if the inflation rate is 2% per annum. • For foreign-controlled companies that can claim credits for NRWT on interest, it would increase the average real interest rate paid to 3.06%. It leaves the interest rate paid on the 37% of debt that is related-party debt unchanged, while pushing up the cost of other debt to 3.10%. • For foreign-controlled companies that are unable to claim credits for NRWT on interest, it would increase the average interest rate paid to 3.27% by pushing up the interest rate paid on the 37% of debt that is related-party debt to 3.55%, while pushing up the cost of other debt to 3.10%. 2.48 Estimated effects on costs of capital are examined in table A2.4, assuming a world real interest rate of 3% and 2% inflation. 18 The third row shows costs of capital for companies with marginal foreign shareholders (which might or might not be foreign controlled) if there is no AIL or NRWT. The fourth row show costs of capital for domestic companies (that is, companies with marginal foreign shareholders that are not foreign controlled) when we have AIL and NRWT. The fifth row shows costs of capital for foreign-controlled companies when we have AIL and NRWT and NRWT is fully creditable. The sixth row shows costs of capital for foreign-controlled companies when we have AIL and NRWT, and NRWT is not creditable. 18 Note that EMTRs can become somewhat difficult to interpret when we start to take account of creditable taxes, such as NRWT. To see this, suppose inflation is zero and the interest rate that is required to be paid on related-party debt is 3%. In the absence of NRWT or AIL, firms borrowing from related parties abroad do so at an interest rate of 3%. Now suppose that NRWT at a rate of 10% is levied and this is fully creditable. The borrower continues to pay 3% but 0.3% goes to the New Zealand government in tax. The net cost of interest to New Zealand of this loan as a whole (taking account of the tax received by the Government) falls to 2.7%. This tax would not affect the cost of capital as the tax is fully creditable. However, depending on how EMTRs are defined, it might be thought to increase EMTRs. While it would not be affecting the cost of capital for firms, it would lower the cost of funds to New Zealand as a whole. This sort of increase in EMTR obviously can have very different welfare consequences to those from an increase in EMTRs because of increases in costs of capital. To minimise potential confusion, we do not provide tables showing EMTRs when we are working with NRWT and non-residents are able to claim credits for NRWT. 22 Table A2.4: Costs of capital for domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders and for foreign-controlled companies, r\* = 3%, inflation = 2%, debt = 43% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital No AIL or NRWT 3.77% 4.10% 4.07% 3.89% 3.71% 3.58% 3.34% 4.10% 2.95% 2.40% Domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholders AIL = 2% 3.81% 4.14% 4.11% 3.93% 3.76% 3.63% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% Foreign-controlled companies: AIL = 2% and NRWT = 10% NRWT creditable 3.80% 4.13% 4.10% 3.91% 3.74% 3.61% 3.36% 4.13% 2.97% 2.42% NRWT not creditable 3.88% 4.21% 4.18% 4.00% 3.83% 3.70% 3.45% 4.21% 3.06% 2.49% 2.49 We draw attention to the following points illustrated by table A2.4: • The third row of table A2.4 comes from table A2.1 and the fourth row comes from table A2.2. By comparing these rows, we see that AIL pushes up costs of capital but only by very small amounts for domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholders that are not foreign controlled. • By comparing the fourth and fifth rows, we see that the combination of AIL and NRWT has an even smaller effect on pushing up costs of capital for foreign-controlled companies that can claim credits for NRWT. Unlike AIL, NRWT is not increasing the cost of capital for these companies. • By comparing the fourth and sixth rows, we see that the combination of AIL and NRWT has a bigger effect on costs of capital for foreign-controlled companies that cannot make use of credits for NRWT. This is because the 10% rate of NRWT is greater than the 2% rate of AIL. • Differences in costs of capital going down the rows seem small relative to differences in costs of capital going across the rows. This suggests that tax biases between these different types of company are likely to be small relative to tax biases between different types of assets. Thin capitalisation rules 2.50 Non-residents investing into New Zealand can reduce the amount of corporate income tax they pay in New Zealand by having the subsidiary borrow from the parent and pay part of the return to the parent by way of deductible interest on a loan (rather than as a non-deductible dividend payment). Alternatively, the corporate group could lower the amount of tax it pays in New Zealand by having a New Zealand subsidiary take on a disproportionately large share of borrowing from third parties. 2.51 The thin capitalisation rules deny interest deductions if there are deemed to be excessive levels of debt in New Zealand. This can occur if both: 23 • the New Zealand group’s debt ratio (that is, debt/(debt+equity)) is greater than 110% of the group’s worldwide debt ratio, and • the New Zealand group’s debt ratio is greater than the ‘safe harbour’ of 60%. 2.52 We understand that the safe harbour test is normally the binding constraint. We assume that firms that fail to satisfy the safe harbour test are not able to use the worldwide test to qualify for a better interest deductibility result. 2.53 If borrowing is from a foreign parent company, interest payments will normally be taxed in the parent’s hands. In this case, it will often be the difference between the New Zealand company tax rate and the foreign tax rate that determines incentives for debt financing. For example, suppose $100 of additional interest is paid from a New Zealand company in tax profit to a foreign parent. This reduces the New Zealand total tax payments by $18 (income tax falls by $28 but NRWT increases by $10). Also suppose that the parent is based in a country with a 20% company tax rate that can claim credits for New Zealand tax. In this case, additional tax of $10 would be paid by the foreign parent (income tax of $20 offset by a tax credit for NRWT of $10). This suggests that incentives to thinly capitalise New Zealand operations will often arise when the New Zealand company tax rate is higher than the tax rate in the country where the foreign parent resides. 2.54 New Zealand has a relatively high company tax rate within the OECD. Therefore, it might be thought a multinational enterprise with a foreign parent would normally have a tax advantage in thinly capitalising New Zealand operations. At the same time, slightly more than 50% of foreign direct investment (FDI) into New Zealand ($66.1 billion or 50.5% of a total stock of $130.9 billion as at 31 March 2021) is from Australia. 19 The Australian company tax rate for large companies is 30%, which is slightly higher than New Zealand’s 28% company tax rate. Nonetheless, there are other factors to consider, and there can be incentives for Australian corporate parents to thinly capitalise New Zealand subsidiaries even if the Australian company tax rate is slightly higher. 2.55 Australia’s full imputation system means that many firms will want to pay tax in Australia, rather than New Zealand, because franking credits (that is, imputation credits) are available for Australian, but not foreign, taxes. Many other factors may be important as well, including whether the foreign parent or the domestic subsidiary are in a taxpaying position and whether foreign tax credits can be claimed for taxes paid in New Zealand. 2.56 One possible way of examining the effects of thin capitalisation rules on the cost of capital, which has been used in prior studies, is to assume that firms are clustered at their thin capitalisation safe harbour limits and that this determines the amount of debt they hold. 20 However, this would imply that foreign-controlled companies were all facing a debt ratio of 60%, which is considerably higher than the 43% ratio suggested by IQ data. 2.57 To examine whether there is major evidence of clustering, IQ data on debt ratios is provided in table A2.5. Firms are grouped by their debt ratio. A ratio 19 Statistics NZ National Accounts Data for the year to 31 March 2021. 20 The McLeod Review Final Report made this assumption (see Part B of Annex E, pp. 139–140) when it examined how the rules at that time could affect effective tax rates (ETRs). Note that a key difference between the ETRs being estimated by the McLeod Review and our EMTRs is that the McLeod Review assumed that income is always being taxed fully at the company level. The McLeod Review did not attempt to capture the way in which EMTRs can be affected, not only by tax rates and levels of debt finance, but also by tax depreciation rules and by inflation. These additional effects are being modelled in the OECD work and in our analysis. 24 of 0 means either no debt or a debt ratio below 1%, which is too low to register. There are 587 firms included in our sample.

It may also be misleading when thinking about policy changes. For example, relaxing the thin capitalisation safe harbour limit may have no effect on costs of capital for most firms. 2.60 At the same time, it would be good to explore the results further in future work to get a better idea of what is driving behaviour. Incentives to cluster close to the thin capitalisation threshold are obviously relevant for firms that are in a taxpaying position but not for those in a tax loss position. Also, s ome firms may be using the worldwide test rather than the thin capitalisation safe harbour test. 21 In presenting this data, we ignore a relatively small group of 40 firms with negative or zero levels of equity. 25 For these firms, an increase in the safe harbour would be likely to have no effect on costs of capital. 22 2.61 In our costs of capital estimates, rather than assuming that firms are clustered at thin capitalisation safe harbours, we normally consider firms with average debt levels of around 43% that do not face a binding thin capitalisation constraint. This understates the importance of thin capitalisation safe-harbour constraints that will be constraining debt levels for some firms. In chapter 9 of the LTIB, we discuss some international empirical evidence suggesting that thin capitalisation rules often do impact on levels of investment and on the sensitivity of investment to the company tax rate. However, we do not see an easy and consistent way of analysing the impact of this on costs of capital and EMTRs. 2.62 Different levels of debt can have a significant effect on EMTRs. In table A2.6, we estimate EMTRs for a domestic company with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders with an average debt level of 43%. We compare EMTRs for this firm to those that arise for foreign-controlled companies with a set of different possible debt levels of 0%, 43%, 60%, 75% and 100%. 2.63 In each case, we assume that interest expense is fully deductible. This is clearly the appropriate assumption if debt is 0%, 43% or 60%, as in these cases companies will be within their thin capitalisation safe-harbour thresholds. EMTRs for the higher ratios of 75% and 100% are not the EMTRs that arise under current thresholds. They show the EMTRs that would arise if the threshold were relaxed to allow interest to be fully deductible for foreign-controlled companies with these higher levels of debt. For foreign-controlled companies, we assume that 37.3% of debt is associated-party debt. We make the ‘worst case’ assumption that NRWT on interest is not creditable abroad. We also assume a world real interest rate of 3% and inflation of 2% per annum.

This means that some firms with debt ratios above 60% could possibly be within the thin capitalisation safe harbour and so clustering may be greater than is evident from the table. However, it is still likely that the majority of firms are not clustered at safe harbour limits. The data suggests that 74% of firms have debt ratios below 50%. 26 2.64 We draw attention to the following points illustrated by table A2.6: • For domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders and an average level of debt of b = 43%, EMTRs vary between 27.6% and -23.3%. • For foreign-controlled companies with the same level of debt, EMTRs are slightly higher and vary between 2 8.8% and -20.7%. The slightly higher EMTRs are the consequence of the higher tax rate for NRWT compared with AIL. • For foreign-controlled companies sitting on the thin capitalisation threshold of 60%, EMTRs would vary between 23.7% and -31.4%. They would be slightly lower than for domestic companies with average levels of debt. • Allowing higher thin capitalisation thresholds of 75% or 100% would lower EMTRs further for firms that avail themselves of these higher debt levels. This would be providing an advantage to foreign-controlled companies that are currently likely to be clustered close to the 60% safe harbour. This would not be reducing EMTRs for firms facing the highest EMTRs at present. Different real interest rate assumptions 2.65 We have seen how small amounts of inflation can create biases between different types of investment. However, throughout our analysis, we have used the OECD’s assumption of a 3% required real return on both debt and equity finance. As is discussed in appendix 4, there is some uncertainty as to the most appropriate real interest rate to assume. Higher real interest rates have been used in some other studies. In this section, we compare EMTRs for our set of assets with real interest rates of both 3% and 5%. 2.66 A higher real interest rate will tend to reduce the biases caused by inflation. The biases caused by inflation will tend to be large when inflation rates are high relative to real interest rates. Table A2.7: EMTRs for domestic companies with foreign marginal portfolio shareholders, t = 28%, debt = 43%, different values of r\* and inflation Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% r = 3% Inflation = 0% 22.0% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 9.1% -12.9% Inflation = 2% 21.3% 27.6% 27.0% 23.7% 20.1% 17.3% 11.2% 27.6% -0.3% -23.3% r = 5% Inflation = 0% 21.1% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 18.7% 13.2% -12.9% Inflation = 2% 19.9% 24.3% 23.8% 21.1% 18.8% 17.2% 14.4% 24.3% 8.3% -18.9% 2.67 We draw attention to the following points illustrated by table A2.7 • In the absence of inflation, EMTRs would be 18.7% for PME where tax depreciation is assumed to be equal to economic depreciation, zero- 27 depreciation assets and inventory. This would be true irrespective of whether the real interest rate demanded by non-residents was 3% or 5%. • A higher real interest rate assumption does not affect qualitative conclusions much. It is still the case that minor amounts of inflation can reduce the neutrality of investment decisions. It leads to increasing EMTRs on short-lived PME and inventories as well as increasing tax subsidies for investment in assets that can be expensed. • However, with a lower real interest rate of 3%, the biases caused by inflation tend to be larger. For example, both the increases in EMTRs for short-lived PME and inventory and the decreases in EMTRs for assets where capital expenditure can be expensed are larger than is true when the real interest rate is 5%. SMEs where there may be little or no shareholding by non-residents 2.68 The OECD analysis assumes that non-resident shareholders are the marginal investors into companies in New Zealand. This assumption is a key reason for the high costs of capital and EMTRs for New Zealand reported in the OECD study, as well as those reported earlier in this appendix. However, for SMEs, there is often little or no investment by non-resident shareholders. The company tax rate may have much less of an effect in driving up costs of capital for these firms than for companies where non-residents are likely to be marginal shareholders. 2.69 To analyse this case, we make use of the domestic SME model variants outlined in appendix 1. These consider incentives to invest by a domestic SME where domestic residents, rather than non-residents, are marginal shareholders. Domestic residents can invest in either interest-bearing securities or domestic SMEs, so the opportunity cost of equity investment is the after-tax interest rate that could otherwise have been earned. The domestic interest rate is being raised by AIL so that, if inflation is 2% and the world real interest rate is 3.00%, the domestic real interest rate becomes 3.10%. Domestic residents can borrow or lend at that rate. 2.70 We consider two possible variants. In the first, we assume that income is taxed each year at the marginal tax rates of shareholders. This would be the case if the company fully distributed its taxable profits each year while paying no unimputed dividends. It is assumed that the shareholder faces a marginal tax rate of 33%. We refer to this as the ‘full distribution case’. 2.71 Costs of capital and EMTRs are provided for this case in table A2.8. We consider two possible real interest rates and two possible inflation rates. As AIL is increasing the domestic real interest rate, costs of capital and EMTRs do not depend on debt levels because, whether investment is debt- or equity-financed, the opportunity cost of capital is the after-tax real interest rate. 28 Table A2.8: Costs of capital and EMTRs for domestic SMEs without foreign marginal shareholders, full distribution, m = 33%, AIL = 2% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital r\* = 3% Inflation = 0% 3.23% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 2.57% 2.05% Inflation = 2% 2.71% 3.10% 3.07% 2.88% 2.67% 2.50% 2.13% 3.10% 1.64% 1.43% r\* = 5% Inflation = 0% 5.31% 5.10% 5.10% 5.10% 5.10% 5.10% 5.10% 5.10% 4.61% 3.42% Inflation = 2% 4.71% 5.14% 5.10% 4.86% 4.63% 4.47% 4.17% 5.14% 3.68% 2.80% EMTRs r\* = 3% Inflation = 0% 7.2% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% -16.8% -46.3% Inflation = 2% -10.5% 3.2% 2.2% -4.3% -12.4% -20.0% -40.6% 3.2% -82.8% -109.9% r\* = 5% Inflation = 0% 5.9% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% -8.5% -46.3% Inflation = 2% -6.2% 2.7% 1.9% -3.0% -8.0% -11.9% -19.8% 2.7% -35.8% -78.8% 2.72 We draw attention to the following points: • In cases where economic depreciation is deductible or for inventories, EMTRs would be 2.0% in the absence of inflation. This is, of course, the rate of AIL, which would be pushing up the domestic real (and nominal) interest rate. This would be true whether the real interest rate was 3% or 5%. EMTRs would be lower for appreciating assets or assets where capital expenditure can be expensed as these are being taxed concessionally. EMTRs would be somewhat higher for commercial and industrial buildings, where it is being assumed that tax depreciation is slightly lower than economic depreciation. • Unlike the case of companies with marginal foreign shareholders, there would be no cases of very high EMTRs. With a world real interest rate of 3%, the highest EMTR is 7.2% for commercial and industrial buildings. • The impact of small amounts of inflation is similar to what we found earlier for 100% debt-financed investment by domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholders. This is because, whether investment is debt- or equity-financed, the opportunity cost of investing is the after-tax real interest rate. Inflation can increase EMTRs slightly for very short-lived PME and for inventories. Its major impact, though, is to make EMTRs more negative for concessionally taxed assets. • The negative EMTRs that arise for many assets are, to a large extent, the consequences of the impacts of inflation and an unindexed tax system in combination with the fact that some assets (such as those for which capital expenditure can be expensed) are concessionally taxed to start off with. • It should be noted that the fact that EMTRs are negative is because the (risk adjusted) cost of capital ends up being less than the real interest rate. It does not mean that those who invest their own capital in a 29 business will pay negative amounts of tax. All that it is saying is they end up paying less tax than they would if they were earning interest. Another valid question is whether the tax impost on other forms of saving such as interest-bearing securities is appropriate. 23 • Standard arguments in favour of reducing high EMTRs look weaker for domestic SMEs without foreign shareholders than for companies with marginal foreign shareholders. This is because EMTRs tend to be much lower for these firms. 2.73 In the second variant, we consider a company taxed at 28% that retains its profits indefinitely. In this case, we assume that profits are being taxed at 28% as a final tax. We refer to this as the ‘full retention case’. Table A2.9: Costs of capital and EMTRs for domestic SMEs without foreign marginal shareholders, full retention, t = 28%, AIL = 2% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital r\* = 3% Inflation = 0% 3.20% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 2.67% 2.20% Inflation = 2% 2.79% 3.10% 3.07% 2.91% 2.75% 2.61% 2.34% 3.10% 1.95% 1.68% r\* = 5% Inflation = 0% 5.27% 5.10% 5.10% 5.10% 5.10% 5.10% 5.10% 5.10% 4.71% 3.67% Inflation = 2% 4.79% 5.14% 5.10% 4.90% 4.72% 4.60% 4.38% 5.14% 3.99% 3.15% EMTRs r\* = 3% Inflation = 0% 6.3% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% -12.3% -36.2% Inflation = 2% -7.6% 3.2% 2.4% -3.0% -9.2% -14.8% -28.4% 3.2% -54.0% -78.3% r\* = 5% Inflation = 0% 5.2% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% -6.1% -36.2% Inflation = 2% -4.3% 2.7% 2.0% -2.0% -5.8% -8.7% -14.2% 2.7% -25.4% -58.7% 2.74 We draw attention to the following points: • The general structure of EMTRs is similar to the full distribution case. • In the absence of inflation, EMTRs for PME where economic depreciation is assumed to be deductible or inventories would be equal to the 2% rate of AIL. For appreciating assets or assets where capital expenditure can be expensed, EMTRs could be significantly negative. • Small amounts of inflation could make these EMTRs more negative. • Note that the case in A2.9 with full retention is the same as would be true of full distribution if shareholders were taxed at a rate of m = 28%. 23 The LTIB discusses the possibility of inflation indexation and of a dual income tax with a possibly lower flat rate of tax on capital income. Either of these might relieve tax biases not by taxing business income from SMEs more heavily but by reducing taxes on some relatively heavily taxed forms of saving. 30 APPENDIX 3 Economic depreciation and EMTRs for equity-financed and debt- financed investments 3.1 In the OECD model, assets are acquired in one year and provide a stream of cash flows starting in the next year. In reality, investments will generate streams of cash flows throughout different years, but the model is simplifying things and assuming a single cash flow each year. It seems most consistent to think of assets as being acquired at the end of an initial year, say year 0, which is why they produce no revenue in the initial year. 3.2 In the OECD model, depreciation deductions start in year 1, the year after an asset is acquired. This is slightly less generous than New Zealand tax rules. Suppose, for example, that an asset costing $10,000 is acquired in the 12 th month of an income year and qualifies for 10% DV depreciation. A depreciation deduction of 1/12 of a full year’s deduction, namely, $83.33 would be allowed in the year it is acquired. This first year allowance is ignored in the OECD model. Assuming that depreciation deductions start in year 1 allows us to model ‘economic depreciation’. Strictly, if assets provide no cash flows in the year they are acquired, they would not be expected to depreciate in that year. Any depreciation in the initial year would be accelerated. 3.3 It might be thought that assuming depreciation deductions start in the initial year could understate the generosity of depreciation deductions considerably for assets acquired earlier in an income year. For example, an asset acquired halfway through an income year would qualify for half of a full year’s depreciation in that initial year. However, a firm is also likely to be taxed in the initial income year on any earnings from that asset in that year. The OECD’s assumption of an asset being acquired in year 0, starting to earn revenue in year 1 and normally starting to claim depreciation deductions in year 1 seems reasonable as a way of analysing tax settings in New Zealand. 3.4 The cost of capital and EMTR estimates from appendix 2 can be most easily understood by considering the following four specific assets: • A zero-depreciation asset (d = 0%) that is acquired at a cost of $10,000 at the end of year 0 and provides a constant real revenue stream in each future year. • A two-period asset that is acquired at a cost of $10,000 at the end of year 0 and fully depreciates over the first year it is used (d = 100%). Thus, it provides a single positive cash flow at the end of year 1 and then expires. • A depreciating asset with an intermediate rate of DV economic depreciation, (say d = 10%). This is acquired at the end of year 0 at a cost of $10,000 and provides cash flows that decline at this constant DV rate. • An item of inventory that is acquired at the end of year 0 at a cost of $10,000 and sold one year later. 3.5 We use these examples to consider the effects of company income tax and inflation. We first consider fully equity-financed investments and then consider fully debt-financed investments. 31 Equity-financed investment, no inflation or taxes 3.6 Suppose that marginal foreign shareholders require a real return of 3% on their capital. The following would all be marginal investments: • A zero-depreciation asset earning $300 at the end of year 1 and at the end of each subsequent year. • A two-period asset that earns $10,300 at the end of year 1 and then expires. • An asset with a 10% DV economic rate of depreciation that earns $1,300 at the end of year 1 (of which $300 covers the return required on capital and $1,000 covers economic depreciation), $1,170 at the end of year 2 (which is 90% of $1,300) and cash flows in later years that decline by 10% DV in each future year. • Inventory that is sold for $10,300 at the end of year 1. Equity-financed investment, no inflation, 28% company tax rate 3.7 In all these cases, the cost of capital would rise to 4.167% = 3%/(1-0.72) and the EMTR would rise to 28%: • For a zero-depreciation asset earning $416.67 at the end of year 1 and at the end of each subsequent year, tax would be $116.67 each year (28% of $416.67) and the after-tax revenue would be $300, which leaves marginal shareholders with the return they demand. • Now consider a two-period asset that earns $10,416.67 at the end of year 1 and then expires. The firm would be able to deduct depreciation of $10,000 in year 1, so it would have taxable income of $416.67 in that year and pay $116.67 in tax, leaving marginal shareholders with the $10,300 they demand. • An asset with a 10% DV economic rate of depreciation that earns $1,416.67 at the end of year 1 of which $416.67 covers the return required on capital before tax, ($116.67 covers tax and $300 covers the return marginal shareholders require), and $1,0 00 covers economic depreciation. So long as the asset also generates $1275.00 at the end of year 2 (which is 90% of $1,416.67) and cash flows in later years decline by 10% DV in each future year, the asset would continue to be exactly cover the return required on capital and economic depreciation in each future year so it would be a marginal investment. • Inventory that is sold for $10,416.67 at the end of year 1 would be marginal. The company would be required to pay $116.67 in tax, leaving shareholders with the $10,300 they demand. 3.8 Thus, these examples show why economic depreciation would lead to EMTRs all being 28% if there was no inflation, economic depreciation was deductible for depreciating assets and there was FIFO treatment of inventories. Equity-financed investment, 2% inflation, 28% company tax rate 3.9 Here we drop the asset with the 10% DV economic rate of depreciation from the discussion because it becomes a bit more complex to analyse. However, in any event, this ends up just being an intermediate case between the zero- depreciation asset and the two-period asset. 32 • For a zero-depreciation asset earning real income of $416.67 at the end of year 1 and at the end of each subsequent year, real tax payments would be $116.67 each year (28% of $416.67) and the real after-tax revenue would be $300 at the end of each year, which leaves marginal shareholders with the return they demand. (This would require revenues that increase by 2% per annum to offset inflation. Thus, the nominal revenue in year 1 would be $425.00 (namely, $416.67x1.02), the nominal revenue in year 2 would be $433.50 (namely, $416.67x1.02x1.02) and so forth.) This asset receives no depreciation deductions and is not penalised by historical cost depreciation. Its cost of capital remains 4.167%, and its EMTR remains 28.0%. • The two-period asset, however, is penalised because depreciation deductions are not indexed for inflation. Inflation erodes the real value of the depreciation deduction. Rather than the firm being able to claim a real depreciation deduction of $10,000 in year 1, it can only claim a real depreciation deduction of $9,803.92. Because of this, the cost of capital rises to 4.9292%. If the asset generates real revenue of $10,492.92, the company will be taxed on $689.00 of real revenue ($10,492.92 minus $9803.92) and pay tax of $192.92. This will leave the $10,300 ($10,492.92 minus $192.92) of real revenue that marginal shareholders require. Because depreciation deductions are not indexed for inflation, the cost of capital increases to 4.9292% and the EMTR increases to 39.1%. There can be a material rise in EMTRs of depreciating assets with relatively fast rates of economic depreciation. • Inventories are, of course, very similar to the two-period depreciating assets. Because there are no inflation adjustments for inventories, the real deduction allowed in year 1 also falls to $9803.92, which means that the cost of capital increases to 4.9292% and the EMTR rises to 39.1%. Debt-financed investment, no inflation or taxes 3.10 Similar examples with each asset costing $10,000 at the end of year 0 can be used to consider the case where investments are fully debt-financed and where foreign lenders require a real interest rate of 3% on their loans. To keep things as simple as possible, we assume that there is no approved issuer levy or NRWT on interest so that 3% is the real interest rate that domestic firms end up paying. In the absence of inflation or tax, the costs of capital would all be 3.0% and the EMTRs would all be 0%. The examples are as follows: • For a fully debt-financed zero-depreciation asset which earns $300 at the end of each year starting in year 1, the revenue earned would match the $300 of interest that needs to be paid each year, making the investment marginal. The $10,000 cost of the investment would be financed by borrowing $10,000. As the asset is fully debt-financed and does not depreciate the loan is assumed to never be repaid. • For a two-period that earns $10,300 at the end of year 1 and then expires, the investment would once more be marginal. The cost of the investment would once more be financed by the firm borrowing $10,000. In year 1 the revenue of $10,300 would provide $300 to meet the interest payment on the loan as well as $10,000 to repay the loan. • An asset which costs $10,000 at the end year 0 which depreciates at a DV economic rate of 10% and which generates revenue of $1,300 at the end of year 1, $1,170 at the end of year 2 and so forth would be marginal. The cost of the asset could be financed by borrowing $10,000. Revenue of $1,300 would finance interest expense of $300 plus a loan repayment 33 of $1,000. As the asset has economic depreciation of $1,000 this loan repayment is keeping the investment fully debt-financed. In year 2, revenue of $1,170 would finance interest of $270 on the loan outstanding plus a repayment of $900 to match economic depreciation on the asset. The same pattern would ensure that revenue fully covers interest and loan repayments in future years making this a marginal investment. • If $10,000 is borrowed to acquire $10,000 of inventory at the end of year 0 and this is sold for $10,300 at the end of year 1, this is once more a marginal investment. The loan as well as interest on the loan can be repaid out of the revenue from selling the inventory in year 1. Debt-financed investment, no inflation, 28% company tax rate 3.11 With debt-financed investment, a company tax rate of 28% (or any other rate) would not affect the cost of capital so long as economic depreciation is deductible. In all these cases, the cost of capital would remain 3.00% and the EMTR would remain 0.0% because interest payments are deductible: • For a zero-depreciation asset earning $300 at the end of year 1 and at the end of each subsequent year, this revenue would be taxable, but interest expense of $300 would be deductible. The tax liability would be zero so this would continue to be a marginal investment. • A two-period asset that earns $10,300 at the end of year 1 and then expires would continue to be marginal. The revenue would be taxable in year 1 but this would be balanced by a deduction for interest expense of $300 as well as depreciation of $10,000. Again, there would be no tax to pay so the investment would remain marginal. • An asset with a 10% DV economic rate of depreciation that earns $1,300 at the end of year 1 would also have no tax to pay in that year. The revenue would be taxable but this would be fully offset by an interest deduction of $300 and depreciation of $10,000. In future years, taxable revenue, interest deductions and depreciation deductions would all be reduced by 10% each year leading to no tax liabilities in any future year. • Inventory that is sold for $10,300 at the end of year 1 would also be marginal. The firm could claim a deduction for the $10,000 costs as well as for $300 of interest expense in year 1 and this would balance the $10,300 of revenue generated by selling the asset. Again, there would be no tax to pay. 3.12 Thus, these examples show why economic depreciation would lead to EMTRs all being 0% for fully debt-financed investments if there is no inflation and economic depreciation is deductible for depreciating assets and there is FIFO treatment of inventories. Debt-financed investment, 2% inflation, 28% company tax rate 3.13 Here we once more drop the asset with the 10% DV economic rate of depreciation from the discussion because it becomes a bit more complex to analyse. • First consider a zero-de preciation asset. The first thing to note is that if this asset continued to provide a real revenue stream of 3%, the investment would be better than marginal. This is because while the real revenue of $300 per annum was being taxed, the firm would not only be allowed a deduction for the $300 per annum of real interest expense, it would also be allowed a deduction for the inflationary component of 34 interest as well. This means that it would benefit from a stream of net tax deductions and the cost of capital will fall below 3%. Table A2.1 reports the required real rate of return on a marginal investment is roughly 2.24% or, more accurately, is 2.2375%. To see why this is marginal, consider an investment costing $10,000 which provides a real revenue stream of $223.75 in each future year. With a real interest rate of 3% and inflation of 2%, the nominal interest cost becomes 5.06%. Thus, the firm will be able to deduct nominal interest of $506.00 which is a real deduction of $496.08 ($506.08/1.02). The company’s real taxable income will be -$272.33 (real revenue of $223.75 minus a real deduction of $496.08). This leads to tax falling by $76.25 (28% of $272.33). This tax subsidy of $76.25 exactly balances the difference between the real revenue generated and the real interest expense ($223.75 + $76.25 = $300). • Now consider the two-period asset. Table A2.1 reports that the cost of capital for this investment remains 3.00% and the EMTR remains 0.0%. This is because the overdeduction of interest expense (by allowing a deduction for the inflationary component of interest) is exactly balanced by the overtaxation of income (because depreciation deductions are not indexed for inflation). If the asset costs $10,000 at the end of year 0 and provides real revenue of $10,300 in a year’s time, the real revenue is taxable while the real depreciation deduction is only $9,803.92 ($10,000/1.02). Thus, before taking interest expense into account, the firm would be taxed on real income of $496.08 even though real income is only $300. This overtaxation of $196.08 exactly balances the overdeduction for interest of $196.08. • Under FIFO, the tax treatment is much the same as for the two-period depreciating asset. If inventory is acquired at the end of year 0 for $10,000 and sold at the end of year 1 for $10,300, the firm only gets a deduction in year 1 for $9,803.92 in real dollars. 3.14 These examples have aimed to provide some intuition for the numbers reported in Table A2.1. In the absence of inflation, EMTRs for fully equity-financed investments would all be equal to the statutory company tax rate of 28.0% so long as economic depreciation is deductible and inventory receives FIFO treatment and is turned over at least once a year. With inflation, costs of capital would increase for fully equity-financed investment in depreciating assets and inventory but not for assets which do not depreciate. 3.15 Now consider fully debt-financed investment. If there were no inflation, EMTRs would all be 0.0% for investment in depreciating assets so long as economic depreciation is deductible and for investment in inventories. With positive inflation, EMTRs will remain 0.0% for depreciating assets with an economic depreciation rate of 100% and for inventory but will fall (and become negative) for depreciating assets which depreciate less quickly. 35 APPENDIX 4 Risk and the required real rate of return net of any New Zealand taxes 4.1 In studies of investment biases, a real required return of around 5% has often been assumed. For example, Zwick and Mahon (2017) assume a nominal after- tax rate of 7%, roughly corresponding to 2% inflation and a real after-tax rate of return of 5%. In a paper setting out the OECD methodology, Hanappi (2018) chooses a real interest rate of 5% and 2% inflation to assist in making an initial version of the OECD model comparable with other studies. As we have commented, the OECD is now using a 3% real required rate of return and 1% inflation in its analysis. 4.2 Summers (1987) has argued that different cash flows should be discounted at two different rates. He argues that, while many cash flows from investments should be discounted at a high rate that incorporates a risk premium, those associated with depreciation deductions are close to riskless and should, in principle, be discounted at something close to a riskless interest rate. He reports evidence from a survey of companies that found that, in practice, most companies appear to discount interest deductions at high (much higher than riskless) interest rates. 4.3 There are also some complex issues on how to account for risk more generally. Gordon (1985) and Weisbach (2004) present models in which companies are taxed on economic profits and company tax involves a government sharing in economic profits and economic losses. In these models, any losses are assumed to be fully utilisable and able to be deducted against other profits, or the tax benefit is cashed out. Only tax on the risk-free component of the return drives up the cost of capital. However, for these models to be applicable to investment in depreciable assets, not only would any losses need to be cashed out, but taxpayers would also need to be able to make deductions for actual economic depreciation (how assets actually fall in value), rather than deductions based on depreciation schedules reflecting how they are expected to fall in value. Bulow and Summers (1984) show that basing depreciation on schedule depreciation rates can add to risk and push up the cost of capital. 4.4 There seems to be no agreed consensus on how best we should take account of all these issues. However, a widespread assumption appears to exist in practice that cash flows are discounted at interest rates considerably higher than riskless rates and that this can be reasonably modelled by incorporating a risk premium in the real return that investors demand. In our analysis, we have considered the possibility of either a 3% or a 5% real required rate of return. 36 APPENDIX 5 Marginal investments with expensing 5.1 Table A2. 1 in appendix 2 presented results from our version of the OECD company tax model showing how expensing can lead to a zero EMTR for 100% equity-financed investment and a negative EMTR for 100% debt-financed investment. This appendix provides some simple, additional cash-flow examples to explain these results for both equity-financed and debt-financed investments. As in table A2.1, we assume there is no AIL or NRWT on interest. 5.2 Suppose that non-residents demand a 3% real return on their capital, net of New Zealand taxes, and suppose there is no inflation (to keep things as simple as possible). Equity-financed investment 5.3 Consider an asset that costs $1,000 at the end of year 0 and produces revenue of $230 at the end of year 1, $224 at the end of year 2, $218 at the end of year 3, $212 at the end of year 4, $206 at the end of year 5 and then expires. 5.4 In the absence of a company tax, this would be a marginal equity-financed investment because it generates a rate of return of exactly 3%. The cost of the asset is equal to the present value of its revenues. 25 230224206 1000 1.03 1.031.03 = + ++ 5.5 Thus, the cost of capital is 3%p= , the cost of funds to the economy is 3%r= and the EMTR is (\*) /(3% 3%) / 3% 0%EMTRp rp=−=− = . 5.6 Now suppose that we have a 28% company tax rate and capital expenditure can be expensed. Suppose that the same investment is once more equity- financed. It is straightforward to see that this investment should still be marginal. 5.7 Tax reduces all costs and all revenues in the same proportion. The cost of the investment, net of the tax benefit of expensing, is $720, which is 72% of its pre-tax cost. The revenue in each future year is just 72% of the pre-tax revenue. As costs and revenues fall in the same proportion, this investment will still be marginal because 25 230(1 0.28) 224(1 0.28)206(1 0.28) 720 1.03 1.031. 03 −− − =+++ 5.8 Thus, the cost of capital will remain 3% and the EMTR will remain 0%. As is recorded in table A2.1 , for a fully equity-financed investment, the EMTR will be zero. For equity-financed investment in assets that can be expensed, the government is acting like a 28% partner in the investment. It bears 28% of the cost and reaps 28% of the benefits. Because pre- and post-tax rates of return are the same, expensing is not affecting the cost of capital for an equity- financed investment. 37 Debt-financed investment 5.9 Now consider a debt-financed investment. Once more assume that we have a 28% company tax rate. Suppose that firms can borrow at an interest rate of 3% (real and nominal) and the after-tax interest cost is 2.16% (that is, 3% x (1–0.28)). It will be a break-even investment for a firm to borrow at an interest rate of 3% to invest in an asset that earns just 2.16% if capital expenditure can be expensed, so long as the firm has profits against which it can set off any deductions. The EMTR will be -38.9% = (2.16%–3.00%)/2.16% (as was reported in table A2.1). 5.10 Suppose that an investment costs $1,000 at the end of year 0 and generates revenue of $221.60 at the end of year 1, $217.28 at the end of year 2, $212.96 at the end of year 3, $208.64 at the end of year 4, $204.32 at the end of year 5 and then expires. It is straightforward to check that this generates a 2.16% pre-tax rate of return. 5.11 To finance the investment, the company borrows $720. Together with the $280 tax saving, this finances the investment. The loan is repaid evenly at a rate of $144 per annum over the next five years. 5.12 Cash flows are provided in table A5 .1 . Table A5.1: Marginal debt-financed investment with expensing Year Capital outlay Borrowing and (repayments) Loan balance Revenue Interest Tax After-tax cash flow 0 -1,000.00 720.00 720.00 -280.00 0.00 1 (144.00) 576.00 221.60 21.60 56.00 0.00 2 (144.00) 432.00 217.28 17.28 56.00 0.00 3 (144.00) 288.00 212.96 12.96 56.00 0.00 4 (144.00) 144.00 208.64 8.64 56.00 0.00 5 (144.00) 0.00 204.32 4.32 56.00 0.00 5.13 This investment earns less than the cost of funds to the economy but is marginal on an after-tax basis. Borrowing at 3% to earn 2.16% is marginal and the EMTR is -38.9%. Just as in the equity-financed case, the firm undertaking the investment benefits from expensing. However, the firm also benefits from a stream of interest deductions in the debt-financed case. 38 APPENDIX 6 Tax changes since the 2000/01 income year and their impact on corporate costs of capital and EMTRs 6.1 There have been several tax changes to depreciation allowances, company tax rates, the thin capitalisation rules and tax incentives for R&D. All of these will have affected the levels and variability of both costs of capital and EMTRs. The aim of this appendix is to document what has happened and to estimate the impact of the various measures on costs of capital and EMTRs and how they have changed over time. 6.2 This appendix should be considered as only a first step towards examining this issue. It provides a rough estimate of the effects on costs of capital and EMTRs of some of the larger tax changes that have taken place. However, there is much that we are unable to analyse. In particular, we are unable to adequately examine the effects of changes to thin capitalisation provisions or the restricted transfer pricing rules within this framework. 6.3 Costs of capital will vary for different assets. A difficulty in attempting to estimate costs of capital is not knowing the rates of economic depreciation for the different broad groups of capital assets that make up New Zealand’s capital stock. Statistics NZ provides estimates of net capital stock for nine categories of assets: exploration; land improvements; non-residential buildings; other construction; plant, machinery and equipment (PME); residential buildings; research and development; software; and transport equipment. It is difficult to estimate how quickly broad categories of asset (like land improvements, or plant, machinery and equipment) are likely to depreciate over time. It is also difficult to estimate what tax depreciation rates will apply to these various broad categories of asset. However, this is what we need to know if we are to estimate how tax provisions have been affecting costs of capital and EMTRs over time. 6.4 Statistics NZ has provided Inland Revenue with data on consumption of fixed capital and net capital stock for what they describe as ‘market units’ in New Zealand. A market unit’s main objective is to operate in the market by selling its goods and services at competitive prices that are sufficient to generate a profit or surplus in the long term. Tax changes, such as a change in the company tax rate or a change in depreciation provisions, are likely to have a significant effect on investment by market units but much less effect on investment by non-market units. 6.5 Data from Statistics NZ is provided in table A6.1 . This can be used to provide rough estimates of economic depreciation rates for different groups of assets. The data provided in the second column shows an average over three years (2017, 2018 and 2019) of gross fixed capital consumption (GFKC) to net capital stock (NKS) at the beginning of the year. Both variables are measured in constant dollar terms. We use these ratios to estimate average rates of economic depreciation for most of Statistics NZ’s asset types where the asset type is sufficiently broad that it would seem impractical to us to estimate economic depreciation rates in any other way. There are, however, two narrower groups of assets where the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) has provided estimates of economic depreciation for what appear to be comparable assets. These two groups of assets are non-residential buildings (mainly commercial and industrial buildings) and software. 39 6.6 Our estimates of economic depreciation rates are provided in the third columns. For non-residential buildings, we use an estimate of 2.69%. For software, we use the BEA estimate of 55%. Table A6.1: Data used in estimating costs of capital Asset type Stats NZ GFKC/NKS Estimated rate of economic depreciation Assumed tax depreciation rate Weighting Exploration 7.9% 7.9% Expensed 0.8% Land improvements 5.8% 5.8% 5.8% 2.6% Non-residential buildings 3.1% 2.69% 2.0% 23.4% Other construction 3.3% 3.3% 3.3% 16.4% Plant, machinery and equipment 16.8% 16.8% 16.8% 19.9% Residential buildings 2.1% 2.1% 0.0% 24.4% Research and development 14.6% 14.6% Expensed 2.4% Software 35.4% 55.0% 50.0% 3.7% Transport equipment 19.8% 19.8% 19.8% 6.4% Total 100.0% 6.7 Assumed tax depreciation rates are provided in the fourth column. For some types of assets, it is possible to identify what the tax depreciation rate in New Zealand is likely to be. For example, exploration expenditure and R&D expenditure can normally be deducted immediately (expensed). Non-residential buildings (commercial and industrial buildings) can be depreciated at a rate of 2.0% DV. Residential buildings receive no depreciation deductions. 6.8 For other assets, we assume an ‘average tax depreciation rate’ equal to the estimated rate of economic depreciation. 24 The weightings for the different assets are provided in the fifth column. These are averages over the three-year period (2017–2019) from Statistics NZ’s net capital stock figures. 6.9 We use the economic depreciation rates and the weightings from table A6 .1 t o estimate the cost of capital for an aggregate asset that is a weighted average of the nine different types of capital asset. Tax depreciation rates in the table are used to estimate costs of capital at present. Tax depreciation rates applicable in earlier years are used to estimate costs of capital in those earlier years. In addition, we estimate how costs of capital for inventories have changed over time because of changes in the company tax rate. Tax parameters that have changed since the 2000/01 year 6.10 We allow for the following changes in tax parameters over time. 24 Note that only certain diminishing value depreciation rates are allowed for tax purposes. For example, 2%, 4% and 8% are allowed as depreciation rates, but not 3.3% or 5.8%. In reality, land improvements will be depreciated at a variety of these allowed depreciation rates. Assuming a depreciation rate of 5.8% is only a rough, on-average approximation. 40 Company tax rate 6.11 In the 2000/01 income year, the company tax rate was 33% (which it had been since the late 1980s). It was reduced to 30% from the 2008/09 income year, and then to 28% from the 2011/12 income year. Depreciation 6.12 There have been several changes to the depreciation rules. From the 2000/01 income year until the 2004/05 income year, assets could be written off under one set of depreciation rules. In addition, a 20% depreciation loading applied for qualifying assets (that is, most depreciable assets other than buildings and land improvements). Buildings could be depreciated at a rate of 4% DV. From the 2005/06 income year, depreciation rates were changed in a way that sped up depreciation deductions for most PME (especially short-lived PME) but reduced the depreciation rate on buildings. The 20% loading for qualifying assets continued. Budget 2010 announced several changes. Depreciation loading was terminated for assets acquired from 21 May 2010. This occurred in different income years for firms with different balance dates, but it applied for the majority of the 2010/11 income year for companies with a standard balance date of 31 March. In our estimates, we treat this as applying to assets acquired from the 2010/11 income year. In addition, depreciation deductions on buildings were removed with effect from the 2011/12 income year. 6.13 Depreciation deductions for non-residential buildings were restored at a rate of 2% DV from the beginning of the 2020/21 income year. Table A6.2: Tax depreciation rates Asset type 2000/01 to 2004/05 2005/06 to 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 to 2019/20 2020/21 Exploration Expensed Expensed Expensed Expensed Expensed Land improvements 5.60% 5.80% 5.80% 5.80% 5.80% Non-residential buildings 4.00% 3.00% 3.00% 0.00% 2.00% Other construction 4.00% 4.00% 3.30% 3.30% 3.30% Plant, machinery and equipment 18.60% 20.20% 16.80% 16.80% 16.80% Residential buildings 4.00% 3.00% 3.00% 0.00% 0.00% Research and development Expensed Expensed Expensed Expensed Expensed Software 47.30% 60.00% 50.00% 50.00% 50.00% Transport equipment 21.60% 23.80% 19.80% 19.80% 19.80% 6.14 Table A6 .2 shows the applicable depreciation rates at the end of the income years that relate to when the above changes were made. The figures in the last column come from table A6.1 . Currently the DV rate of depreciation allowed for plant, machinery and equipment is given by d = 2/T where T is the estimated useful life. Before the end of the 2004/05 income year, depreciation allowed was given by 1/ 1 0.135 T d= − . This allows us to estimate average depreciation 41 rates in prior years. 25 Figures reported in table A6.2 are inclusive of the 20% loading, if any. R&D tax credits 6.15 Before the 2008/09 income year, R&D could normally be expensed and there were no additional tax credits for R&D. In the 2008/09 income year, a 15% R&D tax credit was introduced, but this was repealed the following year. A 15% R&D tax credit was reintroduced in the 2019/20 income year. Thin capitalisation rules 6.16 Several changes made to the thin capitalisation rules could have affected costs of capital, and we cannot be confident about their overall effects, as has been discussed in appendix 2. Our estimates may therefore understate increases in costs of capital over time to the extent that changes to the thin capitalisation rules have pushed up costs of capital. The estimates also do not take account of other changes that are also difficult to model, such as the restricted transfer pricing rules. Other assumptions 6.17 Costs of capital can be affected not only by tax changes but also by changes in other variables, such as corporate debt levels, real interest rates or inflation. Our focus is on how changes in tax parameters have affected costs of capital. 6.18 A potential difficulty is the number of different cases that can arise for firms in slightly different positions, such as foreign-controlled companies or domestic companies. In our estimates, we focus solely on the case of a domestic company with marginal foreign shareholders. This means that costs of capital and EMTRs are impacted by AIL but not by NRWT on interest. 6.19 Costs of capital will tend to be very slightly lower for foreign-controlled companies that can make use of tax credits for NRWT and somewhat higher for foreign-controlled companies that cannot. However, as was discussed in appendix 2, differences in costs of capital between these different types of firms are unlikely to be very large. Also, changes over time in costs of capital and EMTRs are likely to be much the same for the different types of firms. Our estimates 6.20 Our estimates of the impact on costs of capital of changes to company tax rates, depreciation provisions and R&D tax credits are presented in table A6.3 . Columns 2–10 provide estimates of costs of capital over time for the nine different types of assets for which Statistics NZ provides data on net capital stock. In making these estimates, we assume a constant world real cost of debt and equity of 3% and 2% per annum inflation. As a result of New Zealand’s 2% AIL, the domestic real interest rate is 3.10%. We assume that investment is 43% debt-financed. Our estimates are for domestic companies with foreign portfolio shareholders. 6.21 The eleventh column then aggregates these costs of capital into a weighted average for the nine types of assets. The weightings for net capital stock are averages over the last three years for ‘market activities’ provided by Statistics 25 This assumes a single ‘average’ depreciation rate for each of the income periods. In practice, there were a discrete number of different depreciation rates allowed. Assets were depreciated at the closest depreciation rate for an asset with the relevant estimated useful life. 42 NZ. Restricting our data to market activities affects our estimates. For example, the estimates for residential buildings exclude owner-occupied residential housing and government assets, such as schools and hospitals, that are not employed in market activities. 6.22 Over the 20-year period, our estimates suggest there has been a slight increase – from 3.75% to 3.83% – in the weighted average cost of capital for the nine types of assets that Statistics NZ includes in its estimates of net capital stock. The weighted average rose slightly to 3.78% in 2005/06 (when depreciation rates were scaled back for buildings but increased for short-lived machinery and equipment). It dropped to 3.59% in 2008/09 (when the company tax rate was cut from 33% to 30% and the 15% R&D tax credit was introduced). It climbed back to 3.68% in 2009/10 (when the R&D tax credit was repealed) and then to 3.77% in 2010/11 (when depreciation loading was removed). Despite a further cut in the company tax rate to 28%, the weighted average increased to 4.06% in 2011/12 because of the removal of building depreciation. In the last couple of years, there has been some decline in costs of capital because of the reintroduction of an R&D tax credit and the restoration of depreciation deductions for commercial and industrial buildings. 6.23 The final column shows costs of capital for inventories. They are estimated to have fallen from 4.44% to 4.14% over this period because of the cut in the company tax rate in 2008/09 and again in 2011/12.

This is, of course, in line with the policy intent of subsidising R&D because of concerns that R&D is likely to generate positive externalities. The cost of capital for exploration is less than the 3% real assumed cost of funds to the economy because of expensing. Other investments have hurdle rates of return that exceed the 3% real cost of funds. 6.25 Not too much should be read into the exact numbers provided for the different types of assets because they depend on a reasonably tenuous method of estimating economic depreciation. This method involves dividing Statistics NZ estimates of consumption of fixed capital by net capital stock at the beginning of the year. Small changes in assumptions can have substantial effects. For example, the BEA estimates that stand-alone houses and small groups of connected dwellings with four or fewer dwellings have an economic depreciation rate of 1.14%, and that larger developments of five or more dwellings have an economic depreciation rate of 1.4%. Using either of these estimates of economic depreciation would reduce estimated costs of capital for these assets to 3.82% and 3.93% respectively. We have also not adjusted the costs of capital calculated for residential buildings for the recent denial of interest deductibility. Interest on new builds of rental property continues to be deductible. 6.26 Table A6.4 presents estimates of EMTRs, once again assuming a world real interest rate of 3%, a debt level of 43% and 2% inflation. For R&D, the cost of capital is negative in three years (see table A6.3) and the tax wedge is also negative. This leads to very high positive EMTRs, which are meaningless. If the cost of capital were to fall, the calculated EMTR would rise. In cases where costs of capital are negative, EMTRs are not reported and are recorded with the ‘\*\*\*’ symbol. 44 Table A6.4: EMTRs: r\* = 3%, inflation = 2%, b = 0.43, AIL = 2% Exploration Land improve- ments Non-res buildings Other construct PM&E Res buildings R&D Software Trans equip Wtd avge Inven- tories Weight 0.80% 2.60% 23.40% 16.40% 19.90% 24.40% 2.40% 3.70% 6.40% 2000/01 -29.02% 26.47% 17.02% 20.47% 27.15% 13.38% -29.02% 36.36% 27.88% 20.00% 32.38% 01/02 -29.02% 26.47% 17.02% 20.47% 27.15% 13.38% -29.02% 36.36% 27.88% 20.00% 32.38% 02/03 -29.02% 26.47% 17.02% 20.47% 27.15% 13.38% -29.02% 36.36% 27.88% 20.00% 32.38% 03/04 -29.02% 26.47% 17.02% 20.47% 27.15% 13.38% -29.02% 36.36% 27.88% 20.00% 32.38% 04/05 -29.02% 25.84% 17.02% 20.47% 27.15% 13.38% -29.02% 36.36% 27.88% 19.99% 32.38% 05/06 -29.02% 25.84% 20.85% 20.47% 25.02% 17.08% -29.02% 29.29% 25.30% 20.60% 32.38% 06/07 -29.02% 25.84% 20.85% 20.47% 25.02% 17.08% -29.02% 29.29% 25.30% 20.60% 32.38% 07/08 -29.02% 25.84% 20.85% 20.47% 25.02% 17.08% -29.02% 29.29% 25.30% 20.60% 32.38% 08/09 -25.50% 23.32% 18.69% 18.33% 22.52% 15.23% \*\*\* 26.55% 22.79% 16.45% 29.50% 09/10 -25.50% 23.32% 18.69% 18.33% 22.52% 15.23% -25.50% 26.55% 22.79% 18.43% 29.50% 10/11 -25.50% 23.32% 18.69% 20.83% 26.99% 15.23% -25.50% 31.75% 27.40% 20.45% 29.50% 11/12 -23.25% 21.67% 32.23% 19.32% 25.18% 28.53% -23.25% 29.77% 25.56% 26.13% 27.59% 12/13 -23.25% 21.67% 32.23% 19.32% 25.18% 28.53% -23.25% 29.77% 25.56% 26.13% 27.59% 13/14 -23.25% 21.67% 32.23% 19.32% 25.18% 28.53% -23.25% 29.77% 25.56% 26.13% 27.59% 14/15 -23.25% 21.67% 32.23% 19.32% 25.18% 28.53% -23.25% 29.77% 25.56% 26.13% 27.59% 15/16 -23.25% 21.67% 32.23% 19.32% 25.18% 28.53% -23.25% 29.77% 25.56% 26.13% 27.59% 16/17 -23.25% 21.67% 32.23% 19.32% 25.18% 28.53% -23.25% 29.77% 25.56% 26.13% 27.59% 17/18 -23.25% 21.67% 32.23% 19.32% 25.18% 28.53% -23.25% 29.77% 25.56% 26.13% 27.59% 18/19 -23.25% 21.67% 32.23% 19.32% 25.18% 28.53% -23.25% 29.77% 25.56% 26.13% 27.59% 19/20 -23.25% 21.67% 32.23% 19.32% 25.18% 28.53% \*\*\* 29.77% 25.56% 24.55% 27.59% 20/21 -23.25% 21.67% 21.30% 19.32% 25.18% 28.53% \*\*\* 29.77% 25.56% 21.72% 27.59% 45 REFERENCES Auerbach, A.J.

This long-term insights briefing (LTIB) examines how New Zealand’s tax settings are likely to affect incentives for firms to invest into New Zealand and benchmarks New Zealand’s tax settings against those in other countries. Inland Revenue consulted on the proposal to base our LTIB on this topic in August 2021. Submissions were mainly supportive of the proposal. A draft LTIB and a draft set of technical appendices were issued in February 2022. These ha ve been consulted on and seven stakeholders provided written submissions. In addition, the documents went to two international experts, Professor Jack Mintz and Professor Michael Keen, who provided written reviews of the documents. This LTIB and its accompanying technical appendices take account of comments received. 2. Compared to other OECD countries, New Zealand appears to have relatively high taxes on inbound investment. These taxes are likely to mean higher costs of capital (or hurdle rates of return) for investment into New Zealand than for investment into most other OECD countries. High taxes on inbound investment have the potential to reduce economic efficiency and be costly to New Zealanders by reducing New Zealand’s capital stock and labour productivity. OECD analysis suggests that New Zealand is an outlier with some of the highest costs of capital in the OECD. The OECD analysis focuses on company tax provisions only but a broader set of taxes that are imposed in some countries, but not in New Zealand, can also increase costs of capital. If a broader set of taxes is considered, this can moderate conclusions about how much of an outlier New Zealand is likely to be. However, even if these other taxes are taken into account, New Zealand is still likely to have high tax rates on inbound investment compared to most other OECD countries. 3. Variability in costs of capital across different types of assets or for investment into New Zealand that is financed in different ways or for different types of companies also has the potential to reduce productivity. 4. This LTIB aims to help build up an understanding of how taxes on inbound investment can combine to affect incentives to invest in New Zealand. The analysis is underpinned by modelling the costs of capital and effective marginal tax rates when taking into account the combined effects of company tax rates, depreciation provisions, special tax incentives, such as the research and development tax credit, and withholding taxes. It does so for investment that can be financed using different proportions of debt and equity. 5. The LTIB suggests that, despite New Zealand’s broad-based income tax settings, there is likely to be considerable variability in costs of capital. This variability is increased significantly by quite small levels of inflation, especially when real interest rates are low. 6. There are likely to be ongoing questions about whether New Zealand should change its business tax settings in ways that lower costs of capital and make them more neutral. Whether to lower costs of capital is a difficult issue because measures that do so will normally have a fiscal cost and may often reduce the progressivity of personal income taxes. They can also, at times, provide windfalls to those who have invested in the past or to those who would invest in New Zealand regardless of whether taxes were cut. 7. Changing the way in which businesses are taxed will always be a vexed issue. As well as the direct impact of any changes on business investment and productivity and growth, complex issues arise about how the tax system as a whole fits together and, ultimately, whether it is fair. There are important 8 questions of how to improve economic efficiency by funding government spending in ways that impose as few economic costs as possible (that is, in ways that lower the overall well-being of New Zealanders as little as possible). At the same time, there will also be important questions about whether the business tax system is fair and whether it provides a robust source of revenue to finance government spending. 8. When considering whether to change the business tax system and how best to change it if change is deemed desirable, there will always be difficult trade-offs to consider. These are likely to be ongoing issues for future governments. 9. The aim of this LTIB is to initiate a process of discussion on these sorts of issues. It considers several possible tax changes, namely: • a cut in the company tax rate • accelerated depreciation provisions • inflation indexation of the tax base • a higher thin capitalisation rule safe harbour • an allowance for corporate equity • special industry-specific or firm-specific incentives, and • a dual income tax system. 10. These measures are possible ways of lowering costs of capital and some of these can also promote tax neutrality. There is unlikely to be a single ‘best option’. Choices between the options will ultimately depend on the weightings that are given to different possible objectives of reforms. Feasible options are likely to depend on some quite difficult questions about the sorts of tax instruments that are desirable for New Zealand. 11. The analysis in this LTIB is supported by Tax, foreign investment and productivity: Technical appendices to support Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing (LTIB), (Technical appendices). 1 12. The aim of this LTIB is to start a conversation on what people see as the most important objectives for reform and whether particular reforms are worth considering further. 1 https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2022/2022-other-final-ltib 9 CHAPTER 1 Introduction • Inland Revenue is required to produce a long-term insights briefing (LTIB) at least once every three years. • This is Inland Revenue’s first LTIB. • It examines how New Zealand’s tax settings are likely to affect incentives to invest and benchmarks our tax settings against those in other countries. • Concerns have been raised for many years about New Zealand’s relatively weak economic performance and the LTIB questions whether New Zealand’s tax settings might be a contributing factor. • It examines the pros and cons of some possible reform options. 1.1 New Zealand’s poor productivity performance has been a longstanding concern. International tax reviews and the work of other agencies have often highlighted tax and its impact on investment as an important factor affecting productivity and economic performance. Despite other public sector work on productivity, no broad analysis has been undertaken of how New Zealand’s tax settings compare with those of other countries, whether the settings are likely to be having a relatively large effect on investment and/or whether this might be contributing to New Zealand’s weak productivity performance. 1.2 Questions of how best to address weak productivity and poor economic performance are complex, and there is unlikely to be a single ‘silver bullet’. Many other important productivity issues could be considered, including: • competition policy and the degree of monopoly power • migration settings and incentives for firms to invest in productivity- improving technology or to bring in cheaper labour, and • broader policy settings, which may affect the housing market and incentives to invest there. 1.3 While there are likely to be many channels through which taxes affect productivity, one that may have an important influence is tax on inbound investment. 1.4 In its August 2021 scoping paper, Inland Revenue proposed that its 2022 LTIB should focus on tax, investment and productivity. 2 Submissions received were mainly supportive of this suggestion and we proceeded with the topic. In February 2022 Inland Revenue published a draft LTIB, as well as a set of draft technical appendices. These were consulted on, and seven stakeholders provided written submissions. In addition, two reviews were commissioned from international experts. The final LTIB takes account of the feedback received. 2 Inland Revenue. (2021). Tax, investment and productivity: consultation on the scope of Inland Revenue’s long-term insights briefing. https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2021/2021- other-scope-ird-ltib-tax-liability-productivity 10 1.5 Other agencies are also looking at productivity issues in their LTIBs, for example, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s LTIB entitled The future of business for Aotearoa New Zealand. 3 Our LTIB is narrower in scope, but it aims to be complementary to, and supportive of, other work in this area. 1.6 Work on this topic has been facilitated by work at the OECD that allows us to benchmark how tax provisions are likely to be affecting costs of capital in New Zealand and in other OECD countries. Costs of capital are hurdle rates of return. New Zealand’s investment demand exceeds the pool of domestic savings of domestic residents, so we rely to a considerable extent on imported capital to fund domestic investments. For investing into New Zealand to be attractive, New Zealand investments will need to generate risk-adjusted returns net of New Zealand taxes comparable to what non-residents are able to obtain from investing in other countries. Costs of capital are the hurdle pre-tax rates of return that will make investment in New Zealand marginal, that is, just worth undertaking. These will affect inbound investment into New Zealand and the level and composition of New Zealand’s capital stock. 1.7 Analysing costs of capital is helpful when considering how different possible tax changes might affect incentives to invest in different assets financed in different ways. It is also helpful when examining the likely effects, and pros and cons, of possible future business tax changes. 1.8 The modelling in this paper is consistent with, and builds upon, many other international studies. These include the cost of capital and effective marginal tax rate (EMTR) analysis of the OECD. The EMTR is the proportion of the real pre-tax rate of return on a marginal investment that is lost in tax. For example, if a marginal investment earns a 4% real pre-tax rate of return but only earns 3% net of New Zealand taxes, its EMTR is 25% or (4% − 3%)/4%. We work with the OECD model and extend it in several ways to consider New Zealand’s tax settings. 1.9 It should be noted at the outset that any economic modelling work will be a simplification of the real world and, at most, will provide partial insights into how taxes are likely to impact on investment. The assumptions underlying the modelling are discussed further in chapter 3. 1.10 Despite its simplifications, the modelling can be helpful when considering: • whether New Zealand appears to be an outlier in how heavily it taxes inbound investment, • whether a potential case for policy change exists, and • the pros and cons of different possible policy changes. 1.11 In practice, there will be important trade-offs to consider when thinking about the pros and cons of any policy changes. If New Zealand is an outlier in its tax treatment of inbound investment, this does not necessarily mean there are compelling grounds for New Zealand to alter its tax settings. At times, New Zealand may be different from other countries in important ways, for example, in its geographical remoteness from other countries or in the set of taxes that 3 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. (2021). The future of business for Aotearoa New Zealand: an exploration of two trends influencing productivity and wellbeing – purpose-led business and the use of blockchain technology, https://www.mbie.govt.nz/dmsdocument/20250-the-future-of-business-for -aotearoa-new- zealand 11 it is willing to impose. Decisions about whether to alter tax settings will need to weigh up conflicting considerations, including not only productivity and economic efficiency but also questions about revenue adequacy and about fairness and income distribution. Decisions on whether to change current settings (and, if so, how) will depend on the weightings given to competing objectives. 1.12 These wider assessments can be informed by a variety of frameworks. One framework (used in the international economic literature and in past large-scale tax reviews in both New Zealand and in other countries) is informed by assessing options against efficiency and fairness objectives. Efficiency involves raising revenue while minimising costs to a broadly defined measure of well- being. Another framework is the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework and, related to that, He Ara Waiora. He Ara Waiora is a framework centred on a te ao Māori view of well-being. 1.13 One presentation of He Ara Waiora focusses on whether the key concepts are means (actions or processes ) or ends (ultimate objectives), although these distinctions are never absolute. The key concepts that most directly affect, or are affected by, the LTIB are mana whanake, kotahitanga, and manaakitanga. 1.14 Mana whanake is mana in the power to grow sustainable, intergenerational prosperity. Ultimately, we care about investment in New Zealand because we care about the long-term living standards of New Zealanders. We would hope that the LTIB furthers the goal of growing sustainable, intergenerational prosperity by investigating whether New Zealand’s tax settings for international investment are in our best interests. If we make positive changes to our settings over time, this will lead to economic security and the ability to create wealth for whānau Māori as well as all New Zealanders. 1.15 Kotahitanga and manaakitanga are both important concepts in any consultative process. Kotahitanga is about working in an aligned, coordinated way, and manaakitanga is about enhancing the mana of others through a process of showing proper care and respect. There have been two separate rounds of public consultation on the LTIB, but both have largely been about understanding the evidence and modelling the effects of the tax system on foreign investment. However, any future policy projects arising out of the LTIB would benefit from more engagement on how any particular policies would affect Māori and New Zealanders more widely, thereby giving effect to the principles of kotahitanga and manaakitanga. Background 1.16 Alongside the Treasury, Inland Revenue provides advice to the Ministers of Finance and of Revenue on the tax and social policies administered through the tax system. As part of providing this advice, Inland Revenue has an important stewardship role to ensure that we are well placed to advise present and future governments on tax policy issues that are likely to be of vital interest to New Zealand in the future. 1.17 Under the Public Service Act 2020, there is a new legislative requirement for public service chief executives to undertake public consultation on the topics to be included in an LTIB and on a draft of the LTIB itself. 4 This is required to happen at least once every three years. 4 See schedule 6, clauses 8 and 9 of the Public Service Act 2020. 12 1.18 LTIBs are not intended to involve advocacy for any particular policy change. Pros and cons of different policy options are to be considered, but LTIBs are not intended to push for particular policy conclusions. They are expected to look out at least ten years into the future. 1.19 The purpose of an LTIB is to make available to the public: • information about medium- and long-term trends, risks, and opportunities that affect, or may affect, New Zealand society, and • information and impartial analysis of the trends, risks and opportunities that have been identified, including policy options for responding to them. 1.20 This is Inland Revenue’s first LTIB. Key trends and issues 1.21 The scoping paper noted that, while New Zealand had a low company tax rate compared to most other OECD countries in the late 1980s, this is no longer true. Since the late 1980s, there have been two reductions in New Zealand’s company tax rate, but most other OECD countries have reduced their company rates more than New Zealand over this period. This is shown in figure 1.1. 5 Figure 1.1: Company tax rates in NZ and some other OECD countries 1.22 A potential concern is whether high taxes on inbound investment, and a high company tax rate in particular, are reducing inbound investment, productivity 5 D ata for figures 1.1 to 1.5 is available on the OECD website at https://stats.oecd.org/ Data for figure 1.1 was supplemented by some additional information for early years provided to us by the OECD but not available on their website.

The scoping paper noted that New Zealand’s lagging productivity performance has been an issue for decades, and this included periods when New Zealand’s company tax rate was relatively low as well as when it was relatively high. 1.23 The scoping paper noted that New Zealand had relatively high EMTRs on inbound investment. This evidence is discussed further in chapter 3. High EMTRs may make it harder for New Zealand firms to respond to new risks and opportunities that require investment in new activities (for example, climate change or providing important new infrastructure). 1.24 The New Zealand Productivity Commission has suggested that attracting high- quality foreign direct investment (FDI) has been used as a strategy by small, advanced economies (SAEs) to help firms export specialised, distinctive products at scale. It has also suggested that firms in successful SAEs are more internationally connected, with greater direct investment overseas (ODI). 6 The scoping paper pointed out that New Zealand’s FDI was not growing as quickly as that of most other OECD countries and New Zealand’s ODI performance looked particularly weak. This is shown in figures 1.2 and 1.3. Figure 1.2: FDI as a percentage of GDP 7 6 New Zealand Productivity Commission, 2021, ‘Cut to the chase: New Zealand firms: reaching for the frontier’, April. 7 Data for figures 1.2 and 1.3 is accessed though links to Globalisation>FDI statistics according to benchmark definition 4 th edition (BMD4)>FDI positions – as a share of GDP on https://stats.oecd.org/ 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 20052006200720082009201020112012201320142015201620172018201920202021 Foreign Direct Investment as a Percentage of GDP (%) AustraliaNew ZealandUnited Kingdom United StatesOECD weighted average 14 Figure 1.3: ODI as a percentage of GDP 1.25 This LTIB focuses on taxes on inbound investment that may affect FDI performance, as in figure 1.2. It has not been possible to consider the potential impact of tax settings on ODI in the time available. New Zealand’s very low levels of ODI have continued despite a major tax policy change for income years starting on or after 1 July 2009. At that time, New Zealand changed its tax rules on outbound investment to exempt the active income of controlled foreign corporations, making the rules much more like those of many other countries. While this might have been expected to encourage ODI, there is no evidence of a strong positive response in the data. 1.26 A submission on the draft LTIB by Strategic Tax Management expressed concerns that ODI was not being considered in the LTIB work. It suggested tax settings for ODI might be reducing the attractiveness of NZ as a place to base MNEs. In the longer run, it would be good to examine how tax settings are likely to be affecting outbound as well as inbound investment, but we have not been able to do that as part of the current LTIB exercise. 1.27 The Productivity Commission has suggested that high-quality FDI can provide spillover benefits for New Zealand. At the same time, it points out that the same benefits may be produced by having large domestic exporting firms and that not all FDI is what they would deem to be “high quality”. 8 1.28 This raises the question of whether we should focus on FDI or broader measures of investment that can add to New Zealand’s capital stock, including foreign portfolio investment (FPI) as well as FDI. This is explored in chapter 2. Broader measures of investment may make New Zealand’s investment performance look less mediocre. One of the external reviewers pointed to a series that the OECD has put together on corporate investment as a share of GDP. 8 See the discussion in New Zealand Productivity Commission, 2021, ‘New Zealand firms: reaching for the frontier’, April, page 84. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 2005200620072008200920102011201220132014201520162017201820192020 Overseas Direct Investment as a Percentage of GDP (%) AustraliaNew ZealandUnited Kingdom United StatesOECD weighted average 15 1.29 Results for Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and OECD countries are provided in Figure 1.4 below. These results suggest that, since 2001, corporate net investment (corporate gross fixed capital formation minus consumption of fixed capital) as a percentage of GDP has been higher in New Zealand than in the United States, the UK or the OECD as a whole. Since 2015 corporate net investment as a percentage of GDP has also been higher in New Zealand than Australia. Thus, despite New Zealand’s low stock of FDI and despite the fact that this is not increasing rapidly, New Zealand appears to have high levels of corporate net investment. Aggregate corporate investment can increase if companies raise funds domestically or use FPI to finance investment. Conversely, FDI will increase if a foreign company increases its ownership of domestic businesses without this necessarily enlarging New Zealand’s aggregate capital stock. Thus, low FDI as a percentage of GDP does not mean that New Zealand is necessarily doing poorly on aggregate corporate investment. Figure 1.4 Company net investment as a share of GDP 9 1.30 Nevertheless, over an extended period, New Zealand’s performance on real GDP per capita and productivity has been weak. The scoping paper discussed New Zealand’s economic performance relative to the USA in real GDP per capita and labour productivity. Real GDP per capita fell in New Zealand relative to the United States until about 1992, when it seemed to stabilise for a period. There has been some small sign of recovery since then. 10 However, as the scoping paper discusses, New Zealand’s labour productivity performance looks worse 9 Data for figure 1.4 is from https://stats.oecd.org/, National accounts>Annual national accounts>Detailed tables and simplified accounts. 10 In Productivity by the numbers, May 2021, page 21, http://www.productivity.govt.nz/research/productivity-by-the-numbers/ , the New Zealand Productivity Commission provides a longer time series using Conference Board Total Economy Data. This suggests New Zealand’s GDP per capital declined from 101% to 67% of that in the United States over the period from 1950 to 2019. -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 20002002200420062008201020122014201620182020 Net Fixed Capital Formation to GDP (%) Series1Series2Series3Series4Series5Series6 16 than its real GDP per capita performance. New Zealand’s level of labour productivity is now about 61% of that of the United States. This is lower than it was in throughout the 1990s despite the growth in real GDP per capita since that time. 11 Fi gure 1.5: Real GDP per capita relative to the US 1.31 Many other issues may be more crucial for economic performance than tax policy settings, but an important question is whether New Zealand’s current settings are likely to be having a material adverse impact and whether there are ways of improving our tax settings. Feedback received on the scoping paper 1.32 Our scoping paper suggested that our LTIB focus on tax, investment and productivity. We received feedback from eight individuals and groups. Most supported tax investment and productivity as a topic for our LTIB. At the same time, several concerns and qualifications were raised. 1.33 Four of the submissions discussed capital gains tax or productivity concerns arising from the light taxation of property. Two of these suggested that under- taxation of sectors that benefit from tax exempt capital gains may be a bigger issue than the impact of high tax rates on inbound investment reducing productivity. A third submission was concerned that the absence of a capital gains tax was reducing the coherence of the tax system. The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) has advised that LTIBs should not focus on issues that have already been subject to considerable analysis. Capital gains tax was considered by the recent Tax Working Group and the Government 11 These figures and data for figure 1.5 is from https://stats.oecd.org/, Productivity > Productivity and ULC – Annual total economy > Level of GDP per capita and productivity. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 19701975198019851990199520002005201020152020 GDP Per Capita Relative to US GDP Per Capita (%) AustraliaNew ZealandUnited Kingdom United StatesOECD unweighted averageOECD weighted average 17 decided against a general tax on capital gains. Therefore, we are not making a capital gains tax on property or a more general tax on capital gains a central focus because it has been the subject of recent debate and policy consideration. 1.34 A fourth submission commented that the OECD cost of capital and EMTR benchmarking analysis ignores taxes on capital gains. The submission was concerned that this may make New Zealand look relatively worse than is true. New Zealand’s lack of a tax on capital gains could be an advantage of investing in New Zealand, relative to most other countries, when gains are realised through sales of assets such as buildings or goodwill. 1.35 Most submissions raised other important factors that could affect investment that were not included in the OECD benchmarking analysis. As well as the desirability of coherence in tax settings, concerns were expressed about overly complex legislation, high compliance costs, and a lack of certainty and predictability adding to the costs and risk of investing in New Zealand. Concerns were also expressed that, for a small country like New Zealand, there may often be relatively small benefits to non-resident firms from investing in the country. Small levels of other costs and uncertainties may make it unattractive for firms to investigate whether investing in New Zealand is likely to be beneficial. 1.36 Several of the submissions pointed out that other factors may be as, or even more, important than taxes on inbound investment in affecting decisions about investment in New Zealand. Issues pointed to included comparative advantage, the underlying profitability of investments, and other regulatory issues, such as Overseas Investment Office criteria. 1.37 Two submissions discussed our company tax full imputation scheme and questioned whether it was desirable to continue with an imputation system. One of these submissions pointed to the prevalence of ‘classical’ company tax systems overseas – where profits are taxed at the company level and then taxed a second time when dividends are paid to shareholders. A third submission appeared to be pushing in the opposite direction. It raised concerns about differences in tax settings between different entities. These are substantial economic issues, and it has not been possible to consider them in this LTIB. 1.38 Two submissions argued that personal taxes should be taken into account when considering incentives to invest for small and medium enterprises. Even if small and medium enterprises operate as companies, profits will be subject to personal tax when distributed as dividends. We discuss how the OECD modelling might be extended to these sorts of enterprise in chapter 4. 1.39 Two submissions discussed environmental taxes. An increase in measured economic performance, such as growth in GDP or labour productivity, may be unattractive if it is accompanied by environmental degradation. This is important and underlines the partial nature of cost of capital and EMTR studies. We do not see any real conflict between this observation and the analysis in this LTIB. Normally, neutrality of tax settings is seen as a plus. However, as the submissions have pointed out, tax neutrality may not be desirable in specific instances where there are negative or positive externalities (spillover costs or benefits to other firms or individuals). In those circumstances, there might be a case for either higher or lower levels of tax on specific investments. Externalities need to be taken into account when assessing economic efficiency. One of the submissions argued that, for use of non-neutral taxes to be justified, there needs to be clear evidence of market failure and for tax instruments to be the best way of addressing externalities. The submissions also pointed out that environmental taxes could be a way of raising revenue, as well as correcting for market failures. 18 1.40 Two of the submissions argued that New Zealand had been served well by its broad-based low-rate tax settings, and that this suggests a high burden of proof is necessary before moving away from these settings. However, two of the submissions commented favourably on specific tax concessions that had been made available in other countries. Feedback received on the draft LTIB 1.41 Our draft LTIB and a set of technical appendices were published in February 2022. We commissioned two external reviews on these papers by Professor Jack Mintz and Professor Michael Keen. 12 We also consulted with stakeholders on the two papers and received written submissions from seven individuals and groups. 13 This final LTIB takes account of feedback received. 1.42 Both external reviewers were positive about the analysis and the discussion of the various options in the draft LTIB but questioned the heavy focus on the OECD’s benchmarking exercise. Both suggested that a broader set of comparisons can be helpful when benchmarking costs of capital and EMTRs. This is also useful in spotlighting some of the uncertainties in these benchmarking exercises. 1.43 The OECD estimates suggest that New Zealand is an outlier with very high costs of capital and EMTRs compared with most other OECD countries. The reviewers pointed to other analysis that suggests New Zealand is less of an outlier. The OECD analysis only considers company tax provisions. Other taxes may also impact on costs of capital and EMTRs and including these other taxes may make New Zealand less of an outlier than the OECD analysis is suggesting. However, it is still likely to be true that New Zealand has high costs of capital and EMTRs relative to most OECD countries. Both reviewers also suggested that there should be some additional focus on the OECD’s Pillar 2 tax changes. This was also suggested in written submissions. 1.44 One reviewer questioned whether there should be more focus on aggregate investment than on FDI. He also raised questions about whether international financial arbitrage may lead to more complex outcomes than was picked up in our analysis and pointed out that a statement in the chapter on indexation was misleading. The draft LTIB raised questions about the viability of inflation indexing interest income and expense and stated that no OECD countries had comprehensive indexation provisions. This may have led stakeholders to be unduly dismissive of comprehensive indexation as an option. The reviewer pointed out that both Mexico and Chile have broad indexation measures that extend to indexing interest income and expense. 1.45 The other reviewer questioned why there had not been more focus on average effective tax rates (AETRs) in addition to EMTRs. He also suggested that some of the options should be considered as policy alternatives rather than measures that might be introduced alongside each other. 1.46 The written submissions echoed concerns that had been raised in submissions on the August 2021 scoping paper. Some submissions commented on the 12 Professor Jack Mintz is President’s Fellow, School of Public Policy, University of Calgary and Professor Michael Keen is currently at Tokyo College, University of Tokyo and prior to that was Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the IMF. Both are leading international experts on the economics of tax policy. 13 https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2022/2022-ir-draft-ltib-submissions-external- reviews 19 potential for uncertainty and any unique or distinct application of international rules in New Zealand to discourage inbound investment. They also commented that differences in settings could lead to uncertainty or the potential for double taxation (taxation of the same income in both New Zealand and another country). 1.47 Some submissions expressed concerns that the draft LTIB did not come out with definitive conclusions on the impacts of the various options on inbound investment. There is some discussion of estimates from the economic literature on how changes in costs of capital and EMTRs can impact on investment in chapter 2. A critical first step is obtaining better estimates of how taxes are likely to impact costs of capital and EMTRs. But uncertainties remain about how big effects are likely to be. Some expressed concerns that the draft LTIB did not suggest a programme of future tax policy changes. However, the aim of an LTIB is not to advocate for any particular direction of policy change, let alone to tie future governments’ hands to such a programme. Instead, the aim is to explore pros and cons of different options as neutrally as possible. Some concerns were expressed about the analysis being too narrow because of the focus on economic efficiency and fairness rather than a broader living standards framework. This is discussed further in chapter 2. When analysing the economic efficiency of taxes, economists are attempting to take into account any costs that may affect living standards. 1.48 The written submissions did not reach any consensus on preferred directions for future policy. For example, the Chartered Accountants of Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) questioned whether any of the options were likely to be feasible. It expressed concerns about measures that might move away from a broad-based, low-rate (BBLR) approach to tax policy. Of all the options, it considered a dual income tax the most feasible but thought this was unlikely to be possible in the short to medium term because it is likely to require a tax on capital gains. Business New Zealand (Business NZ) also expressed support for a BBLR framework but considered a cut in the company tax rate as their top priority, with accelerated depreciation provisions or looser thin capitalisation provisions worth considering. They expressed strong opposition to specific tax incentives. The Corporate Taxpayers Group argued that it was an urgent priority to reduce costs of capital and expressed broad support for measures that did this, including specific tax incentives. 1.49 If future governments do wish to make tax changes to reduce costs of capital and make these more neutral, there are likely to be ongoing debates about the best possible direction of reforms. 1.50 Some further specific issues were raised in specific submissions. One submission suggested that it might be useful to provide additional cash-flow examples of how tax provisions can affect costs of capital and EMTRs. This is picked up on in the Technical appendices. Another submitter thought that the LTIB did not go far enough in considering alternatives to a BBLR approach. Outline of the LTIB 1.51 The content of the LTIB is as follows. Chapter 2 discusses a framework for examining taxes on inbound investment and whether changes in tax settings are likely to be in New Zealand’s best interests. Chapter 3 provides estimates from the OECD benchmarking analysis of costs of capital or hurdle rates and EMTRs in New Zealand against those for other countries. These suggest that New Zealand is an outlier with very high costs of capital and EMTRs compared with most other OECD countries. We also discuss other analysis that suggests that, while New Zealand has higher EMTRs than most OECD countries , it may 20 be less of an outlier. Chapter 4 extends the OECD analysis in several ways to examine costs of capital and EMTRs in New Zealand for a broader set of assets and a broader set of taxes. This analysis is supplemented by a set of technical appendices that are available on the tax policy website. 14 1.52 The subsequent chapters examine the pros and cons of different ways of reducing costs of capital. Some of these ways can also help in making tax settings more neutral. Chapter 5 provides an overview of the different policy options that are considered. While these are meant to cover the most likely options to be put forward, the list is far from exhaustive. Chapter 6 examines a cut in the company tax rate. Chapter 7 examines two accelerated depreciation measures: a depreciation loading for assets, and a system of partial expensing. Chapter 8 considers the possibility of indexing the income tax base for inflation so that taxpayers would no longer be taxed on inflationary gains and could no longer deduct inflationary losses. Chapter 9 discusses the possibility of loosening the current thin capitalisation rules by allowing a higher safe harbour threshold. Chapter 10 explores the possibility of an allowance for corporate equity. Chapter 11 discusses the possibility of specific incentives for different types of business. Finally, chapter 12 considers the possibility of a more fundamental shift towards a dual income tax system. 14 Inland Revenue. (2022).

Introduction 2.1 New Zealand’s tax policy settings will affect incentives for non-residents to invest in New Zealand. They will impact on costs of capital (that is, the real pre- tax rates of return that investments in New Zealand need to generate to be attractive on an after-tax basis). 2.2 New Zealand depends on capital inflows for its economic development and performance. Inbound investment can generate growth in New Zealand’s capital stock, and with a greater capital stock, labour will tend to become more productive. 2.3 Some submitters asked how efficiency and productivity relate to living standards. If taxes have adverse effects on productivity, this can mean that less income is produced in New Zealand with the same inputs. For example, this can mean that New Zealanders earn their incomes either by working longer and having less time to spend with friends and family or on other pursuits. Efficiency costs represent the multi-faceted ways that taxes may reduce well- being that are over and above the amount of tax collected to finance government spending. 2.4 A greater capital stock can support higher wage rates in New Zealand, which means higher incomes for New Zealanders. This will make it more attractive for people to choose to live in New Zealand. Incomes are one of the key determinants of living standards. 22 2.5 Inbound investment could also support productivity and growth through transferring technology, building management expertise and broader business knowhow, and raising the skills and knowledge of the New Zealand workforce. In addition, inbound investment might provide access to international production chains and markets. 2.6 Company tax is the main tax on inbound investment income. Company tax settings may have important impacts on inbound investment and the efficiency and effectiveness of New Zealand’s tax settings more broadly. 2.7 Later chapters examine, and extend, work by the OECD on how taxes on inbound investment income can impact on costs of capital and effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs). They look at the pros and cons of some different possible tax policy changes. This chapter discusses an economic framework and some empirical evidence that can be helpful in thinking through the likely welfare consequences of taxes on inbound investment. 2.8 We start by presenting a simple economic model, with a single type of capital inflow and a single type of investment, that economists have used to start to examine these sorts of issues. We explain why this model suggests that high taxes on inbound investment into New Zealand can be undesirable. We then discuss a broader range of capital inflows and forms of investment and consider how non-neutral settings can reduce productivity and economic performance. Gains in productivity and economic performance from reducing high EMTRs and making these more neutral will ultimately depend on the responsiveness of investment to tax settings. We complete this chapter by discussing international evidence on how large the effects on investment are likely to be of any reductions in costs of capital and EMTRs. 2.9 Much of the analysis in this chapter has been discussed in other tax reviews, including the Tax Review 2001 (chaired by Sir Robert McLeod and commonly referred to as the McLeod Review) 15 and New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment, Inland Revenue and Treasury (2016). 16 The chapter draws on this analysis. The effects of source-based taxes on inbound investment income in a small open economy – a simple model 2.10 New Zealand imposes company tax and other taxes on non-residents on income sourced from New Zealand, and this is often referred to as a source-based income tax. Tax is also imposed on New Zealand residents when they earn income from New Zealand or foreign countries. This is often referred to as a residence-based income tax. New Zealand’s tax settings comprise elements of both source-basis and residence-basis taxation. 2.11 A key question is whether it is in the best interests of a small open economy (SOE) to impose source-based income taxes on the income that non-residents earn from investment in the SOE. 2.12 A standard simple economic model considers an SOE importing a single type of capital. Under the standard SOE assumption, an SOE like New Zealand faces a perfectly elastic supply of capital. This means New Zealand can import as much 15 McLeod Review. (2001). Tax Review 2001, Final Report. https://www.treasury.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2007-11/taxreview2001-report.pdf 16 Inland Revenue and Treasury (2016). New Zealand’s taxation framework for inbound investment. https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2016/2016-other-nz-framework-inbound- investment 23 capital as it wants without affecting the returns that foreigners demand (net of any New Zealand taxes) for supplying their capital to New Zealand. In the model, investment is assumed to take place until additional investment is earning only marginal (or break-even) returns. 2.13 To provide non-residents with the returns they demand, investments need to generate a rate of return that is at least as good as what could be achieved if the non-residents supplied their capital to other countries. Economic rents are returns in excess of the return that non-residents demand on their funds. If there are no economic rents, the implication of this model is that there should be no taxes imposed on inbound investment, except to the extent that taxes imposed in the SOE are creditable abroad (that is, taxes overseas are reduced dollar for dollar as a result of tax being paid in New Zealand). This is because it is likely to be a particularly inefficient backdoor way of taxing domestic residents. Any tax imposed will be passed on to other domestic factors of production, such as land and labour, but in a manner that is less efficient than taxing those factors directly. 2.14 The logic behind this model can be most easily seen if we think of debt as being the single form of capital and lending to New Zealand being no more or less risky than lending to other countries. If New Zealand is a net capital importer importing debt from the rest of the world, it must offer an interest rate that non-resident lenders are willing to accept. Suppose we tax interest payments to non-residents. Unless non-residents can claim credits for these taxes (which reduces the amount of tax they pay overseas on this income), the pre-tax interest rate will need to rise until the net-of -NZ-tax interest rate is the same as what the non-resident can obtain from lending to other countries. Thus, the economic incidence of this tax will be borne by domestic borrowers rather than foreign lenders. 2.15 Much the same story will apply if the single form of capital were equity. A source-based company tax is likely to push up hurdle rates of return until foreign equity investors are earning comparable risk-adjusted returns to what they can obtain elsewhere. If there are no economic rents, the tax will not be borne by non-residents because they will never be willing to accept less than the marginal rate of return that they can obtain from investing in other countries. Instead, hurdle rates of return will need to rise, which will mean less capital stock, a less productive labour force and lower wages. The tax will fall on New Zealanders rather than non-residents. 2.16 With equity-financed investment there are some additional issues to consider. Risk and uncertainty will complicate the story because different non-resident suppliers of capital will generally have different views about what the returns on an investment are likely to be. This may make the supply of capital less than perfectly elastic. However, it might still be expected that taxes in New Zealand will largely drive up the pre-tax rates of return that investments are required to generate to provide the returns (net of any New Zealand tax) that non- residents demand on their funds. 2.17 If there are no economic rents and the supply of capital is perfectly elastic, the implication of this model is that, except to the extent that taxes imposed in the SOE are creditable abroad, there should be no source-based taxes imposed on inbound investment income. If there are location-specific economic rents (that is, profits above a global hurdle rate of return that can be earned by businesses that need to be operating in the SOE to obtain the rents), there is a case for taxing these at high rates while still attempting to tax marginal investments at a rate that is as low as possible. 24 2.18 This model is discussed in Gordon and Hines (2002), who conclude the burden of a source-based tax on marginal investments will be borne entirely by labour or other fixed factors. A labour income tax would reduce the net wage rate, and this would create some labour market distortions. The key point, however, is that these distortions would also be created by a tax on inbound investments that reduces capital stock and makes labour less productive. However, while a source-based tax also distorts investment decisions, a labour income tax does not. Gordon and Hines argue that a strong conclusion about tax policy in an open economy setting is that a source-based tax on capital income should not be used since it is dominated by a labour income tax (Gordon and Hines, 2002, pp. 1939-1940). 2.19 Thus, in this model, source-based taxes that drive up the cost of capital are always undesirable because they burden New Zealanders more than necessary for the tax amount being collected. 2.20 This analysis provides some arguments against source-based taxes on marginal investment into an SOE like New Zealand. However, there are several balancing considerations that push against abandoning source-based taxes altogether. 2.21 SOEs have not completely removed source-based taxes (although, as will be discussed in chapter 3, many other countries have lower source-based taxes than New Zealand). In particular: • Economic rents (profits above a global minimum hurdle rate) may sometimes be substantial, and the burden of taxes on these rents may often be borne by foreign investors. • While the supply of capital is likely to be very elastic, it may be less than perfectly elastic, and this may allow some of the burden of taxes to be borne by foreign investors. • Reducing tax on both sunk investments and land would provide windfall gains to existing owners of firms with these assets where the firms had undertaken the investment in the expectation that future returns would be taxed. Replacing this revenue source is likely to impose burdens on New Zealanders. • Foreign tax credits for taxes paid in New Zealand may be available overseas, especially non-resident withholding taxes (NRWT). • When taxes are borne by foreign investors, it allows New Zealanders to pay lower taxes. To give tax cuts where a substantial benefit flows to non- residents may be costly to New Zealanders. • In later chapters we look at some other ways of taxing economic rents. The analysis suggests that if we could find sensible and efficient ways of taxing economic rents and if we could restrict the benefits of source-based tax cuts to new investment only, high source-based taxes on inbound investment would be reducing economic efficiency and there would be a case for reducing these taxes. 2.22 There are, however, also some important fairness issues to consider. Company tax has a dual role in New Zealand. Not only is it the most important source- based tax on the income of non-residents, but it is also an important source of revenue and an important way of supporting the progressivity and integrity of 25 personal income taxation. 17 Without a company tax, it would be much easier for those with high income and wealth to earn their income through companies and minimise the tax they paid. Thus, company tax is important in maintaining the integrity and coherence of the personal tax system. 2.23 For example, Inland Revenue data on a set of high-wealth individuals (HWIs) in 2018 suggests that, of their total tax paid both directly and through entities, only 8% is taxed at personal rates, with 21% taxed at the trustee tax rate and 71% taxed at the company rate. 18 A zero company tax rate would create considerable scope for some HWIs to pay little or no tax until profits accumulating in companies are eventually paid to shareholders as dividends. 2.24 A balancing consideration is that lowering the company tax rate would reduce incentives for multinational companies to shift profits away from New Zealand through transfer pricing or thinly capitalising their New Zealand subsidiaries. 2.25 McKeehan and Zodrow (2017) provide a formal model that attempts to trade off the different pros and cons of cutting source-based taxes in an SOE. Different types of capital inflows and different costs of capital 2.26 The simple model outlined above assumed a single type of capital inflow and a single type of investment. In practice, source-based taxes may affect: • both foreign direct investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) (passive portfolio holdings of New Zealand debt and equity securities by overseas investors) • how firms are financed, for example, with debt or equity, and • the sorts of assets that are acquired (for example, buildings, machinery and equipment, inventories or intangible assets). FDI or FPI 2.27 The simple model outlined above makes no distinction between FDI and FPI. However, as the McLeod Review discusses, there may be some important differences. For example, there could be important productivity spillovers from FDI that may make FDI a more powerful way of promoting productivity and growth than FPI. By itself, this might be a reason for considering lower source- based taxes on FDI than on FPI. At the same time, economic rents are likely to be more of an issue for FDI than for FPI, which might be a reason for having a higher tax rate on FDI than on FPI. Debt and equity 2.28 Costs of capital and EMTRs are likely to be much higher for equity-financed investment into New Zealand than for debt-financed investment because 17 For the year to June 2021, net corporate tax revenue (inclusive of NRWT) was $18,405 million. This amounted to 16.6 percent of total tax of $110,753 million. See Tax Outturn Data - June 2021, https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/tax-outturn-data/tax-outturn-data-june- 2021. I nland Revenue data reveals that roughly one-third of net corporate tax revenue is from foreign controlled companies. 18 These estimates have been updated and corrected from those provided in the draft LTIB. They are calculated assuming that imputation credits claimed by HWI individuals and trusts are in respect of dividends from companies owned and controlled by the HWIs. Company tax payments which lead to these imputation credits are treated as part of personal or trustee taxation. 26 interest is a deductible expense, whereas dividends are not. We see in later chapters that, while New Zealand has relatively high costs of capital and EMTRs compared to most OECD countries, there will be instances where investments are being subsidised by the tax system and EMTRs are negative. The same model that suggests source-based taxes on inbound investment are particularly inefficient would suggest that source-based subsidies to inbound investment are also particularly inefficient – unless the subsidies are justified by important productivity spillovers or perhaps assist in supporting broader measures of well- being. The subsidies would benefit domestic factors, such as labour, but in a less efficient way than if these factors were subsidised directly. 2.29 Some measures that may reduce source-based taxes, such as a reduction in the company tax rate, would also reduce differences between equity-financed and debt-financed investment. Other measures, such as accelerated depreciation, would reduce costs of capital and EMTRs without reducing the distortions between these different ways of financing investment. Types of asset 2.30 The OECD benchmarking exercise, as well as other analysis, has suggested that New Zealand has relatively high costs of capital and EMTRs on average. At the same time, we find that costs of capital and EMTRs differ between investment in different assets and differences can be substantial. For some assets, such as investment in intangible assets, there can often be an element of subsidy if investments are partially debt financed. Tax neutrality 2.31 The neutrality of tax settings is an important consideration. Suppose that investment funds can be attracted at a real cost of 3% to New Zealand (net of any New Zealand taxes). Also suppose that a non-neutral tax system means that investment in one type of asset (type 1 assets) initially has a cost of capital or hurdle rate of return of 5% because it faces a relatively heavy tax impost. Investment in a second type of asset (type 2 assets) has a cost of capital of 2% because it faces a much more favourable tax impost. Suppose we change the tax rules so that the cost of capital for both types of assets becomes 3.5%. This will increase investment in type 1 assets and reduce investment in type 2 assets. New Zealand will gain type 1 assets earning pre-tax rates of return of between 5% and 3.5% while losing type 2 assets earning between 2% and 3.5%. This will mean gaining higher-returning investments while losing lower- returning investments. Economic efficiency and the productivity of New Zealand’s capital stock will tend to increase. 2.32 Likewise, greater neutrality in the tax treatment of debt and equity inflows is also likely to promote economic efficiency and productivity by causing more productive investments to displace those with lower productivity. How important are source-based taxes likely to be in determining FDI and broader levels of capital stock in New Zealand? 2.33 A key benefit of reducing source-based taxes is that this is likely to increase FDI and inbound investment and New Zealand’s capital stock more broadly. 2.34 Important questions are whether additional FDI is likely to generate important productivity spillovers (for example, through the transfer of technology, management skills and broader business knowhow) and how big the effects of any tax changes on FDI and New Zealand’s capital stock are likely to be. In this section, we examine some international evidence on these issues. 27 2.35 It should be noted that an increase in FDI does not necessarily mean an increase in New Zealand’s capital stock. For example, if a foreign company takes control of an existing New Zealand business, this will be measured as an increase in FDI. There may, however, be no increase in New Zealand’s capital stock. FDI: productivity spillovers and sensitivity to tax 2.36 Many countries have attempted to impose low taxes on inbound FDI in the hope that this will generate positive productivity spillovers for other firms in the same industry or firms in connected industries. If there were substantial productivity spillovers, this could be a reason for going further than the simple model discussed earlier in this chapter suggests and subsidising inbound investment. 2.37 However, there are reasons to require a high burden of proof before cutting taxes or subsidising investment because of potential productivity spillovers or other externalities. Unless there is strong and quantifiable evidence of spillover benefits, a danger exists that providing tax subsidies would encourage lobbying and make it much more difficult to maintain a robust tax revenue base and a neutral and efficient tax system. 2.38 Our reading of the evidence is that, while examples of productivity spillovers will inevitably exist, there is very little clear and consistent evidence of substantial productivity spillovers from FDI into New Zealand. These issues are discussed by Doan, Maré, and Iyer (2015). They find that, while foreign-owned firms make a significant contribution to the New Zealand economy, there is little evidence of substantial positive spillover effects from inbound FDI to local firms’ productivity. There are also questions about whether firms in New Zealand that are acquired by foreign entities have an improved productivity performance. Fabling and Sanderson (2014) discuss this issue. While foreign-acquired firms appear to increase both average wages and gross output relative to firms that remain in domestic ownership, the authors find no evidence that these acquired firms boost their productivity performance. 2.39 Productivity spillovers can arise with domestic firms as well as from inbound FDI. In a recent inquiry, the New Zealand Productivity Commission argues that its most productive “frontier firms” can have an important role in lifting what they see as New Zealand’s “lacklustre productivity performance”. These firms tend to be innovative and export specialised, distinctive products. The Commission argues that high-quality FDI that invests in innovation, grows new export markets, creates a demand for skills, encourages more training, attracts international talent and builds career paths that keep skilled people in New Zealand can provide spillover benefits for New Zealand. At the same time, it po ints out that the same benefits may be produced by having large domestic exporting firms and that not all FDI is what they would deem to be “high quality”. It also notes that of the few foreign-owned businesses exporting specialised products, all started as New Zealand businesses. 19 All of this raises questions about whether it would be attractive to impose lower taxes on FDI relative to other forms of inbound investment. If non -residents are marginal investors into domestic companies, taxes on FPI as well as on FDI will be important factors affecting the level of New Zealand’s capital stock. 2.40 Many authors have argued that tax will have little effect on FDI and that a host of other factors, such as the nature of competition in product markets, the cost and availability of intermediate supplies, and proximity to final markets, will be 19 See the discussion in New Zealand Productivity Commission, 2021, ‘New Zealand firms: reaching for the frontier’, April, page 53. 28 more important. For example, Markusen (1995) argues that any effects of taxes on FDI will be unnoticeable in practice. 2.41 However, there is evidence that taxes may have important effects on levels of FDI and that the sensitivity of FDI to tax may have been growing over time. This literature is discussed in Hines (1999). De Mooij and Ederveen (2003) (in a widely cited review of the literature) found a median semi-elasticity of -3.3 (meaning that a 1% point cut in the company tax rate of the host country – where the income is sourced from – leads to a 3.3% increase in FDI). Moreover, the authors find evidence that this elasticity has been increasing over time, and that bigger effects are found if tax effects are measured in terms of effective tax rates (such as the EMTR analysis reported in this LTIB or AETRs) rather than statutory tax rates. This suggests that developing robust measures of EMTRs (and, in the longer run, AETRs) is likely to be important in understanding the effects of possible tax changes on FDI. 2.42 There is an open question whether these international studies are likely to be relevant to an economy like New Zealand, which is very distant from other markets. It is reasonable to suspect that elasticities may be much higher for, say, small landlocked countries in Europe, where companies can respond to taxes and locate a production centre to supply much the same market in one of several countries other than the country where final sales of goods or services will take place. 2.43 New Zealand observed limited growth in FDI when the company tax rate was cut in 2008 and 2011 (see pp. 8-9 of Inland Revenue and Treasury (2016) New Zealand taxation framework for inbound investment). However, evidence presented in appendix 6 of the Technical appendices suggests that EMTRs increased, rather than decreased, in 2011 as a result of other tax changes, including changes to depreciation rates. Also, the eyeballing of the data in the Inland Revenue and Treasury paper may be misleading if tax changes take a long time to have an effect. Freebairn (2015) reports studies suggesting that it may take seven to ten years for half of the long-run response to take place. Other confounding things may be happening at the same time (including a Global Financial Crisis and other tax measures, such as reductions in depreciation deductions and a tightening of thin capitalisation rules). As far as we are aware, no study of the sensitivity of FDI in New Zealand to tax rates has been conducted. Capital stock: sensitivity to tax 2.44 An alternative is to look at the responsiveness of total capital stock to tax parameters. Hassett and Hubbard (2002) suggest that studies have tended to find increasing elasticities through time, although this appears to be the result of more robust ways of estimating elasticities rather than because the elasticities themselves are changing through time. The authors suggest elasticities of capital stock with respect to user costs are in the range of -0. 5 to -1.0. 20 Nolan and Nolan (2021) discuss two models for New Zealand. One provides an estimate of around -0.7, which is consistent with previous work for New Zealand by Szeto and Ryan (2009). This is within the range suggested by Hassett and Hubbard. A second model has a higher elasticity of -1.42. There has been insufficient modelling in New Zealand for us to have a very robust set of estimates. Developing a better understanding of how taxes impact on costs of capital are again necessary in building an understanding of how they are likely to impact on New Zealand’s aggregate capital stock. 20 It should be noted that this elasticity is for total capital stock and not just FDI. 29 CHAPTER 3 Benchmarking New Zealand’s costs of capital and EMTRs against those of other OECD countries • OECD analysis suggests that New Zealand is an outlier with costs of capital and EMTRs for buildings, tangibles and inventories that are very high relative to most other OECD countries. • This suggests that New Zealand may require higher hurdle rates of return than most other countries before firms will find it profitable to invest. • Other things equal, this would reduce investment into New Zealand and New Zealand’s capital stock. • It may also reduce the speed with which New Zealand adjusts to new opportunities and challenges, including the need to take up new technologies to address climate change concerns. • International benchmarking studies will never be completely definitive and international comparisons will depend on the assets that are included and the taxes that are considered. • Allowing for taxes other than company tax provisions is likely to make New Zealand less of an outlier than the OECD analysis suggests. However, this is unlikely to undermine the conclusion that New Zealand is likely to require relatively high costs of capital and EMTRs compared to other OECD countries. • Decisions on whether to establish operations in a country may depend in part on the company tax rate itself, and New Zealand’s company tax rate is now high relative to most other OECD countries and especially other small, advanced economies in the OECD. Introduction 3.1 The aim of this chapter is to examine how New Zealand’s company tax rate and tax depreciation rules are likely to compare to those in other OECD countries. To do this we mainly focus on a model that has been developed by the OECD. 30 3.2 The OECD examines how tax provisions can affect incentives to invest by considering their impact on costs of capital, effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) and effective average tax rates (EATRs) for a set of assets. This can be useful in benchmarking New Zealand’s tax rules against those in other countries and for examining whether New Zealand is an outlier in the way that it taxes investment. In this LTIB, our focus is on the cost of capital and the closely related EMTR measure. 21 3.3 The OECD data is provided on the OECD website. 22 The model that underlies these results is discussed in Hanappi (2018). 3.4 This chapter explains key assumptions underlying the OECD modelling and reports on how New Zealand compares to other OECD countries in the OECD estimates. 3.5 The OECD’s model focuses on investment by companies. It only examines the effects of the company tax rate, depreciation rates and the tax treatment of inventories on costs of capital and EMTRs. It does not consider sales taxes, withholding taxes, such as New Zealand’s non-resident withholding tax on interest or its approved issuer levy, or the likely impact of thin capitalisation provisions. It makes some assumptions about debt levels and macroeconomic parameters for its benchmarking exercise. 3.6 The OECD modelling is helpful in providing a first-cut analysis of how taxes are likely to compare across OECD countries. However, quite a bit is omitted from this analysis and some of the assumptions being used may not be the most appropriate for New Zealand. We will consider possible extensions to the model and modify some of the parameter values when examining costs of capital and EMTRs for New Zealand in chapter 4. 3.7 The OECD’s analysis suggests that New Zealand is an outlier with high levels of taxation on inbound investment. However, reviewers have pointed us to two other studies, which we also discuss. In one of these studies, New Zealand appears to be less of an outlier. This is in part because this study considers taxes other than company tax provisions which may also impact on costs of capital and EMTRs while the OECD study examines company tax provisions only. Allowing for a broader set of taxes is likely to make New Zealand less of an outlier but it is still likely to be the case that New Zealand has high taxes on inbound investment compared with most other OECD countries. The OECD modelling and some key assumptions 3.8 The OECD examines how tax rules can affect the cost of capital. As was discussed in chapter 2, the cost of capital is the minimum real pre-tax rate of return needed for an investment to be profitable on an after-tax basis, or the hurdle rate of return. For investments that just meet their cost of capital, the 21 EATRs may affect decisions whether firms with high levels of mobile economic rents choose to set up operations in New Zealand. (Mobile economic rents are high returns that can be derived from setting up in any country.) However, analysis of EATRs is left for future work. We suspect that, because of New Zealand’s extreme remoteness, decisions on whether to set up in New Zealand are more likely to be driven by whether there are non-tax reasons to set up in New Zealand rather than because New Zealand might be an attractive place to earn mobile economic rents. Also, for firms with very high mobile economic rents, the EATR can be closely approximated by the statutory company tax rate, which can be observed easily without any complex economic modelling. 22 OECD. OECD.Stat. Public Sector, Taxation and Market Regulation / Taxation / Corporate Tax Statistics / Effective Tax Rates. https://stats.oecd.org/ 31 expected present value of future revenues will exactly match the cost of the investment. The investment is sometimes said to be marginal (that is, break- even) on an after-tax basis. 3.9 New Zealand and other countries import capital from abroad. For non-residents to be willing to invest, they must expect to be able to earn as good risk-adjusted returns from investment in New Zealand as they could obtain from investing in other countries. A common assumption (and one that the OECD adopts) is that non-residents are the marginal equity investors into domestic companies. 23 This is likely to be a reasonable first approximation for analysing many sectors of the New Zealand economy. This model may not, however, be relevant for sectors where foreign investment (both foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment) is a negligible fraction of total equity investment. This is discussed further in chapter 4 below and in appendix 1 in the Technical appendices. 3.10 Suppose that investment is financed by non-resident shareholders who require a fixed rate of return (say, 3%) on their capital that is equal to the return they can obtain from investing in other countries. To make things as simple as possible, assume there is no inflation, so this is the real and nominal rate of return that foreign shareholders demand. Also suppose initially that investment is fully equity financed and that all economic income being generated is fully taxed. 24 If the company tax rate were 0%, the cost of capital would be 3%. This would be the pre- and post-tax rate of return needed to provide non- residents with the return they demand on a marginal investment. With a company tax rate of 25%, the cost of capital would increase to 4%. After this pre-tax rate of return is taxed at the company tax rate, non-resident shareholders would be left with the 3% after-tax return on their capital that they demand. If the company tax rate were increased to 40%, the cost of capital would increase to 5% to ensure non-resident shareholders end up with the after-tax rate of return they demand. 3.11 In this simple model, the net-of -company-tax rate of return is fixed at 3%. Changes to the company tax rate will affect the hurdle rate of return or cost of capital. In a more complex model, depreciation provisions, real interest rates, inflation and levels of debt financing will also affect the cost of capital. 3.12 The OECD’s model takes these other factors into account under a set of possible macroeconomic assumptions. They examine the following two cases: • real interest rates and inflation rates that are country specific, and • a common real interest rate and inflation assumption for all countries. 3.13 We work with the second of these two cases because this focuses on the impact of tax rules (rather than macroeconomic settings) in affecting incentives to invest in different countries. 23 Support for this approach in the Australian context is provided by Murphy, C. (2018). Murphy provides an extensive review of academic literature on this issue. For a contrary approach, see Swan, P. (2019). Swan provides evidence suggesting marginal investment is supplied by residents who can make use of imputation credits and who can borrow on international capital markets to finance investment. This is likely to be more consistent with the alternative model that we analyse in Appendix 1 of the Technical Appendices. 24 To understand the example, it is easiest to consider investment in an asset that maintains its value through time where no depreciation deductions are allowed. For assets that fall in value over time, economic income would be fully taxed if depreciation deductions mirrored economic depreciation (that is, the fall in the market value of assets). 32 3.14 The OECD assumes that the real interest rate is 3% per annum and the inflation rate is 1% per annum. Foreign shareholders demand a 3% real return on the capital they invest into New Zealand and other economies. The real interest rate is also 3%. With 1% inflation, this means a 4.03% nominal interest rate. 25 Withholding taxes on interest and dividends are ignored in the OECD analysis. 3.15 A key assumption (as in the example outlined above) is that non-residents are the marginal investors and the return on an investment net of New Zealand taxes needs to generate these investors’ required rate of return. Competition is assumed to make this the hurdle rate of return on all investment. This means that taxes on inbound investment are ultimately going to determine costs of capital in New Zealand. 3.16 The cost of capital will also be affected by the proportion of investment that is equity financed and the proportion that is debt financed. This is because interest payments are tax deductible, whereas dividend payments are not. The OECD assumes that 35% of marginal investment is financed by debt and 65% by foreign equity. It is also assumed that all firms are in a taxpaying position. About 34% of companies had a loss that they carried forward from the 2019/20 to the 2020/21 year. The OECD modelling does not consider thin capitalisation restrictions, which may limit interest deductions in some circumstances. Of course, it could be argued that ignoring thin capitalisation restrictions is consistent with the assumption that firms are only 35% debt financed. In New Zealand, firms that are less than 60% debt financed are not subject to any thin capitalisation restrictions. 3.17 The estimates of costs of capital will also be influenced by the tax rules for inventory (or trading stock) and rates of depreciation that are allowed for tax purposes, as well as economic depreciation rates. Economic depreciation is the rate at which assets would fall in market value if there were no inflation. Many countries attempt to have tax depreciation rates as close to economic depreciation as feasible. However, tax depreciation rates are sometimes designed to be faster than economic depreciation rates to provide incentives for investment. 3.18 The OECD’s modelling results are only available for the last four years (2017– 2020) and for four aggregated sets of assets. These are buildings (manufacturing plants, large engineering structures, and office or commercial buildings), inventories, acquired intangibles (acquired software) and a category of asset described as ‘tangible assets’, which includes tangible assets that are not buildings – mainly machinery and equipment (road transport vehicles, air, rail or water transport vehicles, computer hardware, equipment, and industrial machinery). The accuracy of the OECD’s benchmarking will, of course, depend on how well the specific assets chosen reflect the broader categories of asset they are assumed to represent and also the accuracy with which officials in different countries have estimated the tax depreciation rates allowed. In New Zealand, for example, there is quite a variety of different tax depreciation rates that can be allowed for different types of equipment or different types of industrial machinery. The figures will be best estimates but will not be precise. 3.19 The OECD model calculates the real pre-tax rate of return that is necessary to make investments break even given the company tax rates and depreciation rates applying in different OECD countries. This is done by finding the rate of return required to make the present value of the revenues from an investment 25 The OECD refers to this as the ‘low interest and inflation rates’ option, but it is now the only standardised interest rate and inflation option they report. Previously, they considered a real interest rate of 5% and an inflation rate of 2% as well. To be able to purchase 3% more real goods and services, we need a nominal interest rate of 4.03% because 1.03 × 1.01 = 1.0403. 33 equal to the cost. A simple version of the OECD model is outlined in appendix 1 in the Technical appendices. 26 3.20 It should be noted that any economic model is no more than a partial insight. In particular, the OECD model treats the tax rules as certain and assumed to continue forever. Macroeconomic variables , such as interest rates and inflation rates, are also assumed to remain constant in the future. All of this seems reasonable when considering the long-run effects of tax settings but may ignore some important other considerations. Submitters have pointed out that if tax rules are uncertain and subject to chopping and changing, and especially if policy frameworks are unclear, this can negatively impact on investment in ways that are not captured in formal economic models. Complexity of legislation and compliance costs and having tax rules that are very different from rules in other countries may also have a negative impact on investment, especially if these cause foreign investors to question whether it is worth finding out if investing into New Zealand would be a good idea. If different rules apply to different types of firms, this can add to the complexity. 3.21 In the modelling, it is assumed that investment is undertaken by a company that holds the investment permanently. This ignores one aspect of New Zealand’s tax system, namely the absence of a general tax on capital gains, which may tend to promote investment here relative to investment in other countries. In many other countries, capital gains will normally be subject to some level of tax when assets are sold, whereas this is not the case in New Zealand. Where firms invest with the intention of generating capital gains, this analysis may make New Zealand look like it is a relatively higher tax country than is true in practice. The OECD estimates of costs of capital and EMTRs 3.22 OECD estimates of costs of capital or hurdle rates of return allow New Zealand’s performance to be benchmarked against the other 37 OECD countries. Results are provided in table 3.1 for 2020, the latest year for which data is available. 26 Our model provides identical cost of capital estimates to the OECD model for the case that underlies the OECD’s estimates of costs of capital reported on their website when non-residents are marginal investors in companies. The OECD model is more flexible and can be extended to consider other marginal investors as well, but this comes with additional complexity. As is discussed further in footnote 4 of the Technical Appendices, there may be some differences in our EMTR measures. 34 Table 3.1: Estimated costs of capital in 2020 Country Buildings Inventories Acquired intangibles Tangible assets Cost of capital Rank Cost of capital Rank Cost of capital Rank Cost of capital Rank Australia 3.4 14 3.9 7 4.0 9 3.7 6 Austria 3.5 12 3.5 25 3.9 12 3.4 12 Belgium 2.3 37 2.7 38 3.3 26 2.6 36 Canada 3.2 26 3.9 6 3.4 24 3.1 25 Chile 3.1 30 4.0 5 18.5 2 2.9 31 Colombia 3.7 5 4.0 4 4.1 8 3.7 5 Costa Rica 3.7 4 4.1 2 21.0 1 3.6 8 Czech Republic 3.5 8 3.5 27 4.0 11 3.2 23 Denmark 3.3 21 3.7 13 3.1 31 3.5 9 Estonia 3.0 31 3.0 33 3.0 33 3.0 29 Finland 3.2 25 3.6 19 4.7 5 3.2 22 France 3.3 19 4.2 1 3.7 17 3.4 15 Germany 3.6 6 3.7 16 3.8 13 3.9 3 Greece 3.3 18 3.7 17 4.1 7 3.7 7 Hungary 3.3 22 3.3 31 3.1 29 3.0 28 Iceland 3.2 24 3.6 18 3.8 14 3.4 13 Ireland 3.1 28 3.4 30 3.8 15 3.3 19 Israel 3.3 20 3.8 11 3.6 22 3.5 10 Italy 2.6 36 2.8 37 2.9 36 1.3 38 Japan 3.7 3 3.9 9 5.0 4 4.1 1 Korea 3.5 13 3.8 10 4.3 6 3.2 21 Latvia 3.0 32 3.0 34 3.0 34 3.0 30 Lithuania 2.9 33 3.5 28 3.3 25 3.2 24 Luxembourg 3.3 17 3.5 26 3.6 21 3.7 4 Mexico 3.1 29 3.9 8 7.2 3 3.1 27 Netherlands 4.0 2 3.5 24 3.7 16 3.3 17 New Zealand 4.1 1 4.0 3 3.7 18 3.9 2 Norway 3.5 9 3.7 12 3.1 30 3.5 11 Poland 2.8 34 2.8 36 3.2 28 2.6 35 Portugal 2.1 38 3.0 35 2.7 37 2.2 37 Slovak Republic 3.2 27 3.6 22 3.4 23 3.4 14 Slovenia 3.3 15 3.6 20 3.3 27 3.1 26 Spain 3.5 10 3.7 15 3.6 20 3.4 16 Sweden 3.3 23 3.7 14 4.0 10 3.3 18 Switzerland 3.5 11 3.6 21 3.7 19 3.3 20 Turkey 2.6 35 3.2 32 2.9 35 2.9 33 United Kingdom 3.3 16 3.4 29 3.1 32 2.9 32 United States 3.6 7 3.6 23 2.6 38 2.6 34 Average 3.3 3.6 4.5 3.2 35 3.23 It is helpful to consider what the results are telling us. The underlying assumption is of a 3% real interest rate demanded by non-resident investors. Take buildings, for example. The OECD analysis suggests that the hurdle rate of return for investment in buildings (mainly commercial and industrial buildings) is 3.4% in Australia. This means that tax is resulting in a higher hurdle rate of return than would be the case if investment were untaxed (when the cost of capital would be 3%). This is unsurprising. One would normally expect that taxes would raise hurdle rates of return. 3.24 To the right of the cost of capital estimate for Australia, there is a rank measure of 14. This means that Australia has the 14 th highest cost of capital for buildings under the OECD estimates. 3.25 Other things being equal, higher costs of capital will tend to reduce investment and capital stock because fewer investments will generate the required rate of return. The OECD data suggests that New Zealand has relatively high costs of capital. It has the highest for buildings, third highest for inventories, 18 th highest for acquired intangibles, and second highest for ‘tangible assets’ (meaning non-building tangible assets). 3.26 Of the various estimates, the figures for buildings and for inventories are likely to be most accurate. The figures for tangible assets are attempting to make an estimate for a large group of different non-building tangible assets that can have different tax depreciation rates and different economic depreciation rates. It can be very difficult to aggregate these into a single average cost of capital. 3.27 A smaller group of assets, with less variety in economic and tax depreciation rates, is grouped under buildings. Also, costs of capital for inventories can be calculated reasonably simply. 3.28 The variability across countries of costs of capital for acquired intangibles is surprising and may be a reason for treating results for these assets with some caution. Very high figures for Chile and Costa Rica are pushing up the average cost of capital estimate significantly. It should be noted that purchased intangibles are likely to comprise a relatively small part of New Zealand’s capital stock. The main purchased intangible may be software. As we discuss in appendix 6 of our Technical appendices, this is only 3.7% of the net capital stock of ‘market entities’ whose investment decisions are likely to be directly impacted by the tax settings we are analysing in this LTIB. 3.29 These estimates are for a few highly aggregated assets only. 3.30 Little difference exists between New Zealand’s costs of capital for the three main types of business investment included in the data: buildings, inventory and tangible assets. Thus, New Zealand’s tax settings appear to be reasonably neutral across these three different aggregate assets. In later chapters, we extend the analysis to consider other forms of investment, including investment in assets where capital expenditure can be immediately written off (or expensed). This will include most investment in self-created intangibles. Looking at a broader set of assets reveals some biases that can be hidden in the OECD’s highly aggregated analysis. 3.31 The OECD data only goes back to 2017. The most major change for New Zealand during the period from 2017 to the present was the restoration of building depreciation for commercial and industrial property in 2020. Before that, in 2019, the OECD estimated that New Zealand had a significantly higher cost of capital for buildings of 4.9%. The Netherlands was in second place with a cost of capital of 4.0%. This suggested that, while taxes were pushing the hurdle rate of return for buildings up from 3.0% to a maximum of 4.0% in other OECD countries, they were pushing that rate up to 4.9% in New Zealand. This 36 suggests that a significant number of investments that would have been profitable in other countries were not profitable in New Zealand. In addition, the cost of capital for investment in commercial and industrial buildings was very high relative to other forms of investment. This was likely to be distorting decisions about investment in different assets. 3.32 Thus, the 2020 change appears to have reduced the cost of capital for the least favourably taxed form of business investment (commercial and industrial buildings) and made costs of capital more neutral. However, the OECD analysis suggests that New Zealand’s costs of capital are still very high relative to most other OECD countries. 3.33 The OECD also provides information on effective marginal tax rate or EMTRs. The EMTR = (p – r)/p where p is the pre-tax rate of return on a marginal investment and r is the cost of funds to the economy. For example, as discussed earlier, the cost of capital for investment in buildings in Australia was 3.4% and the cost of funds was 3.0%. This results in an EMTR of 11.8%, that is, (3.4%–3.0%)/3.4%. Clearly there is a very close relationship between the cost of capital and EMTR measures. The higher the cost of capital, the higher will be the EMTR. A higher cost of capital of, say, 3.5% would imply an EMTR of 14.2%, that is, (3.5%-3.0%)/3.5%. 3.34 The OECD provides estimates of average EMTRs for the 38 OECD countries across their four categories of asset. The OECD estimates that if the real interest rate is 3% and inflation is 1%, these average EMTRs vary from 33.4% for Costa Rica to -30.4% in Italy. New Zealand has an average EMTR of 20.1%, which is 4 th highest, and Australia has an average EMTR of 14.9%, which is 10 th highest. However, these estimates are unweighted averages across the four types of assets. This means that equal weighting is being given to each of the four categories of asset. In principle, it would be preferable to use a weighted average EMTR, reflecting the relative sizes of the four categories of asset in the asset mix, but data limitations may make this impractical for a cross-country benchmarking study. 3.35 In their 2022 Economic Survey of New Zealand, the OECD has noted that New Zealand’s statutory company tax rate and its average level of EMTRs were high relative to other OECD countries and to other small, advanced economies. Data is provided in figure 3.1 with data for small, advanced economies on the left- hand side of both diagrams. 27 F or internationally mobile firms with substantial economic rents that can set up operations and earn these rents in different countries, the company tax rate can be an important factor in deciding whether to set up in a country. 28 27 OECD.

(p. 54) https://doi.org/10.1787/a4fd214c-en https://stat.link/en6415 28 Submissions have also suggested that the company tax rate can be an important “headline” in the most preliminary analyses of whether a country is likely to be an attractive place to invest in. 37 Figure 3.1: Company tax rate and EMTRs relative to other small, advanced economies 1.

Source: OECD Tax Database 3.36 It might be noted that while New Zealand has relatively high EMTRs, there are some countries that are estimated to have negative EMTRs. The models discussed in chapter 2 would support reducing EMTRs to zero but not going further and driving them negative unless there are externalities or other broader benefits from inbound investment. EMTRs in different studies 3.37 Both external reviewer s of our draft LTIB questioned our exclusive focus on the OECD study for benchmarking costs of capital and EMTRs across countries. Some other studies have done a similar benchmarking exercise and there is quite some variability in estimates in the different studies. This suggests that estimates from any single study should not be regarded as definitive. 3.38 Both reviewers commented that focussing too closely on the results of a single study may make the conclusions of that study appear more definite and conclusive than is true. They pointed to some other analysis that ha s also -40 -30 -20 -10 0 10 20 30 40 BEL DNK NOR IRL CHE ISR AUT SWE NDL FIN NZL ITA PRT POL TUR USA EST LVA GBR HUN LTU CAN SVN SVK FRA ESP LUX ISL CZE KOR AUS DEU GRC MEX COL CHL JPN CRI Panel B.

While the OECD study estimates that New Zealand had the fourth highest EMTR on average for the 38 OECD countries in 2020 (see figure 3.1 above), Bazel and Mintz (2021) estimate that New Zealand had the 14 th highest EMTR for 2020 of the 37 OECD countries they analyse (they omit Lithuania). Bazel and Mintz estimate that New Zealand’s EMTR was 1 9.7% and this i s considerably lower than Australia’s which they estimate to be 28.3%. There are also somewhat dated estimates in a study by the Oxford Centre for Business Taxation from 2017 (which was before a substantial company tax rate cut in the United States and before building depreciation for commercial and industrial buildings was restored in New Zealand). 29 That study suggests that New Zealand had the fifth highest EMTR for the 34 OECD countries analysed. Thus, in the OECD and Oxford University studies, New Zealand appears to be more of an outlier than in the study by Bazel and Mintz. 3.39 Part of the reason for the differences between these studies is likely to be that the OECD and Oxford University studies only examine company income tax provisions, while the Bazel and Mintz study considers a broader range of taxes, including capital transfer taxes (such as stamp duties in Australia) and certain sales taxes in the United States, which (unlike New Zealand’s GST) can be an impost on business inputs. These other taxes can also increase costs of capital and EMTRs. However, this seems to be only a small part of the difference between the Bazel and Mintz and OECD studies’ estimates for New Zealand and Australia accounting for roughly 3 percentage points of their higher EMTR estimate for Australia than New Zealand. 30 3.40 A bigger part of the reason for the difference is differences in the set of assets included in the studies and in the economic depreciation rates and tax depreciation rates assumed. The OECD study includes only four aggregated sets of assets built up from ten specific assets (as described in para 3.18 above). The small set of assets may create its own biases, but there is a significant advantage in the OECD model. This is because the OECD can draw on expertise in the various OECD countries to make sure that parameter values entered into the model are as accurate as possible for the assets included in the study. The model is also very simple, allowing parameter values to be as transparent as possible. By contrast, the Bazel and Mintz study is much more complex and the parameter values driving the results are less transparent. 3.41 At the same time, it is important to point out that estimates of costs of capital and EMTRs in any study are likely to be imprecise. For example, we have discussed how the overall EMTR in the OECD study is an unweighted average of EMTRs for four categories of asset. One of these categories of asset (acquired intangibles) is represented by a single asset, acquired software. This means that this single asset ends up with a 25% weighting in the OECD’s estimates. Because of this, any changes to the depreciation deductions for software are likely to have a misleadingly large effect on a country’s position in the OECD rankings. 3.42 In chapter 4, we discuss assets not included in the OECD study, such as zero- depreciation assets, appreciating assets and assets where capital expenditure can be deducted immediately (or expensed). These assets are all likely to have lower costs of capital and EMTRs than the assets included in the study. By itself, 29 Online data from Oxford Centre for Business Taxation available at https://oxfordtax.sbs.ox.ac.uk/cbt-tax-database 30 Bazel, Mintz and Thompson (2018) provides a breakdown of how these different additional taxes can affect EMTRs in many countries. They increase EMTRs in many other countries but not in New Zealand as New Zealand does not have these taxes. 39 bringing in these additional assets will tend to reduce costs of capital and EMTRs in New Zealand. However, similar inclusions for other countries might also lower costs of capital and EMTRs in other countries as well. 3.43 Ultimately, we suspect that the OECD’s conclusion about New Zealand being an outlier, with very high costs of capital and EMTRs relative to most other OECD countries, is likely to be robust for the company tax provisions analysed in the OECD study. Consideration of a broader set of taxes as suggested by Bazel and Mintz that are imposed in other countries but not New Zealand can moderate this effect but costs of capital and EMTRs are still likely to be high compared to most other OECD countries. 3.44 The question of exactly where New Zealand sits relative to other OECD countries is likely to be uncertain. However, this is probably not a critical issue. Whether New Zealand is likely to benefit from lower and more neutral costs of capital and EMTRs, and the pros and cons of different possible measures, are largely independent of our precise ranking in the set of OECD countries. Concluding comments 3.45 Chapter 4 explores the effects of changing some of the assumptions. We extend the modelling by considering: • possible changes to macroeconomic assumptions and assumptions on gearing that are likely to be more relevant for New Zealand • some factors missing from the OECD analysis, such as non-resident withholding tax on interest and New Zealand’s approved issuer levy, and • how the model might be extended to domestic small and medium enterprises (SMEs) where foreign investors may not be the marginal investors. 3.46 Subsequent chapters discuss various policy options for reducing costs of capital and EMTRs and making these more neutral. 40 CHAPTER 4 A deeper look at costs of capital and EMTRs for New Zealand • If depreciation deductions are set to mirror how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation, they will not be neutral in the presence of even small amounts of inflation. They will tend to favour investment in assets that have lower rates of economic depreciation relative to assets with higher rates of economic depreciation. New Zealand’s tax settings are likely to contain these biases. • We find evidence of significant biases between different tangible assets with different economic depreciation rates. • While we saw in chapter 3 that New Zealand’s costs of capital and EMTRs are often high relative to other countries, at times EMTRs will be negative and costs of capital will be less than the cost to New Zealand of importing capital. In these cases, investment is effectively being subsidised by the tax system. • Inflation tends to increase costs of capital and EMTRs for many types of assets that are already relatively heavily taxed. This is especially the case for plant, machinery and equipment with high economic rates of depreciation and for inventories. At the same time, inflation can reduce costs of capital and increase tax subsidies for assets that would be subsidised and have negative EMTRs even if there were no inflation. • Accounting for NRWT and AIL will add to costs of capital and EMTRs slightly. NRWT will also introduce some variability in tax imposts between companies that are foreign controlled and domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders, although at average debt levels the biases between these two types of companies seems quite small relative to the tax biases between different types of asset. • In the analysis in this LTIB, we mainly focus on the case that underpins the OECD model where non-residents are marginal shareholders in companies operating in New Zealand. It is when non-residents are marginal shareholders that New Zealand’s relatively high costs of capital and EMTRs are likely to arise. If, instead, New Zealanders are marginal shareholders, it becomes more likely that EMTRs will be low or negative. Introduction 4.1 The OECD benchmarking exercise discussed in chapter 3 rested on assumptions the OECD has made and applied to all OECD countries. In appendix 2 of our Technical appendices, we modify and extend the analysis in various ways. In this chapter, we provide a shorter discussion of some of the main results. 4.2 We consider the implications of different levels of debt, inflation and real interest rates. We also allow for investment in a broader set of assets than in the OECD study. The OECD model takes account of company tax settings, including depreciation provisions, but not of levies or taxes on interest paid overseas, such as New Zealand’s approved issuer levy (AIL) and non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on interest. AIL and NRWT were incorporated in the 41 effective tax rates calculated by the McLeod Review. 31 On the other hand, the McLeod Review assumed that economic income was fully taxed at the company level so that the EMTR on a fully equity-financed investment was the statutory company tax rate. This is equivalent to assuming that there is no inflation and that depreciation provisions reflect economic depreciation (that is, how assets would fall in value in the absence of inflation). The McLeod Review approach does not capture the way that tax incentives, such as accelerated depreciation provisions, or inflation can affect EMTRs and incentives to invest, whereas the OECD study aims to analyse these issues. 4.3 This chapter attempts to blend insights from the OECD analysis with those from the McLeod Review. It extends the OECD analysis to take account of AIL and NRWT on interest. By taking account of the ways in which depreciation provisions may depart from economic depreciation and the impact of inflation, we are able to analyse possible biases in the tax treatment of different assets and of firms financed in different ways. We also explore possible biases between different types of firm. 4.4 We consider three possible types of firm: • Domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders. These are companies that are not foreign controlled with marginal non-resident shareholders. As will be discussed, for these firms AIL is likely to affect borrowing costs, while borrowing costs are unlikely to be affected by NRWT. • Foreign-controlled companies. These are companies where foreign direct investors will be marginal shareholders. For these firms, borrowing costs are likely to be affected by both AIL and NRWT. • Domestic SMEs without marginal foreign shareholders. Some firms are likely to have little or no foreign shareholding and for these companies it may be unreasonable to think of non-residents as marginal shareholders. There are significant uncertainties about how best to measure costs of capital and EMTRs for these firms, but it seems likely that these SMEs will have lower costs of capital and EMTRs than companies with marginal foreign shareholders. Both borrowing costs and the opportunity cost of the funds of owners can potentially be affected by AIL for marginal shareholders in these firms. 4.5 As discussed in chapter 3, the OECD study has suggested that New Zealand has high costs of capital and EMTRs for inbound investment for the types of asset included in their study. By incorporating AIL and NRWT on interest into the analysis, this chapter aims to achieve a fuller measure of costs of capital and EMTRs than the OECD study achieved. It also aims to analyse the variability of costs of capital and EMTRs across different assets, methods of finance and types of firm. 4.6 The structure of this chapter is as follows. First, we outline some key features of New Zealand’s tax system that will be helpful in understanding how personal and company tax settings are likely to interact. Second, we discuss the set of assets we will be considering in this and subsequent chapters and some key ways in which we are extending and modifying the OECD analysis. Third, we discuss how New Zealand’s tax settings can impact on costs of capital and EMTRs for domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders (that is companies that are not foreign controlled with non-resident marginal 31 See McLeod Review (2001) Tax review 2001: Final Report. 42 shareholders). For these firms, costs of capital and EMTRs are likely to be influenced by AIL but not NRWT on interest. Fourth, we consider NRWT on interest and how this can impact on costs of capital and EMTRs for foreign- controlled companies. Finally, we extend the cost of capital and EMTR analysis to consider domestic SMEs without foreign marginal shareholders. New Zealand’s tax rules: some basics 4.7 Some key features of New Zealand’s tax system are listed in this section. 4.8 As was discussed in chapter 2, company tax has a dual role in New Zealand. As well as being a way of taxing non-residents on the income they derive from investing in New Zealand, it has an important role in shoring up the integrity and progressivity of the personal tax system. The rules outlined below help in understanding these dual roles of company tax as well as policy challenges when changing tax settings in this area. Tax settings are as follows: • Companies are taxed at a rate of 28% on their taxable income regardless of company size and whether this income is earned by domestic-owned or foreign-owned companies. • Personal income is taxed at increasing marginal rates. Before 1 April 2021, the top personal marginal tax rate was 33%. This applied to all income over $70,000 per annum. From 1 April 2021, a higher top marginal tax rate of 39% was introduced. This applies to income over $180,000 per annum. • Trusts are taxed at a rate of 33% on trustee income, which is income earned and retained in the trust for six months or longer. Trustee income distributed from a trust is not subject to further tax when it is distributed. • New Zealand has a full imputation system. This means that if $100 of taxable income is earned by a company, the company is required to pay $28 in company tax. If the remaining $72 is distributed to domestic shareholders as a fully imputed dividend, the shareholders are taxed on the full $100 (the cash dividend of $72 plus $28 of imputation credits) but can claim an imputation credit for the tax paid at the company level of $28. This means that on distribution to a shareholder on a tax rate of 33%, further tax of $5 would be paid. This is because tax on the gross income of $100 would be $33, but this is reduced to a $5 liability by the $28 imputation credit. Once profits are distributed, the total tax rate on the income earned is topped up to the shareholder’s marginal tax rate. If income is untaxed at the company level, the dividends will be fully taxed in shareholders hands. Thus, if the $100 earned by the company was non- taxable to the company and the full $100 of income were distributed to shareholders on a marginal tax rate of 33% as an unimputed dividend, there would be tax of $33 on the dividend. Once again, profits would have been fully taxed in shareholders’ hands. 43 • Imputation credits are available to domestic, but not foreign, shareholders. This means that company tax will normally be a final tax for foreign shareholders. 32 • New Zealand does not have a general capital gains tax. This means that capital profits earned by a company will normally not be subject to tax. Also, shareholders will not generally be taxed on gains that are realised when shares are sold. • NRWT is withheld on interest payments to non-residents at a rate of 10% for countries with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement and 15% for other countries. Most often it will be withheld at a rate of 10%. Where debt is from a related party (for example, a foreign parent company), NRWT must be withheld. However, an alternative exists when debt is from third parties. This alternative is for the borrowing firms to pay AIL at a rate of 2% in lieu of NRWT. A difference between these two types of taxes is that NRWT may give rise to tax credits overseas that reduce the amount of tax overseas lenders must pay on their interest income from New Zealand. No foreign tax credits are available for AIL. Modifying the OECD analysis for New Zealand settings 4.9 The OECD analysis provides a single estimated cost of capital and a single estimated EMTR for non-building tangible assets. However, there are different types of these assets with different economic and tax depreciation rates. This will lead to a variety of costs of capital and EMTRs for these assets. We extend the OECD analysis by considering costs of capital and EMTRs for a broader set of these assets. This allows potential tax biases between different types of these assets to be considered. 4.10 We also extend the analysis by considering other important classes of assets. We consider the following set of assets: • commercial and industrial buildings • plant, machinery and equipment that is assumed to have a variety of economic DV depreciation rates (denoted by d) and DV tax depreciation rates (denoted by d\*) • a zero-depreciation asset that is assumed to neither appreciate nor depreciate in real terms • inventories • appreciating assets, and • assets for which capital expenditure can be deducted immediately (or expensed). 32 Sometimes non-resident withholding tax on dividends may be paid by a New Zealand subsidiary on unimputed dividends paid to a foreign parent, but double tax agreements can reduce this to 0% in many cases. We ignore dividend withholding tax. Some additional complications can be introduced by New Zealand’s foreign investor tax credit for dividends paid to portfolio shareholders. Again, we ignore these complications in the analysis in this chapter. These are extensions that might be considered in future work. 44 4.11 Commercial and industrial buildings are assumed to have an economic depreciation rate of 2.69%, which is an OECD estimate of a weighted average of economic depreciation rates across these two types of buildings. 4.12 New Zealand’s tax depreciation rates for plant, machinery and equipment (PME) attempt to reflect economic depreciation, that is, how assets are expected to fall in value. 33 However, inflation has not been taken into account when setting these depreciation rates. In our modelling, we assume that tax depreciation rates for PME reflect economic depreciation. This allows us to examine biases that would arise if New Zealand were perfectly successful in matching tax depreciation rates with economic depreciation rates. In practice, biases are likely to be larger than we identify because tax depreciation rates will, at best, approximate economic depreciation rates. 4.13 An example of a zero-depreciation asset might be land, if land were not expected to either increase or decrease in real value. If land were expected to increase in real value, it might be covered in the appreciating assets category. 4.14 As in the OECD analysis, we allow for trading stock or inventories. Inventories are subject to first-in, first-out (FIFO) accounting in New Zealand, and we make this assumption in our modelling. We also assume that inventories are turned over at least once a year. A slower rate of turnover would tend to reduce costs of capital and EMTRs. 4.15 Appreciating assets are assumed to appreciate at a real rate of 1% per annum. Neither the real, nor the inflationary, component of this gain is subject to capital gains tax. 4.16 We also consider investment in capital assets that can be immediately written off (or ‘expensed’). This is quite a broad set of investments, which are not considered in the OECD modelling. It includes investment in planting and growing a forest, mining exploration expenditure, and repairs and maintenance expenditure where this provides ongoing benefits for many years. It also includes investment by a firm in building up intangible assets if the costs of the investment can be deducted immediately, for example, as salaries and wages. Capital expenditure on many intangible assets that are created by a firm itself can be expensed, including building up good information and data and establishing reputation and customer goodwill. 4.17 While the OECD modelling assumed an average debt level (namely, a debt/(debt+equity) ratio) of 35%, the average debt level for both foreign- controlled companies and NZX 50 firms (other than banks) is approximately 43%. This is discussed in appendix 2 of the Technical appendices. While the OECD assumed an inflation rate of 1%, we often focus on a slightly higher inflation rate of 2%, which is in the middle of the Reserve Bank target range. This seems reasonable as a long-term estimate of inflation even though the increase in the CPI in the year to June 2022 was significantly higher (CPI inflation of 7.3% over this period). 4.18 Finally, we will be taking account of the way in which AIL and NRWT can increase domestic interest rates and the cost of borrowing for companies. For foreign-controlled companies, things become a little complicated because third- party borrowings will normally be subject to AIL and related-party loans will be subject to NRWT on interest. We will discuss this case later in the chapter. 33 See, for example, the discussion in Inland Revenue and Treasury (2004) Repairs and maintenance to tax depreciation rules - an officials’ issues paper. https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2004/2004-ip-depreciation 45 4.19 We start, however, with the simpler case of domestic companies that are not foreign controlled but that are assumed to have marginal foreign portfolio shareholders. For these firms, AIL is likely to be pushing up interest costs rather than NRWT. This would happen if these companies borrowed from third parties abroad themselves. However, New Zealand financial institutions are required to pay AIL on their borrowings from abroad, so AIL is also likely to push up interest rates more generally in New Zealand and be reflected in the interest rates paid by domestic firms when they borrow from domestic financial institutions. 4.20 We assume that regardless whether these firms borrow from overseas themselves or through domestic financial institutions, AIL pushes up the domestic nominal interest rate they face by 2%. If the nominal cost of debt would be 3.0% in the absence of AIL, the cost would be expected to rise to 3.06% so that, after AIL is levied at a rate of 2%, non -residents receive the net return they demand. Similarly, if the nominal cost of debt would have been 5.06% in the absence of AIL, the cost would be expected to rise to 5.16%. 34 Domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders 4.21 Appendix 2 of the Technical appendices discusses how New Zealand’s tax settings are likely to impact on costs of capital and EMTRs. Table 4.1 is the same as table A2.2 and examines costs of capital when AIL is being levied at a 2% rate. It reports results for two levels of inflation, namely, 0% and 2%, and for different levels of debt. When b = 0%, the debt ratio, debt/(debt+equity), is 0% and investment is fully equity financed. When b = 100%, investment is fully debt financed. When b = 43%, firms are 43% debt financed, which is about an average level of debt for New Zealand companies. 4.22 The first two rows in table 4.1 show the DV rates of economic depreciation (d) and tax depreciation (d\*) that are being assumed. The columns report results for the different assets. The columns show the different assets being considered, including commercial and industrial buildings, PME with a range of economic and tax depreciation rates, zero-depreciation assets, inventory, appreciating assets and assets that can be expensed. For PME, we are assuming that tax depreciation rates reflect economic depreciation rates. For assets that can be expensed, the results hold irrespective of the economic depreciation rate assumed so no value for d is provided. 35 Tax depreciation is an immediate deduction for these assets. 4.23 It is helpful to start by considering the case where there is no inflation and when investment is fully equity financed. In this case, provided tax depreciation reflects economic depreciation, for zero-depreciation assets and for inventory that is taxed on a FIFO basis, EMTRs are all equal to 28.0%. This is the company tax rate and costs of capital are all 4.17%. 4.24 Interest is deductible and, if firms are partly debt financed, there will be lower costs of capital and EMTRs. If there were no inflation and investment were fully debt financed, EMTRs would also be the same across assets if economic depreciation is deductible. If there were no AIL, EMTRs for all these assets would be 0.0%. With AIL of 2%, EMTRs would all be approximately 2%. With 34 As is discussed in appendix 2, the domestic real interest rate would be expected to rise to ππ++ +(1)/ (1) aa rtt where r is the world real interest rate, π is the inflation rate and a t is the rate of AIL. 35 One submission suggested that the low EMTRs we report for expensing arise only for appreciating assets but Appendix 5 of the Technical appendices shows that the low EMTRs arise for depreciating assets as well. 46 an average level of debt of 43%, EMTRs for assets where economic depreciation is deductible would all be 18.7%. For any given level of debt, EMTRs would be the same across different assets so long as tax depreciation reflects economic depreciation and there is no inflation. Tax policy officials have often advocated setting tax depreciation rates as close to economic depreciation rates as possible because of the neutral way in which assets with different economic depreciation rates are taxed. However, this depends on there being no inflation.

In particular, for fully equity-financed investment, EMTRs will be greater than 28% if tax depreciation is slower than economic depreciation and less than 28% if economic income is only partially taxed or if tax depreciation is quicker than economic depreciation. For example, the EMTR rises to 30.7% if economic depreciation is 2.69% DV for commercial and industrial buildings but tax depreciation is only 2.00%. 4.27 If capital expenditure can be expensed, EMTRs will be 0% if investments are fully equity financed and negative if investments are partly debt financed. To consider the fully equity-financed case, suppose that there is no inflation. Suppose that marginal foreign shareholders demand a 3% return on their capital. If there were no tax, an investment that cost $10,000 at the end of year 0 and provided revenue of $300 at the end of each subsequent year would be a break-even investment because it provides marginal shareholders with the return they require. Suppose, however, that there is now a 28% company tax 47 rate and capital can be expensed. Tax will reduce the cost of the investment by 28%. It will also reduce revenues from the investment by 28%. But taxes will not affect the after-tax rate of return because costs and benefits fall by the same proportion. As the cost of capital will remain 3%, the EMTR will be 0%. 4.28 If the investment is partly debt financed, not only is the full cost of the asset immediately deductible, but there will also be a stream of interest deductions. This causes the cost of capital to fall below 3.0% and the EMTR to become negative. It becomes marginal to invest at a lower pre-tax rate of return than the cost of funds to the economy and investment is effectively being subsidised. In table 4.1 above, we see that, with 0% inflation, the EMTR is 0.0% if investment is fully equity financed and -12.9% if 43% debt financed. 4.29 Even in the absence of inflation, difficulties in measuring or applying economic depreciation or deliberate decisions to provide certain tax concessions will lead to a variety of EMTRs. 4.30 The second point to note, however, is that even if depreciation deductions reflected economic depreciation, small levels of inflation can upset the neutrality result. There are two key ways in which inflation can push up EMTRs and discourage investment. First, inflation can erode the real value of depreciation deductions. 4.31 Suppose that an asset is purchased at a cost of $10,000 at the end of year 0 and economic depreciation is 20%DV. In the absence of inflation, it would be worth $8,0 00 at the end of year 1, $6,400 at the end of year 2 and so forth. Also suppose that this is captured in depreciation schedules appropriately and the asset qualifies for 20% DV tax depreciation. This depreciation is a true cost of doing business and, in the absence of inflation, this true cost would be deductible. The firm would be able to claim depreciation of $2,000 over year 1, $1,600 over year 2 and so forth. 4.32 Suppose, however, there is 2% inflation per annum, so the value of money is falling by 2% per annum. To maintain the real value of depreciation deductions, the firm would need to be able to deduct $2,040 in year 1 (namely, $2,000x1.02), $1,665 in year 2 (namely $1,600x1.02x1.02) and so forth. The fact that depreciation deductions are not adjusted to take account of inflation will tend to push up costs of capital for fully equity-financed investment in depreciable assets. Note, however, that if someone invests in a zero- depreciation asset and this receives economic depreciation (that is, no depreciation), there will not be any similar penalty caused by inflation. As no depreciation is allowed, it does not matter whether the zero-depreciation deduction is adjusted for inflation. This creates a tax bias between investing in assets that depreciate and those that don’t. 4.33 Inflation can also erode the value of deductions for inventory. Suppose that an item of inventory is fully equity financed and purchased at the end of year 0 for $10,000. Suppose that it is sold one year later for $10,416.67. If there were no inflation, this would be a break-even investment. The deduction for the $10,000 cost of the inventory in year 0 would be fully offset by an increase in the value of stock on hand of $10,000 in that year. The $10, 000 would end up being deducted when the inventory is sold in the next year. If there were no inflation, the firm would pay tax of $116.67 and end up with the $10,300 that shareholders demand. Suppose that there is 2% inflation, however, and the asset is sold for a real value of $10,416.67. The real value of the deduction the firm receives would only be $9,803.92 so the firm would pay tax of $171.37 which is 28% of ($10,416.67 minus $9,803.92). The firm would end up with $10,245.10 after tax ($10,416.67 minus $171.37) which is less than what 48 shareholders require. Thus, deductions for inventories will also be eroded by inflation. 4.34 There is, of course, an important offset. If there is a real interest rate of 3% and inflation of 2%, firms will be able to deduct nominal interest expense of roughly 5%, even though only 3% is a real interest cost. This will lead to over- deductions for interest. 4.35 These effects are being picked up in table 4.1. First consider zero-depreciation assets. Consider a firm that is 43% debt financed. This firm benefits by being able to deduct the inflationary component of interest expense but faces no offsetting penalty. There is no erosion of depreciation deductions because zero- depreciation assets should not qualify for depreciation deductions. This reduces the EMTR from 18.7% to 11.2%. Similarly, appreciating assets and assets where capital expenditure can be expensed also benefit from being able to deduct the inflationary component of interest expense without any tax penalty on the income side. EMTRs for these two assets fall from 9.1% to -0.3% and from -12.9% to -23.3% respectively. 4.36 However, for most types of investment, EMTRs are likely to rise. In particular, for very short-lived investment in depreciable assets and for inventory, EMTRs can rise from 18.7% to 27.6% with 43% debt financing. Most often, inflation is likely to be pushing up EMTRs. This is likely to be discouraging investment in certain business (including those that have faster depreciating assets or inventories) and reducing the productivity of New Zealand’s capital stock. 36 Some assets that may be associated with technological diffusion such as computers and software have high economic rates of depreciation. 4.37 The maximum inflation rate considered in Table 2.1 is 2.0% per annum. Current inflation rates are considerably higher. If higher inflation rate were to continue into the future, distortions caused by variability in EMTRs would be greater than those reported in Table 2.1. 4.38 The impact of inflation depends on the real interest rate assumed. If the real interest rate rises, this will tend to reduce biases caused by inflation. This is discussed further in appendix 2 of the Technical appendices. Non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on interest and foreign-controlled companies 4.39 As has been discussed previously, NRWT on interest is unlikely to be levied very often on borrowings by companies that are not foreign controlled. For the companies analysed so far in this chapter, AIL is likely to be the main tax that is applied on interest payments overseas. However, foreign-controlled companies are required to levy NRWT rather than AIL on interest payments to related parties. 4.40 NRWT on interest may be levied at rates of either 15% or 10%. NRWT on interest is normally levied at a rate of 10% because of double tax agreements (DTAs). Foreign lenders will, at times, be able to claim tax credits for NRWT on interest, which can reduce foreign taxes dollar for dollar with NRWT collected 36 Even for assets that depreciate extremely quickly and are fully depreciated over the year they are first used, there is an important difference between economic depreciation and expensing. An asset acquired at the end of year 0 that is subject to economic depreciation is assumed to be depreciable in year 1, whereas an asset that can be expensed is assumed to be depreciable in year 0, the year in which it is acquired. This is consistent with the OECD methodology. This is discussed further in Appendix 3 of the Technical appendices. 49 in New Zealand. In this case, NRWT would not be expected to be driving up costs of capital. Often, however, NRWT will not be creditable or at least not creditable in full. In these cases, NRWT levied in New Zealand would be expected to be increasing costs of capital. 4.41 The levies and taxes imposed by way of AIL and NRWT can create some biases between costs of capital and EMTRs for different firms with marginal foreign shareholders. For domestic companies that are not foreign controlled with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders, we have the costs of capital and EMTRs discussed previously. For foreign-controlled companies, NRWT on interest must also be accounted for and results will depend on whether NRWT is creditable. 4.42 Other biases might also arise if these two types of company have very different debt levels. However, data presented in appendix 2 indicates that for both types of firm overall debt levels are similar on average (about 43%). Appendix 2 also discusses information from our International Questionnaire that suggests 37.3% of debt in foreign-controlled firms is associated-party debt, with the remaining 62.7% being from unrelated parties. On debt from unrelated parties, we expect nominal interest rates faced by foreign-controlled companies to be pushed up by 2% in exactly the same way as those for companies that are not foreign controlled. 4.43 On associated-party debt, we expect interest rates to be unaffected if NRWT on interest is fully creditable. We expect nominal interest rates to be pushed up by roughly 10% if NRWT is not creditable. 37 4.44 Estimated effects on costs of capital are examined in table 4.2, assuming a world real interest rate of 3% and 2% inflation. EMTRs can become somewhat difficult to interpret when we start to take account of creditable taxes such as NRWT. 38 For this reason, we focus solely on costs of capital, rather than both costs of capital and EMTRs, when we deal with creditable taxes. 37 As is discussed in appendix 1, the real interest rate rises to / (1)/ ( (1) (1) ) NNN r tttππ−++ − where N t is the rate of NRWT. 38 This issue is discussed in footnote 18 of Appendix 2 in the Technical appendices. 50 Table 4.2: Costs of capital for domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders and for foreign-controlled companies, r\* = 3%, inflation = 2%, debt = 43% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital No AIL or NRWT 3.77% 4.10% 4.07% 3.89% 3.71% 3.58% 3.34% 4.10% 2.95% 2.40% Domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholders AIL = 2% 3.81% 4.14% 4.11% 3.93% 3.76% 3.63% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% Foreign-controlled companies: AIL = 2% and NRWT = 10% NRWT creditable 3.80% 4.13% 4.10% 3.91% 3.74% 3.61% 3.36% 4.13% 2.97% 2.42% NRWT not creditable 3.88% 4.21% 4.18% 4.00% 3.83% 3.70% 3.45% 4.21% 3.06% 2.49% 4.45 We draw attention to the following points illustrated by table 4.3: • The figures in the fourth row of the table for domestic companies with marginal FPI and AIL at a rate of 2% are consistent with cost of capital figures from table 4.1 for the case when inflation is 2% and debt is 43%. There are substantial biases between different types of investment for reasons that have been discussed above. • By comparing the third and fourth rows, we see that AIL has pushed up costs of capital for domestic companies with marginal FPI but only by very small amounts. The 2% AIL has a very small effect on costs of capital. • By comparing the fourth and fifth rows, we see that the combination of AIL and NRWT has an even smaller effect on pushing up costs of capital for foreign-controlled companies that can claim credits for NRWT. This is unsurprising because, unlike AIL, NRWT is not increasing the cost of capital for these companies. The inter-asset biases remain. • By comparing the fourth and sixth rows, we see that the combination of AIL and NRWT has a bigger effect on costs of capital for foreign-controlled companies that cannot make use of credits for NRWT. • Differences in costs of capital going down the rows seem small relative to differences in costs of capital going across the rows. This suggests that tax biases between these different types of company are likely to be small relative to tax biases between different types of asset. SMEs where there may be little or no shareholding by non-residents 4.46 Appendix 2 of the Technical appendices also considers the possibility of an SME where non-residents are not marginal shareholders. Instead, the firm is owned by residents who can borrow or lend at a given real interest rate. In appendix 2, we consider two sub-variants. In the first, it is assumed that taxable profits are 51 fully distributed to domestic residents. In the second, it is assumed that profits are retained in the company. 4.47 Here we report only the results for the full distribution case. It is assumed that domestic residents are taxed at a marginal tax rate, m, of 33%, and the world real interest rate is 3%. The question arises which marginal rate to use for m. We use a rate of 33% because many higher-rate shareholders may be able to use trusts and other entities to limit the amounts of income taxed at the new top personal marginal tax rate of 39%. AIL pushes up the domestic real interest rate to 3.06% or 3.10% if the inflation rate is 0% or 2% per annum respectively. 4.48 Table 4.3 provides estimates of costs of capital and EMTRs. Table 4.3: Costs of capital and EMTRs for domestic SMEs - full distribution m = 33%, r = 3%, AIL = 2% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital Inflation = 0% 3.23% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 3.06% 2.57% 2.05% Inflation = 2% 2.71% 3.10% 3.07% 2.88% 2.67% 2.50% 2.13% 3.10% 1.64% 1.43% EMTRs Inflation = 0% 7.2% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% -16.8% -46.3% Inflation = 2% -10.5% 3.2% 2.2% -4.3% -12.4% -20.0% -40.6% 3.2% -82.8% -109.9% 4.49 We draw attention to the following points: • If inflation were zero, the EMTR for PME where economic depreciation is deductible, for zero-depreciation assets and for inventory would all be 2% and equal to the rate of AIL. This is regardless of the debt level in the company. By comparing this with table 4.1, we see that this is similar to results for domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders which are 100% debt financed. It is very different from the results in table 4.1 for full equity finance where, if inflation were zero, EMTRs would all be equal to the company tax rate. • A key reason for the difference in the results is that company tax is likely to have quite a different impact for firms where non-residents are marginal investors than for firms where there is no foreign shareholding and where domestic residents are marginal investors. In the modelling, it is assumed that the opportunity cost of investing equity capital in an SME is the after-tax interest rate that could otherwise be earned. Thus, whether investment in the SME is debt or equity financed, the opportunity cost of investment is the after-tax interest rate. Unlike companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders, there is no tax bias favouring debt finance relative to equity finance. • These results should be treated as provisional because there are a variety of different possible assumptions that can be made about the opportunity cost of capital for an SME and how heavily this is likely to be taxed. 52 • In table 4.1, we saw that small amounts of inflation could tend to increase costs of capital and EMTRs for equity-financed investment in many assets quite markedly. By contrast, we see that for domestic SMEs without marginal foreign shareholders, inflation often makes negative EMTRs more negative. • With 2% inflation, there will be small positive EMTRs for very short-lived PME and inventories, but significantly negative EMTRs for long-lived PME, zero-depreciating assets, appreciating assets and assets where capital expenditure can be expensed. • It should be noted that the fact that EMTRs are negative is because the (risk adjusted) cost of capital ends up being less than the real interest rate. It does not mean that those who invest their own capital in a business will pay negative amounts of tax. All that it is saying is they end up paying less tax than they would if they were earning interest. Another valid question is whether the tax impost on other forms of saving such as interest-bearing securities is appropriate. 39 • Changes in EMTRs across the different asset types are qualitatively similar to those provided by the OECD model for companies where non-residents are marginal shareholders. EMTRs are highest for inventory and PME with fast economic depreciation rates and lowest for assets where capital expenditure can be expensed. • Unlike the OECD model, there are no large positive EMTRs. This is because the after-tax real interest rate is the opportunity cost of both debt and equity finance. 39 In later chapters we discuss the possibility of inflation indexation and of a dual income tax with a possibly lower flat rate of tax on capital income. Either of these might relieve tax biases not by taxing business income from SMEs more heavily but by reducing taxes on some relatively heavily taxed forms of saving. 53 CHAPTER 5 Tax changes to reduce New Zealand’s costs of capital and EMTRs and make them more neutral • There are important trade-offs between competing objectives to consider when examining if, or how, to reduce taxes on inbound investment. • This chapter introduces some possible reform options that will be considered in more detail in later chapters and considers if, and how, they are likely to impact upon these competing objectives. Costs and benefits of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs 5.1 In chapter 2, we discussed a framework for evaluating taxes on inbound investment in a small open economy. There are trade-offs to consider when deciding on tax settings for inbound investment. 5.2 On the one hand, tax can discourage marginal inbound investment, and this can lower a country’s capital stock and reduce economic performance. The economic incidence of the tax is likely to be borne by domestic residents in a way that is more costly to them than if the same amount of revenue were raised by taxing the incomes of domestic residents directly. 5.3 On the other hand, we have discussed several reasons for levying source-based taxes. Source-based taxes tax location-specific rents (returns that are better than marginal) on investments that non-residents will want to make in New Zealand regardless of whether they are taxed. Given that New Zealand provides the infrastructure that firms require to generate these rents in New Zealand, there is a reasonable fairness case for New Zealand having a right to levy tax on these rents. In principle, there is an economic case for reducing EMTRs on marginal investment as much as possible while maintaining substantial taxes on location-specific rents. 5.4 An important consideration will be whether any company tax reductions in New Zealand are likely to lead to offsetting increases in tax payments overseas. Both external reviewer s questioned whether the draft LTIB put sufficient emphasis on the OECD’s Pillar 2 tax changes and their importance for domestic settings. These reforms are likely to result in a global minimum tax of 15%. This may mean that some tax changes that could be put in place to lower the cost of capital in New Zealand might lead to large multinational enterprises paying higher taxes in other countries. This is a factor to consider when thinking through the pros and cons of different possible tax changes. 5.5 Options that reduce taxes on sunk investments (investments made in the past) would provide a windfall benefit to those that invested in the past in the expectation of the current company tax rate continuing. Providing windfalls can be costly to New Zealand. Most taxes will create efficiency costs and providing windfalls which are financed with distorting taxes will normally be costly to New Zealand as a whole. This is especially so if a substantial fraction of the windfall flows to non-residents. Replacement taxes are likely to fall on New Zealanders. 5.6 Other issues may also be critical. One is the importance that is placed on the company tax base as a source of raising revenue. In its Long-Term Insights 54 Briefing and Long-Term Fiscal Position He Tirohanga Mokopuna 2021, 40 the Treasury has identified long-term fiscal pressures from an ageing population and rising healthcare demand. Moreover, responding to COVID-19 has been fiscally costly. A cut in company tax revenue would create pressure for increases in other taxes or cuts in government spending. Increases in taxes are always controversial. Governments may consider there is little scope to make changes that lead to a substantial reduction in company tax collections. 5.7 Another issue is the distributional effects of any tax changes. There are many ways of lowering costs of capital that can have different distributional effects. However, some, including lowering the company tax rate, may make it harder for the government to levy as progressive an income tax on individuals. High income earners may be able to shelter their income in companies and have it taxed at the company rate, rather than at higher personal tax rates, and a lower company tax rate would increase the benefits of doing so. These concerns might be able to be addressed in other ways, for example, by increasing taxes at the shareholder level. The overall implications of any package of measures on the progressivity of the tax system may be an overriding concern. 5.8 At the same time, chapter 3 provided evidence that New Zealand does appear to have higher costs of capital and EMTRs than most other OECD countries. It is reasonable to question whether New Zealand’s tax settings are appropriate or whether we are unnecessarily detracting from New Zealand’s economic performance and lowering productivity more than is desirable by taxing inbound investment relatively heavily. Choosing between different methods of reducing taxes on inbound investment 5.9 If a government wishes to reduce EMTRs on inbound investment on average, several potential aims and objectives will need to be traded off when considering the best way of doing so. 5.10 In chapter 4, we saw that not only was the current tax system likely to be leading to substantial costs of capital and EMTRs for many assets, but there were also major biases between different types of investments and between investments that are financed in different ways. Our current method of trying to allow for economic depreciation would be neutral if there were no inflation and we were successful in matching our tax depreciation rates to economic depreciation rates. In practice, we will never be able to measure economic depreciation very accurately. Moreover, there are biases created by even minor levels of inflation. Another issue is the way in which costs of capital and EMTRs can vary markedly for multinational firms with different debt levels. 5.11 An important question is whether measures to reduce EMTRs on average should be focussed on reducing higher EMTRs most, with smaller reductions in investments with lower EMTRs and possibly tax increases for investments with negative EMTRs. Is addressing current tax biases an important objective? 5.12 There are several other issues to consider. First is whether to maintain current levels of tax on location-specific rents. If so, how do we best reduce taxes on marginal investments without reducing taxes on these economic rents at the same time? 40 Treasury, ‘He tirohanga mokopuna 2021: the Treasury’s combined statement on the long- term fiscal position and the long-term insights briefing’ https://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/strategies-and-plans/long-term-insights-briefings 55 5.13 A second issue is whether to minimise windfall gains to firms with sunk investments. 5.14 A third issue is whether there is any case for targeted tax reductions for particular industries or activities rather than reducing taxes on inbound investment in a more general way. 5.15 Finally, there are the questions of how personal income should best be taxed, how any changes in company tax provisions should be integrated with personal taxation, and whether having good integration should be an objective. How governments wish to tax the income of individuals may place constraints on how they wish to tax companies. This can have implications for costs of capital and EMTRs. Conversely, concerns about costs of capital and EMTRs could lead to a consideration of how personal income itself should best be taxed. Possible options 5.16 There are many ways of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs with different impacts on tax neutrality. In subsequent chapters, we consider a small number of possible options and their pros and cons. The options chosen are key options to consider, but the list is not meant to be exhaustive. 5.17 For example, we discuss the possibility of a company tax rate reduction by itself (without any changes to the full imputation company tax system or any other measures to boost taxes at the shareholder level to maintain the progressivity of the personal income tax system). This would increase the incentive for those with a high income or wealth to shelter their income in companies and have the income taxed at a low company tax rate rather than higher rates of personal tax. 5.18 In practice, many other options could be considered. For example, the McLeod Review suggested reducing the company tax rate only for foreign-owned firms to lower the tax rate on inbound investment without giving rise to greater tax sheltering problems. Another alternative might be to shift back from an imputation system to the classical company tax system, where there is double taxation of dividends and no credits for company tax. This option was discussed in a 2009 paper to the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group. 41 A lower company tax rate might be accompanied by a tax on capital gains on shares. A further option we consider is a dual income tax, but there are many other options that could also be examined and may well be in the future. 5.19 At this stage we have not attempted to cost the different options. This is because many of the resulting revenue changes would require assumptions about how the rest of the tax system (in particular, the personal tax system) was being changed at the same time. As set out in many of the policy chapters in this LTIB (that is, chapters 6 to 12), unless changes to the personal tax system were being made, then any reform might make little sense. 5.20 The options we have identified include: • Lowering the company tax rate: This is discussed in chapter 6. This option would reduce taxes on marginal investments, which would reduce current biases between investment in different assets and investment financed in different ways. It would reduce distortions caused by inflation, as well as tax subsidies for tax-preferred investments with negative EMTRs, at the same time as reducing some of the relatively high EMTRs. 41 See Inland Revenue and Treasury (2009). 56 It would reduce transfer pricing pressures. It would also reduce taxes on location-specific rents and provide a windfall benefit for owners of sunk investments. As noted above, it is likely to reduce the progressivity of the tax system. • Accelerated depreciation: This is discussed in chapter 7. This option could lower tax on investments with some of the highest EMTRs. If restricted to new investment only, it would be doing so without providing a windfall to owners of sunk investments. This would constrain the costs but create some other distortions. At times, this could lead to investment subsidies and promote inefficient investment. • Indexation of the tax base: This is discussed in chapter 8. Some of the highest EMTRs are likely to be for short-lived depreciating assets and inventories, and these EMTRs will typically increase with inflation. One way of reducing these EMTRs would be to index the tax system comprehensively. This would be likely to reduce the highest EMTRs and make the tax system more neutral. No longer taxing the inflationary component of interest income is also likely to reduce savings distortions. The key argument against comprehensive indexation is the administration and compliance costs it is likely to impose. An alternative might be to index depreciation, or both depreciation and inventories, but not interest. As with accelerated depreciation measures, this could at times lead to investment subsidies and promote inefficient investment. It might, however, be a more neutral way of dealing with distortions caused by inflation than allowing accelerated depreciation. • A higher (less stringent) thin capitalisation threshold: This is discussed in chapter 9. This option would reduce costs of capital and EMTRs, but it would only do so for foreign-controlled firms. It is also likely only to be effective for firms that are trying to maximise their interest deductions and are close to the current thin capitalisation threshold. Data suggests that many foreign-controlled firms are not in that position. • Allowance for corporate equity (ACE) system: This would involve allowing firms a notional interest deduction for corporate equity and is discussed in chapter 10. In principle, it could reduce taxes on marginal inbound investment without forgoing tax on economic rents. It could also reduce or remove debt/equity biases. Some ACE systems have been designed to apply only to new investments to minimise windfalls. A key question is whether it is possible to minimise windfalls in a country like New Zealand without a capital gains tax. There is also the question of how such a tax would integrate with the personal tax system. This is difficult without a capital gains tax at least on sales of shares. • Specific incentives for certain types of business investment: This is discussed in chapter 11. Rather than providing measures that reduce costs of capital and EMTRs generally, this option would involve tax cuts targeted at specific investments. • Dual income tax system: This is discussed in chapter 12. This option would allow a lower company tax rate on inbound investment income in a way that would integrate well with personal income taxation. Dual income tax systems have been adopted in several Nordic countries, so their performance can be assessed. Despite involving a lower tax rate on capital income than on labour income, the system has been adopted by several countries with quite progressive fiscal systems. However, a move in this direction would go well beyond addressing cost of capital concerns. 57 Decisions would need to be made that it was fair and reasonable to tax capital income at lower rates than labour incomes. At the same time, a dual income tax system may possibly be used to support progressive tax rates on forms of income that can be taxed without too much distortion or evasion. 5.21 These options are explored further in subsequent chapters. Before doing so, it may be helpful to mention three issues that were raised in submissions on the draft LTIB and one issue that was raised by an external reviewer . 5.22 An issue that was raised in most submissions is that uncertainties, complexity and the chopping and changing of tax rules can discourage investment in ways that are not being analysed formally. Submissions called for greater clarity in the direction of future tax changes. This is perhaps one of the greatest underlying issues as we think through how tax policy might respond to longer- term challenges. Different future governments will have different views on how progressive the tax system should be, on how much revenue should be raised and how best to trade off fairness and efficiency concerns. It may be difficult to get much certainty about future directions unless New Zealand has a flexible enough tax system to accommodate governments with different policy objectives without wholesale restructurings of the tax system whenever governments change. A key issue will be the government’s flexibility to change the personal income tax scale in ways it considers best serve New Zealand as a whole. 5.23 This is discussed in subsequent chapters. The current New Zealand tax system was designed in the late 1980s around a system where the company tax rate, the trustee tax rate and the top personal marginal tax rate were all aligned. This prevented companies or trusts being used to shelter income from higher rates of personal income. This was complemented with a full imputation system which ensured that once companies distributed profits to domestic shareholders, the profits ended up being taxed at the marginal tax rates of shareholders. The underlying goal was to create a tax system where personal tax rates could not easily be sidestepped. Since then the company tax rate has decreased and the top personal marginal tax rate has increased. This makes it easier for companies and trusts to be used to shelter income from higher rates of personal income tax. At the same time New Zealand’s company tax rate is higher than average for OECD countries and the top personal marginal tax rate is lower than average. As a result New Zealand has a relatively small gap between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal tax rate. A question is whether New Zealand’s tax system is sufficiently flexible to accommodate governments with different views on how progressive the tax system should be or how much revenue should be raised. 5.24 In their submission on the draft LTIB, CA ANZ argued that most of the measures we list are likely to be ineffective in reducing costs of capital and promoting investment. This is because foreign-controlled companies operating in New Zealand have transfer pricing agreements with Inland Revenue that may be based on profit methods. They may require taxable profits returned for New Zealand to be some fixed percentage of sales. If this is the case, CA ANZ argue that many of the options would not impact on the taxes paid by these firms. 5.25 We have discussed this issue with Inland Revenue experts working on these transfer pricing agreements and do not agree with CA ANZ on this. Any profit method is based on benchmarking comparable company behaviour/results and is not an arbitrary formula. Inland Revenue will benchmark the New Zealand operating margin of a subsidiary against those of other independent comparable companies. Generally speaking, the comparable companies will be in the same industry and subject to the same or similar trading conditions as the subsidiary. 58 Their behaviour will be influenced by any special depreciation rates, tax incentives and so forth. By lowering taxes paid by comparable firms, measures that reduce company tax are likely to be factored into lower tax payments under transfer pricing agreements based on profit methods. Also the CA ANZ analysis only applies to foreign-controlled firms. The cost of capital and EMTR issues we are considering apply to other companies as well. 5.26 A separate issue was raised by the Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG). It commented on the negative EMTRs that can arise with expensing if investment is partially debt financed, identified in chapter 4 above. The CTG notes that the subsidies identified would not arise if companies were in a tax loss position. The CTG asserts that most firms benefitting from expensing will be in a tax loss position, but we doubt whether there is any good data on this. However, it is correct to point out that the analysis is considering only firms that are in a profitable taxpaying position. As mentioned earlier, about 34% of companies had a loss they carried forward from the 2019/20 to the 2020/21 year, and these firms are not being picked up in our estimates of EMTRs. This is a broader concern than the expensing issue and would impact on the effectiveness of all the policy options we discuss. It is a complex issue to work through and is left for further work. There is, however, an associated issue. Some of the possible options, such as accelerated depreciation provisions, may make it much more common for companies to end up in a tax loss position. When considering the desirability of these options in the future, it is likely to be important to extend the analysis to consider firms in a tax loss position as well. This is especially so if the tax changes being contemplated are likely to make it more likely for firms to end up in a tax loss position. 5.27 One reviewer suggested that some of the options should be considered as alternatives rather than as options that might be adopted at the same time. For example, consider accelerated depreciation or a less stringent thin capitalisation threshold. If, say, we were to allow expensing for investments, EMTRs would be negative whenever there is any debt. The more generous the depreciation deductions or other capital write off provisions are, the greater the case for tightening, rather than loosening, thin capitalisation provisions. Thus, at times, there may be an either/or choice between the options listed. Also a set of tax changes that reduces costs of capital and EMTRs on average may include some measures that are increasing and others that are decreasing these costs of capital and EMTRs. 59 CHAPTER 6 Reducing the company tax rate • Reducing the company tax rate would reduce the relatively high costs of capital and EMTRs that apply to many forms of investment into New Zealand. • This is likely to encourage efficient marginal investment that would otherwise not take place, and this is likely to promote economic efficiency and productivity. • This would also reduce distortions between different types of assets and different methods of finance. These distortions arise in part because of difficulties in measuring economic income. • This would reduce tax subsidies to investments with negative EMTRs. • It would also reduce transfer pricing pressures. • At the same time, there are trade-offs to consider. This would provide a windfall to firms with existing investments and to firms earning location- specific economic rents that would invest regardless of any cut in the company tax rate. • Unless accompanied by higher taxes at the shareholder level, a reduction in the company tax rate is likely to make the personal income tax system less progressive and increase the benefits of sheltering personal income in companies. • This is likely to reduce the integrity of the personal income tax system. Introduction 6.1 Company tax is the major tax on inbound investment in New Zealand and changes to the company tax rate can have a significant effect on costs of capital and EMTRs. 6.2 One of the many ways the cost of capital can be lowered in New Zealand is by reducing the company tax rate from the current 28%. This would reduce marginal taxation on inbound investment and potentially attract foreign investment. It might attract some additional firms to set up operations in New Zealand. However, this policy option comes with trade-offs, such as loss of taxation from location-specific economic rents and more scope for personal income to be sheltered in companies. This could reduce the progressivity and integrity of the personal income tax. The dual role of company tax 6.3 Company tax has two roles. One supports the coherence of personal tax settings and makes sure that higher income earners do not pay very low rates of tax on the income they earn. The second role is to tax income earned by non-resident investors investing into New Zealand, both as foreign direct investment (FDI) by foreign-controlled entities and foreign portfolio investment (FPI) into domestic companies. 60 6.4 Supporting the coherence of personal income tax settings creates a motivation to make the company rate as close to the top personal rate as possible. If the company rate is significantly lower than the top personal rate, there is an incentive for those with high income and wealth to use companies to shelter income from higher rates of personal tax. 6.5 However, company tax is also a tax on non-resident investment into New Zealand and high taxes may reduce investment, capital stock and economic performance. Concerns about taxes on marginal inbound investment and the cost of capital may create an opposing motivation to cut the company rate. 6.6 This dual role was acknowledged in the 2001 McLeod Tax Review, and this led to a consideration of cutting the company rate, but only to the extent that it applied to non-resident shareholding. This would mean that companies owned by domestic residents would continue to be taxed closer to the top personal rate. 6.7 The Review further suggested restricting this cut to new activities, or significant expansions of existing activities, by non-residents. This would more narrowly target new investment by non-residents, which would avoid providing a significant windfall to those who had invested in the past. It would mean that the tax cut was focused where investment responses were likely to be sensitive to tax. 6.8 The McLeod Review suggestion was a logical and more targeted response to cost of capital concerns that takes into account the dual nature of company tax. In practice, we suspect it may be difficult to limit a company tax cut to new investment only. It could seem unfair to firms replacing their capital stock if existing firms face a different tax rate from new firms. 42 Having a lower tax on foreign-owned firms is not common internationally, and its economic justification is likely to be difficult to explain to domestic businesses who think they also should benefit from a company tax rate cut. 6.9 In this chapter, we focus on the implications of a general cut to the company tax rate for both New Zealand residents and non-residents. There are other more targeted options, such as the McLeod Review suggestion, that could also be considered in the future. These could reduce some of the downsides of the company tax rate cut that we consider. Impact on costs of capital and EMTRs 6.10 In chapter 4 we discussed how inflation and the mismeasurement of income could affect costs of capital and EMTRs. 6.11 Costs of capital and EMTRs are estimated in table 6.1 for a domestic company with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders, assuming a world real interest rate of 3% and 2% per annum inflation in New Zealand. As in the OECD analysis, we also assume that foreign shareholders demand a real return of 3% on their funds net of any domestic taxes. Because of the approved issuer levy (AIL), the domestic real interest rate is bid up to 3.10%. We assume that firms are 43% debt financed and the depreciation deductions are set to mirror how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation for plant, machinery and equipment (PME). 42 At the same time, countries that have introduced an allowance for corporate equity have most often restricted this allowance to new equity only, which raises some of the same issues. This is discussed in chapter 10. 61 6.12 We examine three possible company tax rates: 28%, 24% and 20%. Table 6.1: Costs of capital and EMTRs, domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders, debt = 43%, r\* = 3%,inflation = 2%, AIL = 2% Company tax rate options Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital t = 28% 3.81% 4.14% 4.11% 3.93% 3.76% 3.63% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% t = 24% 3.67% 3.94% 3.91% 3.76% 3.62% 3.51% 3.32% 3.94% 3.00% 2.52% t = 20% 3.53% 3.75% 3.73% 3.61% 3.50% 3.41% 3.26% 3.75% 3.01% 2.61% EMTRs t = 28% 21.3% 27.6% 27.0% 23.7% 20.1% 17.3% 11.2% 27.6% -0.3% -23.3% t = 24% 18.1% 23.8% 23.3% 20.2% 17.1% 14.6% 9.5% 23.8% 0.0% -19.0% t = 20% 15.1% 20.0% 19.5% 16.9% 14.2% 12.1% 8.0% 20.0% 0.3% -15.1% 6.13 We draw attention to several points: • Focusing on the current tax rules (rows where t = 28%), we see that costs of capital can vary significantly from 4.14% for very short-lived PME and inventories to 2.43% for assets that can be expensed. 43 The real cost of funds to New Zealand is assumed to be 3.00%, so this varies from a substantial tax (an EMTR of 27.6%) to a significant subsidy (with an EMTR of -23.3%). • Reducing the company tax rate to 20% would narrow this range of EMTRs to between 20.0% and -15.0%. • Thus, unsurprisingly, a cut in the company tax rate lowers costs of capital for investments that are heavily taxed and reduces tax subsidies for investments that are subsidised. This reduces tax distortions between investment in different assets. Pros Lowering costs of capital when EMTRs are high 6.14 A benefit of a company tax rate cut is that this would address New Zealand’s relatively high costs of capital and promote additional investment in activities that have high EMTRs. This is likely to increase economic efficiency and productivity. Reducing distortions between different investments 6.15 As discussed in chapter 4, an attraction of allowing economic depreciation ( at least if there is no inflation) is that it would promote neutrality across different types of investment for any company. There would be incentives to invest in the most productive assets rather than assets that provide the biggest tax 43 These are, of course, identical to the estimates provided in table 4.1 for domestic companies with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders in the case where debt is 43% and inflation is 2%. 62 advantages. Hurdle rates of return across different possible investments would be the same. 6.16 There is, however, a major difficulty in setting depreciation rates to mirror economic depreciation because we are far from certain about how different assets are likely to depreciate. As a result, biases to investment decisions are inevitable. These are likely to be compounded by inflation if the tax system is not indexed to take account of inflation. Biases will also be created if, for practical reasons, some forms of income are untaxed (for example, because there is no tax on capital gains) or because certain forms of capital expenditure can be expensed. An obvious way of reducing these distortions is to lower the company tax rate. As table 6.1 above shows, reducing the company tax rate will tend to reduce investment biases. There is a narrower range of costs of capital when the company tax rate is 20% (from 3.75% to 2.61%) than when the company tax rate is 28% (from 4.14% to 2.43%). Reducing base erosion and profit shifting 6.17 New Zealand has reasonably robust anti-av oidance rules to mitigate the risk of tax base erosion and profit shifting. Nevertheless, no rules will be watertight, and if profits are shifted away from New Zealand, this will tend to reduce New Zealand’s national income and reduce tax collections. This puts upward pressure on the levels of taxes New Zealanders must pay. 6.18 New Zealand becomes more vulnerable to international profit shifting if its company tax rate is high relative to tax rates in other countries. Other measures, such as the OECD’s Pillar 2 tax changes, are likely to result in a global minimum tax of 15% for larger multinational enterprises. This is likely to reduce incentives to shift profits out of New Zealand. However, a potential benefit of reducing the company tax rate is that this would further reduce the incentive for firms to shift profits out of New Zealand to countries with lower company tax rates. Cons Reducing tax revenue on existing investments 6.19 One disadvantage associated with reducing the company tax rate is that it would reduce the tax revenue from existing investments in New Zealand. This provides windfall gains to existing owners of firms where the investment was undertaken with the expectation that future returns would be taxed at a higher rate. Ideally, it would be preferable to limit any company tax rate reductions to new investments only, as it is only in this case that new investment will be promoted. However, this is likely to be impractical with a company tax rate cut. Loss of taxation on location-specific economic rents 6.20 Furthermore, a company tax rate cut would mean reducing taxes on location- specific economic rents. Economic rents are returns over and above those required for investment to take place, and location-specific means the rents arise from factors that are linked to a location. If we forgo tax on these rents and must levy replacement taxes, these replacement taxes are likely to be less efficient than the taxes we have forgone. Rents of this kind are likely to be larger in a geographically isolated market like New Zealand where supply of certain goods and services is likely to be helped by having a physical presence. New Zealand’s geographical remoteness is likely to create a bigger than normal barrier to many goods and services being supplied from nearby other countries. 63 Consistency, fairness and efficiency of personal income tax 6.21 A reduction in the company tax rate would mean that income being earned through companies is taxed at rates that ar e further below the higher rates of personal tax rates than they are at present. Personal tax rates are set to reflect a government’s views on the level of progressivity that is desirable so that higher income earners pay rates of tax that are deemed to be fair. This goal is undermined if income taxed in different entities is taxed at significantly lower rates. 6.22 The tax system becomes less fair if people with high levels of wealth and income can shelter income in companies to avoid the top personal tax rates. As noted in chapter 2, in 2018 roughly 8% of tax paid by high-wealth individuals was tax on personal income, 21% was on trustee income and 71% was on company income. Only small amounts of the taxable income of high-wealth individuals are taxed at personal rates. There is now a 5% rate differential between the company rate and trust rate (33%), and a greater 11% rate differential between the company rate and the top personal tax rate (39%). This can provide even greater incentives for higher income earners to shelter income in companies and have it taxed at the company tax rate rather than at personal tax rates. 6.23 Reducing the company tax rate would exacerbate these gaps unless personal tax rates were cut at the same time. Cutting personal tax rates may be supported by some future governments but not by others. 6.24 If governments want to lower the company tax rate and maintain the progressivity of the New Zealand tax system, higher levels of tax might be needed at the shareholder level. One option might be a tax on gains from share sales. As discussed by Chen and Mintz (2009), New Zealand is particularly vulnerable to a gap between the company tax rate and the top personal tax rate because of the absence of any tax on capital gains. As a result, those on the top marginal tax rate of 39% can have income taxed at a low rate if this is earned in a company and then gains are realised by selling shares in the company. Chen and Mintz expressed surprise that New Zealand had not adopted the solution of taxing share gains to help with integrity concerns. 6.25 Company tax rates and top personal marginal tax rates in OECD countries are provided in table 6.2. Having a small gap between the company tax rate and the top personal rate is attractive because it limits the scope for personal income to be sheltered in companies. At the same time, New Zealand’s gap between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal tax rate is not high compared to other OECD countries. In 2020, the latest year for which OECD data is provided, New Zealand had a company tax rate of 28% and a top personal marginal tax rate of 33%. The gap between the two was 5 percentage points, which was the fifth equal lowest gap for the 37 OECD countries for which data is recorded. Even now, with a top marginal tax rate of 39% and an 11 percentage point gap, the gap is not large compared with other OECD countries. Only six other OECD countries had a smaller gap than this in 2020. 64 Table 6.2: Company and top personal tax rates – 2020 Country Company tax rate Top marginal tax rate Difference Australia 30.0 47.0 17.0 Austria 25.0 55.0 30.0 Belgium 25.0 52.9 27.9 Canada 26.2 53.5 27.3 Chile 10.0 35.0 25.0 Colombia 32.0 33.0 1.0 Czech Republic 19.0 15.0 -4.0 Denmark 22.0 55.9 33.9 Estonia 20.0 20.0 0.0 Finland 20.0 51.2 31.2 France 32.0 55.4 23.4 Germany 29.9 47.5 17.6 Greece 24.0 54.0 30.0 Hungary 9.0 15.0 6.0 Iceland 20.0 46.2 26.2 Ireland 12.5 48.0 35.5 Israel 23.0 50.0 27.0 Italy 27.8 47.2 19.4 Japan 29.7 55.9 26.2 Korea 27.5 46.2 18.7 Latvia 20.0 31.4 11.4 Lithuania 15.0 32.0 17.0 Luxembourg 24.9 45.8 20.9 Mexico 30.0 35.0 5.0 Netherlands 25.0 49.5 24.5 New Zealand 28.0 33.0 5.0 Norway 22.0 38.2 16.2 Poland 19.0 32.0 13.0 Portugal 31.5 53.0 21.5 Slovak Republic 21.0 25.0 4.0 Slovenia 19.0 50.0 31.0 Spain 25.0 43.5 18.5 Sweden 21.4 52.3 30.9 Switzerland 21.1 41.7 20.6 Turkey 22.0 40.8 18.8 United Kingdom 19.0 45.0 26.0 United States 25.8 43.7 17.9 Average 23.1 42.6 19.5 65 6.26 If about 39% of gains were taxable, so gains on shares were taxed at a rate of approximately 15.2%, there would be a similar tax impost when shares are sold to when imputed dividends are paid for shareholders taxed at the top personal marginal tax rate. 44 Of course, there are other issues to consider. Taxing gains on shares would add to compliance costs but it might provide a revenue base that could help reduce costs of capital and EMTRs, especially if it were accompanied by taxing other forms of capital gain as well. Taxing gains on shares or other forms of capital gains may be unlikely as a short-term or medium-term measure. However, many other countries tax these gains and this may be feasible in the longer term. 6.27 There may be options (other than taxing gains on shares) that could make a significant difference between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal tax rate less of a concern. There appear to be some other countries with a larger gap than New Zealand (for example, Switzerland and Belgium) that also do not tax gains on shares. It is possible these countries have ways of making a large gap between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal tax rate less of a concern without taxing gains on shares. However, it is also possible these gaps are creating important inconsistencies in these countries as well. 6.28 Other options might involve shifting away from New Zealand’s full imputation company tax system to one that leads to heavier taxation of dividends. This would, however, create additional pressures for a tax on gains from share sales and make it less attractive for those on lower marginal tax rates to invest in companies. There would also be a broad set of other pros and cons to consider. 6.29 New Zealand is not alone in needing to work through these sorts of issues. In a recent paper, McKenzie (2021) suggests higher taxes on dividends and capital gains plus taxation of rents at the company level as a possible option for Canada. In an accompanying paper, Smart (2021) discusses pressures that arise in Canada through sheltering of personal income in closely held companies. International experience 6.30 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, New Zealand had a relatively low company tax rate compared to most OECD countries, which made New Zealand a relatively attractive place to invest. However, as at 2021, New Zealand’s company rate of 28% is the 9 th highest in the OECD. This is due to the ongoing trend for OECD countries to cut their company tax rates, which has been prompted by concerns about promoting investment and reducing international tax avoidance. Substantial cuts in company tax rates have occurred in non- OECD countries as well. 6.31 An important aspect of this trend is that the competition for tax base and location of companies is likely to be greater in countries that are close substitutes. In Europe, a business may, at times, be able to supply a large 44 If $100 is earned as company income and this is taxed at the 28% company tax rate, this leaves $72 net of company tax. If this is taxed at 15.2% when shares are sold, this would mean a further $11 of tax, leaving a shareholder on the 39% marginal tax rate with approximately $61 of after-tax income. This tax on gains could be achieved by including 39% of the gain as taxable income because 39% × 39% is approximately 15.2%. This ignores some timing issues. With a 39% tax on share gains, there could still be advantages in those on the top marginal tax rate accumulating profits in companies for lengthy periods before selling these to generate capital gains. 66 number of countries out of one country. In that case, a tax rate decrease may attract businesses that were otherwise largely indifferent to location. 6.32 Australia is the closest country to New Zealand, and if Australia were to reduce its company tax rate, this might put downward pressure on New Zealand’s company tax rate. Currently, just over half of foreign direct investment into New Zealand is from Australia, 45 and a reduction in Australia’s company tax rate would increase incentives for profits to be streamed to Australia. Australia’s company tax rate for larger companies is 30%, which is higher than New Zealand’s company tax rate (although Australia has a lower 26% rate for small to medium companies). Our relative company tax rate is only one of several factors to consider. A bigger issue may be the Australian full imputation system. This currently provides incentives for companies with Australian parents to pay tax in Australia rather than New Zealand. This is because Australian imputation credits (referred to as franking credits in Australia) are available for taxes paid in Australia but not those paid in New Zealand. 6.33 There are recent indications that there may be some movement back towards higher company tax rates internationally. Many countries are examining how best to repair their fiscal position after their COVID-19 response, and this may reduce downward pressure on company tax rates. The UK has announced an intention to increases its company tax rate from 19% to 25%. Most recently, 130 out of 139 jurisdictions have signed up to a new international tax framework that would result in a global minimum company tax rate of 15% targeted at income from intangibles. All of this may be reducing or even end up reversing the long downward trend in company tax rates that has been evident in the last 40 years. However, the OECD unweighted and weighted average company tax rates have continued to decline in recent years (see figure 1.1). Should future company tax rate cuts be signalled in advance? 6.34 If governments wished to cut the company tax rate, the question arises whether to do this in a way that minimises windfalls for sunk investments. One way of doing so might be to announce a commitment to cut the rate at some stage in the future. A credible announcement of a future company tax rate cut, or a programme of such cuts, could promote investment before the cuts taking place. This could reduce the windfall element in the future company tax rate cuts. But it can be difficult for governments to make credible commitments for tax cuts to occur too far into the future. In its submission on the draft LTIB, Business NZ suggested that any promised tax changes should be signalled and occur within a government’s political term. Implications for unincorporated enterprises and domestic SMEs operating as companies 6.35 Some businesses are organised as sole proprietorships or partnerships and, in these enterprises, income is taxed at the personal tax rates of the owners. For domestic small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that operate as companies and are fully distributing profits to their domestic owners, this income will also be taxed at personal rates. 6.36 The question might be asked whether personal tax rates should be cut at the same time as the company tax rate. If personal tax rates are designed to reflect a government’s goals on the progressivity of the tax system, a reduction in the 45 Statistics NZ National Accounts Data for the year to 31 March 2021. 67 company tax rate because of cost of capital concerns should not provide a case for lower personal tax rates. Rather, the issue should be how to ensure that company income is adequately taxed at the personal level to ensure that company income ends up being taxed at appropriate personal rates. Views of stakeholders 6.37 Stakeholders had mixed reactions to the idea of a reduction in the company tax rate. For Business NZ, this was the preferred way of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs. Business NZ argued that the company rate had a strong and positive signalling effect, promoting New Zealand as a good place in which to invest. At the same time, Business NZ expressed concerns about integrity pressure that arises when the company tax rate and top personal marginal rate are poorly aligned. It argued for cuts to personal income tax rates as well. 6.38 The Corporate Taxpayers Group was also supportive of a cut to the company tax rate while recognising that this created important integrity concerns. It was not convinced that these concerns could be efficiently and effectively addressed by taxing gains on shareholders. It was, however, supportive of de veloping a process to work through changes that might accompany a cut in the company tax rate. 6.39 CA ANZ did not believe that it would be appropriate for New Zealand to cut its company tax rate. They also voiced concerns about greater integrity pressures from a bigger gap between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal tax rate. 68 CHAPTER 7 Accelerated Depreciation • Accelerated depreciation schemes are measures that many countries have used to incentivise investment. • They could reduce higher costs of capital and EMTRs by reducing taxes on marginal investments, and by offsetting some biases caused by inflation they could potentially increase the neutrality of many forms of investment. • They would, however, lead to biases between assets that benefit from these accelerated depreciation schemes and inventories. • An attraction of accelerated depreciation schemes relative to a company tax rate cut is that accelerated depreciation could be restricted to new investments and minimise windfalls. • At the same time, restricting accelerated depreciation to new investment would create some distortions by discouraging sales of assets. • Accelerated depreciation would also not be as likely to create tax sheltering opportunities as a cut in the company tax rate would. • Unlike a cut in the company tax rate, accelerated depreciation would not reduce biases between debt and equity financing by non-resident investors. • Accelerated depreciation would also not reduce international tax avoidance pressures caused by New Zealand’s company tax rate being higher than the company tax rates in many other countries. • At times, accelerated depreciation may lead to investment subsidies and promote inefficient investment, especially if depreciation is very substantially accelerated. Introduction 7.1 Accelerated depreciation or additional deductions for capital costs (such as investment allowances) or tax credits are commonly used by countries to lower the cost of capital and incentivise investment. 7.2 Before 2010, New Zealand allowed accelerated depreciation of machinery and equipment but not buildings. Accelerated depreciation as a deliberate policy was removed in 2010. Possible accelerated depreciation measures 7.3 In this chapter we focus on two types of accelerated depreciation measures: depreciation loading and partial expensing. • Depreciation loading means allowing a deduction from taxable income that is greater than the standard depreciation rate. Suppose an asset would normally receive a diminishing value (DV) rate of depreciation of 10% each year. This means that if an asset costs $10,000, $1,000 would be allowed as a depreciation deduction in the first year, $900 (namely, 69 10% of the residual balance of $9,000) in the next year and so forth. Now suppose that an additional 20% depreciation loading is permitted. The yearly DV depreciation deduction would be increased to 12%. • Partial expensing means that a portion of the cost of a new asset can be deducted immediately (in the year that an asset is acquired) from taxable income. The remaining cost of the asset is deducted at the normal depreciation rate. For example, suppose once more that an asset costs $10,000 and would normally qualify for a 10% DV rate of depreciation. Now suppose that partial expensing of 50% is permitted. Taxable income is reduced by $5,000 immediately. The remaining $5,000 is depreciated at a 10% DV rate of depreciation. Impacts on costs of capital and EMTRs 7.4 Table 7.1 reports the estimated EMTRs for various assets. As in chapter 6, we assume that the assets are held by a domestic company with marginal foreign shareholders. The world real interest rate is 3%, and non-resident shareholders demand a real rate of return of 3% net of any New Zealand taxes. Due to approved issuer levy (AIL), the domestic real interest rate is bid up to 3.10%. Furthermore, we assume that firms are 43% debt financed. The depreciation allowance rates for ‘plant, machinery, and equipment’ (PME) are assumed to be set to mirror how the asset would depreciate in the absence of inflation. Rows 3–5 report estimated costs of capital and rows 6– 8 report estimated EMTRs. We consider three possible tax treatments: • the status quo • 20% depreciation loading for both buildings and PMEs, and • 20% partial expensing for buildings and for PMEs with depreciation rates greater than zero. 7.5 The question arises how depreciation loading would be applied to an asset that qualifies for full depreciation of \* 100%dd= = over its first year. This is because it would be impossible to give a depreciation loading without allowing more than the full cost of the asset to be depreciated. We assume that current depreciation rules are maintained for these assets, so costs of capital and EMTRs are unchanged from the status quo. An alternative might be to allow some level of partial expensing in lieu of depreciation loading for those assets for which \* 100%dd== . This would mean allowing some fraction of the cost of the asset (perhaps 20% or 40%) to be written off in the year that the asset is acquired rather than in the subsequent year even if the asset is acquired right at the end of an income year. 70 Table 7.1: Costs of capital and EMTRs, domestic company with foreign marginal portfolio shareholders, debt = 43%, r\* = 3%, inflation = 2%, AIL = 2% Status quo compared with accelerated depreciation options Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital Status quo 3.81% 4.14% 4.11% 3.93% 3.76% 3.63% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% Depreciation loading 3.73% 4.14% 3.85% 3.75% 3.64% 3.56% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% Partial expensing 3.54% 3.80% 3.78% 3.63% 3.49% 3.39% 3.38% 4.14% 2.99% 2.43% EMTRs Status quo 21.3% 27.6% 27.0% 23.7% 20.1% 17.3% 11.2% 27.6% -0.3% -23.3% Depreciation loading 19.6% 27.6% 22.1% 20.0% 17.6% 15.6% 11.2% 27.6% -0.3% -23.3% Partial expensing 15.1% 21.1% 20.5% 17.4% 14.1% 11.4% 11.2% 27.6% -0.3% -23.3% 7.6 We draw attention to the following points: • As has been discussed elsewhere, the current rules lead to considerable variety in costs of capital, varying from 4.14% for heavily taxed PME and inventories to 2.43% for assets that can be expensed. EMTRs vary from 27.6% to -23.3%. • Either form of accelerated depreciation would be a way of lowering some of the higher costs of capital and EMTRs. For example, consider assets that are provided with a 50% rate of depreciation (such as computers). Depreciation loading would drop the EMTR from 27.0% to 22.1%. Partial expensing would drop the EMTR a bit further to 20.5%. In the absence of inflation, all depreciable and non-depreciable assets would have an EMTR of 18.7%. Thus, either change could be thought of as offsetting some of the upward bias to EMTRs that is caused by inflation for these assets. • Depreciation loading would have a smaller effect than partial expensing on assets with lower depreciation rates. For example, an asset with a 2% rate of depreciation has an EMTR of 17.3% under current tax rules. It is significantly less heavily taxed than assets with much faster economic depreciation rates. Such an asset’s EMTR falls to 15.6% under loading or 11.4% under partial expensing. • Neither of the measures would increase tax subsidies to appreciating assets or assets that can be expensed. Nor would they reduce the high EMTR of 27.6% faced by inventories although it would always be possible to consider a separate measure to help reduce EMTRs on inventories. Effects of the two accelerated depreciation schemes on neutrality 7.7 Either of the two schemes would reduce EMTRs on depreciating assets that are currently facing high EMTRs. This would reduce disparities in EMTRs between these assets and assets that are taxed less heavily. At the same time, they 71 would introduce a tax bias between these depreciating assets and inventories unless there were also measures to reduce EMTRs on inventories. 7.8 Of the two schemes, depreciation loading seems more targeted at depreciating assets with high EMTRs. Depreciation loading gives a relatively small benefit to assets that depreciate slowly, while partial expensing provides a significant benefit to all depreciating assets. One possible argument for depreciation loading rather than partial expensing is that this would tend to offset the high EMTRs faced by PME with higher rates of economic depreciation. Thus, it would tend to counteract some of the inflation biases discussed in chapter 4. As is discussed in chapter 8, a more direct way of counteracting these biases would be to index the tax system for inflation. If the tax system were indexed for inflation, partial expensing is likely to be considerably more neutral than depreciation loading. Whether or not the tax system is indexed for inflation can obviously affect the desirability of different accelerated depreciation options. 7.9 The results for depreciation loading for assets that fully depreciate over a year look anomalous (the EMTR remains 27.6% when EMTRs for other depreciating assets are falling). As has been discussed above, an alternative might be to allow partial expensing for these particular assets. 7.10 These are just two types of accelerated depreciation. It may be possible to devise a scheme that is better targeted at supporting assets with relatively high EMTRs. Design issues New or all investment 7.11 Accelerated depreciation can be restricted to new assets. This would mean a firm that owns depreciable assets on the day the new scheme came into force would not benefit from a higher depreciation rate on these assets. Also, if it sold these assets to a new purchaser, the new purchaser could only claim depreciation at the old depreciation rates. 7.12 New Zealand used to allow a 20% loading for purchases of new machinery and equipment. This provision, which was repealed in 2010, was restricted to purchases of new machinery and equipment. 7.13 Restricting accelerated depreciation to new assets minimises windfall benefits to firms that have invested in the past. It reduces the fiscal cost of accelerated depreciation. If accelerated depreciation were given to incentivise investment, there would seem to be little reason to allow it on investments that have already taken place. 7.14 At the same time, restricting accelerated depreciation to new assets would have implications for assets that were acquired new after the accelerated depreciation scheme came into force. It would mean that the assets would only continue to qualify for accelerated depreciation if they were retained by their initial owner. Restricting accelerated depreciation to new investment might create biases. For example, some firms might want to use relatively new trucks or buses only, while other firms may be quite willing to use older trucks or buses. Efficiency may decrease if tax is an obstacle to assets being acquired by those who will use them most productively. Treatment of firms in loss 7.15 Accelerated depreciation confers a benefit to businesses that have tax liabilities, but it may confer little or no benefit to businesses that are in tax loss. This can 72 be distortionary. The draft LTIB suggested that this bias may be of little concern because it is only for firms that are in a taxpaying position that high costs of capital and EMTRs will arise. However, one of the reviewers has pointed out that start-up companies and other companies that are temporarily in loss may also sometimes face high EMTRs. This is something that could be explored further in future work. Asset limitations 7.16 If a system of accelerated depreciation were put in place, the question of which assets should be included in the scheme would arise. Depreciation loading is only relevant for assets that are depreciable for tax purposes. Potentially, a system of partial expensing could apply not only to depreciable assets, but also to non-depreciating assets or even appreciating assets. However, table 7.1 suggests that non-depreciating and appreciating assets are unlikely to face high EMTRs. As a result, it would seem appropriate for any partial expensing scheme to also be limited to depreciating assets. 7.17 Before 2010, New Zealand applied depreciation loading to machinery and equipment but not buildings. Buildings depreciate relatively slowly and assets that depreciate more slowly tend to face lower costs of capital and EMTRs if there is inflation but depreciation provisions do not take this into account. However, there would appear to be little reason for distinguishing buildings from other assets that also depreciate at slow rates. Interactions with Pillar 2 reform 7.18 Under the OECD’s Pillar 2 tax reforms, large multinational enterprises operating in New Zealand are likely to become subject to a global minimum tax of 15%. This means that if the tax rate in New Zealand falls below 15%, there will normally be additional taxes to pay overseas. If this applied to reductions in tax brought about by New Zealand adopting accelerated depreciation provisions, this might make accelerated depreciation provisions a cost-ineffective way of promoting investment because lower taxes paid in New Zealand might be offset by higher taxes paid abroad. However, the Pillar 2 rules explicitly exclude timing differences brought about by measures such as accelerated depreciation. Thus, if the company tax rate in New Zealand falls below 15% because of accelerated depreciation measures, this will not trigger additional taxes overseas. Thus, the Pillar 2 rules would not interfere with the effectiveness of accelerated depreciation as a means of promoting investment. 7.19 By contrast, if a country were to provide an investment allowance that was a deduction in addition to depreciation, this could trigger additional taxes overseas. The Pillar 2 changes will make it relatively more attractive to promote investment by accelerated depreciation rather than by an investment allowance. International experience United States 7.20 The United States introduced a partial expensing scheme, which it referred to as “bonus depreciation”, for certain forms of qualifying expenditure in two tax changes in 2002 and 2003. Under the 2002 change, 30% of qualifying capital expenditure could be expensed, and this was increased to 50% in the 2003 change. Qualifying assets were investments in new machinery and equipment but not buildings. This bonus depreciation scheme terminated at the end of 2004, but in 2008, bonus depreciation measures were reintroduced and the fraction of investment that can be expensed has varied since then. Currently, 73 100% of qualifying expenditure can be expensed. As has been discussed, full expensing will involve negative EMTRs and a tax subsidy for investment that is partially debt financed. Australia 7.21 Australia introduced a partial expensing scheme as part of its response to COVID-19. Under the Australian legislation, 50% of the cost of qualifying assets could be expensed. Qualifying assets included new machinery and equipment but not buildings. To qualify, assets needed to have be en first held on or after 12 March 2020 and first used or installed and available for use by 30 June 2021. To qualify for this incentive, firms needed to have a turnover of less than $50 million. (In addition, Australia offered immediate capital write-off to these firms for assets costing less than $150,000 acquired between 12 March 2020 and 30 June 2020.) There is now a temporary full expensing provision under which firms with turnovers below $5 billion can immediately deduct the cost of eligible new depreciating assets. The eligible new assets must be first held and first used or installed ready for use between October 2020 and June 2023. For firms with turnovers of less than $50 million, temporary full expensing also applies to eligible second-hand depreciating assets. Pros and cons of accelerated depreciation 7.22 Both forms of accelerated depreciation reduce some of the higher costs of capital and EMTRs. They both could be targeted at new investment, which would limit windfall gains to those with sunk investments and limit the fiscal costs of the measures. Of the two schemes, depreciation loading would probably be better targeted at reducing costs of capital and EMTRs on the most heavily taxed depreciable assets. 7.23 An important question is whether accelerated depreciation measures merely reduce high positive EMTRs or go further and produce negative EMTRs. With 20% loading or 20% partial expensing, accelerated depreciation would appear to be reducing higher EMTRs without making EMTRs negative (at least at average debt levels). However, with high enough levels of depreciation loading or partial expensing, EMTRs can become negative. 7.24 For example, with full expensing, EMTRs in table 7.1 would fall to -23.3% and investment would be subsidised. It would be attractive at the margin for firms to be acquiring funds at a cost of 3% net of New Zealand taxes and investing these in investments earning only 2.43%. Even though this investment would be adding to capital stock, which would support greater labour productivity, borrowing at 3% to earn 2.43% is likely to be inefficient. 7.25 There is also a question about the effects of accelerated depreciation for firms where non-residents are unlikely to be marginal shareholders. In chapter 4, we discussed SMEs owned by domestic residents where the individuals would otherwise invest in interest-bearing securities. As discussed in chapter 4 in table 4.4, these firms may have incentives to invest at risk-adjusted rates of return that are lower than the interest rate. Negative EMTRs can arise for these firms even if investment is fully equity financed. An unattractive feature of accelerated depreciation measures is that they can increase investment subsidies for such firms. 7.26 Table 7.2 examines costs of capital and EMTRs for such SMEs owned by domestic residents on a marginal tax rate of 33%. It considers the case where these SMEs are fully distributing taxable earnings. As in table 4.3, it is assumed that the world real interest rate is 3.0% but the domestic real interest rate is bid up by AIL to 3.10% with 2% inflation. Owners of the SMEs can borrow or 74 lend at this real interest rate. We compare the status quo with either 20% depreciation loading or 20% partial expensing. Table 7.2: Costs of capital and EMTRs for domestic SMEs without foreign marginal shareholders, full distribution, m = 33%, AIL = 2% Commercial and industrial buildings Plant, machinery and equipment Zero- depreciating assets Inventory Appreciating assets Expensing d 2.69% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% -1.00% d\* 2.00% 100.00% 50.00% 10.00% 4.00% 2.00% 0.00% 0.00% Costs of capital Status quo 2.71% 3.10% 3.07% 2.88% 2.67% 2.50% 2.13% 3.10% 1.64% 1.43% Depreciation loading 2.63% 3.10% 2.81% 2.69% 2.55% 2.43% 2.13% 3.10% 1.64% 1.43% Partial expensing 2.46% 2.77% 2.74% 2.59% 2.42% 2.29% 2.13% 3.10% 1.64% 1.43% EMTRs Status quo -10.5% 3.2% 2.2% -4.3% -12.4% -20.0% -40.6% 3.2% -82.8% -109.9% Depreciation loading -14.2% 3.2% -6.8% -11.6% -17.7% -23.6% -40.6% 3.2% -82.8% -109.9% Partial expensing -22.1% -8.5% -9.5% -16.0% -23.9% -31.3% -40.6% 3.2% -82.8% -109.9% 7.27 We draw attention to the following points: • Under current rules (the status quo), EMTRs are slightly positive for inventory and PME with fast economic depreciation rates, but for many forms of investment, EMTRs are negative. • Allowing depreciation loading or partial expensing can lead to negative EMTRs if the opportunity cost of capital is a heavily taxed income stream. • There will be times when accelerated depreciation schemes are likely to lead to inefficient investment subsidies rather than merely reducing high EMTRs on inbound investment. Views of stakeholders 7.28 Business NZ expressed support for some form of accelerated depreciation measures and commented that they had argued against the removal of depreciation loading in the context of the Budget 2010 tax changes. They are open to the idea of restricting the measures to new investment if the aim is to incentivise new investment. CTG also supports reconsidering depreciation rules and higher depreciation rates. CA ANZ did not support accelerated depreciation as they consider it runs against the overall philosophy of the tax system, and they suggested it should not be undertaken without wider consultation on the structure of the tax system as a whole. CA ANZ’s preference was to consider a simplified system of depreciation rates instead. 75 CHAPTER 8 Indexation • Under the present income tax system, costs of capital and EMTRs for real investment can vary significantly from the statutory rates when there is inflation. • This increase can be significant even at low rates of inflation in the middle of the Reserve Bank’s 1% to 3% target range. • The effects of inflation are not uniform across different asset classes. • This tends to reduce the neutrality of the tax system. • In principle, these distortions could be addressed by comprehensively indexing the tax base for inflation, which would include sales of revenue account assets, depreciation, trading stock, and interest. • While comprehensive indexation could eliminate the mismeasurement of income and reduce tax distortions, it could also be complex and have high compliance and administration costs. • Several OECD countries have indexation measures for depreciation. Two countries (Mexico and Chile) have broad indexation provisions that extend to interest income and expense. • Indexing depreciation deductions, or both depreciation deductions and inventories without indexing interest, might be a way of lowering costs of capital and EMTRs and making these more neutral. • However, like accelerated depreciation schemes, this would sometimes lead to investment subsidies. • The case for indexation measures will depend on compliance and administration costs and how these change over time, as well as on future interest and inflation rates. • The case for indexation is strongest when inflation is high relative to real interest rates. Introduction 8.1 Currently, the New Zealand tax system is not indexed for inflation, so it taxes nominal income and allows deductions for nominal interest expenses. However, some nominal income is compensation for inflation and should not be taxed under an economic definition of income. Under an economic definition, gains in the value of a person’s assets that are merely compensating for inflation would not be taxed. However, gains that contribute to an increase in a taxpayer’s real net worth should be taxed. 76 Example 8.1 Suppose the average price of goods is initially $10, and a person has $10,000. That person can buy 1,000 goods. The person puts the money into a bank account and earns 5.06% interest, and there is a 2% inflation rate. This is a 3% real interest rate. After one year, the person will have $10,506, but the average price of goods will increase to $10.20. Before accounting for tax, the person’s real worth will have increased by 3% – in the first year, they can buy 1,000 goods and in the following year they can buy 1,030 goods. However, New Zealand currently taxes nominal income. If the person’s marginal tax rate is 30%, then the person will have $10,354 in the second year and can only buy 1,015 goods. The person has been taxed at a rate of 50% on their real economic income. 8.2 Taxing nominal gains can increase the effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) for investment in certain assets. At the same time, businesses can deduct more than their real interest expenses. When compared to the economic definition of income, the current rules can: • overtax taxpayers with income and assets that have an inflationary component, such as trading stock, and depreciable property, and • allow excessive deductions for taxpayers with interest expenses. 46 8.3 This can increase costs of capital and EMTRs on investments that are already taxed quite heavily. This overtaxation can reduce investment in many types of assets and be distortionary between different types of investments. 8.4 While it is not the focus of this LTIB, taxing nominal gains can also impose a heavy tax impost on those who are earning interest income, which may discourage savings and distort how people choose to save. This can reduce economic efficiency and horizontal equity. If, in the example, above we only wanted to tax the real interest that is being earned, we would levy tax on only $306. This is because the first $200 of the $506 of interest income is merely maintaining the purchasing power of money that has been lent. 8.5 As was seen in chapter 4, at times the current rules can lower costs of capital and EMTRs and promote investment in certain assets, especially for heavily geared investments. How might the tax system be indexed for inflation? 8.6 This chapter looks at the idea of comprehensively adjusting the income tax base for inflation. To clarify, this is different to the idea of inflation indexing personal income tax thresholds. Even if personal income tax thresholds were indexed for inflation, or if there were a flat personal tax rate and no personal income tax thresholds to index, there would still be a question of how to take inflation into 46 Tax Working Group. (2018). Appendix E – Inflation indexing the tax system https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/twg-bg-3985472-appendix-e-inflation-indexing-the- tax-system 77 account so that people who earn interest or other forms of capital income are not taxed on purely inflationary gains. 8.7 One approach to comprehensive indexation was proposed by the 1989 Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital. 47 This Consultative Document approach involves four key changes: • Sale of revenue account capital assets – on sale, the cost base of the asset and improvements is increased by the amount of inflation since incurring these expenses. • Inventories or trading stock – the ‘opening value’ of trading stock is increased by an inflationary component based on the average value of stock through the year. • Depreciation – the cost base of depreciable assets is increased every year by inflation. • Financial arrangements – the inflationary component of interest received is non-assessable and the inflationary component of interest paid is non- deductible. Other adjustments would be required for more complex financial arrangements, such as derivatives and arrangements in foreign currency. Impacts on costs of capital 8.8 In chapter 4, we discussed how inflation and the mismeasurement of income could affect costs of capital and EMTRs. 8.9 Costs of capital are estimated in table 8.1. As in previous chapters, we consider a domestic company with marginal foreign portfolio shareholders, using the OECD company tax model modified to take account of approved issuer levy (AIL). 48 We assume that foreign shareholders demand a real return of 3% on their funds net of any domestic taxes, as do foreign lenders. Because of AIL, the domestic real interest rate is bid up to 3.06% if the tax system (including interest) is comprehensively indexed for inflation or 3.10% if interest is not indexed. We assume that firms are 43% debt financed and the depreciation deductions for plant, machinery and equipment (PME) are set to mirror how assets would depreciate in the absence of inflation. 8.10 Rows 3–5 report costs of capital and rows 6–8 report EMTRs. We consider three possible tax treatments: • the status quo • full indexation of depreciation allowances, inventories and interest payments, and 47 Consultative Document on the Taxation of Income from Capital (December 1989) https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/tp/publications/1989/1989-dd-taxation-income- capital/1989-dd-taxation-income-capital- pdf.pdf?modified=20200910102401&modified=20200910102401. 48 As discussed in chapter 4, costs of capital and EMTRs would be slightly lower for foreign- controlled companies that are able to claim foreign tax credits for NRWT levied in New Zealand and somewhat higher for firms that are unable to claim foreign tax credits. However, the differences are not very large. 78 • indexation of depreciation allowances and inventories but not interest.

Rather than taxes pushing up the hurdle rate of return by 1.14 percentage points from 3.0% to 4.14%, they would only be pushing up the hurdle rate of return by 0.69 percentage points. – Under our assumptions, the EMTRs for all types of PME, zero- depreciation assets and inventory would be the same (although differences would arise in practice because tax depreciation rates will never reflect economic depreciation rates perfectly). – The negative EMTRs for assets that can be expensed would become less negative (changing from -23.3% to -12.9%), which means that the tax subsidy for these investments would be reduced, promoting tax neutrality. – An anomaly would be the tax treatment of commercial and industrial buildings, and there would be a case for considering a higher tax depreciation rate for these buildings if we had a fully indexed tax system (at least if the BEA estimate of 2.69% reflects economic depreciation for these buildings in New Zealand). – This would be a way of reducing EMTRs for most assets in a way that increases neutrality at the same time. 79 • Only indexing depreciation allowances and inventories might be a way of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs and making them more neutral. • While not reported in the table, only indexing depreciation allowances and inventories could sometimes lead to inefficient tax subsidies. This can be true for domestic companies with marginal foreign shareholders that are sufficiently debt financed. It can also be true for domestic SMEs where New Zealand residents are marginal shareholders. The analysis parallels the discussion in table 7.2 above, which considered the effects of accelerated depreciation measures. Pros and cons of comprehensive indexation 8.12 Comprehensive indexation of the tax system for inflation is a way of reducing higher EMTRs markedly. At the same time, it is increasing neutrality and would reduce tax distortions and improve economic efficiency and horizontal equity. The EMTRs on different investments would be more consistent. Table 8.1 shows how the range of EMTRs would narrow for firms with an average level of debt finance (that is, 43% debt finance). While it is not directly reported in table 8.1, it is evident that full indexation would also reduce biases between debt and equity finance by limiting interest deductions to only real interest expense. 8.13 Indexation would get to the heart of the problem of removing biases in measuring the tax base that are caused by inflation. In this regard, indexation could be better at mitigating the tax effects of inflation than other more ad hoc measures, which can introduce further biases into the tax system. 8.14 Comprehensively indexing the tax system for inflation using the Consultative Document approach would require adjustments to the rules for capital assets, trading stock, depreciation, and interest and financial arrangements (as set out above). Several countries have inflation adjustments for depreciation deductions, including Chile, Costa Rica, Iceland, Mexico, the Netherlands and Turkey. 49 Australia used to index capital gains for inflation. Inflation adjustments for inventories are also feasible. A simpler alternative, which effectively allows a form of inflation adjustment for firms with a constant level of stock through time, is to allow inventory to be valued on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. Inflation adjustments for interest income and expense from financial arrangements would be the most complex, particularly for financial arrangements involving foreign currency or derivatives. Where taxpayers have financial transactions with New Zealand financial institutions, complexities could normally be removed for most taxpayers by the financial institutions advising on the real component of interest income and interest expense. However, calculations would be more complex if the financial arrangements do not involve New Zealand financial institutions. 8.15 While the focus in the LTIB is on costs of capital and EMTRs, a major potential benefit of comprehensive indexation would be the lower and more neutral tax treatment of interest income which is currently taxed quite heavily and other forms of saving that are often taxed less heavily. 8.16 The main issues with indexing are its complexity, which can lead to high compliance and administrative costs. In the draft LTIB, we incorrectly stated that no OECD country currently comprehensively inflation indexes their tax system. We have since discovered that both Chile and Mexico have broad 49 See the OECD’s Effective Tax Rates Explanatory Index, Corporate Effective Tax Rates Explanatory Annex (oecd.org) 80 indexation provisions that extend to interest. Advances in technology and the widespread uptake of accounting software are likely to be making comprehensive indexation more feasible over time. Pros and cons of partial indexation 8.17 An alternative approach to comprehensive indexation is partial indexation, which reduces the complexities involved. Partial indexation involves adjusting particular items of income or expense for inflation. Partial indexation measures adopted by various other countries include: • explicit indexation of the basis of depreciable property and of revenue account property in calculating capital gains, and • only taxing a portion of interest (for example, 60%) as a rough proxy for indexation. 8.18 Either inflation indexing depreciation deductions and sales of revenue account property or inflation indexing both these and inventories might be ways of both reducing higher EMTRs and making EMTRs more consistent and neutral. It would not reduce tax biases between debt and equity investment in companies with non-resident shareholders, and at times, it would lead to investment subsidies. At the same time, it might be a more neutral way of promoting investment in depreciable assets than the accelerated depreciation schemes examined in chapter 7. As with accelerated depreciation measures, it would be less prone to reduce the progressivity and integrity of the personal tax system than a company tax rate cut. The appropriate index 8.19 If the tax system were to be indexed for inflation, the most appropriate price index to use would seem to be a general price index, such as the consumers price index (CPI). Ultimately, all income is income of individuals and using the CPI would avoid overstating or understating the true incomes that individuals receive. 8.20 The Reserve Bank’s target range for CPI inflation is 1–3%. Therefore, one option might be to index the income tax base by 2% inflation, which would be in the centre of the range. Using a proxy inflation rate like 2% would allow banks and other financial institutions to know the appropriate indexation rate in advance. This would help them withhold appropriate levels of tax on interest income. An alternative might be to allow adjustments based on the actual inflation figure but with a three-month lag, so the inflation rate used for indexing taxes reflects inflation in the previous quarter. Views of stakeholders 8.21 Stakeholders are likely to have been misled by the incorrect statement in the draft LTIB that no OECD countries have comprehensive indexation provisions. This was given as a reason for doubting the practicality of this option at present. 8.22 Business NZ considered that indexation was an option to consider in the future only when the relevant digital technology is at a sufficient level for this to occur. 8.23 CTG commented that comprehensive indexation of the tax base has been explored in the past and found to be impractical and that indexation of interest seems particularly problematic. The CTG identified that the rules might mean 81 borrowers are taxed when real interest rates turn negative, but they also acknowledged there may be viable alternatives that could be thought through that would address this problem. CTG suggests, however, that partial indexation measures could usefully be considered. 8.24 CA ANZ argued against comprehensive indexation because this is likely to lead to further complexity. 82 CHAPTER 9 Thin capitalisation • The deductibility of interest but not dividends creates incentives for multinational entities to use debt to finance investment into New Zealand subsidiaries, at least if investment is from countries with lower company tax rates. • To combat base erosion and profit shifting by multinationals, most countries (including New Zealand) have introduced thin capitalisation rules, where a deduction for the cost of debt above a debt percentage is denied. • However, thin capitalisation rules can push up costs of capital and EMTRs. • There is international evidence suggesting that thin capitalisation rules can have significant negative impacts on foreign direct investment and increase the tax rate elasticity of investments. • An increased safe harbour threshold would be a way of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs and promoting inbound foreign direct investment. • It would do so without sacrificing tax on economic rents and without making it harder to levy progressive personal income taxes. • However, the changes are likely to promote inbound investment for only a minority of firms and not for firms facing the highest EMTRs at present. • Additional debt levels may trigger higher taxes overseas, making a higher thin capitalisation threshold an expensive way of promoting inbound investment. • A high threshold could result in inbound investment subsidies. Introduction 9.1 Current tax settings allow taxpayers a deduction for interest but not for dividends paid. This is not a major issue when considering investment decisions for companies owned solely by New Zealand residents, as New Zealand’s imputation tax credit regime effectively makes the corporate income tax a withholding tax and reduces debt/equity biases for such firms. 50 However, multinationals investing into New Zealand may often be able to lower their worldwide tax liability by increasing debt levels in New Zealand. This will be the case if the multinational is based in a country with a lower company tax rate than New Zealand. Interest paid to the foreign parent will reduce tax paid in New Zealand by more than it increases tax paid abroad. 9.2 The distinction between debt and equity is largely arbitrary in related-party situations. This is because the overall risk to a parent company is not generally 50 If taxed profits were fully distributed and taxed at the shareholders’ tax rates each year, there would be no debt-equity bias for firms owned by New Zealand residents. There can, however, be a timing tax bias favouring equity finance when the company tax rate is less than the tax rates of shareholders and profits are retained in a company for several years before being distributed as dividends. 83 affected by choices between these two methods of financing the operation of subsidiaries when the funding is being advanced by related parties. Multinational entities may sometimes be able to reduce their worldwide tax liability by having a subsidiary borrow from the parent, or another subsidiary, and then pay part of their return to the parent as deductible interest rather than as a non-deductible dividend. Alternatively, the corporate group could lower the amount of tax it pays in a jurisdiction by having a subsidiary in that jurisdiction take on a disproportionately large share of borrowing from third parties. 9.3 New Zealand currently has a relatively high corporate income tax rate when compared to other OECD countries. Therefore, there could often be a tax advantage in a multinational enterprise using a much higher proportion of debt to finance its New Zealand operations than is true for the worldwide enterprise. Thin capitalisation rules 9.4 To address excessive profit shifting, many countries have ‘thin capitalisation’ rules, including New Zealand. New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules aim to limit the amount of interest deductions against the New Zealand tax base and apply to inbound investment by a non-resident. 9.5 If the debt level of a corporate group or other taxpayer exceeds prescribed levels, the thin capitalisation rules deem the excess debt to be an item of income, effectively denying interest deductions. This can occur if both: • the New Zealand group’s debt percentage 51 is greater than the ‘safe harbour’ of 60%, 52 and • the New Zealand group’s debt percentage is greater than 110% of the group’s worldwide debt percentage. 53 9.6 The rules apply to foreign-controlled companies but not to domestic companies. They disallow interest deductions if the debt percentage of the New Zealand group exceeds 110% of the worldwide group’s debt percentage. However, if the New Zealand debt percentage does not exceed the ‘safe harbour’ ratio of 60%, then the worldwide comparison is not needed, and all the interest may be deducted. This means that deductions for interest on debt-financed investments is unaffected until this 60% threshold is exceeded. 9.7 It should be noted that a case might be made for allowing New Zealand subsidiaries of foreign parents to have higher levels of debt than the worldwide group company. This can reduce costs of capital and help ensure that marginal inbound investment is not subject to high EMTRs. As was discussed in chapter 2, standard economic models would suggest that there is a presumption against high EMTRs on marginal inbound investment. As will be discussed in chapter 10, some countries have introduced an allowance for corporate equity, and this has some similarities to allowing firms to fully deduct interest even if investments are fully debt financed. At the same time, we have 51 Calculated as debt/(debt+equity). 52 There is also a separate 75% safe harbour ratio for outbound investment. We do not discuss this further given our focus on inbound investment. 53 Debt percentage calculated using the multinational’s total group debt, total group assets, and total group non-debt liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting practice or the financial reporting standards of the country where the worldwide group’s consolidated financial accounts are prepared. 84 seen that, with high levels of debt financing, EMTRs may often be negative. In that case, investment can be subsidised, and this can be inefficient. International evidence on thin capitalisation rules and investment 9.8 Two international studies have investigated the effects of introducing, or tightening, thin capitalisation rules on investments. They have estimated it has a negative effect on employment and investment by multinational corporations, especially in high-tax host countries. This suggests that thin capitalisation rules may normally add to costs of capital and EMTR concerns in ways that we have not been able to model in our work in chapter 4. 9.9 De Mooij and Liu (2021) estimated that introducing thin capitalisation rules reduces the investment of multinational affiliates by an average of 20% where the average corporate income tax rate is 27%. The size of this effect depends on the corporate income tax rate and is larger at higher rates. 9.10 Similarly, Buettner et al (2014) estimated that introducing thin capitalisation rules, or making them tighter, can significantly reduce the level of foreign direct investment in high-tax countries. In addition, they estimated that foreign direct investment is about twice as sensitive to shifts in tax rates if typical thin capitalisation rules apply than if there are no restrictions. Concerns about excessive taxes on marginal inbound investment become larger the greater the responsiveness of investment to tax rates is. 9.11 This international analysis suggests that tight thin capitalisation rules may have a material impact on inbound investment. One potential way of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs would be to increase the thin capitalisation 60% safe harbour threshold. This would, however, increase the scope for multinationals to have much higher levels of debt in New Zealand than is true of the worldwide entity to shift tax payments out of New Zealand. Alternatively, if tight thin capitalisation rules are required to protect the tax base from profit shifting, there may be a greater case for considering whether concerns about high costs of capital and EMTRs on inbound marginal investment should be addressed in other ways. A variety of different possible ways of addressing cost of capital concerns are being canvassed in this briefing. Impact on costs of capital and EMTRs 9.12 Increasing the 60% thin capitalisation safe harbour threshold would lead to increased debt levels for some foreign-controlled companies. This would reduce costs of capital and EMTRs for these firms. This would have no implications for the debt levels of domestic firms, which are not subject to the rules. 9.13 In chapter 4, we analysed EMTRs for foreign-controlled firms that are required to pay non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on interest payments to foreign parent companies. NRWT is normally levied at a rate of 10%, which is considerably higher than the 2% rate of approved issuer levy (AIL). 9.14 Whether payments of NRWT increase costs of capital depends on whether this NRWT is creditable against income tax paid in other countries. In this chapter, we focus on the case where NRWT is not creditable, which means that NRWT payments will tend to increase costs of capital. This can be thought of as a worst case scenario. Domestic taxes will be pushing up costs of capital and this would not be the case if NRWT were creditable. 9.15 In table 9.1 we show EMTRs for firms investing in our various assets. First, we show EMTRs for a domestic company with marginal foreign portfolio 85 shareholders with the average debt level of 43%. Second, we show EMTRs for foreign-controlled companies at different debt levels. We assume that 37.3% of debt is related-party debt, which was the average level from the data reported in appendix 2 of the Technical appendices. We consider debt levels of 0%, 43%, 60%, 75% and 100% for foreign-controlled firms, assuming interest is fully deductible in all cases. This shows what would happen if thin capitalisation rules were relaxed and this allowed foreign-controlled firms to take up these various debt levels.

This is consistent with data that has been provided in earlier chapters. • For foreign-controlled companies that are 43% debt financed, EMTRs vary between 28.8% and -20.7%. They are slightly higher than for domestic companies because interest payments to related parties in foreign- controlled companies are subject to NRWT rather than AIL. • As is discussed in appendix 2 of the Technical appendices, many foreign- controlled companies have no debt. These would have EMTRs varying between 39.1% and 0.0%. • As is also discussed in appendix 2 of the Technical appendices, there is limited evidence of foreign-controlled companies being clustered at the 60% thin capitalisation threshold. However, for firms that are, EMTRs would vary between 23.7% and -31.4%. These are the firms that would benefit from a higher thin capitalisation threshold. • Relaxing the thin capitalisation threshold to 75% would mean that firms that move to this new threshold would have EMTRs varying between 15.0% and -50.6%. • Abandoning thin capitalisation rules completely would mean that foreign- controlled firms becoming fully debt financed would have EMTRs varying between 2.0% and -81.2%. 86 • Relaxing or eliminating the thin capitalisation threshold would reduce EMTRs and costs of capital for foreign-controlled firms that want to take on more debt to benefit from interest deductibility but are constrained by the current threshold. However, these are not firms that face the highest EMTRs at present. • Completely eliminating the thin capitalisation threshold could lead to very negative EMTRs for certain asset if foreign controlled companies choose to finance investment with very high levels of debt. Increasing the safe harbour threshold: policy considerations 9.17 There are pros and cons in increasing the safe harbour threshold. Pros 9.18 Removing the thin capitalisation rules entirely or increasing the safe harbour threshold would be ways of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs for some firms. This is likely to promote foreign direct investment. The international evidence suggests that the effects on inbound investment may be significant. It would have several potential advantages relative to other ways of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs. 9.19 An attraction of increasing the thin capitalisation safe harbour threshold is that it would not mean forgoing tax on economic rents. So long as interest is not being deducted at inflated rates, economic rents would continue to be taxed. Also, unlike cutting the company tax rate, it would not make it more difficult to maintain a progressive personal income tax structure if that is a key objective for future governments. A higher threshold would only be of benefit to foreign- controlled firms, so it would not undermine the role of the company tax in supporting personal income taxation. 9.20 If there were an intention to lower taxes on inbound foreign direct investment without reducing taxes on inbound investment more broadly, increasing the threshold might be particularly attractive. This is because it would be targeted at investment by foreign-controlled firms. However, this is only likely to be justified if it were thought that foreign direct investment brought in important spillover benefits or other wellbeing benefits not associated with other forms of inbound investment. In chapter 2, we questioned whether there was strong evidence of important productivity spillovers from foreign direct investment and whether these were likely to be bigger than the productivity spillovers from investment by domestic firms. Cons 9.21 Increasing the safe harbour would be reducing the effectiveness of the rules as a base-maintenance measure. Many would question whether it is fair to provide multinationals with greater scope to stream profits out of New Zealand and reduce their worldwide tax payments in the process. 9.22 Increasing the safe harbour would only benefit some firms. It would benefit foreign-controlled companies that are close to the thin capitalisation border and would like to take on more debt but are stopped from doing so by the thin capitalisation rules. However, these firms are already likely to be facing relatively low EMTRs and costs of capital. As table 9.1 above points out, EMTRs and costs of capital for these firms are likely to be significantly lower than for either foreign-controlled firms with low levels of debt or for domestic firms. This is likely to reduce, rather than increase, the neutrality of inbound investment. Productivity is likely to be supported more by tax measures that reduce costs 87 of capital and EMTRs most when these are relatively high rather than when they are relatively low to start with. If future governments wish to reduce EMTRs, there is a question of whether this is likely to be the most efficient and effective way of doing so. 9.23 An increase in the safe harbour may only affect a relatively small number of firms. There is limited evidence of firms being clustered close to the thin capitalisation safe harbour threshold (see table 9.2). An increase in the threshold is unlikely to have any effect on costs of capital and EMTRs for the large numbers of foreign-controlled firms that are well below it. Of course, not only would this reduce the effectiveness of the measure as a way of promoting investment, but it would also be likely to reduce the fiscal cost.

This is that increasing the thin capitalisation safe harbour threshold may be a relatively costly way of promoting inbound investment from a New Zealand perspective. When it leads to New Zealand subsidiaries being financed with more debt and less equity from a foreign parent, not only will this reduce tax paid in New Zealand, but it will often add to tax paid overseas. This is likely to mean a relatively large revenue cost to achieve a relatively small fall in the cost of capital. 9.25 For example, suppose a higher threshold leads to an extra $100 of interest being attracted from a country with a 20% company tax rate that provides credits for NRWT on interest levied in New Zealand. This reduces New Zealand tax by $18 (a reduction in company tax of $28 offset by an increase in NRWT of $10) but increases foreign tax by $10 (as the interest income is taxed at a rate of 20% but offset by an NRWT tax credit). Overall, the net benefit to the foreign investor would be a reduction in worldwide tax of $8, but this would be smaller than the drop in New Zealand tax. Thus, increasing the safe harbour threshold may be a relatively costly way of promoting inbound investment. 54 In presenting this data, we ignore a relatively small group of 40 firms with negative or zero levels of equity. 88 9.26 Finally, as has been discussed, at times debt-financed investment may face negative EMTRs and be subsidised by the tax system. For example, table 9.1 above shows that if firms were allowed to use 100% debt finance, EMTRs for several types of investment would be negative (and, in the case of expensing, very negative). Allowing foreign-controlled firms to have very high levels of debt finance would not just be reducing high positive EMTRs; it would sometimes be adding to investment subsidies. 9.27 There are some possible interactions to consider. If the thin capitalisation safe harbour were relaxed, this might make it less attractive to make other changes which might also be reducing EMTRs (such as introducing accelerated depreciation measures) if they might also be creating investment subsidies. Other solutions 9.28 One disadvantage of increasing the safe harbour threshold is that increasing debt finance into New Zealand may often mean higher taxes paid overseas. This makes a higher threshold a relatively cost-ineffective way of promoting investment. Also, a higher safe harbour threshold is only likely to be of benefit to foreign-controlled firms that are close to the safe harbour threshold initially. An alternative is an allowance for corporate equity. This would reduce the cost of capital on inbound investment without inducing firms to take on additional debt finance and would apply to a much broader set of inbound investment. This is discussed in chapter 10. Views of stakeholders 9.29 Business NZ noted the thin capitalisation safe harbour threshold had been reduced from 75% to 60% as part of the Budget 2010 changes, which was seen as appropriate at the time. This helped offset the fiscal cost of other tax changes that were taking place at the same time. They believe some further analysis of the most appropriate threshold is warranted. 9.30 CTG considered New Zealand’s thin capitalisation rules should be reviewed to make New Zealand a more attractive destination for inbound investment. 9.31 CA ANZ considered the current 60% thin capitalisation threshold is broadly appropriate and should not be changed. 89 CHAPTER 10 Allowance for corporate equity • An allowance for corporate equity (ACE) allows companies a deduction at an imputed interest rate for the cost of equity finance. • At first sight, it would appear to have several attractions. • It aims to eliminate tax on marginal inbound investment while continuing to tax economic rents. • If it is applied only to incremental equity acquired after the tax is put in place, it might avoid windfalls to existing owners of shares in companies, and this would reduce the fiscal cost of the measure. • The interest rate used in the ACE calculation should, in principle, reflect the risk to a firm of being unable to claim deductions. However, it is likely some average interest rate would be used in practice. • The neutrality properties of the tax would depend heavily on how the equity base is defined. • To obtain full neutrality benefits, it would be necessary for the ACE to sometimes operate as an additional tax rather than as a tax deduction. • If a tax policy goal is to tax individuals on both their capital and labour income, it would seem difficult to integrate an ACE with the personal tax system unless gains on shares were subject to full rates of personal tax. • An alternative to introducing an ACE would be to introduce a cash flow tax. This would be expected to have similar economic effects to an ACE for firms in a taxpaying position with much the same benefits and costs. Introduction 10.1 Current tax settings allow companies a deduction for the cost of debt but not for the cost of equity. An allowance for corporate equity (ACE) grants companies a notional interest deduction for their equity. For example, if a company has $1,000 of equity and the interest rate that applies to notional interest deductions is 5%, the company would be able to claim a deduction of $50. 10.2 Providing an ACE would be one way of reducing the relatively high costs of capital and effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) that New Zealand imposes on inbound investment (discussed in chapter 3). At the same time, a potential danger exists of going beyond the point of merely reducing high EMTRs and instead generating tax subsidies with negative EMTRs. The OECD analysis suggested that several countries with ACE systems, including Italy, Belgium and Poland, had very negative EMTRs on inbound investment. 10.3 An ACE could also reduce or eliminate debt-equity biases for foreign-owned firms. As discussed in chapter 4, costs of capital and EMTRs can be substantially higher for equity-financed investment than for debt-financed investment and allowing a notional interest deduction would alleviate these biases. 90 Policy objectives 10.4 A key objective for an ACE is to remove tax on marginal inbound investment and make EMTRs as close to zero as possible. 10.5 A strong case for an ACE was made by Griffith, Hines and Sørensen (2010) (GHS) in a chapter written for the Mirrlees Review in the United Kingdom. GHS suggested this as an approach adopted in some countries that would respond to the growing openness of the UK economy. It is a possible way of addressing many of the concerns that were discussed in chapter 2. 10.6 An ACE would aim to remove tax on marginal inbound investments and make EMTRs as close to zero as possible. At the same time, it would aim to continue to tax economic rents. It is often suggested the ACE should apply only to new equity issued after the tax comes into force to minimise the fiscal cost of the tax change and windfall benefits to existing firms. While this is attractive in principle, we suspect this might not be feasible for New Zealand without significant other changes to our tax system. 10.7 By creating greater neutrality in the tax treatment of debt and equity investment into New Zealand, an ACE would reduce financing biases. This would be likely to increase economic efficiency and productivity. 10.8 As well as aiming to remove tax on marginal inbound investments and make EMTRs as close to zero as possible, GHS argue that an ACE would eliminate the distortions associated with the misalignment between economic depreciation and depreciation for tax purposes. GHS argue that, under conventional systems of business taxation, accelerated depreciation measures can distort the behaviour of firms and end up subsidising investment (p.975 ff). This can induce low-productivity investment, which would not be attractive in the absence of tax. They argue that an attraction of an ACE system is that it eliminates these distortions. 10.9 Any increase in depreciation will reduce the equity against which an allowance under ACE is calculated. This reduces the ACE allowance by an amount that should, at least in principle, exactly offset any benefits derived from the accelerated depreciation. Regardless of the rate at which firms write down their assets in the tax accounts, the present value of the sum of the capital allowance and the ACE should always equal the initial investment outlay. Therefore, for a fully equity-financed investment, the ACE system is intended to be equivalent to the immediate expensing of investment allowed under a cash flow tax. 91 Example 10.1 Suppose that the tax code allows a taxpayer to bring forward $100 of depreciation from year 2 to year 1. Assuming a tax rate of 28%, their tax liability is reduced by $28 in year 1. In year 2, the taxpayer is not able to claim the $100 depreciation as they claimed it in year 1. Their taxable earnings in year 2 are therefore $100 higher than they otherwise would have been, and their tax liability increases by $28. Assuming a discount rate of 5%, the taxpayer has gained $1.40 by deferring the payment of the $28 to year 2. 55 However, the equity base used for calculating an ACE liability is increased by retained profits from tax accounts. We assume that the tax saving of $28 leads to a matching $28 increase in dividends so that real funds for investment are unchanged. As taxable earnings fall by $100, taxable retained earnings is reduced by $100 in year 1 and the equity base for ACE in year 2 is also reduced by $100. If the imputed rate of return allowed under ACE is also 5%, then the taxpayer deduction under ACE is reduced by $5. This increases their tax liability in year 2 by a further $1.40. Thus, the tax benefit from accelerated depreciation is exactly offset by the fall in the future ACE allowance. This is assumed to be matched by a reduction in dividends of $29.40 in year 2. This means that the rate at which companies write down their assets does not matter for the present value of the taxes they pay. 10.10 This neutrality example requires that the imputed interest charge reflects the company’s discount rate used to discount future depreciation deductions. As will be discussed below, for this neutrality result to hold, it also requires the equity base to be able to become negative and to then lead to an ACE liability. 10.11 Lastly, an ACE system will also influence corporate debt policy. By allowing a deduction for equity financing, it could potentially introduce funding neutrality to the current tax system, thereby reducing or eliminating the debt bias. Design issues Rate of allowance 10.12 The efficacy of an ACE in alleviating tax on marginal inbound investment and eliminating the debt bias depends on the allowed rate of notional deduction. 10.13 In principle, the interest rate used might not necessarily need to include a premium for risk and it might be appropriate to allow a deduction for only the risk-free nominal interest rate (that is, the interest rate of long-term government bonds). This would be the case if losses could be carried forward with interest and were certain to be used at some stage in the future, as is discussed in Bond and Devereux (1995). 10.14 However, in practice, firms will often receive less than the present value of their losses, so GHS argue that it would be appropriate to add a risk premium to the interest rate used. 10.15 Under an ACE system, on a fully equity-financed investment, any equity invested will increase the amount the company is allowed to deduct in all future 55 This is because $28 x 0.05 = $1.40. Paying the tax bill in year 2, rather than year 1, has a future value (year 2 value) of $1.40. 92 years by the amount invested multiplied by the ACE rate. If the value of these deductions is discounted at the same rate, the present value of the additional ACE deductions will equal the amount of equity invested. Thus, the taxpayer ends up receiving the same deduction as if they had been allowed a deduction for the equity invested up front. The premium added to the ACE rate should therefore reflect the risk faced by individual firms in being able to make these future deductions. 10.16 This is also necessary if the ACE is to eliminate the distortions associated with the misalignment between economic depreciation and depreciation for tax purposes. 10.17 Tax authorities are unlikely to know the risk faced by each individual firm, so an average risk premium would seem the only viable option. This would compromise some of the tax neutrality properties of an ACE. GHS suggest that in countries with a well-developed market for corporate bonds, the average interest rate on such bonds would be a natural benchmark for choosing the imputed rate of return to equity under an ACE. 10.18 Most countries with ACE systems have either used rates linked to the yields on government bonds, normally with some additional risk premium, or commercial interest rates. Hebous and Klemm (2019) provide details on the rules used in different countries that have had ACE systems. ACE base 10.19 One question is how the ACE base should best be defined. GHS suggest that the equity base be calculated as follows: “Equity base in the previous year + taxable profits in the previous year (gross of the ACE allowance) + dividends received + net new equity issues – tax payable on taxable profits in the previous year – dividends paid – net new acquisitions of shares in other companies = Equity base for the current year” 10.20 There are several points to note. First, this approach is aimed at removing tax on marginal investments into New Zealand and achieving investment neutrality across assets. As was illustrated in example 10.1, an important part of making this work is to add in taxable profits when calculating changes in the base from year to year. This approach is also aimed at achieving neutrality between debt and equity financing. It does this by aligning EMTRs for equity-financed corporate investments with assets that can be expensed. In this case, the EMTR for all equity-financed investments would be zero. Likewise, if not for non- resident withholding tax (NRWT) and approved issuer levy (AIL), the EMTRs for debt-financed investments would all be zero. As EMTRs on fully debt-financed investments are normally negative, this means increasing the tax impost on debt-financed investment. 10.21 Further, acquisitions of shares in other companies should be subtracted from the equity base. This is to avoid double counting. For example, if company A is set up with $100 of equity and uses this to purchase share capital in company B, 93 the same $100 should not be counted twice as equity in both companies. For ACE purposes, it is necessary to subtract new acquisitions of shares so that company A ends up with zero, while company B ends up with $100. Share purchases in foreign companies would also be subtracted because income derived by a parent company from such firms would typically be non-taxable. If company A was financed with $50 of share capital and $50 of debt and used this to purchase the shares in company B, then it would have an ACE basis of –$50 and would need to be subject to an imputed interest charge on the –$50 of equity for the GHS approach to work. Thus, under the GHS approach, the ACE deduction might sometimes be negative and adding to a company’s tax liability. 10.22 This seems central to the GHS approach. It is necessary for the ACE system to be increasing the tax impost on debt-financed investment. We have seen that under current tax settings fully debt-financed investment will normally generate negative EMTRs. With an ACE, these EMTRs would become zero, which means a higher tax liability than at present. Debt-financed investment into an asset that can be expensed would provide an immediate deduction for the cost of the asset. This would reduce the equity base or turn it negative. Debt-financed investment into firms that make tax losses for several years before moving into a tax profit would also tend to generate negative equity bases. Transition to an ACE 10.23 An ACE might, in principle, be applied either to all equity in a company or only to equity acquired after the date that the ACE is implemented. An attraction of applying it only to additional equity built up after the time when an ACE is introduced is that this would limit the cost of the scheme. It would also minimise windfall gains to existing companies. 10.24 As we understand it, most ACE systems are based on additional equity acquired after the initial implementation date. This provides obvious incentives for a firm to be wound up and then reborn in a different entity in which new equity qualifies for the ACE deduction. GHS argue that the incentives for this to happen may be attenuated by other taxes if companies are wound up. However, the other taxes that GHS point to are capital gains taxes. This may make it more difficult for countries like New Zealand, without a capital gains tax, to limit deductions only to what is, in reality, new equity. Anti-avoidance 10.25 The issue of the potential abuse of ACE systems has been raised in policy discussions. Indeed, Hebous and Ruf (2017) found that the increases in equity following the introduction of the Belgian ACE were largely earmarked for intra- group lending and for creating deductions to shelter other sources of interest earnings. 10.26 They found that a unilateral implementation of an ACE system creates an opportunity for multinational entities to implement ‘double-dipping’ structures. This is where capital is injected as equity into an affiliate in a country with an ACE system who then lends that capital to another affiliate in a country without an ACE system. The borrower affiliate receives a deduction for interest paid on the loan, while the lender affiliate receives a deduction under the ACE system. 10.27 In addition, the borrower affiliate can invest the loan into yet another affiliate in a country with an ACE system, thereby doubling (or ‘cascading’) the received allowance corresponding to any given amount of equity. 10.28 The tax avoidance concerns outlined in this section would mean that ACE reforms might need to be accompanied by anti-avoidance provisions targeting 94 intra-company transactions. We note that the implementation of the global minimum taxation regime established by Pillar 2 may mitigate these concerns. However, the Pillar 2 changes could also remove some of the cost of capital benefits of an ACE system if lower taxes in New Zealand lead to offsetting higher taxes in other countries as a result of the proposed global minimum tax of 15% for larger companies. Integration with the personal tax system 10.29 A policy concern with an ACE, and quite possibly a fatal difficulty for such a tax at least in the short run, is how to integrate it with personal taxes. So long as individuals are being taxed on both their capital and labour income, it would be necessary to have additional taxes at the shareholder level if investment through companies is not to create an obvious tax avoidance loophole. For example, rather than an individual earning money in a bank account and paying tax on interest earned each year as funds accumulate, the individual could set up a company that puts the money into a bank account. Because of the ACE deduction, there would be no tax on the interest income accumulating in the company’s bank account. If there is no tax on gains in shares and the individual subsequently sells the shares in the company for a tax-free capital gain, no tax would have been paid on the interest. 10.30 GHS suggest two possible personal tax systems that could be integrated with an ACE system. The first is what they describe as an income tax regime. This is a dual income tax system as described in chapter 12. The second is a personal consumption tax that exempts individuals from tax on their capital income. If income is to be taxed at the personal level, GHS suggest taxing both dividends and capital gains at full personal rates. In the absence of a tax on share gains, it would seem difficult to integrate this tax with New Zealand’s personal income tax base. Land and property and rents capitalised in prices 10.31 In the absence of good integration between an ACE and personal taxes, there would be considerable scope for individuals to put assets they own, such as rental properties, into companies. If properties are acquired by the companies at market value, the value is likely to reflect the capitalised value of future earnings. Most, or all, future rental income would escape personal tax. The cash flow tax alternative 10.32 An alternative to an ACE system, with much the same potential benefits and costs, would be to introduce a cash flow tax whereby capital costs could be deducted immediately rather than depreciated over time. There would be full expensing for all capital assets including non-depreciating assets, such as land. Revenue from the sale of any assets would be fully taxable. There are different possible types of cash flow tax that could be considered, but one possible suggestion is to deny interest deductibility at the same time. This would ensure that inbound investment is not subsidised. 10.33 Like an ACE, a cash flow tax would remove tax on marginal investments while continuing to tax economic rents. Potential advantages would be its simplicity and the fact it removes any need to determine an appropriate interest rate for notional interest deductions on equity. A disadvantage is that it is likely to make it much more common for companies to end up in a tax loss position. As with an ACE, there would be major questions on how to integrate this sort of tax with the personal tax system. However, if an ACE were to be considered as an 95 option in the future, this is an alternative that could be considered at the same time. 56 Views of stakeholders 10.34 Business NZ thought an ACE would face some important practical obstacles, including difficulties of integrating this tax with the personal tax system. They did not dismiss this as a possibility to be considered in the future but thought other possible tax changes should be considered first. They suggested the option of an ACE not be considered at this time. 10.35 CTG considered an ACE an option that should be explored as part of a broader discussion of the need for alignment between the company tax rate and the top personal marginal rate. 10.36 CA ANZ commented that, while an ACE would in theory add neutrality to the tax system, it would not be practical to implement unless changes were made to the personal tax system. They consider an ACE is not viable under current policy settings. 56 Auerbach, Devereux, Keen and Vella, 2017, suggest a destination-based cash flow tax which, in addition to the neutrality benefits of a cash flow tax would also alleviate international tax avoidance pressures. 96 CHAPTER 11 Incentives for specific businesses or industries • The main objective of this policy option is to favour specific industries or activities where it is believed there will be too little of these industries or activities without an incentive. • Reasons for incentives include the possibility of positive externalities or that the incentives may bring some desirable activity to New Zealand that is particularly sensitive to tax. • Downsides of tax incentives are that they reduce the neutrality of the tax system and, unless incentives are very cleverly targeted, they can divert investment into less productive areas and encourage lobbying. • Questions can also be raised about whether there should be surtaxes on certain activities. • New Zealand’s general approach for many years has been (with a few exceptions) to keep the tax base as broad and neutral as possible. • This chapter questions whether there are good grounds for changing this approach. Introduction 11.1 One way of reducing the cost of capital is to target favourable tax treatment to specific businesses or industries. This is usually promoted on one or more of the following premises: • We are competing with other countries for a particular type of activity, and a specific tax incentive is a cost-effective way of attracting that activity while keeping taxes higher on other businesses. • There are positive externalities from the activity, and it will therefore be underprovided by the market unless it is subsidised through a specific tax incentive. • The activity is important to the future of the economy, and future living standards will be higher if we get more of the activity now by subsidising it with a specific tax incentive. 11.2 In the context of a model looking at effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs), a specific incentive can lower the cost of capital by either lowering the tax rate applied to income from the investment or by accelerating or increasing depreciation deductions for the investment. 11.3 A typical list of tax incentives is provided by Klemm (2010): • Tax holidays (a temporary exemption from particular taxes). • Special zones (geographically limited areas where various tax exemptions are applied). 97 • Investment tax credit (immediate tax credit similar to New Zealand’s current R&D tax credit for investment, potentially with refundability). • Investment allowance (immediate deduction for a proportion of the cost of an investment, but its value depends on the tax rate for the firm). • Accelerated depreciation (depreciation at a faster rate than generally applied). • Reduced tax rates. • Exemptions from various taxes. • Financing incentives (for example, reduced withholding taxes on dividends). Pros 11.4 At times investment may generate positive externalities (that is, spillover benefits to other firms or individuals). This can provide a case for a tax subsidy for that type of investment. This is the justification for the current R&D tax credit. A concern is that, in the absence of some subsidy for the investment, there may be too little investment undertaken because some of the benefits from R&D are captured not by the firm undertaking the investment but by other firms in New Zealand. If a tax subsidy is justified on those grounds, it is important that the measure addresses a specific market failure, that the market failure is not driven by other poor regulatory settings and that providing a tax incentive is the best way of addressing the issue. 11.5 Another possible argument for incentives is that, if targeted to mobile investment, investment might be attracted without reducing activity in other areas. 11.6 By targeting specific industries, a case can be made that, overall, tax competition might be less damaging because it allows higher general tax rates. 11.7 Another perspective is not to look at this approach as a system that has low rates for specific industries or activities, but rather as a system that ha s a low cost of capital for industries generally but levies higher tax rates on particularly immobile tax bases. This approach (levying higher tax rates on immobile tax bases) has been followed to some degree in a country like Norway (with very high taxes on oil and gas but a broad-based low-rate system generally). Cons Moving away from a broad-based low-rate system 11.8 The underlying logic of a broad-based low-rate system is that the most profitable pre-tax investments are the most productive investments. That is, they generate the most income for a given investment cost. New Zealand is likely to have the lowest cost tax system (for a given amount of revenue) if it ensures that the tax system is distorting the choice of investments by as little as possible. In chapter 2, we discussed some general benefits of neutrality in tax settings. 11.9 The primary weakness of specific incentives is that they create distortions to the economy through preferential treatment. This can have indirect costs even 98 if the investment would not have taken place but for the incentive. This will happen if the favoured investment or activity crowds out other investment or activity that is taxed at the general rate. Normally this would be expected to reduce economic efficiency and productivity relative to providing more neutral tax cuts that cost a similar amount. 11.10 Specific incentives (a move towards a narrow-based high-rate system) would make sense if the government were able to somehow know that, although an investment was less profitable pre-tax than other investments, it was nevertheless more in New Zealand’s interests for the investment to be undertaken, and if there were no better instrument to address this presumed market failure other than the tax incentive. The key weakness is about the ability and incentives to gather that knowledge. 11.11 As noted in the 2001 McLeod Review, arguments for favourable tax treatment due to positive externalities or other benefits can become “a platform for practically any lobbyist’s reform agenda”. 57 International dilution 11.12 As a result of the OECD Pillar 2 work, special incentives will be less effective in promoting investment. At times they will bring some entities’ tax rates below the minimum rate under Pillar 2 and this would thereby trigger additional taxation in other countries. When low taxes on specific businesses or industries might be in New Zealand’s best interests 11.13 There can be cases where it makes sense for a country (for example, New Zealand) to undercut a different country’s tax rate to attract investment that can happen in one country or the other (but not both). For example, where this lures highly productive firms to New Zealand with substantial economic rents that they can earn in New Zealand or in other countries and that investment does not draw investment away from other, higher pre-tax return investments in the attracting country (that is, New Zealand). 11.14 Low taxes are most effective where a tax base is very mobile. That is, the firm has an economic rent it can earn, but it can earn that same level of rent regardless of where it operates. If a tax incentive, such as a low company tax rate for certain businesses or industries, lured firms with large firm-specific rents to locate and grow and expand in New Zealand, this could potentially be in New Zealand’s best interests. There would be both the direct revenue benefits of company tax that would otherwise not be collected and the potentially wider skills that might be passed on to other firms that would support productivity and growth. Correctly identifying these businesses or industries is likely to be challenging. When low taxes on specific businesses or industries are unlikely to be in New Zealand’s best interests. 11.15 Low taxes on specific businesses or industries will not be in New Zealand’s best interests when there are large economic rents to be earned while operating in New Zealand, but they are location specific and only arise if the firm operates within New Zealand. 11.16 When there are large location-specific rents, some countries apply higher taxes to the business or activity. A specific extreme example is petroleum resources 57 See paragraph 2.12 of the final report, McLeod Review (2021). 99 in Norway. The ordinary company rate in Norway is 22%, but the additional tax on cash flow principles on petroleum resources is applied at a rate of 56%, giving a total rate of 78%. 58 11.17 In one sense, investment in petroleum extraction ‘competes’ with all other investments available to international investors. However, applying a 78% tax rate may still be a sensible policy because the firm must be in Norway to earn the returns, and those returns are so high that, even after this tax, the investment earns sufficient returns to still attract investment. 11.18 Norway has decided it makes sense to move away from an otherwise broad- based low-rate approach for this specific industry because of the level of economic rent available to firms operating in the industry. This is even though it is a capital-intensive industry with global competition. 11.19 Note that even though there are plenty of other countries with petroleum resources, Norway is not ‘competing’ with these other countries because it is not an either/or question. A firm may appreciate a much lower tax rate in a different country, but it does not have to choose whether to operate in Norway or another country. It can operate and extract and sell petroleum from both countries. Provided the after-tax return in Norway has a positive net present value, it would make sense to operate in both countries, even when the non- Norway country had a more ‘competitive’ tax rate. 11.20 It is challenging to identify areas in New Zealand where location-specific rents are likely to be highest, let alone to design and enforce different tax rates for different activities. Applying higher tax rates where location-specific rents are significant might be easier in an economy with one or two sectors earning high location-specific rents rather than in an economy where these rents are likely to be much more diffuse and harder to identify. 11.21 In his survey of specific incentives and the literature surrounding them, Klemm (2010) provides a pithy conclusion that summarises his scepticism about the ability to target tax rates in a beneficial way: Even if a tax incentive can be useful in principle, a country may be well advised to refrain from introducing one. This reflects the advantage of a coherent and simple tax system, which cannot take account of all issues, especially since they may be changing over time. Moreover, once a system has created the precedence of an exemption for one particular sector or region, the pressure for further ones will increase. The ultimate outcome may be a less efficient tax system, even if a few of the incentives used have a sound economic rationale and are cost-effective. International experience 11.22 Tax incentives for specific businesses or industries are common overseas. The OECD’s publication, Tax Policy Reforms 2020: OECD and Selected Partner Economies, 59 gives a sense of the sorts of activities and investment that draw special incentives: 58 Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, Norwegian Petroleum Directorate.

Previous incentives were more restricted, targeting facilities for (among other activities) research and testing, vocational training, safety, energy saving, and new growth-engine technology commercialisation. The new regime has a ‘negative list system’ 60 that excludes, rather than includes, specified industries and assets. 11.23 In general, specific incentives are particularly common in developing countries, where governments are often trying to balance taxing location-specific rents (for example, mining) at higher rates with attracting other industries with specific incentives. 11.24 Reviews of tax incentives overseas tend to point to a lack of cost-effectiveness (that is, limited additional investment given the fiscal cost) and the risk of rent seeking and corruption, although this is usually in the context of countries that may already suffer from those problems. 61 Views of stakeholders 11.25 CA ANZ commented that this sort of change would be such a significant policy decision and departure from the broad-based low-rate structure that it should only be undertaken after a broader examination of New Zealand’s tax policy frameworks. 11.26 Business NZ strongly supported the existing broad-based low-rate structure and argued that, once tax incentives are considered, this opens a “Pandora’s Box” of concerns about what incentives should be introduced. 11.27 CTG argued overseas examples of successful tax concessions should be considered. The group suggested that the main economic argument against tax concessions is that they need to be funded by higher taxes on other firms (assuming a set revenue need) and they divert resources to activities generating a lower overall return. However, the group argued that such objections do not hold to the extent tax concessions attract activities that contribute tax revenue but would not locate here without the concessions and that engage resources (including personnel) that would otherwise not be here. 60 PwC.

Introduction 12.1 A ‘dual income tax system’ is a system where capital income is taxed separately (at lower rates) from labour income. 12.2 The tax systems in the Nordic countries are generally described as ‘dual income tax systems’: high progressive tax rates are applied to labour income (for example, salaries, wages) while relatively low tax rates are generally applied to capital income (for example, interest, capital gains). In contrast, New Zealand’s income tax system is more of a ‘comprehensive income tax system’, under which capital income is generally taxed at the same rate as labour income, although there are some notable exceptions (for example, portfolio investment entity 62 income is taxed at a top rate of 28%, and capital gains not specified in legislation as taxable are generally non-taxable). 12.3 According to Sørensen (2005), a pure dual income tax system has the following features: • A flat, uniform personal tax on all forms of capital income (including capital gains) levied at a rate equal to the corporate income tax rate. 62 Portfolio investment entities are collective investment vehicles that attract funds for investment on a passive basis from a group of investors. 102 • Full relief for the double taxation of corporate equity income. • A broad tax base for capital income and corporate income. • A basic tax rate on labour income (equal to the capital income tax rate) combined with a progressive surtax on high labour income. Example 12.1 Assume that: • the corporate, basic labour, and flat personal tax rates are 20%, and • the progressive surtax on labour income is 16% on labour income over $100,000 – thus labour income over and above $100,000 is taxed at a total marginal tax rate of 36%. A taxpayer has $160,000 of salary income, $5,000 of interest income from personal investments, and $15,000 of capital losses. This taxpayer does not have any shares, so the technical details of how corporate equity income is taxed in a shareholder’s hands is ignored. This taxpayer would be taxed in the following way: • The taxpayer’s general net income would be $160,000 + $5,000 - $15,000, or $150,000. • Tax on this amount would be $30,000, which is 20% of $150,000. • The taxpayer would also be liable for the surtax percentage points of tax on $60,000 of the salary income. • This is additional tax of $9,600. • Total tax for the taxpayer in this case is $39,600. 12.4 None of the Nordic tax systems have all the features outlined by Sørensen. Norway’s system probably comes closest. 63 12.5 The Nordic systems all make explicit distinctions between types of income, with earned or personal income taxed differently from capital income. Further divisions exist within these two broad categories, particularly for dividends and capital gains. 12.6 The corporate tax rates in the Nordic countries are generally low – between 20% to 22%. 64 In contrast, the personal tax rates are very high, with top marginal tax rates ranging from around 46% to 55%. 12.7 The corporate tax rates are not generally aligned with the tax rates on capital income, and the tax rates on capital income are not completely flat and uniform 63 For example, Sweden’s and Iceland’s corporate tax rates differ from their capital income tax rates; Norway does not provide full double tax relief for corporate equity income; Finland and Denmark do not apply a flat tax to capital income. 64 Apart from Norway, the Nordic countries’ corporate tax bases appear to be narrower than New Zealand’s (despite the larger differential between corporate and personal tax rates). New Zealand’s company tax collected 4.0% of GDP in 2019 and Norway’s collected 5.7% of GDP, while the other Nordic countries’ corporate tax only collected between 2.1% to 3.0% of GDP. Norway’s result is likely driven by the significant resource profits from oil and gas. 103 either. For example, Iceland taxes capital gains, dividends and interest at 22% (with a tax-free threshold for interest), but it taxes rental income at effectively 11%, 65 and both Finland and Denmark tax capital income progressively. 12.8 Different reasons have been put forward for taxing capital income at a lower rate than labour income. As we see it, the main considerations seem to be: 66 • to maintain a reasonably low cost of capital for foreign investors while collecting high levels of tax • to maintain a progressive personal tax system with potentially a significantly higher top rate than New Zealand’s current top rate of 39% • concerns that applying high top marginal tax rates to personal capital income may lead to excessive distortions or to excessive evasion of tax, and • enthusiasm for, or at least a willingness to accept, a low tax rate on capital income as a quid pro quo for quite steeply progressive tax rates on labour income. 12.9 One concern about taxing the capital income of domestic residents at very high rates is that this can distort intertemporal consumption decisions and cause people to save too little for the future. Up until recently (and at the time dual income tax systems were being put in place), the conventional wisdom held by many economists was that taxing the capital income of domestic residents at all was likely to be particularly inefficient. 67 More recent analysis has questioned the robustness of these results, and some analysts have suggested high and progressive taxes on wealth or capital income. 68 Scheuer and Slemrod (2020) puts it as follows: “We point out that the former conventional wisdom – that an optimal tax system would feature no taxes on capital income – has been overturned.” It is fair to say that concerns about intertemporal consumption distortions are probably more muted now than they were when Nordic countries adopted their dual income tax systems. Nonetheless, there is no presumption that capital income should necessarily be taxed at the same rates as labour income. 12.10 A second concern is that capital income taxes can produce significant distortions because different forms of capital income, such as income from housing and interest income, are taxed very differently. As a result, taxes on capital income may be particularly distortionary. 12.11 A third concern is the way that capital income tax distortions can be increased because of inflation and the taxation of inflationary gains. This can compound intertemporal consumption distortions and biases between different types of saving. 12.12 A fourth concern is that capital income may be particularly hard to tax and prone to tax evasion by taxpayers concealing wealth offshore. International agreements on the automatic exchange of information (AEOI) between countries will have helped to moderate some of these concerns. At the same 65 Fifty percent of rental income is taxed at 22%, with the remaining 50% exempt. 66 See also Sørenson, P.B. (2007). 67 Key papers are Atkinson, A. and Stiglitz, J. (1976); Chamley, C. (1986); and Judd, K. (1985). 68 See, for example, Straub, L. and Werning, I. (2020), who argue that standard models did not establish what many claimed they established, and Saez, E. and Zucman, G. (2019), who argue for high and progressive taxes on wealth. 104 time, new innovations, such as blockchain, may be making it harder for tax authorities to find out about taxable income. It is hard to predict now how these pressures are likely to change in the future. 12.13 A fifth concern is the way in which high tax rates on capital income could increase the benefits of interest deductions, especially in times of inflation. Table 12.1: Nordic countries’ tax rates Country Corporate tax rates Personal/earned income tax rates Capital income rates Sweden 21.4% Around 30% to 52%. Figures include municipal taxes of around 32% but not social security contributions. Social security contributions are around 30% but are capped at around NZ$6,000 and can be credited against other taxes. 25% for dividends, interest, capital gains and rental income. Dividends are double taxed (no imputation). Norway 22% Around 30% to 46%. Figures include national insurance of 8.2%. 22% on interest, royalties, rental and capital gains other than on shares. 31.68% for dividends and capital gains on shares, which are double taxed with an RRA deduction allowed (explained below). Finland 20% Around 17% to 55%. Figures include municipal tax (16.75% to 23.5%) and church tax (1% to 2.2%). 30% on dividends, rental income, some interest income, and capital gains up to EUR€30,000. 34% thereafter. Denmark 22% Around 8% to 56%. Figures include municipal tax and the social security levy (tax of around 8%). 27% or 42% on dividends and capital gains on shares. Up to 42.7% on other capital income (for example, interest). Iceland 20% Around 42% to 53%. Figures include municipal taxes and social security (6.85%). 22% on capital gains and dividends, interest and rent. There is a tax-free threshold for interest and only 50% of rent is taxed. 12.14 It is hard to know now if these sorts of concerns are likely to become pressing in New Zealand. If they do, a dual income tax approach is something to be considered. At the same time, measures that reduce taxes on capital income 105 can obviously end up reducing taxes on some of the wealthiest in society, so there are complex fairness concerns to work through. 12.15 If New Zealand wished to move in the dual income tax direction, there are several ways of achieving this, including increasing the rate of GST and using the revenue raised to reduce income taxes or provide payments to households. If this were done in a way that delivers more benefit to those on lower incomes rather than higher incomes, this might be done without reducing the overall progressivity of the tax system. 12.16 The Nordic countries collect very high levels of tax. In 2019, Denmark collected the most tax as a proportion of GDP (46.3%), followed by Sweden (42.9%) and Finland (42.2%). Norway (39.9%) and Iceland (36.1%) collected the least. In comparison, New Zealand’s tax take was 32.3% of GDP. 69 12.17 Despite such high levels of tax, the Nordic countries’ corporate tax rates are all lower than New Zealand’s (see table 12.1). The reasonably low corporate tax rates allow the Nordic countries to maintain reasonably low costs of capital for foreign investors. At the same time, dual income taxes allow the Nordic countries to levy high taxes on labour income 70 without too much distortion. Pros and cons Reducing the cost of capital 12.18 Many of the strengths and weaknesses of a dual income tax system that relate to the lower cost of capital through a lower corporate tax rate are identical to the strengths and weaknesses of lowering the company tax rate, outlined in chapter 6. 12.19 In the context of an exercise looking at costs of capital, the primary strength of a dual income tax system is that it allows a lower cost of capital but still allows greater taxation of domestic residents’ labour and capital income (where that capital income earns a higher than risk-free return). One important difference is that cutting the company tax rate and doing nothing else would tend to make the tax system less progressive. This is because those on higher incomes would obtain greater benefits by sheltering personal income in companies. A dual income tax is one way of allowing a company tax cut but supporting this with other measures that support the integrity and progressivity of the personal tax system. These include measures to integrate the corporate tax system with the personal tax system, possibly including a capital gains tax on shareholders. 12.20 As set out above, a lower tax rate on corporate income also reduces the effect of non-neutralities in the capital income base (for example, depreciation schedules that do not match economic depreciation), potentially reduces avoidance and evasion, and reduces tax distortions to saving. Other aspects of the regime ensure that the portion of nominal income reflecting inflation is taxed less under a dual income tax system than under a comprehensive income tax system. At the same time, there are some complex design and distributional issues to consider. 69 OECD Revenue Statistics 2020. 70 In the case of Norway, on economic rents as well. 106 Issues with the distinction between labour income and capital income 12.21 The distinction between labour income and capital income can be very difficult to draw. Broadly speaking, labour income is earned from performing services (for example, wages, salaries) whereas capital income is earned from investment (for example, ordinary business income, interest, dividends, capital gains). 12.22 However, items that are typically considered ‘capital income’ may also include a labour component. For example, part of the capital gain from buying and selling a property may include value added by labour spent fixing up the property. Similarly, capital gains and dividends from closely held companies may include a component that is properly attributable to work performed by a shareholder- employee in the company who is paid a below-market wage or salary. 12.23 It therefore seems inevitable that a subjective distinction between labour and capital will be complex and give rise to outcomes that, at times, appear inconsistent or arbitrary and create distortions. This is even in the absence of any tax avoidance or minimisation behaviour. A dual income tax system, therefore, cannot rely solely on anti-avoidance rules that consider the ‘true substance’ of income to work out if the amount is capital or revenue. Such subjective rules can only be a backstop at best. Norway illustrates an attempt at more objective ‘income splitting’ rules. Income-splitting rules 12.24 An initial question is how to tax the capital income of sole traders and partnerships where the return comprises both capital and labour income. In principle, there are two potential approaches for splitting income between the capital income and labour income components. 12.25 One approach is to identify labour income by attempting to value the labour services that are being provided and then to treat the residual as capital income. A key problem with that approach is that it seems impractical to value the labour services that are being contributed. 12.26 The second approach, and the one used in practice, is to attempt to value the capital income component and to treat the residual as labour income. This can be done by attempting to value capital assets employed in a business and imputing a standard return on these as capital income. Everything else is treated as labour income and subject to higher progressive marginal tax rates. This means that if someone has a very smart idea and can generate economic rents, these rents will be taxed as labour income. 12.27 Norway calculates capital income by multiplying the value of capital in a business by an imputed interest rate, known as the rate of return allowance (RRA). The RRA, which is currently around 1.3%, is based on interest rates on government bonds and is practically risk free. 71 This income (along with forms of passive capital income, such as interest and rents) is taxed at 22%. Other income is taxed as labour income and subject to higher progressive income tax rates. It should be noted, however, that it is far from a simple exercise to estimate the true risk-free rate, especially in the context of some negative interest rates on government borrowing in Europe. 71 The RRA is based on the 3-month interest rate for Treasury Bills: https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/taxes/get-the-taxes-right/shares-and-securities/about- shares-and-securities/the-shareholder-model/ 107 12.28 Before 2006, Norway had mandatory income-splitting rules for sole traders, partners and closely held companies with active owners to prevent labour income being converted to capital income. 12.29 Sørenson explains that these rules were not very effective. Taxpayers could structure their affairs to avoid being ‘active owners’ and thereby avoid the income-splitting rules. Moreover, the rules were frequently changed, usually to be more generous to taxpayers. The salary deduction adjustment is a good example as Sørenson notes that, by the late 1990s, almost 80% of active shareholders had negative labour income because of the deduction. 12.30 To address the problems with income-splitting rules for companies, Norway introduced a ‘shareholder model’ in 2006, which is still used today. The key features are the RRA, which is calculated on capital invested, and the intentional double taxation of dividends and capital gains on shares. 12.31 The RRA is a deduction that provides relief against double taxation for the risk- free return. Returns above the risk-free rate are intentionally double taxed at a combined effective tax rate (around 46.7%) that is roughly in line with the top marginal tax rate on labour. 72 The tax rate of 31.68% on dividends and capital gains on shares is set to achieve this result. It should be noted that this tax on capital gains is at quite a high rate and appears to be essential in making Norway’s shareholder model work. However, the tax on capital gains is designed to mitigate or eliminate the lock-in effects that are a standard problem with many capital gains taxes. It does this by increasing the cost basis of the shares by any unused RRA. This is more fully explained in Sørensen (2005). 12.32 For companies, the RRA model applies at the individual shareholder level rather than at the corporate level. It applies to both listed and unlisted shares held by residents of Norway (with some exceptions for European Economic Area (EEA) residents for EU law reasons). It applies whether the shareholders are active or passive. 12.33 One reason the RRA model, including the double taxation of returns above the risk-free rate, applies at the shareholder level (rather than corporate level) is so that it does not affect the location decisions of multinational enterprises earning mobile rents. Another reason is that there is a lower revenue cost. This is because many shares may be owned by exempt entities or foreign residents who cannot use a deduction but whose ownership share of corporate income (including the risk-free return) remains taxed at the corporate level. Taxing the capital income of domestic residents and fairness considerations 12.34 As noted above, a key question is the fairness of reducing the taxation of the return to capital of New Zealand residents. On the one hand, this might be dismissed as a regressive measure that favours some of the wealthiest in society who have high capital incomes. For those earning business income, or earning income through companies, the lower tax rate might be restricted to the risk-free return, with any returns over and above these being taxed at labour income tax rates. However, depending on the balance of tax paid under a tax on share gains (required at least in Norway’s dual income tax), as compared with the lower rate on all currently taxable capital income, there might be a reduction in the tax paid by these people. On the other hand, these measures have been put in place by countries with quite progressive fiscal systems, and they have probably enabled the countries to have a considerably 72 $100 profit − $22 tax = $78 available for distribution. $78 × 31.68% = $24.70 tax. Total tax = $22 + $24.70 = $46.70. 108 more progressive tax system on the categories of income that are taxed as labour income. 12.35 For residents, a lower tax rate on the risk-free rate of return to capital would reduce distortions in intertemporal consumption/savings decisions (whether to consume now or save now and consume later) and on the forms of savings undertaken. It would also reduce distortions caused by inflation and might alleviate the tax avoidance pressure that will arise if capital income is taxed at very high rates. A dual income tax system would be complex. 12.36 At the same time, it would provide one way of increasing higher personal marginal tax rates, should future governments wish to do so, without this leading to increases in costs of capital and EMTRs. Alternatively, it might provide a way of reducing costs of capital and EMTRs without changing higher marginal tax rates. 12.37 There are already elements of dual income taxes in New Zealand’s current tax rules. For example, the top marginal tax rate is now 39%, but individuals on this tax rate are taxed only at a capped tax rate of 28% if they invest into portfolio investment entities. Also, income can often be taxed at less than a person’s statutory personal marginal tax rates if they invest into trusts or companies. However, with trusts and companies there is scope for sheltering both capital and labour income. A dual income tax might be one way of increasing the coherence with which different forms of income are taxed. Views of stakeholders 12.38 Business NZ noted that the introduction of a dual income tax system would be complex and present many detailed issues to work through. They raised the question of how high the personal tax rates and/or GST would need to be to compensate for a low tax rate on capital income. Business NZ thought that this option should not be given priority. 12.39 CA ANZ thought this was probably the most attractive of the options, particularly because it seemed to be the most coherent overall reform. 109 REFERENCES Atkinson, A. and Stiglitz, J.

Regulatory Impact Statement: Taxation of the gig and sharing economy: GST Coversheet Purpose of Document Decision sought: Analysis produced for the purpose of informing final Cabinet decisions Advising agencies: Inland Revenue Proposing Ministers: Minister of Revenue Date finalised: 25 May 2022 Problem Definition Digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy facilitate income earning opportunities for small-scale operators on a large scale. Because many of these supplies occur below New Zealand’s GST registration threshold, they are not subject to GST. This has given rise to two policy problems that these proposals seek to address: •Competitive distortion: A competitive distortion arises between traditional suppliers of these services who charge GST, and services undertaken through digital platforms, which are generally not subject to GST. •Sustainability of the GST base: The ability of digital platforms to facilitate income earning opportunities for individuals on such a large scale and generally below the GST registration threshold (and the growth in activity on these digital platforms) h as the potential to erode the GST base over time unless these services enabled by digital platforms are taxed in the same way as supplies of the same services made by other means. Executive Summary Overview The gig and sharing economy refers to economic activity facilitated through digital platforms (commonly referred to as mobile apps) that connect buyers with sellers who share their skills, labour, and assets. Common examples include ridesharing services, short-stay accommodation, and food and beverage delivery services. The gig and sharing economy is growing in popularity as it offers flexible working arrangements and an easy way to connect buyers and sellers. There are no special tax rules for sellers in the gig and sharing economy. They are not employees, so have costs associated with complying with their tax obligations. These include being required to keep records of income and expenses, potentially paying provisional tax, and being required to account for GST. In this regard they are considered self-employed for tax purposes. The proposals being considered by this project on the ‘Taxation of the gig and sharing economy’ cover two main areas. This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) explores options relating to GST. Another RIS has been prepared which covers information reporting and exchange for the gig and sharing economy. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 How GST should apply in the context of the gig and sharing economy GST applies to the broadest possible range of goods and services in New Zealand. This keeps GST fair, simple and efficient. New Zealand’s GST system operates with a $60,000 GST registration threshold which is intended to recognise there are trade-offs between a broad-based GST system and the compliance and administration costs associated with GST registration. These compliance and administration costs potentially fall away (or are significantly reduced) in the context of the gig and sharing economy where transactions are facilitated by large and sophisticated digital platforms with the ability to process millions of transactions on a regular basis. Many sellers who currently operate through digital platforms expect to earn below the GST registration threshold so are not registered for GST. The policy question is whether GST should apply to these supplies and, if so, how best to apply it. Options considered The Government released a discussion document in March 2022 1 which considered two main options: lowering the GST registration threshold for sellers in the gig and sharing economy or extending current electronic marketplace rules to require digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy to collect GST. Although these were the only options formally consulted on in the discussion document, officials have considered a wider range of options, some of which arose out of the consultation process. Briefly, the options considered were as follows: Options not involving digital platforms 1. The status quo 2. Lowering the GST registration threshold for all taxpayers 3. Requiring mandatory GST registration for “listed services” (which are specific gig and sharing economy activities) Options involving digital platforms 4. Extended electronic marketplace rules that would require digital platforms to collect GST in respect of “listed services”. 2 If Option 4 is the preferred solution, there are several other sub-decisions that need to be made from a detailed policy design perspective that inform how the proposals would work in practice. These are: • Defining “listed services”: If digital platforms are required to collect GST in respect of activities undertaken by sellers through their digital platforms, it would need to be determined which activities were “listed services” and therefore subject to GST collection by the digital platforms. Two options are considered here: 1. An approach that focused on the sectors the gig and sharing economy that create the most urgent GST pressures at this time (accommodation, transportation, and food and beverage delivery services). 1 The role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy. (2022). Available at: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2022/2022-dd-digital-platforms-gig-sharing-economy 2 A variation of this option would allow sellers that are registered for GST to continue to return GST to Inland Revenue on supplies of services they make through digital platforms, but this is not supported by officials for integrity reasons. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 2. A wider approach (which, in addition to those sectors outlined in option 1 also includes a wide range of personal and professional services). • Options to allow sellers to claim GST on their costs: If digital platforms are required to charge GST on supplies made through them, sellers would need a method for claiming back GST on their costs. Three options are considered here: 1. Standard GST registration where sellers would register for GST and provide GST returns in the same way as any other business or self-employed person 2. A flat rate scheme where digital platforms collect GST at the standard rate, and return a portion of this to Inland Revenue, with the remaining amount being paid to the seller in recognition of the GST component of their costs 3. Refunding GST on sellers’ costs as part of the annual income tax return process. The preferred option Option 4 is the preferred option. Under this option, digital platforms will be required to return GST on supplies of “listed services” as if the digital platform itself had made the supply, even though the services were performed by the seller through the digital platform. For integrity reasons and to reduce complexity with the design and implementation of the rules, this will apply to all supplies of “listed services” made through the digital platform, irrespective of whether the underlying seller was registered for GST or not. Under the preferred option, “listed services” are transportation services (which includes ridesharing and food and beverage delivery) and taxable accommodation. These sectors were identified by the OECD as the most significant in terms of the gig and sharing economy currently. Also included in “listed services” are other services closely connected with these services. Existing rules for determining when an electronic marketplace is a supplier for the purposes of the remote services rules will be leveraged to achieve this. Sellers would be able to recover GST on their costs associated with making supplies through digital platforms through either: • The standard GST registration: This involves registering for GST and claiming GST deductions in the same way as any other business or self-employed person. In all cases where a seller is registered for GST, the output tax is still returned by the platform. • The digital platform applying a flat rate of GST: Under a flat rate system, GST is still charged on the supply at a standard rate of 15%. However, only a proportion of this is returned to Inland Revenue, with the remainder given to the underlying seller as a proxy for their GST costs. This amount recognises the seller would otherwise be over-taxed through not having a mechanism to recover GST on costs assoc iated with making supplies through digital platforms. The flat rate would be set at 6.5%, with the remaining 8.5% to be returned to the underlying seller as a proxy for their costs. This amount has been arrived at through an analysis of sellers’ costs in these industries. Sellers with turnover greater than $60,000 would still be required to register for GST and would not be able to use the proposed flat rate scheme, however digital platforms would still be responsible for collecting and paying GST to Inland Revenue. The preferred option would impact the following stakeholders in the following ways: • Digital platforms: They would be required to collect GST on sales made by sellers through their platforms and pay this to Inland Revenue. Digital platforms would need to account for this additional tax which could reduce their competitive advantage currently held over traditional suppliers of the same services that generally have been collecting and paying GST already. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 • Sellers on digital platforms: Sellers on digital platforms that are registered for GST would no longer be required to return output tax, as this would be collected by digital platforms on their behalf. GST registered sellers would continue to claim GST on their expenses in the usual way. Sellers operating through digital platforms that are not registered for GST would be subject to a flat rate of GST at a reduced rate to account for the otherwise unrecoverable GST on their expenses. • Inland Revenue: As a result of requiring digital platforms to collect GST in respect of “listed services” through digital platforms, Inland Revenue would potentially have to monitor and police a large influx of GST registered sellers seeking to claim GST on their expenses (to the extent they elected to register over a flat rate scheme). Inland Revenue would also have to undertake monitoring to ensure compliance with the rules. This would require Inland Revenue resource and therefore have administration costs. Consultation There were 13 submitters on the discussion document: Airbnb, the Asia Internet Coalition, Baker McKenzie, Booking.com, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Corporate Taxpayers Group, Delivereasy, EY, KPMG, the New Zealand Law Society, PwC, Trade Me, and Uber NZ. Submitters did not support implementing extended electronic marketplace rules for activities in the gig and sharing economy noting the complexities involved and the lack of evidence available to suggest that the absence of GST on most supplies of services through gig and sharing economy digital platforms is distorting consumer decisions. Limitations and Constraints on Analysis The main constraint or limitation on the analysis is that the gig and sharing economy is difficult to measure. This problem is international and not specific to New Zealand. While the OECD’s extended model rules for information reporting and exchange might start t o provide information on the size of the gig and sharing economy in New Zealand, the information exchange will take some time to implement and for the information to be flowing. The number of sellers that operate in the gig and sharing economy in New Zealand in the sectors of short- stay accommodation, transportation, and food and beverage delivery services is expected to be in the 10s of thousands, but it has been difficult to verify this with any degree of certainty. This still represents a significant amount of economic activity that is not subject to GST and in officials’ views waiting for more information on the size of the gig and sharing economy will not influence the outcomes of the thinking that has been done to date. There were no other significant constraints or limitations on the analysis in this statement. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 Responsible Manager Graeme Morrison Policy Lead Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue 25 May 2022 Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Panel Assessment & Comment: The Quality Assurance panel at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Taxation of the gig and sharing economy: GST Regulatory Impact Statement prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Statement meets the quality assurance criteria. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? GST is designed to apply to the broadest possible range of goods and services supplied in New Zealand. This keeps GST fair, simple and efficient. New Zealand has a GST registration threshold of $60,000 and suppliers with turnover under this threshold are not required to (but still can choose to) register for GST. GST registered persons need to add GST to their supplies of goods and services (unless they are exempt supplies) and can claim a credit for the GST on the costs they incur in producing those supplies. Recent years have seen the rapid development of digital platforms and electronic marketplaces which quickly and easily connect a product or service provider with potential buyers. This is driven by modern technologies (such as mobile phone applications and online websites) that enable digital platforms to facilitate transactions between sellers and buyers. Many sellers operating through gig and sharing economy digital platforms are small suppliers who are not required to be registered for GST, but viewed collectively, facilitate hundreds of millions of dollars of sales through digital platforms that are not subject to GST (or where GST applies to a small component – the facilitation services from the digital platforms to the underlying sellers – instead of the overall transaction). A study of the major global markets placed the size of the gig and sharing economy at US$204 billion in 2018, with that size projected to reach US$455 billion by 2023. 3 The estimated size of the gig and sharing economy in New Zealand is $1.9 Billion excluding GST. What is the policy problem or opportunity? The proliferation of the gig and sharing economy and this unique business model gives rise to two key policy considerations. The first is that a competitive distortion arises between traditional suppliers who compete with digital platforms and who generally do charge GST, and digital platforms which generally do not charge GST on services provided through them, and therefore have a competitive advantage. This problem arises particularly in the context of the gig and sharing economy because large digital platforms facilitate an income earning opportunity for small economic actors on a large scale. This means that, viewed collectively, sellers in the gig and sharing economy have a large and disruptive effect on traditional industries that provide the same services. The second key policy issue is that the large-scale nature of the gig and sharing economy has the potential to erode the NZ GST base as more people switch to this way of working and away from other more traditional business models that do charge GST. It is therefore important from a tax policy perspective to consider whether current GST policy settings are appropriate in light of the growth of the gig and sharing economy to ensure the sustainability of the GST base going forward. New Zealand’s GST system has been expanded in the last decade to apply to offshore suppliers of remote services and low value imported goods. A key feature of these recent changes is the role of digital platforms and electronic marketplaces. Special rules treat electronic marketplaces as the supplier of goods or services provided through their platforms 3 https://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Gig-Economy-White-Paper-May-2019.pdf. (This study was conducted prior to COVID-19. It is unclear what impact COVID-19 will have on the global gig and sharing economy long term.) 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 instead of the underlying suppliers who include the likes of software developers and goods sellers. These electronic marketplaces have similar characteristics to the digital platforms that facilitate activity in the gig and sharing economy. One view is that the existence of these digital platforms reduces the compliance and administration costs associated with collecting GST revenues for tax authorities. This is because digital platforms have a business model which necessitates them being able to deal with thousands of transactions on an on-going basis, and most digital platforms will already be registered for GST in New Zealand because of the remote services rules. If the status quo continues there is a risk of erosion of the GST base as the gig and sharing economy continues to grow and the disruptive effect that gig and sharing economy platforms have on traditional business models will continue. Changes are therefore necessary to ensure the sustainability of the GST base and a level playing field with traditional business models. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? The objectives are to: • Address issues relating to competitive neutrality caused by the GST system by ensuring that supplies of services provided through digital platforms have a similar GST treatment to supplies of the same kind of services made through other means. • Protect the long-term sustainability of the GST base in New Zealand by maintaining a broad-based GST system that is responsive to emerging trends and technologies. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? The criteria that have been used to assess the options are: • Fairness: Is the preferred option effective at ensuring that those in the same position pay the same amount of tax (horizontal equity)? Fairness refers to traditional suppliers and sellers in the gig and sharing economy facing similar GST rules. • Efficiency: Do the preferred options minimise impediments to economic growth? Do the options avoid distortions to taxpayer decisions? • Coherence: Do the preferred options make sense in the context of the entire tax system and New Zealand’s international tax relations? Are the preferred options consistent with New Zealand’s broad-base low-rate framework? • Compliance costs: Do the preferred options encourage sellers in the gig and sharing economy to comply with their tax obligations with low compliance costs? (Regarding options to claim input tax credits.) Does the preferred option impose disproportionate compliance costs on digital platforms? • Administration: Are the preferred options possible for Inland Revenue to implement and administer without substantial ongoing administration costs? • Sustainability: Is the preferred option future-proofed? Is it scalable for other activities in the future? Will the preferred option protect the sustainability of the GST base going forward? • Administration: Are the preferred options possible for Inland Revenue to implement and administer without substantial ongoing administration costs? What scope will options be considered within? The scope of options was initially informed by the work completed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in a report on “The impact of the growth of the sharing and gig economy on VAT/GST policy and administration”. New Zealand specific proposals were developed and consulted on in the discussion document The role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy which was published in March 2022. The discussion document canvassed the relevant experiences of other countries in this area, and this informed the scope of options which were consulted on (for example, Canada implemented reforms to require digital platforms to return GST on supplies of short-stay accommodation made through them; and Mexico implemented a flat rate of GST to account for sellers’ costs which was consulted on in a New Zealand context). There are no non-regulatory options (being options that do not involve the amending of New Zealand’s legislation) that would achieve the policy objectives. This is because the existing law, and the $60,000 GST registration threshold, means many sellers in the gig and sharing economy are not required to charge GST on their supplies. Non-regulatory options would not achieve the stated objectives which, given their nature, would require amendments to New Zealand’s GST legislation. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 Stakeholder views Submitters did not support extending the electronic marketplace rules for remote services and low value goods to also apply to supplies of short-stay accommodation and personal services facilitated through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy because: • Doing so would introduce additional complexity to New Zealand’s GST system. This includes increasing compliance costs on digital platforms and underlying sellers who would need to comply with any new GST rules. • The discussion document did not contain economic modelling or analysis that suggested the lack of GST on many services in the gig and sharing economy resulted in distortions. • It would be inconsistent with the approach taken by many other OECD countries, where the focus was on implementing the OECD’s information reporting and exchange framework and using that information to improve compliance with existing GST rules. What options are being considered? Option One – Status quo Individual sellers in the gig and sharing economy will only be required to register, and collect, GST on supplies they make provided they exceed the registration threshold of $60,000 in a 12-month period. Digital platforms are not responsible for collecting GST on supplies made through them. As the gig and sharing economy is dominated by small operators operating below the GST registration threshold, the status quo would not achieve the policy objectives of treating supplies of the same or similar services in the same way for GST purposes and ensuring the sustainability of the GST base. Option Two – Lowering the GST registration threshold across the board New Zealand’s GST registration threshold of $60,000 could be lowered so that more sellers were required to be registered for GST, including those who operate in the gig and sharing economy. The advantage of this approach over the status quo is that it would help achieve the stated policy objective of treating supplies of the same or similar services in the same way for GST purposes and promotes the objective of ensuring the sustainability of the GST base. The disadvantages of this option are that any general changes to the GST registration threshold would have a broad impact across all sectors of the economy. This option also does not eliminate the competitive distortion problem. This is because digital platforms would still be facilitating income earning opportunities for many people beneath the new registration threshold in direct competition with traditional businesses that were subject to GST. Similarly, this option does not ensure the sustainability of the GST base into the future, as it would depend on where the new registration threshold was set. There could still be a considerable number of “smaller” sellers beneath the threshold that would have a disruptive effect on these sectors of the economy. It is also noted that lowering the GST registration threshold would create a different set of issues in terms of ensuring sellers were compliant with their GST obligations. The option fails to recognise the role that large digital platforms with oversight of transactions running through them could have to support the policy objectives more effectively. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 Option 3 – Requiring sellers in specified industries to be registered for GST This option would require GST registration of sellers that provided specifically prescribed activities, for example short-stay accommodation, transportation/ridesharing, and food and beverage delivery services. This would result in a targeted reduction of the GST registration threshold for specific areas of the economy. This option could achieve the stated policy objectives, but it would result in significant compliance costs for sellers in specific areas of the economy who would be required to register for GST. This also has administrative implications for Inland Revenue as there would be an increase in the number of GST registered persons in the system, which has corresponding administrative implications, for example the processing of GST returns and registrations and general support which would be required. Option 4 – Extended electronic marketplace rules that require digital platforms to collect GST on listed services Digital platforms (which are currently recognised in the GST Act as “electronic marketplaces”) in the gig and sharing economy would be responsible for collecting GST as if the digital platform itself had made the supply, even though the services were provided by the seller on the digital platform. To minimise the disruptive effect of any proposals on large commercial operators who are already complying with GST obligations, we recommend that the proposals include a way for digital platforms and large commercial operators to agree to allow large commercial operators to continue returning GST themselves. This is consistent with the general purpose of the proposals, which is to minimise compliance costs to the extent possible while ensuring GST applies to activities in the gig and sharing economy. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 Why a solution that involves digital platforms? The policy rationale for the GST registration threshold is to recognise that there is a trade-off between having a broad GST base that minimises distortions against the compliance and administration costs associated with GST registration. Looked at individually, many sellers in the gig and sharing economy operate below the GST registration threshold of $60,000 in a 12-month period and the compliance and administration costs associated with GST registration outweighs the benefits of GST registration. Looked at collectively, however, digital platforms facilitate a considerable proportion of economic activity which is not currently subject to full GST. 4 This is counter to the principle of maintaining a broad GST base that minimises distortions. These compliance and administration considerations are largely mitigated in the context of the gig and sharing economy where a large platform with the ability to manage hundreds of thousands of transactions on an on-going basis and facilitates and has oversight over all the activity of the underlying seller through that platform. By placing the compliance costs on the platform of collecting and returning GST, this option reduces compliance costs that may be faced by the underlying sellers themselves if they had to comply with GST registration and return filing obligations. Like many other countries, New Zealand has implemented expansions to its GST rules in the last decade to require digital platforms/electronic marketplaces to return GST on supplies of remote services and low value imported goods. These rules treat electronic marketplaces as the supplier of goods or services provided through their platforms instead of the underlying suppliers, who include the likes of software developers and goods sellers. These rules are working well and have shown that the GST system can adapt to new technologies and in cross-border situations. They have also improved the fairness of the GST system by treating supplies of similar goods and services in the same way. The natural next step is that the involvement of digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy be examined in the same way, as collecting GST from digital platforms helps minimise compliance costs for sellers and simultaneously addresses the desired policy objectives of a sustainable GST system that minimises distortions. Another advantage of requiring the digital platforms to collect GST rather than the individual sellers themselves is that it reduces opportunities for non-compliance. This is because GST is collected and returned by the platform directly. Option 4: Sub-decision: What services would be in scope of extended electronic marketplace rules? If digital platforms were required to collect GST on activities undertaken by sellers through platform, the activities that were “listed services” would need to be determined. There are two options for determining what activities would be in scope of extended electronic marketplace rules: 1. Focused approach: This focuses on the sectors the gig and sharing economy that create the most urgent GST pressures. These are currently short-stay accommodation, transportation/ridesharing, and food and beverage delivery services. 4 Digital platforms will generally charge and collect GST on the facilitation services they provide to sellers in the gig and sharing economy under the GST rules for remote services. This is a small proportion of the overall transaction. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 2. Broad approach: In addition to those sectors in option 1, this also includes a broader range of personal services which includes other professional services such as freelancing, translation services, web, and graphic design, etc. The focused approach is the preferred approach. This is because it accounts for sectors in the gig and sharing economy that are already well developed and create the most urgent pressures from a GST perspective. While the broad approach brings in a broader range of economic activity that should, prima facie, be subject to GST in light of this analysis, it is not supported. This is because GST is already collected on many personal services through the remote services rules and bringing personal services in scope would result in additional complexity and cross-over with the remote services rules which officials consider are working well. While tax policy officials consider there are good arguments for including a broad range of personal services in the GST system where those services are facilitated through digital platforms, additional time is needed to develop proposals that minimise complexity. As the gig and sharing economy is expected to continue to grow over time, as new and emerging business models gain in popularity, any solution that is implemented now should be scalable in the future. The preferred option therefore includes the ability to add additional activities that would be subject to the same rules as are proposed for supplies of taxable accommodation, transportation, and food and beverage delivery services. This approach would allow the GST Act to be amended in the future as the gig and sharing economy develops. Option 4: Sub-decision: GST on sellers’ costs The decision to implement electronic marketplace rules for remote services and low value imported goods did not give rise to how GST on sellers’ costs might be recovered. This is because the underlying suppliers in these circumstances would generally be unlikely to have New Zealand GST embedded in the costs associated with producing these types of supplies. This is not the case for the gig and sharing economy where the underlying suppliers (sellers) will have New Zealand GST on the costs they incur in producing the supplies in New Zealand through digital platforms. The discussion document considered three different methods for enabling sellers to recover GST on their costs. The discussion document also noted that there was no obvious solution and that all options recognise there are trade-offs between accuracy, compliance and administration costs. The three options to address this issue were: 1. Standard GST registration: Sellers could register for GST and complete GST returns in the usual way to claim credits for the GST on their expenses. Sellers would only be required to account for GST on sales made for other supplies they make outside of the digital platform to Inland Revenue. The advantage of this option is it allows sellers to claim the GST component of their actual costs as a credit (the same as any other self-employed person who is registered for GST), but this increases compliance costs for sellers who otherwise would not have an incentive to register for GST. There was mixed support from submitters for this option on the discussion document. 2. Flat-rate scheme: GST would be collected by digital platforms at the standard rate of 15 percent, but 6.5 percent would be returned to Inland Revenue as GST with the difference (8.5 percent) being returned to the seller in recognition of the GST component of their 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 costs. 5 Sellers would not be able to claim actual GST deductions for expenses incurred in making their supplies as the reduced GST rate would be a proxy for recognising the GST costs on their expenses. This option reduces sellers’ compliance costs but the amount a seller receives back to account for their GST costs is an approximation only. There was also mixed support from submitters for this option on the discussion document. 3. Refunding GST on costs as part of the annual income tax return process: This option would allow sellers who were not registered for GST to claim back GST on their costs by providing them with a refundable tax credit when they provided their annual income tax return. In theory, this method reduces compliance costs relative to Option 1 (because sellers will always have to provide an annual income tax return) and would be more accurate than the flat rate scheme in Option 2 because it provides an opportunity for GST on actual costs incurred (rather than applying a proxy) but it is complex. It also means that sellers would only get the tax credit annually (as opposed to more frequently compared with Options 1 and 2) and could be confusing because it incorporates GST in the income tax return process in a novel way. This option was not supported by submitters on the discussion document. The preferred option is a combination of Options 1 and 2: optional GST registration with a flat rate scheme applying for sellers that choose not to register for GST. Under the preferred option, sellers could choose to register for GST in the usual way and claim back any GST on their expenses. Sellers with turnover greater than $60,000 would be required to register for GST and would not be able to use the flat rate (the platform would still return their output tax). If sellers with turnover under $60,000 chose not to register for GST, the flat rate would apply and the digital platforms would apply a flat rate treatment where GST was returned to Inland Revenue at a 6.5% instead of the standard rate, with the 8.5% difference being passed on to the sellers by the platform. This option was suggested by several submitters on the discussion document. This option is preferred because it provides sellers with flexibility to claim GST on their actual costs if they choose to, but it also ensures that those who are not registered for GST are recognised in some way without needing to increase their compliance costs through GST registration. At the margins, this option also has administrative benefits for Inland Revenue as it should reduce the incentive to be registered for GST for those who operate through digital platforms. Financial implications of preferred option (Extended electronic marketplace rules that require digital platforms to collect GST on listed services) The preferred option is expected to raise approximately $47 million per annum. This fiscal estimate was arrived at using a ‘bottom up’ approach. Digital platforms currently return GST on their facilitation fees. GST returns of specific digital platforms who provided “listed services” were analysed to determine the amount of GST paid on their facilitation fees. This amount was then grossed up to impute the underlying sales to the customer of the service and then scaled appropriately. 5 The specific percent split ascribed to the flat rate of GST (6.5%) and the amount returned to sellers to account for GST on their expenses/inputs (8.5%) was not covered in the discussion document. This was determined after this option was chosen through an analysis of sellers’ costs as included in GST returns for the relevant sectors of the gig and sharing economy. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 The fiscal estimate then accounted for the GST component of sellers’ costs, with the projections accounting for both GST registered sellers and those that would be subject to the 6.5% flat rate. Once sellers’ costs were taken into consideration, this resulted in an estimate of $47 million revenue gain per annum from these proposals. This estimate does not account for any future growth in the gig and sharing economy and assumes all sellers who would be better off registering for GST than under a flat rate elect to do so (some will not due to inertia which would result in a greater revenue gain than the forecast amount). 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 How do the options compare to the status quo/counterfactual? Option One – Status quo Option Two – Lowering the GST registration threshold across the board Option 3 – Requiring sellers in specified industries to be registered for GST Option 4 – Extended electronic marketplace rules that require digital platforms to collect GST on listed services Fairness 0 -- + ++ Compliance costs 0 - - 0 Admin costs 0 -- - - Efficiency 0 0 + ++ Coherence 0 - 0 + Sustainability 0 + + ++ Overall assessment 0 -- + ++ Example key for qualitative judgements: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual + better than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual - worse than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 What option is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits? The option that is most likely to achieve the policy objectives outlined in this statement is Option 4. By requiring digital platforms to collect GST, Option 4 ensures that compliance costs are reduced for sellers and that GST will be reliably collected on supplies made through them. This model applies to a set of listed services, being activities that are well developed in the gig and sharing economy and for which there is a strong evidence base for urgent pressures from a GST perspective. For sellers to recover the GST on the costs, the combination of an optional GST registration and the flat rate scheme for GST unregistered persons to enable sellers to claim a credit for the GST on their costs ensures fairness and reduced compliance costs for sellers. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 What are the marginal costs and benefits of the option? Affected groups (identify) Comment nature of cost or benefit (eg, ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg, compliance rates), risks.

Supplies of listed will now be subject to GST. Although it is likely that digital platforms would raise their prices to account for GST, this could result in some drop in demand. This would impact sellers’ incomes. Low Medium People who purchase listed services through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy If GST is required to be collected by digital platforms on these services, it is assumed this will be passed on fully to consumers. This will increase the cost to consumers of purchases made through digital platforms by up to 15 percent. Medium/High Medium/High Digital platforms Would have to start collecting GST on supplies of listed services made through them. This would have pricing implications and systems implications. .

Non-monetised benefits Low to Medium 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08 Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? The preferred option (Option 4 – extended electronic marketplace rules that require digital platforms to collect GST on listed services) would require amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the implementation and administration of the new rules. Inland Revenue will provide guidance to digital platforms and sellers affected by any changes to ensure there is an understanding of the new rules. This would include supporting digital platforms through ongoing discussions with them. The usual guidance would be published on the changes on Inland Revenue’s website and in a Tax Information Bulletin shortly after any changes were enacted into law. Submitters on the discussion document noted the importance of development time to make the necessary changes to their systems. It was noted that a period of 12 months following enactment of any changes and the publication of clear guidance was generally necessary. Officials’ advice on the effective date of any proposals would therefore take this into account. How will the new arrangements be monitored, evaluated, and reviewed? Inland Revenue would seek funding for additional resource to monitor the estimated increase in GST registrations and additional contacts from taxpayers because of these changes. Inland Revenue would also undertake increased compliance activity for unfiled returns, other general non-compliance (such as debt collection), and complaints. The GST proposals discussed in this RIS are alongside a proposal on information reporting and exchange (which is discussed in a separate RIS) that, if implemented, will result in Inland Revenue having better information about sellers’ activities on digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy. There is an obvious synergy here in that the receipt of these information flows would further help to bolster compliance initiatives for the GST proposals. More generally, policy officials would also maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if agreed by Parliament. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:08
and makes it harder for individual taxpayers working in the gig and sharing economy to fulfil their tax obligations. As part of our policy thinking in this space, we are looking to improve Inland Revenue’s access to information held by digital platforms in the sharing and gig economy platforms, which receive a great deal of income information about sellers. This will make it easier for individuals to comply with their income tax obligations and support income tax compliance. The two proposals that were consulted on in the discussion document The role of digital platforms in the taxation of the gig and sharing economy which was released in March 2022 are: implementing rules designed by the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development (the OECD) that would see the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities of income information from digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy, or designing rules that are bespoke to New Zealand’s tax system. Option 1 – The OECD solution The OECD developed a set of model reporting rules with digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy which require digital platforms to provide information to tax authorities about sellers who operate on their platforms. This information includes identifying information about the sellers and detail of income earned through the digital platforms. There are two variations of this option. The first requires information to be provided by platforms that facilitate the sale of personal services and rental of immovable property. The second option is an extended version of the model rules which also applies to the sale of goods and vehicle rental. 1 These will be discussed at greater length in the options section of this RIS. If New Zealand implemented an OECD based solution, this would help improve Inland Revenue's visibility over income earned through digital platforms and could be used in various ways to support tax compliance, such as through prompting sellers to file returns or pre-populating income tax returns (it is noted that pre-population would not be considered until at least year 4 to allow information sharing between jurisdictions time to properly bed in). The way these rules operate requires jurisdictions who implement the rules to collect certain information about the activities of sellers on digital platforms that are tax resident in their country. Information must be shared by tax authorities that collect information from digital platforms that are tax resident in their jurisdiction with other tax authorities of other jurisdictions to the extent that the information relates to tax residents in their jurisdiction, and where that jurisdiction has also implemented the OECD’s rules. Advantages of the OECD solution One clear advantage of this OECD led solution is that it promotes a standardised schema with significant buy in and consultation having been undertaken with the digital platforms themselves. This standardised schema reduces compliance costs for platforms . If jurisdictions designed their own rules, the variations between jurisdictions would result in increased compliance costs for digital platforms that had to design their information systems to satisfy the requirements of multiple bespoke rules. This solution leverages existing technological frameworks that have been implemented by tax authorities worldwide for the automatic exchange of information of financial account information. 1 Ridesharing falls under ‘personal services’. Vehicle rental refers to when the seller themselves provides a vehicle for rent through a platform. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00 Not only does an OECD led solution reduce compliance costs for platforms, but it is also sustainable for the long term as its received widespread buy-in from platforms and provides good quality information to jurisdictions. Disadvantages of the OECD solution The OECD model rules follow a prescribed schema that provides information exchange on a calendar year basis. This means that if the information were to be later used for pre- population of income tax returns an alteration would need to be made to account for our tax year (which is 1 April to 31 March), such as by deeming the income earned on a calendar year to have been earned for a tax year or only pre- populating 9 months of income information. The success of the information flows from model rules is also dependent on other countries signing up for improved information flows. This is because information will only be shared among tax authorities whose countries have implemented the rules (that is, if New Zealand implemented the rules, Inland Revenue would onl y receive information from other tax authorities that were also subject to the rules). Option 2 – Bespoke rules The second option considered is for the Government to design and implement its own rules for information collection and reporting in New Zealand as opposed to implementing the OECD schema. Advantages of bespoke rules One clear advantage of developing bespoke rules is that we could prescribe the data we wanted to collect from platforms along with the frequency and timing of this information, which would allow for easier pre-population of income information. Disadvantages of bespoke rules A bespoke solution for NZ would increase compliance costs for digital platforms and could result in reduced appetite for them to operate in New Zealand. It would also take much longer to implement as more extensive consultation would need to be taken with digital platforms (noting under the OECD solution a lot of this has been done). Another disadvantage of a bespoke solution is that it would be more difficult for New Zealand to collect data from non-resident digital platforms with NZ sellers. This is because our domestic law would have no legal effect, and our information requests would be sitting outside the internationally agreed OECD framework which has received a large degree of buy-in across many jurisdictions. Platforms are less likely to comply with requests that sit outside the standardised OECD schema due to increased compliance costs as previously mentioned. Option 1 is the preferred option, with officials preferring the extended version of the model rules over the more limited version. Impact of the preferred option The driver of the OECD’s model rules is to create a standardised information reporting and exchange framework that minimises compliance costs on digital platforms (by ensuring they only need to report information to one tax authority as opposed to several) while improving tax authorities’ access to information about income earned by sellers on those digital platforms, which is useful for tax administration purposes. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00 The information that Inland Revenue would receive from other tax authorities under the OECD’s information reporting and exchange framework will reduce sellers’ abilities to conceal or under-report income they earn in the gig and sharing economy. This information could be used by Inland Revenue to ensure that those who earn income from the gig and sharing economy are paying the correct amount of tax ( Inland Revenue could use this information to support compliance initiatives or, after information flows mature, pre-populate income tax returns. It is noted that pre-population of income tax returns is undertaken on a gross basis and not a net basis. This means that Inland Revenue would still be reliant on sellers to record deductions for expenses incurred in deriving income. If taxpayers did not record their expenses, they would effectively be overtaxed. Although income tax is ultimately a self- assessment regime irrespective of pre-population, this consideration around sellers’ expenses does not apply to the same extent in the employment and investment income context. 2 All considered, pre-population is still an improvement over the status-quo as it ensures income generated through the gig and sharing economy is captured in sellers tax returns. In some circumstances standard cost deductions are available to support sellers to arrive at their profits in their income tax returns with minimal compliance costs. In terms of specific impacts, the following parties are affected in the following ways: • Digital platforms: Limited impact on platforms as they have already indicated approval to adopt the standardised OECD schema approach through consultation with OECD. Platforms will need to provide information in respect of sellers on their platforms. This will require platforms to develop the necessary systems, however they will already be doing so anyway as other countries move to adopt the OECD rules. • Sellers operating in the gig and sharing economy: Reduced opportunities to conceal or under-report their income from activities in the gig and sharing economy as income information will be reported by a third party and/or through other tax authorities. At the margins, there may be a decrease in sellers’ compliance costs because they may be able to see the information that Inland Revenue holds on income earned through digital platforms (consistent with income earned from investments and employment). Sellers will still need to track their expenses and claim deductions for these to ensure that income tax was only paid on their profits from these activities. • Inland Revenue: Changes will be required to Inland Revenue’s START system to ensure that the information received from digital platforms and other tax authorities is aligned with the OECD’s schema. There will be additional ongoing administration costs to support the information exchange with other tax authorities (ensuring the data meets appropriate data quality standards). Changing the START system to show the income information received from digital platforms and/or other tax authorities for sellers will also be required in the future, and after several years of the information exchange having run to address any issues around data integrity that may arise. Consultation These proposals were included in the discussion document. There were 13 submitters on the discussion document: Airbnb, the Asia Internet Coalition, Baker McKenzie, 2 Taxpayers are not able to claim expenses incurred in deriving employment income. Although taxpayers are able to claim expenses incurred in deriving investment income, these are typically less extensive compared to expenses incurred in deriving gig and sharing economy income. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00 Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? Inland Revenue does not regularly or systematically receive information about sellers’ income earned through digital platforms in the gig and sharing economy. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has statutory information gathering powers and could require information be provided on an ad-hoc basis, but this imposes compliance costs on the provider of the information and would lack the regularity necessary to be useful on a yearly basis. This information would be useful for Inland Revenue to ensure that people in the gig and sharing economy are paying the right amount of tax. Inland Revenue receives regular employment and investment income information from employers and banks, and this is generally used to pre-populate income tax returns. Taxpayers in these circumstances will typically confirm that the information that is pre-populated in their income tax returns is correct and can make adjustments if necessary. This reduces their compliance costs as they do not need to collate information about their income earned from various sources and can instead rely on information that has already been provided to Inland Revenue. Digital platforms are like employers, banks, and other third parties that hold information that would be useful for tax administration purposes. This includes information about the income sellers on their platforms earn. This information would be useful for Inland Revenue if it were available on a regular basis: it could be used to ensure that sellers were declaring the income they earn in their income tax returns, and eventually, in the pre-population of sellers’ income tax returns in a similar way that employment and investment income information is currently. As previously noted, Inland Revenue would still be reliant on sellers to record deductions for expenses incurred in deriving their income to ensure these sellers are not overtaxed, as pre- population would only prefill gross income amounts. Given the increasing popularity of the gig and sharing economy it is appropriate that the Government consider whether its current tax settings are appropriate for: • Sellers on digital platforms. This is because they are treated in the same way as self- employed persons who are responsible for tracking their income and expenditure and completing end of year income tax returns. • Inland Revenue. This is because Inland Revenue is responsible for the administration of the tax system, which includes ensuring and promoting taxpayer compliance with tax laws. Digital platforms are generally sophisticated and have business models which result in them having a significant amount of information that is valuable in a tax administration context. Because digital platforms operate in many different countries it is desirable from their perspective that any requirement to provide tax authorities with information about sellers that use their platform is simple to understand and comply with, and in a low-cost way. The OECD have undertaken work on developing a set of model rules that jurisdictions can implement. These rules will enable information reporting and exchange in respect of income earned by sellers through digital platforms. Digital platforms have been involved in this consultation and support the OECD model rules schema and the standardisation it brings. Standardisation is important to digital platforms from a compliance perspective as it means they do not have to devote resources complying with hugely varied domestic rules. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The policy problem this proposal seeks to address is to improve visibility over incomes earned through the gig and sharing economy. Having access to timely income information will help drive tax compliance by reducing opportunities for sellers to conceal or under-declare their income and may also make it easier for individuals to comply with their tax obligations (through pre-population of income sources in income tax returns). The proposals would affect: • Foreign and domestic digital platforms: These platforms would have reporting obligations to tax authorities about sellers’ income earned on their platforms. This includes compiling reports with identifying information about sellers and their incomes. • Sellers on digital platforms: Inland Revenue would have improved visibility over sellers’ incomes earned on digital platforms. This information could be used by Inland Revenue to support sellers comply with their tax obligations. In the knowledge that Inland Revenue has access to information, this may reduce possibilities for motivated sellers to conceal from Inland Revenue details about the income they earn. Information reported by New Zealand digital platforms to Inland Revenue that related to non-resident sellers’ activities could also be shared with that sellers’ tax authority (if the OECD rules option were selected). A study of the major global markets placed the size of the gig and sharing economy at US$204 billion in 2018, with that size projected to reach US$455 billion by 2023. 3 The estimated size of the gig and sharing economy in New Zealand is $1.9 Billion excluding GST. • Inland Revenue: Under both the OECD rules and a bespoke regime, Inland Revenue would receive income information from digital platforms about sellers operating on these platforms that it could use in its tax administration functions. One reason the lack of visibility that tax authorities have over sellers’ incomes in the gig and sharing economy has not been addressed in the past is that it requires information gathering by digital platforms. The rise of the gig and sharing economy in recent years and the proliferation of individuals who have switched to this method of working provided the OECD with the impetus to examine these issues. Historic analysis undertaken by Inland Revenue on self-employed persons suggest that they underestimate their incomes by an average of 20 percent. The work undertaken by the OECD has been significant in analysing the policy problem, potential solutions and receiving buy-in from jurisdictions and large digital platforms for a set of model rules that promote standardisation. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? The objective is to improve visibility over incomes earned through the gig and sharing economy. Inland Revenue having access to timely income information will help drive the tax compliance of sellers and may make it easier for individuals to comply with their tax obligations. 3 https://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Gig-Economy-White-Paper-May-2019.pdf (This study was conducted prior to COVID-19. It is unclear what impact COVID-19 will have on the global gig and sharing economy long term.) 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00 Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? The critiera that have been used to assess the options are: • Fairness: Is the option effective at facilitating the payment of the correct amount of tax by taxpayers? This is often described as horizontal equity: the idea that people in the same position should pay the same amount of tax. Tax should not be easier to avoid just because someone works in a different industry or sector. • Compliance costs: Do the preferred options encourage sellers in the gig and sharing economy to comply with their tax obligations with low compliance costs? • Administration: Are the preferred options possible for Inland Revenue to implement and administer without substantial ongoing administration costs? • Efficiency: Do the preferred options minimise impediments to economic growth? Do the options avoid distortions to taxpayer decisions? • Coherence: Do the preferred options make sense in the context of the entire tax system and New Zealand’s international tax relations? Are the preferred options consistent with New Zealand’s broad-base low-rate framework? • Sustainability: Are the preferred options future-proofed? Will the options be able to apply and extend to future developments in the gig and sharing economy space without the need for further regulatory change? What are the scope of options? In order to improve visibility over sellers’ incomes in the gig and sharing economy, it follows that Inland Revenue will need access to income information. The only feasible option to improve these information flows is to require digital platforms to provide this income information to Inland Revenue in some way or another. There is scope in terms of the exact categories of information to be collected and the timing and frequency of this information. The options were consulted on in a public consultation paper which also asked for submissions on any alternative options, but no additional options were identified by submitters. What options are being considered? Option One – Status quo Individuals who earn incomes through the gig and sharing economy are responsible for filing their own tax returns. This means that these individuals are required to accurately account for their income and expenses and, where necessary, are required to navigate more complex areas of tax such as apportionment rules and provisional tax. Although the digital platforms through which these individuals work hold a lot of information about incomes earnt through the platform, this information is not regularly provided to Inland Revenue to assist in tax compliance. Many of those who enter the gig and sharing economy are unsophisticated taxpayers who often have limited or no prior experience in managing their tax obligations (they may have previously been employees, for example, where tax is withheld at source and subject to the PAYE system). This means that their participation in the gig and sharing economy is often the first time more complex tax rules fall on them. As a result, most individuals will need access to 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00 complex software products, accountants, or other tax advisors to assist individuals to manage their tax affairs. This presents these sellers with further compliance costs. Under the status quo, Inland Revenue will continue to have limited visibility over incomes earned through digital platforms and platform sellers will continue to have high compliance costs associated with complying with their tax obligations. Option Two – The OECD’s extended model reporting rules Under the extended model rules, Inland Revenue would receive information about sellers’ incomes earned through digital platforms in respect of four categories. These are: • personal services • accommodation rental • the sale of goods, and • vehicle rental. The way in which Inland Revenue would receive income information under the model rules is through an information sharing arrangement with other jurisdictions. Jurisdictions which implement the rules are required to collect certain information about the activities of sellers on digital platforms that are tax resident in their country. This information must then be shared with tax authorities of other countries that have also implemented the rules to the extent that the information relates to persons resident in that jurisdiction. Tax authorities will also receive information from other jurisdictions’ tax authorities where the rules have been implemented. The model rules provide a standardised reporting framework and information exchange. To comply with the OECD schema and other reporting standards that European countries may adopt (for example, the DAC7 directive in Europe) 4 , Inland Revenue would need to apply the model reporting rules to all four categories of information as set out above. If New Zealand did not adopt the extended model rules, Inland Revenue would not be entitled to receive information from European jurisdictions about New Zealand sellers operating on platforms resident in Europe. For example, even if New Zealand adopted the personal services and accommodation rental modules, it would still not receive information from European based jurisdictions in respect of these two categories if it did not adopt the wider model rules. The way that the extended model rules would work in the New Zealand context is that NZ resident digital platforms would be required to provide Inland Revenue with income information for New Zealand resident sellers operating on their platforms for personal services and accommodation rental only. NZ platforms would be required to provide Inland Revenue with income information in respect of non-resident sellers operating through their platforms for all four categories of information. This is because sale of goods and vehicle rental information is required in respect of non-resident sellers under DAC7 and will therefore also be required under NZ rules to ensure we have rules of equivalence with Europe. Inland Revenue could seek to use the information about accommodation rental and personal services in sellers’ income tax returns once the information flows mature over the coming years. The incomes earned through digital platforms in these circumstances would generally be amounts that needed to be declared by sellers themselves for income tax 4 DAC7 refers to the Council Directive (EU) 2021/514 adopted by the Council of the European Union on 22 March 2021. It is very similar in form and function to the OECD model rules but does not need to be discussed at length for the purposes of this RIS. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00 purposes. That is, sellers are required to declare this income in their income tax returns and pay tax on any profits they make for these activities. As previously noted, one key component of New Zealand’s implementation of the extended model rules is that NZ resident platforms would not be required to provide Inland Revenue with income information for NZ resident sellers operating on their platforms for sale of goods or vehicle rental. The sale of goods and vehicle rental are not traditional gig and sharing economy activity types. For the sale of goods, this is because it does not involve the sharing of assets, skills, or labour. It would also be unclear from a platform perspective whether the sale of goods was part of a business or other income earning activity of the seller or merely the sale of personal items that would not give rise to income for income tax purposes. For vehicle rental, it is the digital platform that is the seller. This would be different if a digital platform offered a service of vehicle rental, with the vehicles themselves being provided by a third-party seller. In this situation, the seller would be sharing an asset, and this would be a reportable activity. It is for these reasons that this proposal only requires NZ-resident platforms to provide sale of goods and vehicle rental information to Inland Revenue in respect of non- resident sellers. Requiring NZ resident platforms to provide this information in respect of NZ resident sellers would levy undue compliance costs on these platforms in light of the more limited usefulness of this information. One disadvantage of implementing the OECD model rules generally (this applies to both the extended and base model rules) is that the information would be received on a calendar year basis. This means that it would not neatly align with our tax year (1 April to 31 March) for the purposes of pre-filling income tax returns. If Inland Revenue decided to use the information to pre-populate income tax returns, it would have to either deem the income earned to a calendar year to apply in respect of a tax year, or only pre-populate 9 months of income information. Based on experience with OECD information exchanges in other areas, it is expected that it will take a few years to address data integrity issues with the initial information exchanges. One example of a data integrity issue that may arise is an incorrect or incomplete tax identification number which could make aligning income derived with a specific taxpayer difficult. This may make pre-population of income tax returns as proposed in the discussion document difficult until these issues have been resolved. For this reason, officials’ preferred option is that pre-population be phased in over time and initially Inland Revenue would use the information from the exchange to prompt sellers about their return filing obligations. When compared to the status quo this option presents significant advantages. Adopting the OECD model rules will ensure Inland Revenue receives high quality income information in respect of sellers’ activities on digital platforms. This information could be used to support tax compliance and make it easier for sellers to comply with their tax obligations. The OECD model rules are also a sustainable and coherent solution given that they have received international buy in from multiple jurisdictions and digital platforms. The standardised schema of the OECD model rules also lowers compliance costs for platforms for ease of implementation. Option Three – OECD’s base model rules In contrast to the extended model rules, the base model rules would require digital platforms to provide Inland Revenue with information about sellers’ incomes earned through the platforms in respect of two categories. These are personal services and accommodation rental. This means that digital platforms would not be required to provide information in respect of the sale of goods or vehicle rental. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00 On the face of it, this seems like an attractive option. Given the previous limitations of vehicle rental and sale of goods income information, one view is that these modules should be left off New Zealand’s reporting framework altogether. The primary reason that officials prefer the extended model rules over base rules is that New Zealand would need to have rules of equivalence with Europe (who are implementing the broad DAC7 directive) to receive information from platforms headquartered in Europe. This means that if New Zealand did not adopt the extended model rules, Inland Revenue would not receive information from European platforms about NZ sellers operating on their platforms (this would apply even in respect of accommodating sharing and personal services). As the DAC7 directive is mandated in Europe, any New Zealand platforms with European sellers would be required to provide information on the sale of goods and vehicle rental to these jurisdictions directly anyway. By adopting the extended model rules, this ensures that New Zealand platforms will not need to provide information on their European sellers to the relevant European jurisdictions individually but can instead provide the information directly to Inland Revenue. This results in a reduction of compliance costs for NZ resident platforms with European sellers for the sale of goods or vehicle rental. Option Four – Bespoke reporting regime An alternative solution would be to implement bespoke information reporting requirements in New Zealand’s domestic legislation. Under this option, Inland Revenue would receive information about sellers’ incomes earned through digital platforms. The difference between this option and the OECD model rules is that Inland Revenue could prescribe what categories of information, along with timing and frequency of information that it receives from digital platforms. Just like Option 2 and 3, this option would provide Inland Revenue with income information to support tax compliance and make it easier for sellers to comply with their tax obligations. As Inland Revenue could prescribe the frequency and timing of information, this would allow for easier pre-population to our 1 April – 31 March tax year. There is a risk that this option would not be sustainable long term and there is a risk that digital platforms may choose not to operate in NZ if the requirements placed on them were too onerous. A bespoke regime would not be in line with internationally agreed standards developed by the OECD and by DAC7. A lot of digital platforms are based in Europe and to ensure exchange of information with these platforms NZ would need to implement rules of equivalence with Europe. The other problem with this approach is that it increases compliance costs for digital platforms which would need to implement bespoke system changes to comply with New Zealand’s domestic legislation. This could increase the likelihood of non-compliance, and could result in Inland Revenue not receiving any income information. There are also potential practical issues that could arise in attempts to enforce New Zealand laws on foreign digital platforms. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00 What option is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits? The option that is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits is implementing the OECD’s extended model rules (Option 2). This option will achieve the policy objective of ensuring Inland Revenue has visibility over sellers’ incomes in the gig and sharing economy. Access to this information will help drive tax compliance and could also make it easier for individuals to comply with their tax obligations (moderate reduction in compliance costs through pre-population of income profiles, though its noted sellers will still need to manually include their deductions). This option has clear benefits over Option 4 (bespoke rules). Firstly, by adopting a standardised OECD schema this reduces compliance costs for digital platforms. The OECD model rules are also a more sustainable solution given they have buy-in from many multinational digital platforms and jurisdictions. Although a bespoke regime would save on administration costs for Inland Revenue by being better tailored to the NZ tax year, these administrative savings would be offset by the fact that a bespoke regime would need to be implemented by NZ from scratch – and would not be piggybacking off the schema developed and agreed at the OECD. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00 come at an additional cost. The current monetised costs forecasts are based on building START functionality to enable the exchange of information and general administrative funding to ensure that the information is effectively used to support tax compliance. Likewise, the table above also does not account for the uplift in revenue gain expected by pre-populating tax returns. In terms of the non-monetised costs and benefits, these have been determined through public consultation, discussions with tax advisors who represent some of the affected groups, and work undertaken by the OECD. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00 Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? Inland Revenue will be responsible for the implementation and ongoing administration of the new rules. Inland Revenue will provide information to increase awareness regarding the new rules. This will include producing a relevant Tax Information Bulletin item and updating guidance on Inland Revenue’s website along with relevant press releases to advise platform sellers of changes (particularly in respect of tranche 2 of these proposals on GST). Implementing these proposals would require legislative change. If the OECD’s extended model rules were chosen as the preferred option, then legislative change would be simpler. Similar to how FATCA/CRS was adopted, a legislative change could be made to state that the OECD model rules schema and user guide had force in NZ’s domestic legislation. Greater legislative change would be required for a bespoke regime. From an Inland Revenue systems perspective, there would be a sizeable upfront cost to build functionality within START (Inland Revenue’s computer system) to enable for the sharing and receiving of income information with other jurisdictions. As previously mentioned, further changes would also need to be made to ensure Inland Revenue could best utilise the information (for example, to pre-populate income tax returns) which would come at an additional cost to be sought at a later date. If the OECD rules were implemented, this could require greater change if income information received on a calendar year basis was deemed to apply to the NZ tax year. The preferred option is that the OECD’s extended model rules are implemented with the 2024 calendar year being the first year that information is required to be collected by digital platforms in New Zealand affected by the rules. This means that: • New Zealand digital platforms that enable the rental of short-stay accommodation, and personal services for NZ resident sellers would need to collect information during the 2024 calendar year and report that to Inland Revenue in 2025. • New Zealand digital platforms that enable the rental of short-stay accommodation, personal services, the sale of goods and the rental of transportation for non-resident sellers would need to collect information during the 2024 calendar year and report that to Inland Revenue in 2025. • Inland Revenue would need to exchange the information with other countries, to the extent that the information held related to foreign tax residents in jurisdictions that had also implemented the OECD’s extended model rules. • Inland Revenue would use the information it received to support New Zealand sellers comply with their tax obligations. Pre-population of income tax returns will not be implemented until there is confidence in the quality of data received in the information exchange will facilitate this. The first year of operation for digital platforms in Europe of the DAC7 directive is 2023. If New Zealand implements the OECD’s extended model rules for 2024 Inland Revenue would not receive information from European tax authorities about New Zealand sellers on European digital platforms for that calendar year. This is the cost of implementing the OECD’s extended model rules for the 2024 calendar year; but implementing the rules in the 2023 calendar year will require retrospective legislation and would (when compared with a 2024 implementation timeline) reduce the time available for New Zealand digital platforms to develop their systems to become compliant with the changes. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00 How will the new arrangements be monitored, e valuated, and reviewed? If the OECD rules were implemented, it is noted that the OECD will be able to allocate resources to making any changes to the model reporting rules where necessary. Any changes to the OECD schema and rules can then be reflected into domestic legislation in NZ. Given the likely widespread buy-in from jurisdictions, this ensures a more enduring and sustainable policy reform. Inland Revenue would also allocate resource to compliance initiatives to ensure that the information received was effectively utilised to support sellers in the gig and sharing economy to pay the correct amount of tax. Inland Revenue regularly reviews tax settings on an ongoing basis and provides advice and updates to the Government accordingly. Policy officials maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if agreed by Parliament. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 13:56:00
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] many savings products, such as bank accounts, it is difficult to value the financial services as it is combined with the return on savings. These valuation issues do not arise for manager and investment manager services provided to managed funds, as these services are charged to the fund as a separate fee. 5. An example of these fees charged is a KiwiSaver scheme that invests into several underlying wholesale funds that hold different types of investments (such as US shares or New Zealand fixed interest). Each of these funds has a manager and investment manager. The KiwiSaver scheme will buy services from a KiwiSaver manager, and for each wholesale fund they invest into they will be charged for services supplied by managers and investment managers. There are over 1,000 funds offered to retail investors. 1 6. KiwiSaver funds and other types of managed funds purchase three main types of services from third parties: a. Manager services. A fund manager has overall responsibility for managing the fund. This includes offering and issuing units in the fund to investors, managing the fund’s investments, reporting to investors, and procuring services from an investment manager and various administration service providers. b. Investment manager services. An investment manager recommends which assets (shares, bonds, cash) or other funds the fund invests into. When reporting to investors, manager services and investment manager services are both reported as “management fees” which are set as a small percentage (typically between 0.2% and 2%) of the funds under management. c. Various administrative services such as legal, accounting, ICT (information and communications technology) or reporting services. 1 331 KiwiSaver funds (operated by 39 KiwiSaver schemes) and 758 non-KiwiSaver managed funds. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 7. The current GST treatment of different types of services supplied to managed funds is complex and inconsistent, leading to a range of differing GST practices and an uneven playing field across the industry. The industry applies the following GST practices: • GST exempt. There is a GST exemption which applies when management services are provided directly to a retirement scheme (such as a manager providing services directly to a KiwiSaver scheme). However, this exemption does not apply to most structures, where a retirement scheme invests into a variety of underlying wholesale funds (NZ fixed interest, international shares etc.) as the managers and investment managers will be providing their services to the wholesale fund rather than to the retirement scheme. 8. For fund manager and investment manager services provided to other types of managed fund (including wholesale funds which other funds invest into) there are two different GST practices: • 90% exempt. The largest fund managers and investment managers typically treat 10% of their services as being subject to 15% GST and the remaining 90% as exempt from GST (because they consider their services are mostly “arranging” the buying and selling of investment products and so should qualify for the GST exemption for financial services). This may allow them to charge lower fees to the wholesale funds (as they effectively only charge 1.5% GST on their management fees). • GST on all fees. A group of boutique fund managers and investment managers apply 15% GST to all of their services (as in their view their services are providing investment “advice” or other types of services that are subject to 15% GST). This simplifies GST compliance and allows the fund manager or investment manager to claim GST deductions (refunds) on their purchases such as commercial rent, market research, software, ICT and administrative services etc. 9. The practice of applying a 90% exempt ratio was first accepted by Inland Revenue from 2001, as part of an operational agreement which established that it was acceptable to exempt 90% of unit trust manager 2 fees from GST, with the remaining 10% being subject to 15% GST (meaning 10% of their GST inputs could be claimed back). Although this operational agreement did not actually apply to investment manager’s fees, it has been s9(2)(ba)(i) found that some investment managers have also been treating 90% of their fees as exempt. This agreement expired in 2014. 10. In 2017, Inland Revenue formally considered how the GST would apply to two types of managed fund fees under existing law– unit trust manager fees and investment manager fees. The draft conclusion was that the unit trust manager fees should be fully exempt – as they are considered to be arranging financial products, which falls within the financial services exemption, whereas the investment manager fees should be subject to 15% as they are considered to be providing advice on investment opportunities and therefore sits sufficiently outside the financial services exemption. 11. Fees can have a large impact on the financial wellbeing of investors as they directly contribute to the level of accumulated savings, including retirement savings for retirement schemes such as KiwiSaver. Generally, fees as a proportion of funds under management should decrease over time through economies of scale as the amount of funds under management grow and the benefits are passed onto consumers. For this reason, the Government (through the KiwiSaver default provider appointment process) 2 Provides similar services to a fund manager. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] and the Financial Markets Authority have focussed in recent years on ensuring KiwiSaver members receive value for money. What is the policy problem or opportunity? 12. There are two main issues with how GST applies to services supplied to managed funds. 13. The first issue is the inconsistency in the GST treatment on manager and investment manager fees. Because different types of fund manager and investment manager services can have complex and differing GST treatments, the current GST rules can distort competition by favouring certain types of managed funds, business structures, or judgements about how the supplier may choose to interpret the GST rules. 14. The inconsistent GST practices may have allowed some fund managers to structure themselves in order to develop a competitive advantage over others, though there is limited evidence of this. 15. Additionally, some stakeholders have experienced the issue of funds ‘shopping around’ potential fund managers and enquiring about the particular GST treatment they would be subject to. If the particular fund manager cannot match the most favourable treatment, they may not be chosen as the service supplier. 16. The second issue is the uncertainty has resulted in additional compliance costs to fund managers. For example, professional advice may need to be sought to determine the GST treatment of different types of management services or to correct any tax positions previously taken. 17. There is no data available on the level of additional cost borne by fund managers because of the uncertainty, inefficiencies, and competitive distortion. However, several fund managers have indicated the status quo is having a material impact on their ability to compete in the marketplace. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? Consistency of industry practices and fair competition 18. The main objective is to resolve the issues outlined above, by providing certainty and consistency to the managed funds industry. 19. The current GST rules may distort commercial competition by favouring certain types of managed funds, business structures, or judgements for how the supplier may choose to interpret the GST rules. This approach can impose its own costs as fund managers invest in themselves to pursue favoured tax advantages. This suggests it may be important for all fund managers and investment managers to apply the same GST treatment. 20. However, requiring fund managers and investment managers to implement a new GST treatment could have a large impact on the fees charged to funds and retail investors (such as KiwiSaver members) as well as impose transition and compliance costs and, so this Regulatory Impact Statement also considers an option of legislating to allow the current inconsistent GST practices to continue (see option 1 below). Minimising any significant biases that GST may create 21. It is important that any policy solution does not provide a significant bias towards certain types of savings products, managed funds, business structures or larger funds over others. This includes creating a potential bias for in-sourcing costs, given that Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] outsourcing may be more commercially efficient or more consistent with financial market regulations. 22. In particular, the policy solution needs to consider the existing exemption for the management of a retirement scheme, as there could be a bias for managed funds to invest into specialist retirement funds, rather than more general funds. This bias can be removed by applying the same GST treatment to retirement schemes as other types of managed funds, particularly as most retirement schemes invest into general wholesale funds. Minimise compliance costs 23. Transitional and compliance costs should be minimised. This includes providing impacted taxpayers a reasonable time period to amend their IT systems, commercial contracts, and investor disclosure documents. 24. Where possible, the new rules should align with existing industry definitions (such as those used by the Financial Markets Authority) and commercial practices. The rules should be easily understood and simple to apply to various commercial arrangements. Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? 25. The following criteria was used to assess the options: • Certainty. The GST treatment of a particular service is clear and it becomes easier to correctly apply GST. • Consistency of GST practices across the industry. The option does not provide a tax-advantage for some service providers compared to similar service providers. • Impact on managed fund fees. The impact of a particular GST treatment when applied to the manager’s fees charged to a managed fund, that consequently imposes an unrecoverable GST cost on a managed fund. Effectively, the managed funds are likely to pass through these GST costs to retail investors, such as KiwiSaver members by charging higher fees. To the extent that fees increase, this will reduce after-fee returns and therefore the total amounts that are reinvested and saved over time. • Compliance costs and transition costs. Compliance costs should be minimised as much as possible. The option should be easy for the affected parties to understand and apply. • Sustainability of the rules. The option is less likely to require amendments in the future due to on-going uncertainty or to address unintended consequences or future developments. • GST base integrity. The GST system is designed to collect tax revenues on all goods and services supplied to consumers in New Zealand. Some of the options will collect materially more or less GST than other options. What scope will options be considered within? 26. The scope of the options is limited to measures the managed funds industry could implement and administer. Options two, three and four were consulted on in a public consultation paper which also asked for submissions on alternative options which led to option one (legislating to allow the current GST practices to continue) being submitted as the preferred option for one group of stakeholders. What options are being considered? Option One – Legislate to allow the current inconsistent GST practices to continue 27. Under this option, managed funds will be able to choose between one of three GST treatments. These three approaches represent the current practices undertaken by the industry: a. Fully exempt. This option includes retaining a GST exemption for when management services are directly provided to a retirement scheme (such as a manager providing services directly to a KiwiSaver scheme); or b. 90% exempt. Treating 90% of their services as exempt and effectively charging 1.5% GST on their fees (15% GST on 10% of their fees). This practice is applied by most retail managed funds and wholesale funds that other funds such as retirement schemes invest into; or c. Full GST. Charging 15% GST on all their services. This practice is applied by a small number of boutique funds. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 28. One of the main stakeholders, the Financial Services Council 3 , which represents the largest managed funds, has expressed a preference for legislating to effectively allow the current GST practices to be able to continue. 29. It is necessary to legislate to achieve this outcome because most of the current industry practices are not consistent with current GST legislation, which is unclear and largely depends on the type of service being supplied. 30. As this option is intended to align with current industry practice it would have no significant impact on the amount of GST collected, the fees charged to retail investors and the net returns on investments. Consequently, this option will avoid reductions in future balances (including retirement balances) that an increase in GST costs would cause. 31. The main advantage of this option, over the other options, is it will not impact on fees charged to investors of managed funds, including KiwiSaver members. 32. This option does not impose transition costs on the managed funds industry at a time when they are dealing with other significant regulatory changes 4 . However, officials consider that any change costs from the other policy reform options can be mitigated by a gradual transition, so the reforms only become mandatory 36 months after the legislation is enacted – this allows a reasonable time period to renew or renegotiate contracts, update systems and issue new disclosures about fee changes to the funds and retail investors. 33. The main disadvantages of legislating the status quo are that it entrenches the complexity and inconsistency of the current practices and the associated impacts on uneven competition and compliance costs. 34. It would also introduce new integrity risks such as ‘cherry-picking” whereby a manager may choose a taxable GST treatment to maximise GST deductions when they are in a start-up phase and to later switch to an exempt treatment to minimise the GST they charge once they are larger and produce a large amount of fee revenue. 35. This option would also involve two different exemption rules – a full exemption for management of retirement schemes and an optional 90% exemption for managers and investment managers which provide services to other types of funds (including the wholesale funds that most retirement schemes invest into). These differing exemptions could be complex to apply which increases the risks of inconsistency, errors, and disputes. 36. There is also a risk that these exemptions would not be consistent or sustainable over time. For example, some service providers may consider that administrative services, which are generally subject to GST, qualify for the exemption, particularly if these services are bundled with exempt management services. This behaviour would have the effect of broadening the boundary of the GST exemption beyond the policy intent and could require future legislative changes to address. 37. Because this option aligns with the current GST positions in the revenue baselines, it would be fiscally neutral. Option Two – Make the fees subject to 15% GST (100% taxable) 38. Under this option, all manager and investment fees will be subject to 15% GST. 3 Non-profit member organisation with members in the life insurance and managed funds industry (including KiwiSaver and workplace savings schemes). 4 Mandatory climate-related disclosure regime (The Financial Sector (Climate-related Disclosures and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2021), Conduct of Financial Institutions regime and changes to the anti-money laundering rules. Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 39. The boutique funds prefer this option. This is because it provides a level playing field with other funds and reduces some compliance costs. This is the least preferred option for the larger fund managers. The fund managers and investment managers that are currently charging 15% GST on their fees (many which supply services to boutique funds) would not be impacted by this option. 40. This option would be consistent with the policy rationale that the financial services exemption should generally be limited to cases where there are valuation issues. 41. As part of this option, the GST exemption for retirement schemes would be removed and these manager fees would also be subject to 15% GST. This is because if the exemption was retained, it could create a stronger bias for investing through retirement funds rather than other types of managed funds, as well as providing a tax incentive for retirement schemes to be structured so they receive their manager services directly, rather than indirectly through investment in other funds. 42. The main advantage of this option is that it would provide consistency across the managed funds industry, and reduces concerns that GST practices could be distorting competition. 43. Applying 15% GST to all services provided by fund managers and investment managers would simplify GST compliance as they would be able to claim deductions for GST on their external costs (such as commercial rent, ICT services). 44. However, because the services that funds provide to investors would still be exempt from GST, applying GST to the manager’s fees charged to funds would impose an unrecoverable GST cost on managed funds. 45. The main disadvantage of this option is that the additional GST collected will lead to higher fees for retail investors, such as KiwiSaver members. The extent to which GST will lead to higher fees for retail investors is uncertain. Some of the GST cost may be absorbed by the fund manager or investment manager, instead of being passed on as higher fees to managed funds. As well, under this option fund managers and investment managers can claim back more of their GST inputs, whereas previously some of the inputs may have been unclaimed and consequently passed on in higher fees. 46. To the extent that fees increase, this will reduce after-fee returns and therefore the total amounts that are reinvested and the available balances at future dates (e.g., KiwiSaver members would have less available when they withdraw funds to purchase a first home, or at retirement). 47. Feedback from stakeholders was mixed regarding how much they expected fees would increase. The boutique funds advised that the additional GST costs may have little impact on fees charged to retail investors due to increasing pressures to compete on fees and the proposed transition period which would allow time to adjust. In contrast, other stakeholders (such as the Financial Services Council) considered the full impact of the GST cost would be passed through to retail investors. 48. The Financial Markets Authority has advised that overall, fees for KiwiSaver schemes have fallen by 0.15% or 15 basis points over the past two years. Their view is the increased costs of GST will be passed onto members in the form of increased fees. 49. Modelling by the Financial Markets Authority shows that this option will lead to KiwiSaver fund balances being reduced by $103 billion by 2070 (KiwiSaver balances of $2,196.9 billion), while fund balances for non-KiwiSaver managed funds would be lower by $83 billion (fund balances of 1,757.05 billion). 50. Stakeholders have advised that while some fund managers would incur no material transition costs (the boutique fund managers that are currently applying 15% GST to their fees), other fund managers (such as the larger fund managers) may incur significant transition costs. Officials from both the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Employment and the Financial Markets Authority have supported a 36-month transition period. 51. This option would collect additional GST of approximately $225 million per annum from 1 April 2026 onwards, with the GST collected per annum increasing at an assumed growth rate of 10% per annum. It is assumed that most of the additional GST would flow through to retail investors, such as KiwiSaver members, in the form of higher fees. To the extent that fees increase, this will reduce after-fee returns and therefore the total amounts that are reinvested and saved over time, including savings in retirement schemes such as KiwiSaver. Illustrative examples of potential upper-limit impacts on fees and future balances Assume the fund is purchasing management services which are currently treated as being 90% exempt, 10% subject to GST (GST is effectively 1.5% on management services) and that management fees comprise 90% of the fund’s total fees (the other 10% are administration fees). Also assume the retail investor’s balance grows by 5% in 2022 and 10% each year thereafter (before fees) as they continue to regularly contribute funds and reinvest returns. Investor with $37,500 in a fund with a 0.8% annual fee A retail investor with $37,500 invested in a fund that charged a 0.8% fee under the status quo (option 1) would currently pay a $300 annual fee. Under the proposed reform (option 2), and assuming the GST costs were fully passed through to the retail investor, their fee could increase by up to $29, to become $359 for the first year after the reform. After 25 years of regular contributions and reinvesting, the investor would have had a $338,530 balance under the status quo and a $332,040 balance under the proposed reform, a reduction of $6,490. Investor with $100,000 in a fund with a 1% annual fee A retail investor with $100,000 invested in a fund that charges a 1% fee would pay a $1,000 annual fee under the status quo. Under the proposed reform, their annual fee could increase by up to $96, to become $1,194 for the first year after the reform. After 25 years of regular contributions and reinvesting, the investor would have had a $862,308 balance under the status quo and a $841,128 balance under the proposed reform, a reduction of $21,179. Option Three – Make the fees GST exempt (100% exempt) 52. Under this option, all fund manager and investment manager fees would be exempt from GST. This option would be inconsistent with the policy rationale that the financial services exemption should generally be limited to cases where there are valuation issues. 53. The main advantage of this option is that it could improve certainty and consistency as all management and investment management services provided to the funds would be exempt. This option would not impact on fees charged to investors of managed funds, including KiwiSaver members. 54. The main disadvantage of this option is that a GST exemption would reduce costs for funds but would increase costs for fund managers and investment managers as they Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] would no longer be able to claim any GST input tax deductions in respect of their purchases of outsourced costs (such as commercial rent, ICT, legal and accounting services). This option would therefore establish a strong bias towards in-sourcing costs. The impact of this option on a particular fund manager and investment manager depends on their current GST treatment of their manager fees charged to managed funds - fully exempt (not materially impacted), 90% exempt / 10% taxable (comparatively small impact) or 100% taxable (significantly impacted). 55. Submitters expressed mixed views on whether an exemption would lead to lower fees for retail investors. It seems likely that any cost savings from an exemption would be relatively small and may not be passed through to retail investors. 56. Stakeholders have advised that fund managers and investment managers would incur compliance or transition costs. The transition costs would not be borne equally, that is the transition costs imposed on the larger fund managers and investment managers (that are currently applying 90% GST exempt, 10% taxable) would be less than the boutique fund managers and investment managers (that are currently charging 100% taxable). This is because the boutique fund managers and investment managers would need to adjust from 100% taxable to 100% exempt and consequently could no longer claim GST deductions for outsourced costs. 57. Compared to the status quo / option one, this option would result in a total reduction in GST of approximately $22 million per annum from 1 April 2026 onwards, with the amount of GST forgone increasing at an assumed growth rate of 10 % per annum. The estimated revenue depends on the proposed application date and estimated values of the affected managed fund assets and fees at that time. When compared to expected total management fees of approximately $2.1 billion in 2026, it seems unlikely that these reduced GST costs will have a material impact on the overall fees that funds charge retail investors. 58. The main risk with this option is whether the exemption would remain consistent and sustainable over time. This is because an exemption could create boundary issues in determining whether a service was a management service or another type of service (depending on how the relevant services are defined). For example, there could be incentives to bundle or reclassify some other types of services as being management services to further reduce GST costs for managed funds. This has been the experience in European Union countries where case law has found that the “management” of an investment fund has a broad meaning for European Union VAT purposes and can include administrative services and advice. 59. Providing an exemption for management services would lead to policy arguments that other types of services provided to managed funds should also be made exempt from GST in order to further reduce GST costs for managed funds. There does not appear be a good policy rationale for treating management services charged to funds differently to administrative services charged to funds, as both types of service are necessary inputs into the providing a managed fund product to investors. The administrative services are subject to 15% GST. Removing GST on management fees could lead to pressure to reduce GST on administrative services supplied to managed funds as well as similar outsourced services which are used as inputs by online trading platforms or bank savings products. Option Four – No policy change and enforcement of current law (counterfactual) 60. Under this option, the law remains unchanged and Inland Revenue’s draft interpretations of the existing law will be finalised, resulting in manager fees becoming exempt and investment manager fees becoming subject to 15% GST. 61. The GST exemption for retirement schemes would be retained. The differing GST treatment of management services supplied to retirement schemes, compared to Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] similar services supplied to other types of funds (including wholesale funds which retirement schemes invest into), would impose compliance costs, and create a bias for certain business structures. 62. There are no clear advantages to this option. 63. The main disadvantages include the risk that this option could lead to some of the affected fund managers or investment managers restructuring their services or commercial contracts, or potentially disputing Inland Revenue’s interpretations to mitigate the additional GST costs imposed by this option. This could prolong the uncertainty and inconsistency and result in some fund managers or investment managers applying inaccurate tax positions. 64. The current GST rules for fund manager services and investment manager services are unclear, which has imposed uncertainty, unintended consequences, and increased compliance costs on taxpayers. These issues are further described in the problem definition section. 65. Stakeholders have advised that they would incur significant costs to implement Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the existing law. In particular, some investment manager services would incur a significant increase in GST paid (moving from 90% exempt to 100% taxable). 66. Of the two types of fees impacted, the investment manager fees are higher than the fund manager fees, so the counterfactual is estimated to lead to an overall increase in GST collected of approximately $1 35 million per annum from 1 April 2026 onwards, with the GST collected per annum increasing at an assumed growth rate of 10% per annum. The estimated revenue depends on the proposed application date and estimated values of the affected managed fund assets and fees at that time. This estimate assumes that investment manager fees comprise about 60% of the total amount of fund manager and investment manager fees. It is assumed this GST cost will flow through to retail investors in the form of higher fees which would reduce after- fee returns and therefore the total amounts that are reinvested and saved over time. Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 68. The preferred option is consistent with the policy rationale of the financial services exemption, removes the distortion created by the exemption for retirement scheme funds, results in consistency across the managed funds industry and reduces concerns about the GST rules driving commercial behaviour in the industry. 69. The preferred option will likely increase the fees charged to managed fund investors, resulting in reduced returns for savers and consequently reduce the future balances in KiwiSaver and other managed funds. 70. The preferred option will impose transition costs for managed funds that are not already subjecting their manager fees to 15% GST. 71. This preferred option seeks to reduce the compliance and transition costs incurred by establishing a transition period of 36 months between enactment and when the rules will apply, to allow affected taxpayers to amend their IT systems, commercial contracts, and investor disclosure statements, to align with the new rules. 72. This option would collect additional GST of approximately $225 million per annum from 1 April 2026 onwards, with the GST collected per annum increasing at an assumed growth rate of 10% per annum. It is assumed that most of the additional GST would flow through to retail investors, such as KiwiSaver members, in the form of higher fees. Regulatory Impact Statement | 15 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Reduced competitive advantage due to GST treatment. Regulators (Inland Revenue) Reduced need to amend GST positions of affected businesses as the new rules should be easier to apply. Low Medium Others ( e.g., wider govt, consumers, etc.) Crown finances Additional GST tax revenues. $225 million per annum from 1 April 2026 onwards, increasing 10% per annum (based on an assumption the relevant fees will increase 10% each year). Low Total monetised benefits Additional GST revenue collected. $225 million per annum from 1 April 2026 and growing by 10% each subsequent year. Low Non-monetised benefits N/A Low Medium 73. The impacts of the non-monetised costs and benefits have been determined through public consultation and discussions with interested managed funds and tax advisors who work with the managed funds industry. 74. A key assumption is that all, or nearly all, of the additional GST cost will ultimately increase the fees charged by managed funds to retail investors. The extent to which the added GST will lead to higher fees for retail investors (such as KiwiSaver investors) is uncertain. The economic literature 7 for other types of GST increases and decreases has found they are more likely to affect the prices paid by consumers (in this case, retail investors) in more competitive markets and if the GST reform is broader. Increases in GST are more likely to be passed through than reductions. 75. The boutique funds submitted that the additional GST costs would have little impact on fees charged to retail investors due to competitive pressure to reduce fees and the proposed transition period, while the larger funds considered the change would increase the overall fees that managed funds and KiwiSaver schemes charge investors and therefore reduce returns from savings. 76. There is a risk that some funds may restructure to reduce the impact of GST applying to NZ managers and NZ investment managers such as by shifting more assets into offshore domiciled funds which use offshore managers. This could reduce the additional GST revenues collected from the preferred option. 77. The monetised costs and benefits are based on 2021 data published by the Financial Markets Authority about the manager’s basic fee for each KiwiSaver and non- 7 IHS (2011), “The Effect of VAT on Price-Setting Behaviour” in IFS et al., A retrospective evaluation of elements of the EU VAT system, Report prepared for the European Commission, TAXUD/2010/DE/328.

The impacts of increased GST revenues and increased fees charged to investors are sensitive to the assumptions used, particularly assumptions of fee growth as estimates based on 2021 data have been projected to 2026 (the year the proposed reforms would apply from). 79. The fiscal costs are sensitive to the growth assumption as the model projects the 2021 calculations to future years using this assumed growth rate. The growth assumption is based on the dollar value of the basic manager’s fees multiplied by funds under management growing by 20% p.a. during the three years between the quarter ending on 31 December 2018 and the quarter ending on 31 December 2021. 80. A conservative growth rate assumption of 5% for 2022 and 10% for later years is used as: • The period between 2018 and 2021 had historically high investment returns, and the first 4 months of 2022 had negative investment returns. • The data used does not reflect recent reductions in fees from new lower fee default KiwiSaver providers being appointed and having assets transferred to them during December 2021. • Net contributions to KiwiSaver and other retirement schemes may reduce in future years as more of the population of investors reaches retirement age. • There is a potential risk that some funds may restructure offshore to reduce the impact of GST (as described in paragraph 76 above). 81. An assumption has been made that a manager currently incurs acquired taxable inputs of 20% of the value of the management services they provide 8 . When a manager’s fees become 100% taxable, the manager could claim the additional GST input deductio ns on their expenses and offset these deductions against the GST charged on manager fees, resulting in less GST paid to the Crown. Given the limited data available, financial information within the Guardians of the New Zealand Superannuation’s 2021 annual report was used to inform this assumption whereby the cost of their non-employee expenses was 23% and 24% of the value of the Guardians expenses. A 20% value was used for the assumption in order to provide a profit margin to the fund manager or investment manager. 82. The above assumptions do not consider any other second-order effects. 8 Consequently, fund managers and investment managers only claim a proportion of the GST incurred on their costs (as most of the fees charged are GST exempt), with the remaining unclaimed GST being incurred as a business cost. Regulatory Impact Statement | 18 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? 83. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the implementation and ongoing administration of the preferred option. 84. Following Cabinet approval, the preferred option will require amendments to the Goods and Services Act 1985 which could be included in the next available omnibus tax bill expected to be introduced in August 2022. The proposals are intended to apply from 1 April 2026. 85. Inland Revenue will provide information to increase awareness and support taxpayers and the managed funds industry to comply with the proposed rules. This will include producing a relevant Tax Information Bulletin item and updating guidance on Inland Revenue’s website. 86. The preferred option seeks to reduce the compliance and transition costs incurred by establishing a transition period of three years between enactment and when the rules will apply, to allow affected taxpayers to amend their IT systems and commercial contracts to align with the new rules. Essentially, this would be grandparenting existing contracts that were agreed before the new rules were enacted. How will the new arrangements be monitored, e valuated, and reviewed? 87. Inland Revenue regularly reviews tax settings on an ongoing basis and provides advice and updates to the Government accordingly. Policy officials consulted with groups of interested fund manager and managed funds when developing the policy options and will continue to engage with them to monitor the impacts of the policy changes. 88. In addition, Inland Revenue maintains strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if agreed by Parliament. Regulatory Impact Statement | 19 2qddsziq5 2022-06-29 09:03:56
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] regulatory charges that had not otherwise been renewed in three years’ time, to ensure consistency. The rationale for excluding fines, penalties, and interest is because these amounts do not typically correspond to the supply of any goods and services and therefore should not be subject to GST. In the case of general taxes, while they may be used to fund goods and services, it is not proposed that GST apply to these. The default rule would mirror existing deeming provisions for specific statutory and regulatory charges that have been included in the GST Act such as those for rates payable to local authorities, the waste minimisation levy, the levy payable under the Infrastructure Funding and Financing Act, fuel excise, road user charges, etc. It is also proposed that a schedule of non-taxable statutory and regulatory charges is included in the GST Act. Where the GST treatment under the default rule is not considered appropriate from a GST policy perspective, the Minister of Revenue (during a transitional period, through an Order in Council process) or Parliament could amend the schedule which would result in GST not applying to those specific charges contained on the schedule. Most common charges paid under enactments and regulations are currently subject to GST, so this is expected to have no impact on most of the population. For those who are affected, it is expected that there will be only minor and limited impacts. To the extent that it results in GST applying to statutory or regulatory charges where GST is not currently collected: • government agencies and their Ministers will need to ensure they are compliant with the new rules on renewal of statutory and regulatory charges that come into force once the default rule applies. • persons paying the charges should notice a cost increase (to account for GST) if they are not registered for GST; or, if they are registered for GST and the charges are paid as part of their taxable activity, there should be no material change (as a GST credit will be available). Inland Revenue officials consulted on the issue and the proposed solution with the Treasury, the Parliamentary Counsel Office, and GST experts at Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC. To understand the impact of the changes, officials also consulted with the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Justice, and the Department of Internal Affairs. 1 No substantive issues that affect the analysis in this statement were identified during these discussions. Most common charges paid under enactments and regulations are currently subject to GST, so the default rule approach discussed in this statement is expected to have only a limited or minor impact on both those paying statutory and regulatory charges, and those responsible for the administration of them. 1 These government agencies are have administrative responsibility for the largest number of statutory and regulatory charges. Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 14:04:46 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? The GST treatment of many statutory and regulatory charges (being any amount payable under an enactment or a regulation) is clear under existing principles in New Zealand’s GST laws. For a subset of statutory and regulatory charges, however, the GST treatment is not so clear. This has led to specific amendments being made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) which ensure GST applies to statutory and regulatory charges which are collected for specific government objectives or purposes. This generally occurs when officials at Inland Revenue and the Treasury become aware of new statutory and regulatory charges and are involved in the early stages of policy development. The problem with this approach is that: • it requires piecemeal amendments be made to the GST Act every time a new statutory or regulatory charge is being developed (which is generally the position of Inland Revenue and the Treasury when they are engaged in the policy development process on the GST implications) • it can result in uncertainty (that is, if there is no specific provision in the GST Act that shows GST applies, is it not always clear whether the charge is subject to GST under the general GST rules or is not subject to GST at all), and • it can result in statutory and regulatory charges that are not subject to GST, because under the existing law, GST would not apply (even though, from a GST policy perspective it should apply). This leads to an incoherent and inconsistent approach to GST and statutory and regulatory charges. There are over 250 statutory and regulatory charges across New Zealand’s Acts and regulations, and it is important for the integrity of the GST system that the GST treatment of these charges follows a consistent and coherent framework. These problems will continue unless a different approach is taken to address the issue that gives rise to them. What is the policy problem or opportunity? The current rules in the GST Act do not always result in the appropriate GST policy outcome in respect of some statutory and regulatory charges. This has resulted in piecemeal amendments being made to the GST Act to ensure that GST does apply to statutory and regulatory charges that are used for specific government objectives or purposes, or which are used to recover the costs associated with performing the functions of bodies within specific regulatory systems. The problems with this approach could be addressed if the GST Act contained rules which made the GST treatment of all statutory and regulatory charges clear. This would ensure that government agencies with administrative responsibility for statutory and regulatory charges had clarity on the GST treatment of new and existing charges which could help minimise their compliance costs. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 14:04:46 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Stakeholder views Inland Revenue officials consulted with the Treasury and the Parliamentary Counsel Office, and GST experts at Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC on the issue and the potential solutions. The Treasury and the Parliamentary Counsel Office support the preferred option (the introduction of a new default rule). GST experts at Deloitte and KPMG acknowledged the proposal made sense in the context of New Zealand’s GST system which included within the base the activities of government agencies and the Crown. GST experts at PwC disagreed with the preferred solution and considered that deemed supplies in the GST Act should generally be avoided. Officials consider the preferred option an improvement over the status quo, where there is a mixed GST treatment of statutory and regulatory charges which is caused by a lack of certainty about how GST should apply to them. Repealing the current deeming provisions would come at a fiscal cost, would be disruptive in circumstances where GST was being collected, and would be inconsistent with New Zealand’s broad based GST system. To understand the impact of the proposal on existing statutory and regulatory charges, Inland Revenue officials consulted with the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Justice, and the Department of Internal Affairs. No material issues were identified during this consultation. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? The GST treatment of statutory and regulatory charges should be clear for government agencies with administrative responsibility for them (as they will need to know whether GST applies or not) and for those who have to pay them. To address the problems with the current approach and ensure consistency and greater clarity in the future, it is necessary for changes to be made to the GST Act that apply broadly. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 14:04:46 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem The criteria that will be used to assess the options are: • Certainty and transparency: Does the preferred option result in greater certainty and transparency in relation to the GST treatment of statutory and regulatory charges? • Consistency and coherence: Does the preferred option make sense in the context of New Zealand’s GST system? Is the preferred option consistent with the broad- base low-rate tax framework? • Compliance costs: Does the preferred option minimise compliance costs for those with administrative responsibility for statutory and regulatory charges (including both new and existing charges)? • Administration costs: Does the preferred option reduce the administration costs associated with ensuring appropriate GST policy outcomes are achieved for Inland Revenue and the Treasury? What are the scope of options? The scope of feasible options has not been limited by Ministers or stakeholders. Non-regulatory solutions (such as providing guidance and education to government agencies with administrative responsibility for statutory and regulatory charges) have been considered and will continue in the future where appropriate. A regulatory solution is required to directly address the issues identified with the status quo because the GST Act does not always produce outcomes which are considered correct or desirable from a GST policy perspective. What options are being considered? Option One – status quo Inland Revenue and the Treasury will advise government agencies on the GST treatment of newly developed statutory and regulatory charges and will often advise specific amendments to the GST Act are necessary to ensure appropriate GST policy outcomes are achieved. This approach: • still requires regulatory changes (being specific amendments to the GST Act for each new statutory or regulatory charge where, under existing rules in the GST Act, GST would likely not apply) • may result in GST outcomes not being considered where Inland Revenue and the Treasury are not engaged in the policy development process, and • does not address the GST treatment of existing statutory and regulatory charges where no GST is currently being collected. Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 14:04:46 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Option Two – Require Inland Revenue and the Treasury consultation on all new and renewed statutory and regulatory charges A new requirement that government agencies with administrative responsibility for statutory and regulatory charges consult with Inland Revenue and the Treasury on the GST implications of any new statutory or regulatory charges could be introduced. Consultation could then be required on the GST treatment of any new, amended, or renewed statutory and regulatory charges, on a case-by-case basis. This would ensure that Inland Revenue and the Treasury can provide advice on the appropriate GST policy outcomes. This option would likely still require amendments be made to the GST Act. These amendments would be required for specific statutory and regulatory charges that, under existing GST legislation, would not be subject to GST. Option Three – Amend the GST Act to add a default rule The GST Act could be amended to include a default rule that applied to all statutory and regulatory charges (excluding amounts in the nature of fines, penalties, interest, and general taxes). This rule would make it clear that statutory and regulatory charges were deemed to be consideration for the supply of goods and services from the recipient. This would put the GST treatment of these charges beyond doubt. Recognising this default rule may not be appropriate for all future statutory and regulatory charges, therefore this option would include adding a schedule of non-taxable statutory and regulatory charges to the GST Act. This schedule could contain a list of charges to which the default rule would not apply and could be amended through primary legislation if necessary. The default rule would apply to all new (and renewed) statutory and regulatory charges that come into force on or after a date in the future. To ensure consistency, the default rule would also apply to all statutory and regulatory charges after a three-year transition period. This transition period should provide government agencies and Ministers with sufficient time to make the necessary changes to any statutory and regulatory charges which may be affected by the default rule. Inland Revenue and the Treasury would continue to support government agencies to understand the GST implications of their statutory and regulatory charges. The default rule would also make it easier for Inland Revenue and the Treasury to provide this assistance and guidance (as the deficiency with the current law would be addressed). Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 14:04:46 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? The preferred option – enacting a default rule for all statutory and regulatory charges which makes the GST status clear – would require changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These changes could be included in an omnibus taxation bill. To provide government agencies with administrative responsibility for statutory and regulatory charges sufficient time to make any changes that may be required as a result of the default rule, a three-year transitional period is proposed. Any new statutory or regulatory charge that comes into force (including those that are amended through updated regulations) after the date that the default rule applies from would need to be compliant with it. Any existing statutory and regulatory charges that are not otherwise renewed within a three-year period would need to be compliant with the default rule from the beginning of the fourth year after the default rule came into force. To the extent that there are statutory and regulatory charges where the default rule results in an inappropriate GST policy outcome, these could be included on the proposed schedule of non-taxable statutory and regulatory charges included in the GST Act. During the transitional period, the Minister of Revenue could recommend an Order in Council to add specific charges to this schedule. This Order in Council mechanism would help support an expedient carve-out from the effect of the default rule. If the default rule became law, there are various rules in the GST Act that would no longer be required. These rules would be identified as part of the drafting of the Bill and should be repealed following introduction of the default rule. Inland Revenue would communicate the changes to other government agencies if the default rule became law. It would also communicate the changes in its publications (for example, in a Tax Information Bulletin) to improve general awareness. How will the new arrangements be monitored, e valuated, and reviewed? Inland Revenue would continue to monitor the outcomes of the default rule pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (“GTPP”) to confirm that it met the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. We do not expect extensive monitoring to be necessary as the proposed option should result in reduced confusion about the GST status of statutory and regulatory charges. The proposed default rule will help make working through the GST implications of new statutory and regulatory charges easier. Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 14:04:46
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] 5. The second issue arises when a GST-registered person acquires an asset mostly for private use but later makes some business use of the asset. For example, a GST- registered person acquires a dwelling to live in but uses one room of the dwelling as a home office, or they acquire a dwelling to be used as a holiday home, but also hire it out occasionally as guest accommodation. The GST system does not tax most private sales of assets, such as dwellings. This is because they are not part of a registered person’s taxable activity (that is, their business). However, where a GST-registered person makes some business use of a mostly private asset, the use, and disposal, of that asset may be subject to GST. This can lead to a GST liability or adjustment if the asset is sold. The GST liability arises even if the person did not claim an input tax credit when they acquired the asset. The GST liability on a dwelling or land can also be significant as land is a high value, appreciating asset that is often held for long periods before disposal. What is the policy problem or opportunity? 6. There are two key issues with how GST applies to assets that are used in a GST- registered business and also for non-taxable use (private use or to make exempt supplies). 7. First, the current GST apportionment and adjustment rules are complex and have high compliance costs. They require the registered person to monitor whether they use any of their business assets for non-taxable use and to make annual adjustments if there has been a change of use. Due to the compliance costs and complexity of the current rules, Inland Revenue and other stakeholders consider the level of compliance by affected GST-registered businesses with the current rules is likely to be very low. 8. Second, in the mostly private use case, the tax liabilities and compliance costs that can arise will usually be unexpected. We understand that many GST-registered persons are unaware that GST consequences can arise if their dwelling is partly used to make taxable supplies. Consequently, we expect that non-compliance is high and that many people are not accounting for GST on their dwelling on its disposal. 9. The issue with dwellings only arises if the dwelling is owned by a GST-registered person who uses the dwelling for both a taxable and a non-taxable use. Under slightly different fact scenarios, such as when the GST-registered person does not own the dwelling (for example, the GST-registered business is a company or partnership, or the house is owned by a company or trust that is not registered for GST), there is no need to apportion or account for GST on disposal. The current rules may therefore impose higher liabilities and compliance costs on some taxpayers when compared to those imposed on other taxpayers in similar situations. 10. There is limited information about the affected population of GST-registered persons who use assets for both business and private (or exempt) use. Some of the main groups potentially affected are farmers who sell their farmhouse, self-employed persons who sell a home office or vehicle with a mix of private and business use, holiday home accommodation providers and property developers who rent out residential houses prior to selling them. 11. 1,781 farms were sold in the 12 months to March 2022, but we do not know how many farms include a farmhouse (as opposed to just land). 1,006 GST-registered persons are registered with the business industry code “holiday homes and flat accommodation”, and 7,881 GST-registered persons have registered with the code for “residential property development”. The number of houses sold by these GST-registered persons (and whether there was private or exempt use of such houses) is unknown. Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 12. There is no data on self-employed persons who sell a home office or vehicle with a mix of private and business use. Based on discussions and submissions from GST advisors we have assumed that such persons are typically taking GST positions that their house is a non-taxable private asset, and their vehicle is a fully taxable business asset for GST purposes, consistent with the GST rules that operated prior to 2011. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 13. The objective is to mitigate the problems described above. This could be achieved by targeting the application of the apportionment and adjustment rules, so they apply to fewer assets. This would remove compliance costs and reduce the risk of unexpected liabilities. Other options consider how to simplify the rules, so they impose lower compliance costs in those cases where apportionment and adjustment is still required. Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options? 14. The following criteria was used to assess the options:  Fairness. The option does not significantly over-tax or under-tax the non-business use of the relevant asset. It also provides similar GST outcomes for the affected taxpayers compared to other taxpayers who have similar circumstances.  Compliance costs. Compliance costs should be minimised as much as reasonably possible. The option should be easy for the affected parties to understand and apply.  Tax collection and compliance. The option should reduce the fiscal risks associated with incorrect GST practices. The option should be practical for the affected businesses to comply with, so that they are more likely to apply consistent and correct GST practices. What options are being considered? 15. One constraint is that the reform options should not undermine the overall purpose of the GST system, which is a simple, broad-based tax on the private consumption of goods and services by New Zealand consumers. This suggests some rules would still be required for high-value business assets that are clearly used to make taxable supplies while also having a significant amount of non-taxable use. 16. Therefore, the option of repealing (rather than reforming) the apportionment and adjustment rules has not been further analysed. The scope of the options is also limited to measures Inland Revenue could implement and administer. The options were consulted on in a public consultation paper which also asked for submissions on any alternative options. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Option One – Status Quo 17. The current GST apportionment and adjustment rules may create uncertainty, complexity, unintended consequences, and undue compliance costs. These issues are further described in the problem definition section. 18. The status quo can result in unfair outcomes where some taxpayers will face higher and unexpected GST costs compared to other taxpayers in similar situations. It imposes high compliance costs from complex and unclear rules requiring annual adjustments. It is unlikely to be fair in practice as the current rules are often not applied by the affected taxpayers. The small number of compliant taxpayers may be disadvantaged by facing higher compliance costs and liabilities than taxpayers that do not comply. Option two – Improved education and guidance on current law / rules 19. This option involves continuing with the current GST rules but with Inland Revenue providing additional education and guidance to improve the affected taxpayers’ understanding of the rules. 20. This option is unlikely to reduce compliance costs. There is a large population of potentially affected small businesses who will be difficult to reach with guidance or education, especially as they will often not have tax advisors. As the current rules are compulsory and inflexible, there is a limited ability for published guidance to provide alternatives to apportionment or simpler methods for the affected taxpayers to use. 21. Raising awareness of the current issues is likely to create more pressure for policy reforms. Some of the issues with the current rules were identified because of Inland Revenue developing guidance on how these rules apply to particular situations such as business use of dwellings. 22. Submissions noted the importance of providing guidance materials and training if policy reforms were implemented. Option Three – Election method 23. Option three would allow businesses, at the time of purchase, to elect to treat certain assets which are mainly used privately (or to make exempt supplies), such as a house with a home office, or a vehicle, as though they only had private or exempt use. If so, no GST deduction is claimed on purchase and GST will not apply if the asset is later sold. 24. This could ensure GST-registered sole traders are not disadvantaged compared to other types of ownership structures where private assets are usually held by a different person to the entity which is GST-registered. In both cases, the owner of the private asset would have a choice as to whether or not it was considered as part of the businesses’ assets for GST purposes. 25. The option is expected to be effective at reducing compliance costs for the second issue involving appreciating and mostly private assets such as dwellings and land. However, it will not solve the first issue involving mostly business assets. Moreover, for cashflow reasons, GST-registered businesses may still choose to claim GST deductions for depreciating assets such as vehicles, even if they have only a small amount of business use. This option would therefore be less likely to reduce compliance costs from applying apportionment rules to those assets. 26. Submissions agreed that the election option would be an effective way to reduce compliance costs for dwellings and would align the GST rules with current taxpayer practices for dwellings. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Option Four – Principal purpose test 27. Option four would introduce a principal purpose test where an asset’s dominant use at the time of purchase will determine the GST treatment. A similar rule previously applied prior to 2011 and Inland Revenue and other stakeholders consider that a lot of the affected taxpayers are continuing to take GST positions on this basis. 28. A principal purpose test would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by eliminating the need for the apportionment and adjustment rules. However, a principal purpose test would be much less accurate than the current apportionment rules. Some private use of relevant business assets could be undertaxed, and some business use of private assets could be overtaxed. 29. For this reason, Inland Revenue consulted on a proposal that the principal purpose test would only apply to assets purchased for $5,000 or less (GST exclusive). 30. Submissions supported this option but argued that a higher threshold should be used such as $10,000 or $50,000, or alternatively that the apportionment rules be replaced with a principal purpose test for all assets (as was the case prior to 2011). The pre-2011 rules required complex adjustments for private use of the asset which would greatly reduce the compliance cost benefits of this proposed option. However, applying a principal purpose test to high value assets (such as land) in the absence of any adjustment rules would undermine fairness and tax collection. 31. In response to submissions, Inland Revenue recommends applying a principal purpose test to assets purchased for $10,000 or less (GST exclusive). While a higher threshold could reduce compliance costs for more assets, it would reduce fairness and tax collection. In particular, a higher threshold could create an unintended incentive for businesses to prefer to buy vehicles valued below the threshold as, unlike higher cost vehicles or vehicles provided to employees, GST would not be imposed on the private use of lower-value vehicles principally used for work, if the proposed simple principal purpose test could be applied to them. Option Five – Rounding based rules 32. This option involves simplifying the GST apportionment rules with two components:  a rounding rule where assets with high (80% or more) or low (20% or less) business use will be deemed to have sole business or private use (rounding- based rules).  a percentage-based threshold (such as 20%), that would allow a modest change in the business or private use without requiring a GST adjustment to be made. 33. These proposals are expected to remove most partly business and partly private assets from the apportionment rules and reduce the need to make annual adjustments, which will reduce compliance costs. Some assets (with less than 80% business or private use) would continue to incur compliance costs, but these costs would be lower than the current rules as adjustments would only be required if there was a significant (more than 20 percent) change in use, which would usually be a planned, deliberate change. 34. Some submissions considered this option would be an effective way to reduce GST compliance costs for assets such as certain work vehicles which would generally have 80-99% business use. Such assets would be treated as having 100% business use, removing the need to apportion the vehicle cost or make annual adjustments. Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 35. However, other submissions considered that this option would not result in a significant reduction in compliance costs as they thought it may only reduce the need to make annual adjustments. They considered other compliance costs would remain such as the need to formulate a method for apportioning business and non-business use of the asset (such as value of the supplies, time or space allocated) and then monitor this to check the relevant threshold is not exceeded. In addition, the business use of a mainly private asset such as a dwelling may exceed 20 percent, so this option would not be effective at removing GST compliance costs or unexpected liabilities on such assets. It would also create cliff face issues where large costly adjustments would become required if the business use of the asset changed so as to exceed the relevant allowable threshold (e.g. if land went from 80% business use, to less than 80%, GST would need to be paid on 20% of the purchase price of the land). Option Six – Integrity measures 36. The issues paper consulted on a package of integrity measures that will improve Inland Revenue’s ability to collect GST owing on the sale of assets by a GST-registered business that claimed business use of the asset when they originally acquired the asset. 37. This could include a new requirement for certain GST-registered businesses to provide basic information to Inland Revenue about high-value land, pleasure craft (yachts or launches) or aircraft that they have purchased and intend to use in their business activity. 38. This information would help Inland Revenue identify and improve tax compliance in situations where a large GST refund (or cost saving from acquiring zero-rated land) was originally claimed on acquisition of the asset, but there has been a failure to continue to use the asset in a business activity or properly account for GST if the asset is later sold (e.g., because the business never commences trading or has closed down). 39. A new deeming rule is also proposed to clarify that in these situations (business use claimed on acquisition), GST is properly accounted for if the asset is sold, even though the person’s business activity may have since ceased. 40. Other proposed measures ensure that a wash-up calculation that applies when there has been a permanent change to the percentage of business or private use, cannot be unintentionally exploited to avoid tax. 41. The integrity measures would improve fairness by removing opportunities for non- compliant taxpayers to exploit unintended GST subsidies which are not available to compliant taxpayers or to private consumers. However, it would increase compliance costs by requiring the businesses to provide certain information to Inland Revenue when they purchase land, high-value land, pleasure craft (yachts or launches) or aircraft. Option Seven – Simplifying existing apportionment rules 42. This option involves several minor improvements to the existing apportionment rules that would slightly reduce compliance costs for GST-registered businesses. The improvements were strongly supported by submitters and include:  Reducing the number of years GST-registered businesses need to monitor their actual business use of assets and make annual GST adjustments (this ranges from no subsequent adjustments for low-value assets, to 10 years of adjustments for high-value assets and land);  Expanding the ability to use a wash-up rule which provides a final adjustment (rather than ongoing adjustments) when there has been permanent change of use. The proposal will allow this rule to be used for any permanent change in Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] use (rather than just a change to fully business, or fully non-taxable use) and to be applied 12 months earlier; and  Allowing Inland Revenue to approve a wider range of apportionment methods that are more practical for taxpayers to apply and consequentially repealing some complex formula in the legislation which apply to specific and uncommon scenarios. 43. Compared to the status quo, these improvements would reduce the number of annual adjustments and allow a wider range of methods. However, compared to options 3, 4 or 5 above which would remove certain assets from needing to be apportioned when purchased, this option would be less effective at reducing compliance costs for these assets. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Total monetised benefits n/a Estimated $4m per annum reduction in GST collected each year Low Non-monetised benefits Low Medium 48. The impacts of the non-monetised costs and benefits have been determined through public consultation and discussions with tax advisors who work with the affected group. 49. A key assumption is that for most of the affected businesses the proposed options will align with their current practices. This assumption leads to the non-monetised impacts being low as only a small number of businesses would have to consider or change their current GST practices in response to the reforms being implemented. This assumption also means that the monetised impact of the proposed reform options is considered to be nil for nearly all the affected assets (by value) as the GST outcomes provided by the reform options would align with these businesses’ existing GST practices so would not result in any less GST being collected. This assumption was checked as part of the consultation and is considered reasonable by Inland Revenue and other stakeholders. 50. As Inland Revenue does not have relevant GST data on assets acquired by businesses and their private or exempt use, the estimated reductions in GST collected from the affected group of GST-registered businesses are very uncertain and based entirely on assumptions. This included the key assumption about current GST practices (noted above), and assumptions about the number and value of affected assets which may be complying with the current rules and which would potentially apply different GST positions as a result of the proposed reforms. Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? 51. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the implementation and ongoing administration of the new rules. Inland Revenue will provide information to increase awareness and support taxpayers to comply with the new rules. This will include producing a relevant Tax Information Bulletin item and updating guidance on Inland Revenue’s website. 52. One of the proposed integrity measures would require Inland Revenue to implement a new information disclosure for GST-registered persons who claim a large GST deduction (or cost saving from zero-rating) for business use, at the time they acquire land, aircraft, or high-value boats. Similar information disclosures already apply to persons with interests in foreign companies for income tax purposes. 53. The implementation risks are considered low as the preferred option is expected to make the GST rules easier to apply for the affected businesses and is also anticipated to align with the tax positions already taken by most of the affected businesses in respect of these assets. How will the new arrangements be monitored, evaluated, and reviewed? 54. The proposed reform package potentially includes a new information disclosure by GST- registered persons who are claiming GST deductions in respect of land, aircraft and high- value boats. This information will assist Inland Revenue to monitor some of the affected assets which involve the highest level of tax compliance and collection risk. Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 55. Inland Revenue regularly reviews tax settings on an ongoing basis and provides advice and updates to the Government accordingly. Policy officials maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if agreed by Parliament. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] regulatory charges that had not otherwise been renewed in three years’ time, to ensure consistency. The rationale for excluding fines, penalties, and interest is because these amounts do not typically correspond to the supply of any goods and services and therefore should not be subject to GST. In the case of general taxes, while they may be used to fund goods and services, it is not proposed that GST apply to these. The default rule would mirror existing deeming provisions for specific statutory and regulatory charges that have been included in the GST Act such as those for rates payable to local authorities, the waste minimisation levy, the levy payable under the Infrastructure Funding and Financing Act, fuel excise, road user charges, etc. It is also proposed that a schedule of non-taxable statutory and regulatory charges is included in the GST Act. Where the GST treatment under the default rule is not considered appropriate from a GST policy perspective, the Minister of Revenue (during a transitional period, through an Order in Council process) or Parliament could amend the schedule which would result in GST not applying to those specific charges contained on the schedule. Most common charges paid under enactments and regulations are currently subject to GST, so this is expected to have no impact on most of the population. For those who are affected, it is expected that there will be only minor and limited impacts. To the extent that it results in GST applying to statutory or regulatory charges where GST is not currently collected: • government agencies and their Ministers will need to ensure they are compliant with the new rules on renewal of statutory and regulatory charges that come into force once the default rule applies. • persons paying the charges should notice a cost increase (to account for GST) if they are not registered for GST; or, if they are registered for GST and the charges are paid as part of their taxable activity, there should be no material change (as a GST credit will be available). Inland Revenue officials consulted on the issue and the proposed solution with the Treasury, the Parliamentary Counsel Office, and GST experts at Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC. To understand the impact of the changes, officials also consulted with the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Justice, and the Department of Internal Affairs. 1 No substantive issues that affect the analysis in this statement were identified during these discussions. Most common charges paid under enactments and regulations are currently subject to GST, so the default rule approach discussed in this statement is expected to have only a limited or minor impact on both those paying statutory and regulatory charges, and those responsible for the administration of them. 1 These government agencies are have administrative responsibility for the largest number of statutory and regulatory charges. Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 14:04:46 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? The GST treatment of many statutory and regulatory charges (being any amount payable under an enactment or a regulation) is clear under existing principles in New Zealand’s GST laws. For a subset of statutory and regulatory charges, however, the GST treatment is not so clear. This has led to specific amendments being made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act) which ensure GST applies to statutory and regulatory charges which are collected for specific government objectives or purposes. This generally occurs when officials at Inland Revenue and the Treasury become aware of new statutory and regulatory charges and are involved in the early stages of policy development. The problem with this approach is that: • it requires piecemeal amendments be made to the GST Act every time a new statutory or regulatory charge is being developed (which is generally the position of Inland Revenue and the Treasury when they are engaged in the policy development process on the GST implications) • it can result in uncertainty (that is, if there is no specific provision in the GST Act that shows GST applies, is it not always clear whether the charge is subject to GST under the general GST rules or is not subject to GST at all), and • it can result in statutory and regulatory charges that are not subject to GST, because under the existing law, GST would not apply (even though, from a GST policy perspective it should apply). This leads to an incoherent and inconsistent approach to GST and statutory and regulatory charges. There are over 250 statutory and regulatory charges across New Zealand’s Acts and regulations, and it is important for the integrity of the GST system that the GST treatment of these charges follows a consistent and coherent framework. These problems will continue unless a different approach is taken to address the issue that gives rise to them. What is the policy problem or opportunity? The current rules in the GST Act do not always result in the appropriate GST policy outcome in respect of some statutory and regulatory charges. This has resulted in piecemeal amendments being made to the GST Act to ensure that GST does apply to statutory and regulatory charges that are used for specific government objectives or purposes, or which are used to recover the costs associated with performing the functions of bodies within specific regulatory systems. The problems with this approach could be addressed if the GST Act contained rules which made the GST treatment of all statutory and regulatory charges clear. This would ensure that government agencies with administrative responsibility for statutory and regulatory charges had clarity on the GST treatment of new and existing charges which could help minimise their compliance costs. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 14:04:46 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Stakeholder views Inland Revenue officials consulted with the Treasury and the Parliamentary Counsel Office, and GST experts at Deloitte, KPMG, and PwC on the issue and the potential solutions. The Treasury and the Parliamentary Counsel Office support the preferred option (the introduction of a new default rule). GST experts at Deloitte and KPMG acknowledged the proposal made sense in the context of New Zealand’s GST system which included within the base the activities of government agencies and the Crown. GST experts at PwC disagreed with the preferred solution and considered that deemed supplies in the GST Act should generally be avoided. Officials consider the preferred option an improvement over the status quo, where there is a mixed GST treatment of statutory and regulatory charges which is caused by a lack of certainty about how GST should apply to them. Repealing the current deeming provisions would come at a fiscal cost, would be disruptive in circumstances where GST was being collected, and would be inconsistent with New Zealand’s broad based GST system. To understand the impact of the proposal on existing statutory and regulatory charges, Inland Revenue officials consulted with the Ministry for Primary Industries, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Justice, and the Department of Internal Affairs. No material issues were identified during this consultation. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? The GST treatment of statutory and regulatory charges should be clear for government agencies with administrative responsibility for them (as they will need to know whether GST applies or not) and for those who have to pay them. To address the problems with the current approach and ensure consistency and greater clarity in the future, it is necessary for changes to be made to the GST Act that apply broadly. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 14:04:46 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem The criteria that will be used to assess the options are: • Certainty and transparency: Does the preferred option result in greater certainty and transparency in relation to the GST treatment of statutory and regulatory charges? • Consistency and coherence: Does the preferred option make sense in the context of New Zealand’s GST system? Is the preferred option consistent with the broad- base low-rate tax framework? • Compliance costs: Does the preferred option minimise compliance costs for those with administrative responsibility for statutory and regulatory charges (including both new and existing charges)? • Administration costs: Does the preferred option reduce the administration costs associated with ensuring appropriate GST policy outcomes are achieved for Inland Revenue and the Treasury? What are the scope of options? The scope of feasible options has not been limited by Ministers or stakeholders. Non-regulatory solutions (such as providing guidance and education to government agencies with administrative responsibility for statutory and regulatory charges) have been considered and will continue in the future where appropriate. A regulatory solution is required to directly address the issues identified with the status quo because the GST Act does not always produce outcomes which are considered correct or desirable from a GST policy perspective. What options are being considered? Option One – status quo Inland Revenue and the Treasury will advise government agencies on the GST treatment of newly developed statutory and regulatory charges and will often advise specific amendments to the GST Act are necessary to ensure appropriate GST policy outcomes are achieved. This approach: • still requires regulatory changes (being specific amendments to the GST Act for each new statutory or regulatory charge where, under existing rules in the GST Act, GST would likely not apply) • may result in GST outcomes not being considered where Inland Revenue and the Treasury are not engaged in the policy development process, and • does not address the GST treatment of existing statutory and regulatory charges where no GST is currently being collected. Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 14:04:46 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Option Two – Require Inland Revenue and the Treasury consultation on all new and renewed statutory and regulatory charges A new requirement that government agencies with administrative responsibility for statutory and regulatory charges consult with Inland Revenue and the Treasury on the GST implications of any new statutory or regulatory charges could be introduced. Consultation could then be required on the GST treatment of any new, amended, or renewed statutory and regulatory charges, on a case-by-case basis. This would ensure that Inland Revenue and the Treasury can provide advice on the appropriate GST policy outcomes. This option would likely still require amendments be made to the GST Act. These amendments would be required for specific statutory and regulatory charges that, under existing GST legislation, would not be subject to GST. Option Three – Amend the GST Act to add a default rule The GST Act could be amended to include a default rule that applied to all statutory and regulatory charges (excluding amounts in the nature of fines, penalties, interest, and general taxes). This rule would make it clear that statutory and regulatory charges were deemed to be consideration for the supply of goods and services from the recipient. This would put the GST treatment of these charges beyond doubt. Recognising this default rule may not be appropriate for all future statutory and regulatory charges, therefore this option would include adding a schedule of non-taxable statutory and regulatory charges to the GST Act. This schedule could contain a list of charges to which the default rule would not apply and could be amended through primary legislation if necessary. The default rule would apply to all new (and renewed) statutory and regulatory charges that come into force on or after a date in the future. To ensure consistency, the default rule would also apply to all statutory and regulatory charges after a three-year transition period. This transition period should provide government agencies and Ministers with sufficient time to make the necessary changes to any statutory and regulatory charges which may be affected by the default rule. Inland Revenue and the Treasury would continue to support government agencies to understand the GST implications of their statutory and regulatory charges. The default rule would also make it easier for Inland Revenue and the Treasury to provide this assistance and guidance (as the deficiency with the current law would be addressed). Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 14:04:46 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? The preferred option – enacting a default rule for all statutory and regulatory charges which makes the GST status clear – would require changes to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These changes could be included in an omnibus taxation bill. To provide government agencies with administrative responsibility for statutory and regulatory charges sufficient time to make any changes that may be required as a result of the default rule, a three-year transitional period is proposed. Any new statutory or regulatory charge that comes into force (including those that are amended through updated regulations) after the date that the default rule applies from would need to be compliant with it. Any existing statutory and regulatory charges that are not otherwise renewed within a three-year period would need to be compliant with the default rule from the beginning of the fourth year after the default rule came into force. To the extent that there are statutory and regulatory charges where the default rule results in an inappropriate GST policy outcome, these could be included on the proposed schedule of non-taxable statutory and regulatory charges included in the GST Act. During the transitional period, the Minister of Revenue could recommend an Order in Council to add specific charges to this schedule. This Order in Council mechanism would help support an expedient carve-out from the effect of the default rule. If the default rule became law, there are various rules in the GST Act that would no longer be required. These rules would be identified as part of the drafting of the Bill and should be repealed following introduction of the default rule. Inland Revenue would communicate the changes to other government agencies if the default rule became law. It would also communicate the changes in its publications (for example, in a Tax Information Bulletin) to improve general awareness. How will the new arrangements be monitored, e valuated, and reviewed? Inland Revenue would continue to monitor the outcomes of the default rule pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process (“GTPP”) to confirm that it met the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. We do not expect extensive monitoring to be necessary as the proposed option should result in reduced confusion about the GST status of statutory and regulatory charges. The proposed default rule will help make working through the GST implications of new statutory and regulatory charges easier. Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-16 14:04:46
Regulatory I mpact Statement | 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Regulatory Impact Statement: Cross-border workers tax reform Coversheet Purpose of Document Decision sought: Final Cabinet decision Advising agencies: Inland Revenue Proposing Ministers: Minister of Revenue Date finalised: 25 May 2022 Problem Definition New Zealand’s employment-related tax rules are strict, with the result that they do not recognise the different compliance circumstances which arise in the context of cross-border working arrangements. There is an opportunity to modernise these rules which will minimise compliance costs and provide greater certainty for employers and payers of non-resident contractors. Executive Summary Cross-border work arrangements have been an issue of importance to employers and businesses for many years. New Zealand has a need to import specialist skills from abroad. In addition, traditional labour practices are changing, and improved technology has enabled remote working. The employment-related tax rules (Pay As You Earn (PAYE), Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT), Employers’ Superannuation Contributions Tax (ESCT) and Non-resident Contractor’s Tax) are precise. The se rules do not adequately recognise the different compliance circumstances of employers and payers of cross-border workers. As a result, the employer or payer may be non-compliant despite their best endeavours to comply. They seek greater flexibility and certainty from the tax system. In addition, it is not always clear when a non- resident employer has a PAYE, FBT or ESCT obligation. Where the employer does not have a PAYE obligation, the current rules pass the obligation to the employee. No corresponding rules exist for FBT and ESCT. This needs to be addressed to support the integrity of the employment-related tax rules. Over time, private sector businesses have raised concerns with the rules with Inland Revenue. As a result, a review of the tax rules applying to cross-border workers was included on the Tax Policy Work Programme. An officials’ issues paper Cross-border workers: issues and options for reform was published in October 2021. Public consultation indicates that the structural settings are sound. As such, the proposals do not change the rate of tax payable or the circumstances in which tax is payable. However, there is an opportunity to ensure that the rules better fit the specific circumstances which apply to the employers of cross-border employees and the payers of non-resident contractors. A package of improvements is proposed which: •Improve the flexibility of, and/or clarify, the PAYE, FBT and ESCT and NRCT rules, and 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory I mpact Statement | 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • Support the integrity of the PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules. • Make a number of remedial amendments. These changes are broadly intended to modernise the rules to better reflect the issues that arise in connection with cross-border work and to reduce compliance costs. The proposals will affect employers of cross-border employees, payers of non-resident contractors and the individual workers . Recognised seasonal employees are outside the scope of these reforms. Final design of the proposals has taken stakeholder views into consideration where possible. Three proposals received feedback consistent across a number of submitters: • The private sector sought a longer time period to correct the tax position for the employer or payer and the affected individual(s). We have increased the period from 28 days to 60 days. • The proposal for a PAYE, FBT and ESCT threshold to support the ‘sufficient presence’ test for these obligations was not seen as helpful. Some submitters favoured a safe harbour and we have adopted this approach. • The proposal to introduce an NRCT reporting requirement was viewed by the private sector as imposing a compliance cost and potentially onerous. Nevertheless, officials see this proposal as part of the overall package of NRCT reforms which will simplify the rules for payers and assist Inland Revenue to police the rules. As such, we intend to proceed with this proposal. It is expected that some administrative systems changes are required. The changes proposed will be supported by the publication of updated guidance. Limitations and Constraints on Analysis Currently, the system does not distinguish between New Zealand based employees and cross-border workers – whether employees or non-resident contractors. As a result, direct sources of data are limited. However, discussions with Inland Revenue operations and private sectors businesses have been used to scope the problem and develop solutions and to provide qualitative assessments of the costs and benefits. Responsible Manager(s) (completed by relevant manager) Sam Rowe Policy Lead, International Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue 15 June 2022 Quality Assurance (completed by QA panel) 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 s9(2)(a) Regulatory I mpact Statement | 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Panel Assessment & Comment: The reviewer considers that the information and analysis summarised in the regulatory impact statement meets the quality assurance criteria. Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? 1. New Zealand introduced tax obligations relating to the employment in the latter half of the 20 th century. The Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 impose obligations on persons who make payments subject to Pay As You Earn (PAYE) withholding tax, Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT), Employer’s Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) or non-resident contractors’ tax (NRCT). 2. The introduction of the PAYE system streamlined the collection of taxes from individuals’ salaries or wages and ensured that the amount collected is broadly accurate. The obligation to comply with PAYE requirements falls on the payer of the income. As a result, individual taxpayers who only earn employment income do not normally need to pay a substantial amount of tax on their gross income after the end of the tax year. Further taxes have since been applied to other components of employee remuneration: • Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) applies to specified benefits provided by an employer to an employee, such as private use of a vehicle, contributions to a superannuation scheme or private medical insurance, or a loan. • Employer’s Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) applies where the employer makes cash contributions to a superannuation fund or KiwiSaver scheme for the benefit of its employee(s). 3. The latter two taxes ensure that all elements of employee remuneration are taxed on an equivalent basis. 4. Where the payee is a non-resident contractor, the person who pays the income is required to withhold non-resident contractors’ tax (NRCT), a schedular tax, from the contract payment. The withholding obligation does not arise if the contract payment is below the NRCT threshold or subject to a certificate of exemption. While NRCT is included in the PAYE system, it can apply to contracts in which both payer and contractor are non-resident and only the activity takes place in New Zealand. 5. NRCT serves a different policy purpose to PAYE, FBT and ESCT. NRCT was introduced and expanded to manage “flight risk” – contractors who departed New Zealand having completed their work and collected payment but having not paid the New Zealand tax due. It addresses specific concerns about the integrity of the New Zealand tax base, whereas employment-related PAYE obligations serve a range of purposes. NRCT is intended to be a robust withholding obligation, not minimum or final tax. The non-resident contractor has its own tax filing requirement that gives effect to the final tax position. 6. The overarching objectives of the Government include accelerating New Zealand’s economic recovery and laying the foundations for a better future. As New Zealand is a small economy, to advance these objectives it is likely there will be increased demand from businesses based in New Zealand to obtain workers with specialist skills from 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] abroad. The tax arrangements for internationally mobile workers can be complex and impose compliance costs on businesses and/or the individual worker. 7. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of technology in enabling cross- border and remote work arrangements. The pandemic has accelerated existing trends towards more flexible and more remote work. For example, New Zealanders returning to New Zealand while working remotely for an overseas firm with no connection to New Zealand. 8. Given the changes in where and how people work, and the concerns raised with Inland Revenue about the rules, a review of the rules was added to the Tax Policy Work Programme. 9. If left unaddressed, it is expected that the issues faced by employers, payers and workers will continue, though they may worsen. The current rules are hard to comply with, even where the employer, payer or individual worker is trying to get it right. If flows of workers into New Zealand increase, the cost of compliance will increase. Further, leaving the problems unaddressed may make New Zealand a less desirable place for cross-border workers. In the long run, this may disadvantage New Zealand and hinder the government’s economic objectives. 10. No interactions with other work programmes or regulatory systems have been identified. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory I mpact Statement | 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What is the policy problem or opportunity? Problem 11. New Zealand’s employment-related tax rules are strict, meaning that they are narrow and inflexible when applied to cross-border working arrangements. There is an opportunity to modernise these rules which will minimise compliance costs and provide greater certainty for employers and payers of non-resident contractors. 12. The problems can be broken into three broad categories of issues: • PAYE, FBT and ESCT are inflexible withholding obligations and do not adequately cater for the complexities of cross-border employment arrangements. For example, where the employer or payer expected an employee to benefit from an exemption from New Zealand tax, for example under the terms of a double taxation agreement, a project delay may result in the need to pay New Zealand tax. Similarly, it is not always possible to gather and process compensation data from global sources in time to meet New Zealand’s reporting and payment dates. • PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations have been differently interpreted by employers, tax advisors and Inland Revenue. A recent operational statement Non-resident employers’ obligations to deduct PAYE, FBT and ESCT in cross-border employment situations ( OS 21/04) (the Operational Statement) has clarified that the obligations arise for an employer with a sufficient presence in New Zealand. Under the current rules, if there is no presence in New Zealand, an employee should pay PAYE directly to Inland Revenue. However, no equivalent rule exists for FBT and ESCT. • NRCT withholding obligations are inflexible and require modernisation. In addition to the issues which arise for employers, specific issues exist for payers of non-resident contractors. These relate to exemption from the NRCT withholding obligation. Breaches of the thresholds and/or delays in the exemption process may result in a cost borne by New Zealand businesses. 13. Strictly, breaches of the rules require a voluntary disclosure to report the underpaid tax to Inland Revenue and correct the tax position for each affected employer, payer and/or individual. Voluntary disclosures are time-consuming and costly to prepare and from an administrative perspective are time-consuming to process and resolve. Affected population 14. The key groups affected by the proposal are the employers of cross-border employees and payers of non-resident contractors. These are most likely to be medium and large enterprises. There may also be impacts for individual cross-border workers. 15. While the population affected by the cross-border worker rules is not currently quantifiable, we assume it is small as a proportion of total employees working in New Zealand. Based on stakeholder conversations, businesses and entities which make use of highly-skilled cross-b order workers are typically medium or large enterprises. The data available indicates that the numbers of workers potentially affected by the proposal are in the low tens of thousands. 16. Employers and employees in the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme are out of scope of these reforms. 17. No specific population groups will be disproportionately affected by the changes proposed. Consultation 18. An officials’ issues paper Cross-border workers: issues and options for reform was published in October 2021. Following written submissions, stakeholders were offered 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] the opportunity for follow up discussion and meetings were held to better understand the submissions. Submissions resulted in adjustments to some, but not all, proposals 19. Feedback from the Public consultation indicates that the structural settings are sound. As such, the proposals do not change the rate of tax payable or the circumstances in which tax is payable. However, there is an opportunity ensure that the rules better fit the specific circumstances which apply to the employers of cross-border employees and the payers of non-resident contractors. Feedback from consultation was used to produce a package of improvements is proposed which: • Improve the flexibility of, and/or clarify, the PAYE, FBT and ESCT and NRCT rules, and • Support the integrity of the PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules. • Make a number of remedial amendments. 20. These changes are broadly intended to modernise the rules to better reflect the issues that arise in connection with cross-border work and to reduce compliance costs. 21. By addressing these issues, we can increase the flexibility and clarity of the system for taxpayers. As the changes proposed are largely administrative or timing changes, the fiscal impact is expected to be minimal. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 22. The objectives of the review are to reduce compliance costs and modernise the rules. 23. Measures to simplify tax rules often face a trade-off between the accuracy of the rules in question and reduced compliance costs. This main review has focused on ensuring that tax compliance is supported by reducing the focus on the strict requirements of current tax administration. It is expected that this will reduce compliance costs with limited impacts on the amount of tax collected. 24. An additional focus of the review has been to seek to improve and modernise tax data. This will enable Inland Revenue to better police the tax rules for cross-border workers. This is particularly relevant in the context of non-resident contractors, where the burden of assessing the schedular payment thresholds is on the payer; although the payer may not have, or be easily able to obtain, the relevant information. The provision of improved data to Inland Revenue enables a simplification of the threshold test. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? 1. Given our objectives, our criteria include: • Flexibility: flexibility should be provided where possible. • Compliance: compliance costs should be minimised as far as possible. • Administration: proposals should fit within existing administrative and operational systems. Administration costs should be minimised. • Clarity & Certainty: the proposal should increase the clarity of the law to improve certainty for taxpayers. • Fiscal impact: fiscal costs to the government should be minimised. • Stakeholder support: changes should be broadly supported by stakeholders. 2. There may be trade-offs between increasing flexibility and improving the integrity of the tax base and decreasing compliance and administration costs. To provide flexibility will require operational changes, for example to systems and guidance. For stakeholders there may be changes to their systems and processes. In particular, new reporting requirements may increase compliance costs. What scope will options be considered within? 3. Prior to the release of the officials’ issues paper, a range of issues had been raised with Inland Revenue across a broad range of cross-border working scenarios. Some of these issues were policy-based, others operational. Informal discussions with the stakeholders who raised concerns were held to assist in scoping the officials’ issues paper. Through this process it became clear that most issues, and the most important issues to stakeholders, related to inbound cross-border workers (i.e. those working in New Zealand). 4. We considered whether further guidance would resolve the issues raised, but based on discussions with stakeholders, it became apparent that while guidance would be welcome, it would not be sufficient to resolve the concern around the inflexibility of the current rules and the relatively high compliance costs incurred. In addition, the Operational Statement highlighted an integrity issue which could only be addressed by legislation. 5. Work undertaken in developing the issues paper indicated that the fundamental policy settings are sound. No clear case for more radical reform was established. Adjustments to the existing rules to recognise the particular compliance circumstances of employers, payers and individual cross-border workers within the existing framework will meet the objectives above. 6. A number of operational matters were raised in the informal discussions, mostly around Inland Revenue’s processes. Operational matters were excluded from the officials’ issues paper which focused on policy and legislative matters. Following the legislative changes, operational support will be required to embed the new rules. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What options are being considered? Option One – Status quo 7. Option one is the status quo. The population affected by these rules is assumed to be small when viewed as part of the total number of persons working in New Zealand. 8. However, the status quo means that identified problems would remain unresolved and pressure for change would continue. Employers and payers are eager to see reform in this area. Moreover, the current rules do not recognise the compliance circumstances which arise for cross-border workers. 9. Flexibility: stakeholders find the lack of flexibility in the system challenging, and as the nature of work becomes increasingly mobile and demands for cross-border workers increase, this could become increasingly problematic. 10. Compliance: compliance costs will remain high for employers and payers. If numbers of cross-border workers increase the associated costs will also rise. 11. Administration: there is an administrative burden for Inland Revenue in processing and resolving voluntary disclosures. A lack of reform in this area will continue to be a draw on organisational resource. There is also a lack of information which hinders Inland Revenue’s ability to monitor the system. 12. Clarity & Certainty: leaving known problems unclarified will allow uncertainty to persist in the system, adding to compliance difficulties for taxpayers. This would be contrary to Inland Revenue’s objectives for an easy to get right, hard to get wrong tax system. 13. Fiscal impacts: under this option there would be no fiscal impact, besides the potential for unintentional non-compliance due to the lack of reform. Option Two – Reform package 14. Option two is to make a number of tax technical legislative changes to support the objectives of reducing compliance costs and modernising the rules to better fit employers and payers of cross-border workers, as well as those workers themselves. 15. The officials’ issues paper proposed a package of reforms: • PAYE, FBT and ESCT flexibility. Flexibility will permit a period for catch-up payments of underpaid tax to be made via existing systems. It is intended that where a catch-up payment is made, a voluntary disclosure will not be required. In addition, the package confirms that a variety of options for compliance is appropriate, for example a related New Zealand company may discharge the non-resident employer’s employment- related tax obligations. Submissions indicated stakeholders favoured flexibility. A longer catch-up period was preferred – this has been accommodated in the new rules by extending the period from 28 to 60 days. Further, the category of employees has been extended from those on a shadow payroll to other cases where appropriate, such as those who pay via the IR 56 mechanism. • PAYE integrity: Integrity measures will support and clarify the existing PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations. In particular, while existing rules transfer a PAYE obligation to an employee where the employer does not withhold, this is not the case for FBT and ESCT. A corresponding mechanism will therefore be introduced for FBT and ESCT to support the integrity of the rules. Stakeholders appreciated the intention to bring further clarity to the application of the PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules in cross-border employment arrangements. However, the threshold approach proposed drew limited support. Other mechanisms were favoured, and a safe harbour approach is now proposed. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Concerns were raised about the transfer of FBT and ESCT obligations to employees causing a possible cashflow disadvantage to the affected employee. This could arise where the employer does not fund the payment of the tax or take advantage of other flexibility measures. The affected population is unquantifiable but is likely to be small. As this measure is required to support tax integrity, it is included in the final package. • NRCT flexibility: The NRCT package will simplify the threshold tests for NRCT by requiring the payer to consider their only contract with the non-resident contractor. Related to this measure, reporting of non-resident contractor details to Inland Revenue is required. The package contains a catch-up payment option for breaches of the NRCT rules, a nominated taxpayer approach to establishing a compliance history and discharging tax obligations and provides for broader and retroactive certificates of exemption in specified circumstances. Stakeholders supported the flexibility particularly with regards to certificates of exemption, although many submitters favoured further reforms in that direction. Given that the policy intent of NRCT is to support the integrity of the New Zealand tax base via managing the basis for exemption from withholding tax, we have not enhanced the proposals following consultation. In addition, some NRCT proposals which drew a degree of support from submitters, such as the establishment of a register of exempt non-resident contractors, we do not intend to proceed with at present. It was unclear whether the benefits of establishing such a register were likely to outweigh the costs. Finally, submitters appreciated the proposed simplified approach to the NRCT thresholds, but felt that the reporting requirement proposed was likely to impose compliance costs. One submitter felt the costs would be potentially significant, due to the number of payments made, the different systems in which the payment details are recorded and the proposal to make reporting monthly. It is likely that the costs involved will differ between payers. Other submitters felt that reporting would be reasonable, provided the information required was kept to a minimum and reporting was not required monthly. Reporting allows Inland Revenue to introduce greater simplicity and flexibility in the rules, in exchange for data which enables Inland Revenue to police the rules more effectively. The intention is to base the report on information commonly obtained by the payer as part of contractual due diligence. As such, reporting has been retained in the package of proposed reforms. Compliance costs will be minimised as far as possible in the design of the requirement. The reporting requirement and associated changes will be introduced from 1 April 2024 to enable time to prepare systems and processes. 16. In addition, four remedial changes are included in the package. These changes aim to improve the clarity and coherence of the rules. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] How do the options compare to the status quo/counterfactual? Option One – \[Status Quo Option Two – Reforms package Option Two - comment Flexibility 0 ++ Flexibility is greatly enhanced by the proposals. This is largely achieved through timing changes for tax payments and simpler administrative processes. These reforms better reflect the realities faced by cross-border workers than the status quo. Compliance costs 0 + More flexible processes and greater clarity in the system is expected to mean that overall compliance costs are reduced compared to the status quo. Removing the need for voluntary disclosures in specified cases will reduce costs for employers and payers of cross-border workers and enable easier compliance. The introduction of a reporting requirement for NRCT will increase compliance costs for payers. It is clear that the reporting requirement will impose higher costs on those taxpayers who use a greater number of non-resident contractors and may entail systems changes. Administration 0 + For the most part, Inland Revenue will use existing systems to support the proposals. Inland Revenue’s administration costs may increase due to the new reporting requirements, although costs incurred in administering voluntary disclosures are expected to reduce. Clarity & Certainty 0 ++ The proposals improve the clarity and certainty of employment-related taxes for cross-border workers. Unclear rules creating uncertainty as to when employment-related tax obligations arise are a key issue with the status quo. Resolving this helps stakeholders to understand their responsibilities and contributes to Inland Revenue managing a tax system that makes tax easy to get right. Fiscal impacts 0 0 In line with our objectives, the fiscal impacts are minimal. Most reforms change administrative requirements or propose timing changes for the payment of tax. The 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] PAYE, FBT and ESCT integrity measures may result in a small fiscal increase. Stakeholder support 0 + Generally, stakeholders support the direction of the proposals . Some stakeholders would have liked us to go further or to make reforms in areas which were scoped out of the officials’ issues paper. Following written submissions, stakeholders were offered the opportunity for follow up discussion and meetings were held to better understand the submissions. Submissions resulted in adjustments to some, but not all, proposals.

Option two is better than the status quo. The proposals are broadly in line with the objectives of reducing compliance costs and modernising the rules to achieve a better fit for employers, payers and cross-border workers. When viewed as a package there are clear benefits for both stakeholders and Inland Revenue. Although some proposals Example key for qualitative judgements: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual + better than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual - worse than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] may impose a cost on an employer, payer or cross-border worker, the concerns raised will be taken into account to the extent possible when finalising the design.

Low Low 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 18. Both costs and benefits to this proposal are likely to be ongoing. The changes seek to make the rules clearer and easier to apply and to make it easier to comply. This enables ongoing compliance and administrative benefits. 19. The fiscal impact is expected to be small, as the proposals seek to change how and when tax is paid, rather than the amounts paid. To the extent tax integrity is improved there may be a small fiscal gain and it is possible that the simplification of NRCT thresholds may result in a small fiscal loss. Losses and gains are expected to balance. 20. Current Inland Revenue sources of direct information on cross-border workers are limited. This makes it difficult to quantify the costs and benefits. Instead a qualitative assessment has been made.

The proposals are included in the 2022 omnibus taxation bill. The PAYE integrity measures will apply from 1 April 2023. The PAYE and NRCT flexibility measures are intended to apply from 1 April 2024. The latter date allows time for taxpayers to prepare for systems changes, particularly to support the reporting requirement. 2. Inland Revenue will be responsible for producing guidance to support the changes and for the administration of the rules as part of its normal operational activity. How will the new arrangements be monitored, e valuated, and reviewed? 3. Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed reforms on an ongoing basis, through normal use of data analytics and compliance activity. The new data obtained by reporting requirements will assist with analysing whether the new rules are functioning well or if further reforms are necessary. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] 5. The second issue arises when a GST-registered person acquires an asset mostly for private use but later makes some business use of the asset. For example, a GST- registered person acquires a dwelling to live in but uses one room of the dwelling as a home office, or they acquire a dwelling to be used as a holiday home, but also hire it out occasionally as guest accommodation. The GST system does not tax most private sales of assets, such as dwellings. This is because they are not part of a registered person’s taxable activity (that is, their business). However, where a GST-registered person makes some business use of a mostly private asset, the use, and disposal, of that asset may be subject to GST. This can lead to a GST liability or adjustment if the asset is sold. The GST liability arises even if the person did not claim an input tax credit when they acquired the asset. The GST liability on a dwelling or land can also be significant as land is a high value, appreciating asset that is often held for long periods before disposal. What is the policy problem or opportunity? 6. There are two key issues with how GST applies to assets that are used in a GST- registered business and also for non-taxable use (private use or to make exempt supplies). 7. First, the current GST apportionment and adjustment rules are complex and have high compliance costs. They require the registered person to monitor whether they use any of their business assets for non-taxable use and to make annual adjustments if there has been a change of use. Due to the compliance costs and complexity of the current rules, Inland Revenue and other stakeholders consider the level of compliance by affected GST-registered businesses with the current rules is likely to be very low. 8. Second, in the mostly private use case, the tax liabilities and compliance costs that can arise will usually be unexpected. We understand that many GST-registered persons are unaware that GST consequences can arise if their dwelling is partly used to make taxable supplies. Consequently, we expect that non-compliance is high and that many people are not accounting for GST on their dwelling on its disposal. 9. The issue with dwellings only arises if the dwelling is owned by a GST-registered person who uses the dwelling for both a taxable and a non-taxable use. Under slightly different fact scenarios, such as when the GST-registered person does not own the dwelling (for example, the GST-registered business is a company or partnership, or the house is owned by a company or trust that is not registered for GST), there is no need to apportion or account for GST on disposal. The current rules may therefore impose higher liabilities and compliance costs on some taxpayers when compared to those imposed on other taxpayers in similar situations. 10. There is limited information about the affected population of GST-registered persons who use assets for both business and private (or exempt) use. Some of the main groups potentially affected are farmers who sell their farmhouse, self-employed persons who sell a home office or vehicle with a mix of private and business use, holiday home accommodation providers and property developers who rent out residential houses prior to selling them. 11. 1,781 farms were sold in the 12 months to March 2022, but we do not know how many farms include a farmhouse (as opposed to just land). 1,006 GST-registered persons are registered with the business industry code “holiday homes and flat accommodation”, and 7,881 GST-registered persons have registered with the code for “residential property development”. The number of houses sold by these GST-registered persons (and whether there was private or exempt use of such houses) is unknown. Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 12. There is no data on self-employed persons who sell a home office or vehicle with a mix of private and business use. Based on discussions and submissions from GST advisors we have assumed that such persons are typically taking GST positions that their house is a non-taxable private asset, and their vehicle is a fully taxable business asset for GST purposes, consistent with the GST rules that operated prior to 2011. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 13. The objective is to mitigate the problems described above. This could be achieved by targeting the application of the apportionment and adjustment rules, so they apply to fewer assets. This would remove compliance costs and reduce the risk of unexpected liabilities. Other options consider how to simplify the rules, so they impose lower compliance costs in those cases where apportionment and adjustment is still required. Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options? 14. The following criteria was used to assess the options:  Fairness. The option does not significantly over-tax or under-tax the non-business use of the relevant asset. It also provides similar GST outcomes for the affected taxpayers compared to other taxpayers who have similar circumstances.  Compliance costs. Compliance costs should be minimised as much as reasonably possible. The option should be easy for the affected parties to understand and apply.  Tax collection and compliance. The option should reduce the fiscal risks associated with incorrect GST practices. The option should be practical for the affected businesses to comply with, so that they are more likely to apply consistent and correct GST practices. What options are being considered? 15. One constraint is that the reform options should not undermine the overall purpose of the GST system, which is a simple, broad-based tax on the private consumption of goods and services by New Zealand consumers. This suggests some rules would still be required for high-value business assets that are clearly used to make taxable supplies while also having a significant amount of non-taxable use. 16. Therefore, the option of repealing (rather than reforming) the apportionment and adjustment rules has not been further analysed. The scope of the options is also limited to measures Inland Revenue could implement and administer. The options were consulted on in a public consultation paper which also asked for submissions on any alternative options. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Option One – Status Quo 17. The current GST apportionment and adjustment rules may create uncertainty, complexity, unintended consequences, and undue compliance costs. These issues are further described in the problem definition section. 18. The status quo can result in unfair outcomes where some taxpayers will face higher and unexpected GST costs compared to other taxpayers in similar situations. It imposes high compliance costs from complex and unclear rules requiring annual adjustments. It is unlikely to be fair in practice as the current rules are often not applied by the affected taxpayers. The small number of compliant taxpayers may be disadvantaged by facing higher compliance costs and liabilities than taxpayers that do not comply. Option two – Improved education and guidance on current law / rules 19. This option involves continuing with the current GST rules but with Inland Revenue providing additional education and guidance to improve the affected taxpayers’ understanding of the rules. 20. This option is unlikely to reduce compliance costs. There is a large population of potentially affected small businesses who will be difficult to reach with guidance or education, especially as they will often not have tax advisors. As the current rules are compulsory and inflexible, there is a limited ability for published guidance to provide alternatives to apportionment or simpler methods for the affected taxpayers to use. 21. Raising awareness of the current issues is likely to create more pressure for policy reforms. Some of the issues with the current rules were identified because of Inland Revenue developing guidance on how these rules apply to particular situations such as business use of dwellings. 22. Submissions noted the importance of providing guidance materials and training if policy reforms were implemented. Option Three – Election method 23. Option three would allow businesses, at the time of purchase, to elect to treat certain assets which are mainly used privately (or to make exempt supplies), such as a house with a home office, or a vehicle, as though they only had private or exempt use. If so, no GST deduction is claimed on purchase and GST will not apply if the asset is later sold. 24. This could ensure GST-registered sole traders are not disadvantaged compared to other types of ownership structures where private assets are usually held by a different person to the entity which is GST-registered. In both cases, the owner of the private asset would have a choice as to whether or not it was considered as part of the businesses’ assets for GST purposes. 25. The option is expected to be effective at reducing compliance costs for the second issue involving appreciating and mostly private assets such as dwellings and land. However, it will not solve the first issue involving mostly business assets. Moreover, for cashflow reasons, GST-registered businesses may still choose to claim GST deductions for depreciating assets such as vehicles, even if they have only a small amount of business use. This option would therefore be less likely to reduce compliance costs from applying apportionment rules to those assets. 26. Submissions agreed that the election option would be an effective way to reduce compliance costs for dwellings and would align the GST rules with current taxpayer practices for dwellings. Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Option Four – Principal purpose test 27. Option four would introduce a principal purpose test where an asset’s dominant use at the time of purchase will determine the GST treatment. A similar rule previously applied prior to 2011 and Inland Revenue and other stakeholders consider that a lot of the affected taxpayers are continuing to take GST positions on this basis. 28. A principal purpose test would reduce compliance costs for taxpayers by eliminating the need for the apportionment and adjustment rules. However, a principal purpose test would be much less accurate than the current apportionment rules. Some private use of relevant business assets could be undertaxed, and some business use of private assets could be overtaxed. 29. For this reason, Inland Revenue consulted on a proposal that the principal purpose test would only apply to assets purchased for $5,000 or less (GST exclusive). 30. Submissions supported this option but argued that a higher threshold should be used such as $10,000 or $50,000, or alternatively that the apportionment rules be replaced with a principal purpose test for all assets (as was the case prior to 2011). The pre-2011 rules required complex adjustments for private use of the asset which would greatly reduce the compliance cost benefits of this proposed option. However, applying a principal purpose test to high value assets (such as land) in the absence of any adjustment rules would undermine fairness and tax collection. 31. In response to submissions, Inland Revenue recommends applying a principal purpose test to assets purchased for $10,000 or less (GST exclusive). While a higher threshold could reduce compliance costs for more assets, it would reduce fairness and tax collection. In particular, a higher threshold could create an unintended incentive for businesses to prefer to buy vehicles valued below the threshold as, unlike higher cost vehicles or vehicles provided to employees, GST would not be imposed on the private use of lower-value vehicles principally used for work, if the proposed simple principal purpose test could be applied to them. Option Five – Rounding based rules 32. This option involves simplifying the GST apportionment rules with two components:  a rounding rule where assets with high (80% or more) or low (20% or less) business use will be deemed to have sole business or private use (rounding- based rules).  a percentage-based threshold (such as 20%), that would allow a modest change in the business or private use without requiring a GST adjustment to be made. 33. These proposals are expected to remove most partly business and partly private assets from the apportionment rules and reduce the need to make annual adjustments, which will reduce compliance costs. Some assets (with less than 80% business or private use) would continue to incur compliance costs, but these costs would be lower than the current rules as adjustments would only be required if there was a significant (more than 20 percent) change in use, which would usually be a planned, deliberate change. 34. Some submissions considered this option would be an effective way to reduce GST compliance costs for assets such as certain work vehicles which would generally have 80-99% business use. Such assets would be treated as having 100% business use, removing the need to apportion the vehicle cost or make annual adjustments. Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 35. However, other submissions considered that this option would not result in a significant reduction in compliance costs as they thought it may only reduce the need to make annual adjustments. They considered other compliance costs would remain such as the need to formulate a method for apportioning business and non-business use of the asset (such as value of the supplies, time or space allocated) and then monitor this to check the relevant threshold is not exceeded. In addition, the business use of a mainly private asset such as a dwelling may exceed 20 percent, so this option would not be effective at removing GST compliance costs or unexpected liabilities on such assets. It would also create cliff face issues where large costly adjustments would become required if the business use of the asset changed so as to exceed the relevant allowable threshold (e.g. if land went from 80% business use, to less than 80%, GST would need to be paid on 20% of the purchase price of the land). Option Six – Integrity measures 36. The issues paper consulted on a package of integrity measures that will improve Inland Revenue’s ability to collect GST owing on the sale of assets by a GST-registered business that claimed business use of the asset when they originally acquired the asset. 37. This could include a new requirement for certain GST-registered businesses to provide basic information to Inland Revenue about high-value land, pleasure craft (yachts or launches) or aircraft that they have purchased and intend to use in their business activity. 38. This information would help Inland Revenue identify and improve tax compliance in situations where a large GST refund (or cost saving from acquiring zero-rated land) was originally claimed on acquisition of the asset, but there has been a failure to continue to use the asset in a business activity or properly account for GST if the asset is later sold (e.g., because the business never commences trading or has closed down). 39. A new deeming rule is also proposed to clarify that in these situations (business use claimed on acquisition), GST is properly accounted for if the asset is sold, even though the person’s business activity may have since ceased. 40. Other proposed measures ensure that a wash-up calculation that applies when there has been a permanent change to the percentage of business or private use, cannot be unintentionally exploited to avoid tax. 41. The integrity measures would improve fairness by removing opportunities for non- compliant taxpayers to exploit unintended GST subsidies which are not available to compliant taxpayers or to private consumers. However, it would increase compliance costs by requiring the businesses to provide certain information to Inland Revenue when they purchase land, high-value land, pleasure craft (yachts or launches) or aircraft. Option Seven – Simplifying existing apportionment rules 42. This option involves several minor improvements to the existing apportionment rules that would slightly reduce compliance costs for GST-registered businesses. The improvements were strongly supported by submitters and include:  Reducing the number of years GST-registered businesses need to monitor their actual business use of assets and make annual GST adjustments (this ranges from no subsequent adjustments for low-value assets, to 10 years of adjustments for high-value assets and land);  Expanding the ability to use a wash-up rule which provides a final adjustment (rather than ongoing adjustments) when there has been permanent change of use. The proposal will allow this rule to be used for any permanent change in Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] use (rather than just a change to fully business, or fully non-taxable use) and to be applied 12 months earlier; and  Allowing Inland Revenue to approve a wider range of apportionment methods that are more practical for taxpayers to apply and consequentially repealing some complex formula in the legislation which apply to specific and uncommon scenarios. 43. Compared to the status quo, these improvements would reduce the number of annual adjustments and allow a wider range of methods. However, compared to options 3, 4 or 5 above which would remove certain assets from needing to be apportioned when purchased, this option would be less effective at reducing compliance costs for these assets. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Total monetised benefits n/a Estimated $4m per annum reduction in GST collected each year Low Non-monetised benefits Low Medium 48. The impacts of the non-monetised costs and benefits have been determined through public consultation and discussions with tax advisors who work with the affected group. 49. A key assumption is that for most of the affected businesses the proposed options will align with their current practices. This assumption leads to the non-monetised impacts being low as only a small number of businesses would have to consider or change their current GST practices in response to the reforms being implemented. This assumption also means that the monetised impact of the proposed reform options is considered to be nil for nearly all the affected assets (by value) as the GST outcomes provided by the reform options would align with these businesses’ existing GST practices so would not result in any less GST being collected. This assumption was checked as part of the consultation and is considered reasonable by Inland Revenue and other stakeholders. 50. As Inland Revenue does not have relevant GST data on assets acquired by businesses and their private or exempt use, the estimated reductions in GST collected from the affected group of GST-registered businesses are very uncertain and based entirely on assumptions. This included the key assumption about current GST practices (noted above), and assumptions about the number and value of affected assets which may be complying with the current rules and which would potentially apply different GST positions as a result of the proposed reforms. Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? 51. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the implementation and ongoing administration of the new rules. Inland Revenue will provide information to increase awareness and support taxpayers to comply with the new rules. This will include producing a relevant Tax Information Bulletin item and updating guidance on Inland Revenue’s website. 52. One of the proposed integrity measures would require Inland Revenue to implement a new information disclosure for GST-registered persons who claim a large GST deduction (or cost saving from zero-rating) for business use, at the time they acquire land, aircraft, or high-value boats. Similar information disclosures already apply to persons with interests in foreign companies for income tax purposes. 53. The implementation risks are considered low as the preferred option is expected to make the GST rules easier to apply for the affected businesses and is also anticipated to align with the tax positions already taken by most of the affected businesses in respect of these assets. How will the new arrangements be monitored, evaluated, and reviewed? 54. The proposed reform package potentially includes a new information disclosure by GST- registered persons who are claiming GST deductions in respect of land, aircraft and high- value boats. This information will assist Inland Revenue to monitor some of the affected assets which involve the highest level of tax compliance and collection risk. Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 55. Inland Revenue regularly reviews tax settings on an ongoing basis and provides advice and updates to the Government accordingly. Policy officials maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if agreed by Parliament. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 16:06:24
Regulatory I mpact Statement | 1 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Regulatory Impact Statement: Cross-border workers tax reform Coversheet Purpose of Document Decision sought: Final Cabinet decision Advising agencies: Inland Revenue Proposing Ministers: Minister of Revenue Date finalised: 25 May 2022 Problem Definition New Zealand’s employment-related tax rules are strict, with the result that they do not recognise the different compliance circumstances which arise in the context of cross-border working arrangements. There is an opportunity to modernise these rules which will minimise compliance costs and provide greater certainty for employers and payers of non-resident contractors. Executive Summary Cross-border work arrangements have been an issue of importance to employers and businesses for many years. New Zealand has a need to import specialist skills from abroad. In addition, traditional labour practices are changing, and improved technology has enabled remote working. The employment-related tax rules (Pay As You Earn (PAYE), Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT), Employers’ Superannuation Contributions Tax (ESCT) and Non-resident Contractor’s Tax) are precise. The se rules do not adequately recognise the different compliance circumstances of employers and payers of cross-border workers. As a result, the employer or payer may be non-compliant despite their best endeavours to comply. They seek greater flexibility and certainty from the tax system. In addition, it is not always clear when a non- resident employer has a PAYE, FBT or ESCT obligation. Where the employer does not have a PAYE obligation, the current rules pass the obligation to the employee. No corresponding rules exist for FBT and ESCT. This needs to be addressed to support the integrity of the employment-related tax rules. Over time, private sector businesses have raised concerns with the rules with Inland Revenue. As a result, a review of the tax rules applying to cross-border workers was included on the Tax Policy Work Programme. An officials’ issues paper Cross-border workers: issues and options for reform was published in October 2021. Public consultation indicates that the structural settings are sound. As such, the proposals do not change the rate of tax payable or the circumstances in which tax is payable. However, there is an opportunity to ensure that the rules better fit the specific circumstances which apply to the employers of cross-border employees and the payers of non-resident contractors. A package of improvements is proposed which: •Improve the flexibility of, and/or clarify, the PAYE, FBT and ESCT and NRCT rules, and 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory I mpact Statement | 2 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] • Support the integrity of the PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules. • Make a number of remedial amendments. These changes are broadly intended to modernise the rules to better reflect the issues that arise in connection with cross-border work and to reduce compliance costs. The proposals will affect employers of cross-border employees, payers of non-resident contractors and the individual workers . Recognised seasonal employees are outside the scope of these reforms. Final design of the proposals has taken stakeholder views into consideration where possible. Three proposals received feedback consistent across a number of submitters: • The private sector sought a longer time period to correct the tax position for the employer or payer and the affected individual(s). We have increased the period from 28 days to 60 days. • The proposal for a PAYE, FBT and ESCT threshold to support the ‘sufficient presence’ test for these obligations was not seen as helpful. Some submitters favoured a safe harbour and we have adopted this approach. • The proposal to introduce an NRCT reporting requirement was viewed by the private sector as imposing a compliance cost and potentially onerous. Nevertheless, officials see this proposal as part of the overall package of NRCT reforms which will simplify the rules for payers and assist Inland Revenue to police the rules. As such, we intend to proceed with this proposal. It is expected that some administrative systems changes are required. The changes proposed will be supported by the publication of updated guidance. Limitations and Constraints on Analysis Currently, the system does not distinguish between New Zealand based employees and cross-border workers – whether employees or non-resident contractors. As a result, direct sources of data are limited. However, discussions with Inland Revenue operations and private sectors businesses have been used to scope the problem and develop solutions and to provide qualitative assessments of the costs and benefits. Responsible Manager(s) (completed by relevant manager) Sam Rowe Policy Lead, International Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue 15 June 2022 Quality Assurance (completed by QA panel) 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 s9(2)(a) Regulatory I mpact Statement | 3 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Panel Assessment & Comment: The reviewer considers that the information and analysis summarised in the regulatory impact statement meets the quality assurance criteria. Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? 1. New Zealand introduced tax obligations relating to the employment in the latter half of the 20 th century. The Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 impose obligations on persons who make payments subject to Pay As You Earn (PAYE) withholding tax, Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT), Employer’s Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) or non-resident contractors’ tax (NRCT). 2. The introduction of the PAYE system streamlined the collection of taxes from individuals’ salaries or wages and ensured that the amount collected is broadly accurate. The obligation to comply with PAYE requirements falls on the payer of the income. As a result, individual taxpayers who only earn employment income do not normally need to pay a substantial amount of tax on their gross income after the end of the tax year. Further taxes have since been applied to other components of employee remuneration: • Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) applies to specified benefits provided by an employer to an employee, such as private use of a vehicle, contributions to a superannuation scheme or private medical insurance, or a loan. • Employer’s Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) applies where the employer makes cash contributions to a superannuation fund or KiwiSaver scheme for the benefit of its employee(s). 3. The latter two taxes ensure that all elements of employee remuneration are taxed on an equivalent basis. 4. Where the payee is a non-resident contractor, the person who pays the income is required to withhold non-resident contractors’ tax (NRCT), a schedular tax, from the contract payment. The withholding obligation does not arise if the contract payment is below the NRCT threshold or subject to a certificate of exemption. While NRCT is included in the PAYE system, it can apply to contracts in which both payer and contractor are non-resident and only the activity takes place in New Zealand. 5. NRCT serves a different policy purpose to PAYE, FBT and ESCT. NRCT was introduced and expanded to manage “flight risk” – contractors who departed New Zealand having completed their work and collected payment but having not paid the New Zealand tax due. It addresses specific concerns about the integrity of the New Zealand tax base, whereas employment-related PAYE obligations serve a range of purposes. NRCT is intended to be a robust withholding obligation, not minimum or final tax. The non-resident contractor has its own tax filing requirement that gives effect to the final tax position. 6. The overarching objectives of the Government include accelerating New Zealand’s economic recovery and laying the foundations for a better future. As New Zealand is a small economy, to advance these objectives it is likely there will be increased demand from businesses based in New Zealand to obtain workers with specialist skills from 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] abroad. The tax arrangements for internationally mobile workers can be complex and impose compliance costs on businesses and/or the individual worker. 7. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of technology in enabling cross- border and remote work arrangements. The pandemic has accelerated existing trends towards more flexible and more remote work. For example, New Zealanders returning to New Zealand while working remotely for an overseas firm with no connection to New Zealand. 8. Given the changes in where and how people work, and the concerns raised with Inland Revenue about the rules, a review of the rules was added to the Tax Policy Work Programme. 9. If left unaddressed, it is expected that the issues faced by employers, payers and workers will continue, though they may worsen. The current rules are hard to comply with, even where the employer, payer or individual worker is trying to get it right. If flows of workers into New Zealand increase, the cost of compliance will increase. Further, leaving the problems unaddressed may make New Zealand a less desirable place for cross-border workers. In the long run, this may disadvantage New Zealand and hinder the government’s economic objectives. 10. No interactions with other work programmes or regulatory systems have been identified. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory I mpact Statement | 5 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What is the policy problem or opportunity? Problem 11. New Zealand’s employment-related tax rules are strict, meaning that they are narrow and inflexible when applied to cross-border working arrangements. There is an opportunity to modernise these rules which will minimise compliance costs and provide greater certainty for employers and payers of non-resident contractors. 12. The problems can be broken into three broad categories of issues: • PAYE, FBT and ESCT are inflexible withholding obligations and do not adequately cater for the complexities of cross-border employment arrangements. For example, where the employer or payer expected an employee to benefit from an exemption from New Zealand tax, for example under the terms of a double taxation agreement, a project delay may result in the need to pay New Zealand tax. Similarly, it is not always possible to gather and process compensation data from global sources in time to meet New Zealand’s reporting and payment dates. • PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations have been differently interpreted by employers, tax advisors and Inland Revenue. A recent operational statement Non-resident employers’ obligations to deduct PAYE, FBT and ESCT in cross-border employment situations ( OS 21/04) (the Operational Statement) has clarified that the obligations arise for an employer with a sufficient presence in New Zealand. Under the current rules, if there is no presence in New Zealand, an employee should pay PAYE directly to Inland Revenue. However, no equivalent rule exists for FBT and ESCT. • NRCT withholding obligations are inflexible and require modernisation. In addition to the issues which arise for employers, specific issues exist for payers of non-resident contractors. These relate to exemption from the NRCT withholding obligation. Breaches of the thresholds and/or delays in the exemption process may result in a cost borne by New Zealand businesses. 13. Strictly, breaches of the rules require a voluntary disclosure to report the underpaid tax to Inland Revenue and correct the tax position for each affected employer, payer and/or individual. Voluntary disclosures are time-consuming and costly to prepare and from an administrative perspective are time-consuming to process and resolve. Affected population 14. The key groups affected by the proposal are the employers of cross-border employees and payers of non-resident contractors. These are most likely to be medium and large enterprises. There may also be impacts for individual cross-border workers. 15. While the population affected by the cross-border worker rules is not currently quantifiable, we assume it is small as a proportion of total employees working in New Zealand. Based on stakeholder conversations, businesses and entities which make use of highly-skilled cross-b order workers are typically medium or large enterprises. The data available indicates that the numbers of workers potentially affected by the proposal are in the low tens of thousands. 16. Employers and employees in the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme are out of scope of these reforms. 17. No specific population groups will be disproportionately affected by the changes proposed. Consultation 18. An officials’ issues paper Cross-border workers: issues and options for reform was published in October 2021. Following written submissions, stakeholders were offered 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] the opportunity for follow up discussion and meetings were held to better understand the submissions. Submissions resulted in adjustments to some, but not all, proposals 19. Feedback from the Public consultation indicates that the structural settings are sound. As such, the proposals do not change the rate of tax payable or the circumstances in which tax is payable. However, there is an opportunity ensure that the rules better fit the specific circumstances which apply to the employers of cross-border employees and the payers of non-resident contractors. Feedback from consultation was used to produce a package of improvements is proposed which: • Improve the flexibility of, and/or clarify, the PAYE, FBT and ESCT and NRCT rules, and • Support the integrity of the PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules. • Make a number of remedial amendments. 20. These changes are broadly intended to modernise the rules to better reflect the issues that arise in connection with cross-border work and to reduce compliance costs. 21. By addressing these issues, we can increase the flexibility and clarity of the system for taxpayers. As the changes proposed are largely administrative or timing changes, the fiscal impact is expected to be minimal. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 22. The objectives of the review are to reduce compliance costs and modernise the rules. 23. Measures to simplify tax rules often face a trade-off between the accuracy of the rules in question and reduced compliance costs. This main review has focused on ensuring that tax compliance is supported by reducing the focus on the strict requirements of current tax administration. It is expected that this will reduce compliance costs with limited impacts on the amount of tax collected. 24. An additional focus of the review has been to seek to improve and modernise tax data. This will enable Inland Revenue to better police the tax rules for cross-border workers. This is particularly relevant in the context of non-resident contractors, where the burden of assessing the schedular payment thresholds is on the payer; although the payer may not have, or be easily able to obtain, the relevant information. The provision of improved data to Inland Revenue enables a simplification of the threshold test. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? 1. Given our objectives, our criteria include: • Flexibility: flexibility should be provided where possible. • Compliance: compliance costs should be minimised as far as possible. • Administration: proposals should fit within existing administrative and operational systems. Administration costs should be minimised. • Clarity & Certainty: the proposal should increase the clarity of the law to improve certainty for taxpayers. • Fiscal impact: fiscal costs to the government should be minimised. • Stakeholder support: changes should be broadly supported by stakeholders. 2. There may be trade-offs between increasing flexibility and improving the integrity of the tax base and decreasing compliance and administration costs. To provide flexibility will require operational changes, for example to systems and guidance. For stakeholders there may be changes to their systems and processes. In particular, new reporting requirements may increase compliance costs. What scope will options be considered within? 3. Prior to the release of the officials’ issues paper, a range of issues had been raised with Inland Revenue across a broad range of cross-border working scenarios. Some of these issues were policy-based, others operational. Informal discussions with the stakeholders who raised concerns were held to assist in scoping the officials’ issues paper. Through this process it became clear that most issues, and the most important issues to stakeholders, related to inbound cross-border workers (i.e. those working in New Zealand). 4. We considered whether further guidance would resolve the issues raised, but based on discussions with stakeholders, it became apparent that while guidance would be welcome, it would not be sufficient to resolve the concern around the inflexibility of the current rules and the relatively high compliance costs incurred. In addition, the Operational Statement highlighted an integrity issue which could only be addressed by legislation. 5. Work undertaken in developing the issues paper indicated that the fundamental policy settings are sound. No clear case for more radical reform was established. Adjustments to the existing rules to recognise the particular compliance circumstances of employers, payers and individual cross-border workers within the existing framework will meet the objectives above. 6. A number of operational matters were raised in the informal discussions, mostly around Inland Revenue’s processes. Operational matters were excluded from the officials’ issues paper which focused on policy and legislative matters. Following the legislative changes, operational support will be required to embed the new rules. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 9 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What options are being considered? Option One – Status quo 7. Option one is the status quo. The population affected by these rules is assumed to be small when viewed as part of the total number of persons working in New Zealand. 8. However, the status quo means that identified problems would remain unresolved and pressure for change would continue. Employers and payers are eager to see reform in this area. Moreover, the current rules do not recognise the compliance circumstances which arise for cross-border workers. 9. Flexibility: stakeholders find the lack of flexibility in the system challenging, and as the nature of work becomes increasingly mobile and demands for cross-border workers increase, this could become increasingly problematic. 10. Compliance: compliance costs will remain high for employers and payers. If numbers of cross-border workers increase the associated costs will also rise. 11. Administration: there is an administrative burden for Inland Revenue in processing and resolving voluntary disclosures. A lack of reform in this area will continue to be a draw on organisational resource. There is also a lack of information which hinders Inland Revenue’s ability to monitor the system. 12. Clarity & Certainty: leaving known problems unclarified will allow uncertainty to persist in the system, adding to compliance difficulties for taxpayers. This would be contrary to Inland Revenue’s objectives for an easy to get right, hard to get wrong tax system. 13. Fiscal impacts: under this option there would be no fiscal impact, besides the potential for unintentional non-compliance due to the lack of reform. Option Two – Reform package 14. Option two is to make a number of tax technical legislative changes to support the objectives of reducing compliance costs and modernising the rules to better fit employers and payers of cross-border workers, as well as those workers themselves. 15. The officials’ issues paper proposed a package of reforms: • PAYE, FBT and ESCT flexibility. Flexibility will permit a period for catch-up payments of underpaid tax to be made via existing systems. It is intended that where a catch-up payment is made, a voluntary disclosure will not be required. In addition, the package confirms that a variety of options for compliance is appropriate, for example a related New Zealand company may discharge the non-resident employer’s employment- related tax obligations. Submissions indicated stakeholders favoured flexibility. A longer catch-up period was preferred – this has been accommodated in the new rules by extending the period from 28 to 60 days. Further, the category of employees has been extended from those on a shadow payroll to other cases where appropriate, such as those who pay via the IR 56 mechanism. • PAYE integrity: Integrity measures will support and clarify the existing PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations. In particular, while existing rules transfer a PAYE obligation to an employee where the employer does not withhold, this is not the case for FBT and ESCT. A corresponding mechanism will therefore be introduced for FBT and ESCT to support the integrity of the rules. Stakeholders appreciated the intention to bring further clarity to the application of the PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules in cross-border employment arrangements. However, the threshold approach proposed drew limited support. Other mechanisms were favoured, and a safe harbour approach is now proposed. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Concerns were raised about the transfer of FBT and ESCT obligations to employees causing a possible cashflow disadvantage to the affected employee. This could arise where the employer does not fund the payment of the tax or take advantage of other flexibility measures. The affected population is unquantifiable but is likely to be small. As this measure is required to support tax integrity, it is included in the final package. • NRCT flexibility: The NRCT package will simplify the threshold tests for NRCT by requiring the payer to consider their only contract with the non-resident contractor. Related to this measure, reporting of non-resident contractor details to Inland Revenue is required. The package contains a catch-up payment option for breaches of the NRCT rules, a nominated taxpayer approach to establishing a compliance history and discharging tax obligations and provides for broader and retroactive certificates of exemption in specified circumstances. Stakeholders supported the flexibility particularly with regards to certificates of exemption, although many submitters favoured further reforms in that direction. Given that the policy intent of NRCT is to support the integrity of the New Zealand tax base via managing the basis for exemption from withholding tax, we have not enhanced the proposals following consultation. In addition, some NRCT proposals which drew a degree of support from submitters, such as the establishment of a register of exempt non-resident contractors, we do not intend to proceed with at present. It was unclear whether the benefits of establishing such a register were likely to outweigh the costs. Finally, submitters appreciated the proposed simplified approach to the NRCT thresholds, but felt that the reporting requirement proposed was likely to impose compliance costs. One submitter felt the costs would be potentially significant, due to the number of payments made, the different systems in which the payment details are recorded and the proposal to make reporting monthly. It is likely that the costs involved will differ between payers. Other submitters felt that reporting would be reasonable, provided the information required was kept to a minimum and reporting was not required monthly. Reporting allows Inland Revenue to introduce greater simplicity and flexibility in the rules, in exchange for data which enables Inland Revenue to police the rules more effectively. The intention is to base the report on information commonly obtained by the payer as part of contractual due diligence. As such, reporting has been retained in the package of proposed reforms. Compliance costs will be minimised as far as possible in the design of the requirement. The reporting requirement and associated changes will be introduced from 1 April 2024 to enable time to prepare systems and processes. 16. In addition, four remedial changes are included in the package. These changes aim to improve the clarity and coherence of the rules. 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] How do the options compare to the status quo/counterfactual? Option One – \[Status Quo Option Two – Reforms package Option Two - comment Flexibility 0 ++ Flexibility is greatly enhanced by the proposals. This is largely achieved through timing changes for tax payments and simpler administrative processes. These reforms better reflect the realities faced by cross-border workers than the status quo. Compliance costs 0 + More flexible processes and greater clarity in the system is expected to mean that overall compliance costs are reduced compared to the status quo. Removing the need for voluntary disclosures in specified cases will reduce costs for employers and payers of cross-border workers and enable easier compliance. The introduction of a reporting requirement for NRCT will increase compliance costs for payers. It is clear that the reporting requirement will impose higher costs on those taxpayers who use a greater number of non-resident contractors and may entail systems changes. Administration 0 + For the most part, Inland Revenue will use existing systems to support the proposals. Inland Revenue’s administration costs may increase due to the new reporting requirements, although costs incurred in administering voluntary disclosures are expected to reduce. Clarity & Certainty 0 ++ The proposals improve the clarity and certainty of employment-related taxes for cross-border workers. Unclear rules creating uncertainty as to when employment-related tax obligations arise are a key issue with the status quo. Resolving this helps stakeholders to understand their responsibilities and contributes to Inland Revenue managing a tax system that makes tax easy to get right. Fiscal impacts 0 0 In line with our objectives, the fiscal impacts are minimal. Most reforms change administrative requirements or propose timing changes for the payment of tax. The 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] PAYE, FBT and ESCT integrity measures may result in a small fiscal increase. Stakeholder support 0 + Generally, stakeholders support the direction of the proposals . Some stakeholders would have liked us to go further or to make reforms in areas which were scoped out of the officials’ issues paper. Following written submissions, stakeholders were offered the opportunity for follow up discussion and meetings were held to better understand the submissions. Submissions resulted in adjustments to some, but not all, proposals.

Option two is better than the status quo. The proposals are broadly in line with the objectives of reducing compliance costs and modernising the rules to achieve a better fit for employers, payers and cross-border workers. When viewed as a package there are clear benefits for both stakeholders and Inland Revenue. Although some proposals Example key for qualitative judgements: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual + better than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual - worse than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo/counterfactual 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] may impose a cost on an employer, payer or cross-border worker, the concerns raised will be taken into account to the extent possible when finalising the design.

Low Low 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:43:08 Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 18. Both costs and benefits to this proposal are likely to be ongoing. The changes seek to make the rules clearer and easier to apply and to make it easier to comply. This enables ongoing compliance and administrative benefits. 19. The fiscal impact is expected to be small, as the proposals seek to change how and when tax is paid, rather than the amounts paid. To the extent tax integrity is improved there may be a small fiscal gain and it is possible that the simplification of NRCT thresholds may result in a small fiscal loss. Losses and gains are expected to balance. 20. Current Inland Revenue sources of direct information on cross-border workers are limited. This makes it difficult to quantify the costs and benefits.

The proposals are included in the 2022 omnibus taxation bill. The PAYE integrity measures will apply from 1 April 2023. The PAYE and NRCT flexibility measures are intended to apply from 1 April 2024. The latter date allows time for taxpayers to prepare for systems changes, particularly to support the reporting requirement. 2. Inland Revenue will be responsible for producing guidance to support the changes and for the administration of the rules as part of its normal operational activity. How will the new arrangements be monitored, e valuated, and reviewed? 3. Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed reforms on an ongoing basis, through normal use of data analytics and compliance activity.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? 1. Since the mid-1980s, New Zealand’s tax system has been based around a broad-base framework. This means that taxes are applied neutrally with few exemptions and subsidies. In respect of employee income, anything an employer provides to an employee that is salary or wages, or is a substitute for salary or wages, should be taxed, subject to the practicality of doing so. To ensure this is the case, most non-cash benefits received because of employment are treated as fringe benefits and are subject to FBT on a broadly comparable basis to salary and wages. 2. Specifically, the FBT that an employer calculates and pays is designed to equate with the PAYE tax that is applied to salary and wages. This promotes fairness between employees (whether they are paid in cash or in kind) and helps preserve the integrity of the base that taxes income from employment. It reduces incentives for employers to provide employees with non-cash benefits rather than pay them salary and wages. 3. As with the taxation of salary and wages and taxes in general, FBT coverage is intended to be broad with exemptions from FBT being limited to situations where compliance costs make it impracticable to apply FBT. For example, benefits provided on an employer’s premises are exempt from FBT. The purpose of this general on- premises exemption is for taxpayer compliance costs reasons. 4. The on-premises concession means that when an employer provides free car parking to an employee on the employer’s premises, FBT does not apply in many instances, including car parks leased from a car park provider. 5. In contrast, any contributions an employer makes to their employees’ public transport costs, for example in the form of a voucher or a loaded electronic ticketing card, triggers FBT unless they fall below the standard de minimis 3 . Any cash contributions to an employee’s public transport costs are taxed like salary and wages under the PAYE rules and do not attract FBT. 3 Miscellaneous benefits are exempt from FBT when the taxable value provided to each employee is $300 or less per quarter and the total taxable value of all unclassified benefits provided by the employer to all employees over the past four quarters is $22,500 or less. There is also a longstanding concessional FBT treatment when an employer who is in the business of providing public transport allows an employee to travel on that transport for less than fares charged to the public, but this covers relatively few employees. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What is the policy problem or opportunity? 6. The current FBT exemption for on-premise car parking does not align with the general principle that tax should be applied neutrally to avoid biasing economic decision- making. For example, it may encourage the use of private cars for transport to workplaces with free car parking over the use of environmentally friendlier modes of transport, in particular public transport, and can also encourage the provision of car parking in lieu of a portion of taxable salary and wages. 7. A key principle of tax policy is horizontal equity – ideally a tax should apply equally to people on the same effective income. The car park exemption can be a sizeable benefit to employees ($2,500-$6,000 per annum) where parking charges are material, such as in central Auckland and Wellington. This gives rise to horizontal equity concerns when the untaxed car parking benefit is provided as a substitute for a portion of the employee’s salary and wages. The employee in this case receives a tax saving over other employees who are not able to structure their remuneration package to include this benefit. There may also be, to a lesser extent, some vertical equity considerations, as the car parking exemption is more likely to favour overall high- income earners. 8. In addition, FBT, like other tax rules, should be applied neutrally, including considering its impact on environmental outcomes. Taxes should avoid biasing economic decision- making and should not encourage environmentally damaging behaviour. Current FBT settings may encourage the use of private cars for transport to workplaces with free car parking over the use of public transport, which is likely to have a negative environmental impact. 9. Applying FBT to more on-premises car parking has been considered on several occasions, particularly in 2012. However, the reform proved to be contentious, partly because of valuation and compliance cost concerns, and did not proceed. 10. The Tax Working Group (the Group) 4 identified the environmental neutrality issue around car parking and the practical difficulties associated with applying FBT to a wider range of on-premise car-parking and stated the different FBT treatment of car parks and public transport has the perverse effect of discouraging the use of public transport. The Group recommended in its 2018 final report 5 that the Government consider, for environmental reasons, allowing employers to subsidise their employees’ public transport use without incurring FBT given the practical difficulties associated with applying FBT to a wider range of car parks. 11. Stakeholders are employers, employees, public transport providers, and the wider community, particularly those in urban areas. For example, employers have an interest in that they may currently be discouraged from providing public transport fringe benefits to their employees when compared with car parking. 12. Employees have an interest as the FBT rules encourage their take-up of tax free car parking (where available) in lieu of a portion of taxable salary and wages over travel to and from work by public transport. Public transport providers are affected in that the current bias may reduce public transport use. Therefore, the incentive to develop low- cost solutions for employer-subsidised public transport may be reduced. 13. The wider community is affected in that the current FBT rules may encourage behaviour that increases overall emissions and traffic congestion. 4 The Tax Working Group was established in November 2017 by the Government at the time to consider the future of tax and provide recommendations to Government that would improve the fairness, balance and structure of the tax system over the next 10 years. 5 https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax-final-report.html Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 14. Given the lack of data for on-premise car parking and public transport fringe benefits currently provided by employers, it is difficult to determine the scale of the issue. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 15. The objectives are to: a. Enhance neutrality of the wider tax system, particularly removing or reducing the bias towards the use of private cars. b. Improve equity as taxpayers with similar levels of income should pay similar levels of tax (horizontal equity) and that taxpayers on higher incomes should pay higher levels of income tax in a way that reflects the Government’s objectives of increasing the progressivity of the tax system (vertical equity). c. Improve environmental neutrality of the FBT rules, in particular reduce the current bias towards the environmentally unfriendlier mode of transport by car employers face when considering how to remunerate their employees. d. Minimise compliance costs on employers. Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? 16. The options will be assessed against the objectives previously stated. As stated in the limitations, they only consider changes to FBT, not PAYE or government expenditure options. 17. In addition, consideration is given to the Government’s climate change priority and to its commitment to reduce New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. What options are being considered? Option One – Status Quo 18. Under the status quo, employer-provided on-premise car parking is exempt from FBT, whereas other more environmentally friendly modes of transport, such as employer subsidised public transport, attract FBT. 19. Pros: a. Maintains consistency and neutrality between public transport and other fringe benefits. b. Maintains lower compliance costs for employers providing car parking for their employees compared with option two. 20. Cons: a. Car parks are subsidised when provided by employers which encourages salary substitution. b. Car park subsidy encourages travel to and from work in private cars rather than other modes of transport, in particular public transport. c. Current negative environmental bias is maintained. Option Two – Apply FBT to (more) on-premise car-parking Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 21. Under this option FBT would be applied to all or more (for example in areas where the benefit is greatest) employer-provided car parks on the employers’ premises. 22. Pros: a. Improves wider tax neutrality and horizontal equity. b. Improves environmental neutrality by removing the incentive to use private cars over other modes of transport for travel between home and work, in particular public transport. 23. Cons: a. Increases administrative complexity for Inland Revenue and employers and increases compliance complexity and costs for employers providing car parking to employees. b. Given previous experience, it is unlikely that this option will be able to proceed and be implemented. Option Three – Exempting employer subsidised public transport from FBT 24. Under this option FBT would not apply when employers subsidise employees’ use of public transport for the purposes of travel between home and work, for example by providing a voucher or loaded electronic ticketing card. Public transport would cover buses, trains and trams. 25. Pros: a. Provides a more balanced treatment between the use of private cars and car parking and public transport. It improves horizontal equity. b. Improves, in principle, the environmental neutrality of the FBT rules by removing the incentive to use private cars over public transport. Some employers are likely to shift to providing subsidised public transport benefits. However, tax officials believe that uptake will likely not be significant enough to materially change employees’ behaviour in respect of their between work and home travel. 26. Cons: a. Does not remove overall tax distortion. b. Creates an additional economic distortion relative to other fringe benefits. c. An exemption would in practice be limited to situations where public transport fringe benefits are relevant to employers’ location (urban areas with sufficient public transport infrastructure) and employers’ preparedness to offer such benefits to their employees (administrative complexity and compliance costs for employers of providing vouchers or topping up electronic ticketing cards may limit uptake by employers). d. Could incentivise calls for other FBT exemptions, adding further distortion and undermining the integrity of the tax system. Consultation 27. Officials undertook targeted consultation through meetings, emails, and surveys in 2021 with three public transport providers, one public transport planner and employers through two representative Groups. It suggested that there are very few employers currently providing public transport fringe benefits. They noted the challenges were the differing circumstances of employees which meant it may or may not be a useful benefit and consideration of whether other fringe benefits, such as health insurance, might be of equal or more value to employees. 28. Stakeholders largely supported an FBT exemption for employer subsidised public transport and stated that it would make more employers likely to consider public Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] transport fringe benefits as an option. Those members who have attempted providing public transport benefits in the past had encountered significant compliance costs in setting up and operating processes that enabled them to top up employees’ electronic travel cards or be billed directly by public transport providers. Accordingly, they stated that for an exemption to be successful, public transport providers will need to have some type of simple approach that employers can use. A number of the larger employers consulted have remote work sites and stated a public transport FBT exemption would not be of much help for their employees. 29. Some, mainly large, employers also provided details of car parks they have available and stated that, as a generalisation, other than remote sites, the provision of car parks is often restricted to being available for employees who need to park work vehicles in them or need to have a vehicle available for work related travel. 30. The public transport providers and the planner confirmed that they have been involved with only a few employers who were providing, or looking to provide, public transport benefits. One transport provider had been running a small-scale pilot scheme with a few employers for partially subsidising employees’ transport costs. At the time of consultation, this pilot was not ready or intended to be scaled up. Regulatory Impact Statement | 8 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What option is likely to best address the problem, meet the policy objectives, and deliver the highest net benefits? 31. From a pure tax policy perspective, option two – apply FBT to (more) on-premise car parking would be officials’ preferred option, as it would improve wider tax neutrality and horizontal equity as well as environmental neutrality. However, this option would increase complexity and compliance costs for employers providing on-premise car parking. Earlier attempts pointed to stakeholders raising practical difficulties which could not be readily resolved at the time. It is unlikely that perceptions have changed. 32. Our view is that the status quo would be preferable to exempting employer-subsidised public transport fringe benefits from FBT. While an exemption would improve environmental neutrality in relation to private cars, it creates an additional economic distortion relative to other fringe benefits, including other modes of travel such as employer-provided e-bikes. Officials believe that an exemption would result in limited behavioural change. Its application would be restricted to situations where employers are located near public transport routes that their employees can readily access, including the availability of those services when the employees need them, and employers’ preparedness to offer the benefit to their employees. We also note that with exemptions there is an incentive to salary sacrifice and associated costs that come with that choice. 33. Environmental neutrality is a priority given the Government’s emissions reduction commitments. In that context, widening the FBT exemptions to also include a public transport exemption would potentially achieve an improvement despite creating an additional economic distortion in the FBT rules. The current bias towards the environmentally unfriendlier mode of transport by car employers face when considering how to remunerate their employees is removed. Limiting the exemption to between home and work travel would best achieve removing the existing bias between car- parking on the employer’s premises and public transport. However, this may be practically difficult (for example, when an employee uses a monthly train pass), so an exemption would need to focus on situations where the subsidy is provided primarily for that purpose and accept that some incidental other private travel would likely be subsidised too.

Low Medium Total monetised benefits N/A N/A N/A Non-monetised benefits Low Low 34. An FBT exemption for public transport would generally apply to all employers. However, in practice it would largely be relevant for employers with workplaces in urban areas with sufficient public transport networks. The level of uptake will also depend on the availability of low compliance cost options for employers. Section 3: Delivering an option How will the new arrangements be implemented? 35. Should the Government decide to proceed with an exemption, it will require an amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. The proposed legislative amendments would take effect from 1 April after the proposed bill receives Royal Assent. There is already a public transport provision in the FBT rules but that relates only to valuing the benefit where it has been provided by an employer who is a public transport provider. 36. Inland Revenue would be responsible for the implementation and ongoing administration of the new rules. Inland Revenue will publish guidance material to raise awareness and explain how the exemption works. This would include producing a relevant Tax Information Bulletin item and updating guidance on Inland Revenue’s website. Overall, Inland Revenue expects that only very minor alterations to systems and operations will be needed. Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] How will the new arrangements be monitored, e valuated, and reviewed? 37. Monitoring: Should the Government decide to proceed with an FBT exemption for employer subsidised public transport fringe benefits, the proposal is taxpayer friendly, uptake will be voluntary, and enforcement and extensive monitoring is not necessary. In practice, it will be difficult to evaluate the effect the proposed measure will have on employers’ and employees’ behaviour. A reduction in FBT collected may indicate the level at which public transport benefits are currently provided. 38. Review: Should the Government proceed with an exemption for public transport, there are no plans for a specific review of this change, as it is taxpayer friendly. 39. Inland Revenue regularly reviews tax settings on an ongoing basis and provides advice and updates to the Government accordingly. Policy officials maintain strong communication channels with stakeholders in the tax advisory community, including through the generic tax policy process, and these stakeholders will be able to correspond with officials about the operation of the new rules at any time. If problems emerge, they will be dealt with either operationally, or by way of legislative amendment if agreed by Parliament. Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:28
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] Section 1: Diagnosing the policy problem What is the context behind the policy problem and how is the status quo expected to develop? 1. Since the mid-1980s, New Zealand’s tax system has been based around a broad-base framework. This means that taxes are applied neutrally with few exemptions and subsidies. In respect of employee income, anything an employer provides to an employee that is salary or wages, or is a substitute for salary or wages, should be taxed, subject to the practicality of doing so. To ensure this is the case, most non-cash benefits received because of employment are treated as fringe benefits and are subject to FBT on a broadly comparable basis to salary and wages. 2. Specifically, the FBT that an employer calculates and pays is designed to equate with the PAYE tax that is applied to salary and wages. This promotes fairness between employees (whether they are paid in cash or in kind) and helps preserve the integrity of the base that taxes income from employment. It reduces incentives for employers to provide employees with non-cash benefits rather than pay them salary and wages. 3. As with the taxation of salary and wages and taxes in general, FBT coverage is intended to be broad with exemptions from FBT being limited to situations where compliance costs make it impracticable to apply FBT. For example, benefits provided on an employer’s premises are exempt from FBT. The purpose of this general on- premises exemption is for taxpayer compliance costs reasons. 4. The on-premises concession means that when an employer provides free car parking to an employee on the employer’s premises, FBT does not apply in many instances, including car parks leased from a car park provider. 5. In contrast, any contributions an employer makes to their employees’ public transport costs, for example in the form of a voucher or a loaded electronic ticketing card, triggers FBT unless they fall below the standard de minimis 3 . Any cash contributions to an employee’s public transport costs are taxed like salary and wages under the PAYE rules and do not attract FBT. 3 Miscellaneous benefits are exempt from FBT when the taxable value provided to each employee is $300 or less per quarter and the total taxable value of all unclassified benefits provided by the employer to all employees over the past four quarters is $22,500 or less. There is also a longstanding concessional FBT treatment when an employer who is in the business of providing public transport allows an employee to travel on that transport for less than fares charged to the public, but this covers relatively few employees. Regulatory Impact Statement | 4 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] What is the policy problem or opportunity? 6. The current FBT exemption for on-premise car parking does not align with the general principle that tax should be applied neutrally to avoid biasing economic decision- making. For example, it may encourage the use of private cars for transport to workplaces with free car parking over the use of environmentally friendlier modes of transport, in particular public transport, and can also encourage the provision of car parking in lieu of a portion of taxable salary and wages. 7. A key principle of tax policy is horizontal equity – ideally a tax should apply equally to people on the same effective income. The car park exemption can be a sizeable benefit to employees ($2,500-$6,000 per annum) where parking charges are material, such as in central Auckland and Wellington. This gives rise to horizontal equity concerns when the untaxed car parking benefit is provided as a substitute for a portion of the employee’s salary and wages. The employee in this case receives a tax saving over other employees who are not able to structure their remuneration package to include this benefit. There may also be, to a lesser extent, some vertical equity considerations, as the car parking exemption is more likely to favour overall high- income earners. 8. In addition, FBT, like other tax rules, should be applied neutrally, including considering its impact on environmental outcomes. Taxes should avoid biasing economic decision- making and should not encourage environmentally damaging behaviour. Current FBT settings may encourage the use of private cars for transport to workplaces with free car parking over the use of public transport, which is likely to have a negative environmental impact. 9. Applying FBT to more on-premises car parking has been considered on several occasions, particularly in 2012. However, the reform proved to be contentious, partly because of valuation and compliance cost concerns, and did not proceed. 10. The Tax Working Group (the Group) 4 identified the environmental neutrality issue around car parking and the practical difficulties associated with applying FBT to a wider range of on-premise car-parking and stated the different FBT treatment of car parks and public transport has the perverse effect of discouraging the use of public transport. The Group recommended in its 2018 final report 5 that the Government consider, for environmental reasons, allowing employers to subsidise their employees’ public transport use without incurring FBT given the practical difficulties associated with applying FBT to a wider range of car parks. 11. Stakeholders are employers, employees, public transport providers, and the wider community, particularly those in urban areas. For example, employers have an interest in that they may currently be discouraged from providing public transport fringe benefits to their employees when compared with car parking. 12. Employees have an interest as the FBT rules encourage their take-up of tax free car parking (where available) in lieu of a portion of taxable salary and wages over travel to and from work by public transport. Public transport providers are affected in that the current bias may reduce public transport use. Therefore, the incentive to develop low- cost solutions for employer-subsidised public transport may be reduced. 13. The wider community is affected in that the current FBT rules may encourage behaviour that increases overall emissions and traffic congestion. 4 The Tax Working Group was established in November 2017 by the Government at the time to consider the future of tax and provide recommendations to Government that would improve the fairness, balance and structure of the tax system over the next 10 years. 5 https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax-final-report.html Regulatory Impact Statement | 5 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:28 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 14. Given the lack of data for on-premise car parking and public transport fringe benefits currently provided by employers, it is difficult to determine the scale of the issue. What objectives are sought in relation to the policy problem? 15. The objectives are to: a. Enhance neutrality of the wider tax system, particularly removing or reducing the bias towards the use of private cars. b. Improve equity as taxpayers with similar levels of income should pay similar levels of tax (horizontal equity) and that taxpayers on higher incomes should pay higher levels of income tax in a way that reflects the Government’s objectives of increasing the progressivity of the tax system (vertical equity). c. Improve environmental neutrality of the FBT rules, in particular reduce the current bias towards the environmentally unfriendlier mode of transport by car employers face when considering how to remunerate their employees. d. Minimise compliance costs on employers. Section 2: Deciding upon an option to address the policy problem What criteria will be used to compare options to the status quo? 16. The options will be assessed against the objectives previously stated. As stated in the limitations, they only consider changes to FBT, not PAYE or government expenditure options. 17. In addition, consideration is given to the Government’s climate change priority and to its commitment to reduce New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. What options are being considered? Option One – Status Quo 18. Under the status quo, employer-provided on-premise car parking is exempt from FBT, whereas other more environmentally friendly modes of transport, such as employer subsidised public transport, attract FBT. 19.

Maintains lower compliance costs for employers providing car parking for their employees compared with option two. 20. Cons: a.

\[IN CONFIDENCE\] Officials have been asked to compare two options to provide support to the BTR sector using the tax system. The following options have been compared: 1. Option 1: provide an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation for BTR assets; or 2. Option 2: reintroduce depreciation deductions for BTR assets at a rate of 1.4% 1 diminishing value (DV). If Cabinet decide to go with either of the above options, BTR must be defined as an asset class. Cabinet has already agreed to a partial definition of a BTR asset class (SWC-21-MIN-0228 refers), including the following components: a. 20 or more dwellings in a single building or multiple buildings that comprise a single development; b. the dwellings are owned by a single owner; c. the building/buildings that contain the dwellings may contain other dwellings or commercial premises that do not form part of the build-to-rent asset; d. the dwellings offer tenants benefits in relation to tenure and/or rights that are greater than those provided for under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986; e. the development includes dwellings where tenants are offered lifetime tenancies; f. the dwellings have continuously been used as a build-to-rent since they were constructed. There are two outstanding issues in defining the asset class -minimum tenure length requirement, and application to new or existing assets. Inland Revenue’s preferred option Recommended option – the status quo Inland Revenue recommends the status quo, for the following reasons: • There is nothing inherent in BTR that makes it different from other residential rental property, apart from scale. • While the interest limitation rules will make BTRs less attractive, the rules currently apply equally to all residential property. Inland Revenue previously advised against the introduction of the interest limitation rules, however, further exemptions for specific investment would undermine the purpose of the rules. • The development and new build exemptions already significantly mitigate the negative impact of the interest limitation rules for newly built BTRs (completed after 27 March 2020). As with all new builds, the exemptions would apply while new BTRs are being constructed, and then for 20 years after they are completed. The new build 1 The depreciation rate of 1.4% was chosen based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) economic depreciation rate set for multi-use residential buildings (MURBs). Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] exemption would apply to the initial owner of a BTR development, as well as to any subsequent owners of the BTR during the 20-year period for which the exemption applies. • An in-perpetuity exemption for BTRs (option 1) could be viewed as inequitable, because it would benefit large investors but provide no relief for smaller investors who hold similar properties. • An in-perpetuity exemption would also incentivise BTRs to only ever be used as rental properties. This is contrary to the objective of the interest limitation rule, which is to tilt the playing field away from investors to first home buyers and owner- occupiers. • Reintroducing depreciation deductions only for BTRs (options 2) would reduce fairness and efficiency within the tax system, as well as the overall coherence of the tax system. Additionally, some (but not all) BTRs are multi-unit residential buildings (MURBs). MURBs are long lived assets that in reality depreciate at a slower rate than commercial and industrial buildings. Second preference – an exemption from interest limitation (option 1) If Ministers decide to provide support to the BTR sector through the tax system, Inland Revenue recommends option 1, which would involve introducing an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation for BTR assets. Inland Revenue prefers option 1 as it provides a similar benefit to BTR assets as option 2, but is simpler from both a compliance and administrative perspective. Potential impact of option 1 Of the options, option 1 is likely to provide a slightly lower net present value (NPV) tax benefit for BTR when a particular set of assumptions is applied. The NPV is based on the following assumptions: 1 the investor has a new BTR asset which is initially worth $15m 2 the investor holds the BTR asset for 50 years 3 all future deductions are discounted at a rate of 5% 4 the investor borrows 50% of the cost of the BTR asset 5 the investor pays interest of 6% per annum. The NPV tax benefit of the extra interest deductions (beyond the benefit of the 20 year new build exemption) would be $730,008. The size of the NPV tax benefit of option 1, relative to the initial value of the BTR in this example, is 4.87%. In comparison, the NPV benefit of allowing the investor to claim depreciation deductions at a rate of 1.4% (diminishing value) over the same time period would be $879,161. The size of the NPV tax benefit of option 2, relative to the initial value of the BTR in this example is 5.86%. Regardless of the assumptions applied, the benefit of option 1 is relatively low. The NPV analysis for both options is also sensitive to changes in the debt ratio. For example, where the debt level is 70%, rather than 50%, the NPV of interest deductions is greater than that of depreciation deductions. Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Views from consultation with stakeholders and general public Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development recommends option 1: an in-perpetuity exemption for BTR developments from interest limitation rules. The purpose of the change to interest limitation was to reduce investor demand for existing housing and improve housing affordability for first home buyers. As well as being supported by this policy, objective B is supported by other recent changes made by the Government including to the First Home Products (supports first home buyers to overcome the deposit barrier to home ownership). The Government is also addressing urban density through speeding up implementation of the National Policy Statement on Urban Development and including medium density residential standards in district plans. The initial policy (for interest limitation) did not take into full account the diversity of residential property supply, and was mostly built around standalone properties. Emerging residential models such as BTR were not captured in this model. Subsequently, the impact on BTR and its tenants were not considered. The 20-year new build exemption is not sufficient to encourage investment in BTR, and this is likely to have a negative impact on rental supply and the experiences of New Zealanders who rent. Exempting BTR developments will support housing objectives A and C (outline above in the problem definition), in conjunction with other measures to support objective B. The Treasury The Treasury does not recommend an exemption for build-to-rent assets. The sector will largely be comprised of new build developments that will already receive a 20-year exemption, and there is little evidence that the sector requires additional financial support via the tax system. The sector continues to expand in full knowledge of the tax changes, and several public funding-streams are available to directly support its continued development without the complexity outlined in this paper. Stakeholders Some submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the interest limitation proposals were in favour of a specific exemption for BTR assets. Submitters argued that when compared with regular residential rental accommodation, BTR assets provide greater tenure security to tenants, do not compete with first home buyers and are more comparable to commercial assets (such as student accommodation or retirement villages). Additionally, they stressed that the industry will not grow without an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation. Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga -Ministry of Housing and Urban Development convened a BTR reference group throughout 2021. This group provided input into the BTR asset class definition and an extension to the interest deductibility exemption: • Depreciation deductibility was identified as a potential incentive to developing BTRs. Deductibility of depreciation for BTRs would be more consistent with the treatment of commercial property. • Denying or limiting interest deductibility was characterised as a barrier to BTR development. BTR stakeholders have also been consulted in one-to-one discussions. Feedback from some institutional investors was that interest deductibility effectively determines whether investing in domestic BTR is viable, compared to international opportunities.

Housing affordability – supply-side issues: Supply-side restrictions have resulted in a housing market that has not kept up with increased demand over the last 40 years. Regulatory barriers, the increased cost of building and insufficient long-term infrastructure planning makes it difficult to increase housing supply in the short term. The increased cost of building has been further exacerbated by building material shortages caused by COVID-19. 3. Housing affordability – demand-side issues: Demand side factors are also putting upward pressure on prices. Falling interest rates resulted in an increase in house prices, creating capital gains for existing property owners but worsening the position of prospective first-home buyers. The removal of loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in response to COVID-19 allowed highly-leveraged investors to re-enter the market, thereby exacerbating price pressures. However, these have since been reinstated. High population growth has also increased demand for housing over recent decades. While tax settings are not the primary driver of housing affordability, current tax settings incentivise investment in housing. In the context of constrained supply, lightly taxing housing relative to other forms of income will lead to higher property prices than would otherwise be expected. 4. Government objectives: The Government currently has three key housing objectives- a. Ensure every New Zealander has a safe, warm, dry and affordable home to call their own – whether they are renters or owners. b. Support more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, which would improve affordability for first-home buyers. c. Create a housing and urban land market that credibly responds to population growth and changing housing preferences, that is competitive and affordable for renters and homeowners, and is well-planned and well regulated. 5. A barrier to achieving objectives A and C is a shortage of rental accommodation driven by an under-supply of housing stock. The build-to-rent (BTR) sector has the potential to enable dedicated rental supply, including needed rental typologies (i.e., one-and two- bedroom units), in areas of high demand. 6. Status quo: BTR assets are treated the same as any other residential investment property. Interest deductions are being phased out from 1 October 2021 for existing residential investment properties. New builds will have an exemption from the interest limitation rules for 20 years from their date of completion. This exemption will apply to new BTR assets. Depreciation deductions are not currently available for any residential property including BTR assets. 7. Impact of status quo on the BTR sector: Limits to available data make it hard to predict how the sector will be impacted if no tax support is introduced for BTR. The view from the sector is that that some developments have been put on hold or deferred indefinitely as a result of the interest limitation rules. However, there are many factors at play that are making it difficult for the BTR sector to emerge at scale in New Zealand. 8. The introduction of the interest limitation rules from 1 October 2021 is seen by the BTR industry as a barrier to its expansion in New Zealand. BTR stakeholders raised concerns that without an extended interest limitation exemption, the rules would Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] seriously harm the feasibility of commercially delivered BTR developments. Stakeholders have indicated that they are investing elsewhere (including overseas) because of the introduction of interest limitation rules. 9. The sector has provided two arguments why interest limitation may limit the industry: a. First, it increases taxation and reduces cashflow for rentals. Noting that this issue is partially solved for new BTR assets, as the new build exemption will apply for the first 20 years of the asset’s life. b. Second, it affects future sales. If a BTR asset needs to be sold, the lack of interest deductibility may affect asset value in the BTR market. BTR investors may see development in New Zealand as riskier than overseas options, or developments exempt from the interest limitation rules (such as retirement villages). Additionally, BTR assets that do go ahead may be split up and sold off as individual units after 20 years (once the new build exemption ceases) which could displace tenants. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 10. The key policy problem is availability of rental accommodation in New Zealand. Housing costs tend to be a greater burden for renters than owner-occupiers. 2 In 2019, approximately one third of households were renters. 3 A greater proportion of lower- income households were renters, including nearly half of all households in the lowest income decile. 4 In 2020, 45 percent of renters spent 30 percent or more of their income on housing costs compared to 25 percent for owner-occupiers. 5 This high ratio of rents to incomes has been steady nationally for more than a decade. 6 However, rents have grown much faster than incomes for some groups, including renters in major centres (such as Auckland and Wellington). 7 Several factors explain increasing rent prices, including the cost of supplying rentals and increased incomes. 11. BTR provides a potential opportunity to further the Government’s objectives A and C by increasing supply of long-term affordable rental accommodation. Therefore, two options for support are being considered: an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation, or reintroducing depreciation deductions. 12. Treatment of BTR assets would need to balance the objectives of providing new housing (objectives A and C) while not undermining the intended purpose of the interest limitation rules in terms of dampening investor demand (objective B). As BTR is an emerging industry, neither of the options are expected to provide significant financial benefit the industry, as illustrated by the NPV analysis above.

Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] BTR investors tend to be large institutional investors, so it could be seen as unfair to provide support that is not available for smaller investors who own individual residential rental properties.

As noted on 8 March 2021 (CAB-21-MIN-0045 Amended refers), Cabinet’s policy objectives for the housing market are to: a. Ensure every New Zealander has a safe, warm, dry and affordable home to call their own – whether they are renters or owners. b. Support more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, which would improve affordability for first-home buyers. c. Create a housing and urban land market that credibly responds to population growth and changing housing preferences, that is competitive and affordable for renters and homeowners, and is well-planned and well regulated. 14. The options presented in this Regulatory Impact Statement seek primarily to address supply-side housing objectives in support of objectives A and C. Specifically, to ensure that renters have a safe, warm, dry and affordable home to call their own. However, the options will also be considered in terms how they impact objective B.

The options will be assessed against the three housing objectives: a. Ensure every New Zealander has a safe, warm, dry and affordable home to call their own – whether they are renters or owners. b. Support more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, which would improve affordability for first-home buyers. c. Create a housing and urban land market that credibly responds to population growth and changing housing preferences, that is competitive and affordable for renters and homeowners, and is well-planned and well regulated. 16. The options will also be evaluated against traditional tax policy criteria including: a. Compliance costs: options should be as simple and as low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with. b. Administrative costs: administrative costs imposed on Inland Revenue should be appropriate for the issue. c. Economic impact: taxes should be efficient and minimise as far as possible impediments to economic growth. Options should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (that is, causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. d. Revenue impact: options for reform should be appropriate given fiscal constraints. e. Sustainability and coherence of the tax system: options should collect the revenue required in a transparent and timely manner while not leading to tax driven outcomes, or opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. Options for reform should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. f. Fairness and equity: The tax system should be fair. Options should, to the extent possible, seek to treat similar taxpayers in similar circumstances in a similar way.

D e c i s i o n s b y C a b i n e t Options for comparison 17. Officials were directed to compare two specific options to provide support to the BTR sector using the tax system \[SWC-21-MIN-0228 refers\]. The first option is to provide an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation for BTR assets. The second option is to reintroduce depreciation deductions for BTR assets. Definition of a build-to-rent asset 18. Cabinet has agreed to a partial definition of a BTR asset class (SWC-21-MIN-0228 refers), including the following components: a. 20 or more dwellings in a single building or multiple buildings that comprise a single development; b. the dwellings are owned by a single owner; c. the building/buildings that contain the dwellings may contain other dwellings or commercial premises that do not form part of the build-to-rent asset; d. the dwellings offer tenants benefits in relation to tenure and/or rights that are greater than those provided for under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986; e. the development includes dwellings where tenants are offered lifetime tenancies; f. the dwellings have continuously been used as a build-to-rent since they were constructed. 19. Cabinet is yet to agree on a minimum tenure length requirement to be included as part of the build-to-rent asset class definition, and whether the definition would apply to existing or new BTRs. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? 20. Two options are being considered in addition to the status quo: a. Option 1: provide an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation for BTR assets. b. Option 2: reintroduce depreciation deductions for BTR assets at a rate of 1.4% 8 diminishing value. 21. The assessment is limited to these two options. It does not analyse any other avenues of support the tax system could provide, or the other programmes that address Government housing objectives. Status quo 22. Currently, depreciation is disallowed for BTR units (as it is for all residential buildings). Interest deductions are also being phased out over approximately four years for existing BTR assets, and interest will eventually be completely denied in relation to borrowing for BTR assets by 2025/26. BTR assets that receive their code compliance certificates on or after 27 March 2020 will be considered new builds and could qualify for the new build exemption from interest limitation for 20 years from the date they receive their code compliance certificate. 23. Objective: This option would not achieve objectives A and C as it provides no additional support to BTR assets, so it does not support the supply-side objectives. However, new BTR assets would still have access to the new build exemption. The status quo best achieves objective B as it does not further incentivise investor demand in residential property. 24. Compliance costs: This option would impose no further compliance costs. 25. Administrative costs: This option would impose no further administrative costs. 26. Economic impact: This option would have no further economic impact. 27. Revenue impact: This option would have no revenue impact over the forecast period. 28. Sustainability and coherence of the tax system: This option would be best for the overall sustainability of the tax system, as it creates no new opportunities for tax driven behaviour, avoidance, or arbitrage. It is the most coherent option in terms of the tax system. 29. Fairness and equity: This option has no impact on fairness and equity. Option One – provide an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation for BTR assets 30. The interest limitation rules apply from 1 October 2021 to limit the ability for residential property investors to deduct interest on loans relating to residential property. Option 1 would provide an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation for BTR assets. The 8 The depreciation rate of 1.4% was chosen based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) economic depreciation rate set for multi-use residential buildings (MURBs). Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] exemption would allow interest incurred in relation to BTR assets to continue to be deducted indefinitely. 31. Objective: Option 1 would support objectives A and C. However, for most BTR assets there will be no additional tax benefit for 20 years, as the new build exemption already applies over the first 20 years of a new BTR asset’s life. It would not support objective B, as it would provide a further exemption from the interest limitation rules that aim to dampen investor demand. 32. Compliance costs: The compliance costs associated with option 1 are low. The interest limitation rules are complex, however, most taxpayers with BTR assets will already be interacting with the rules and applying exemptions. Taxpayers that own BTR assets would be able to continue to deduct interest costs. Taxpayers would have to determine whether they satisfy the definition of BTR as an asset class and will have to provide proof of this to the relevant government agency. 9 Taxpayers would have to consider whether their BTR assets continue to meet the definition and report any changes to their eligibility to the relevant government agency. 33. Administrative costs: Option 1 would have low administrative costs. It would be straightforward to administer a new exemption from interest limitation, as similar exemptions (such as the new build exemption) already exist. 34. Adding a new exemption reason to tax return forms going forward would be simple, and it should be relatively easy to collect any data required for reporting purposes. 35. There should be limited additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue associated with checking that taxpayers qualify for the BTR asset class exemption, as the relevant government agency will be providing the details of eligible taxpayers to Inland Revenue. 36. Economic impact: Option 1 would create a bias towards investment in BTR assets compared with other residential property. However, it would reduce the current bias against investing in BTR compared with other investments (such as commercial property), by restoring interest deductions. 37. The NPV tax benefit (when applying the assumptions set out in the executive summary) of the extra interest deductions would be $730,008. The size of the NPV tax benefit of option 1, relative to the initial value of the BTR in this example, is 4.87%.This analysis assumes the investor has an interest only mortgage with a constant debt level of 50%. 38. Revenue impact: 39. New BTR assets: This option would have no revenue impact for first 20 years after a new BTR asset receives its code compliance certificate, because the existing new build exemption would apply. 40. Existing BTR assets: HUD estimates there may be up to 500 existing dwellings that would not qualify for the new build exemption (existing BTR assets). If these existing BTR assets were to qualify for a BTR-specific exemption from interest limitation, this would have an estimated cost of $2.1m over the 2021/22 to 2025/26 period. Those 9 The relevant government agency that will hold and monitor the asset class register has not yet been determined. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] BTR that do not qualify for the new build exemption will be subject to the four-year phasing out of interest deductions. This means the costing for option 1 will only account for the portion of interest that would otherwise have been phased out for existing BTR. 41. After the 20-year new build exemption expires: BTR assets would continue to have interest deductions under option 1 in perpetuity from year 21. The extent to which option 1 provides a greater benefit than option 2 depends upon a number of factors, in particular the interest rate and the level of borrowing to fund the BTR asset. There is no forecast revenue impact because the reduction in revenue occurs well after the forecast period. 42. Sustainability and coherence of the tax system: Option 1 is better for the overall sustainability of the tax system than option 2, because it would be easier to collect data on the amount of support this option would provide to BTR assets. This better access to data would also make it more likely that Inland Revenue would be able to identify and prevent tax avoidance and arbitrage. Option 1 is less coherent than the status quo, but more coherent than option 2. There are already a number of exemptions from the interest limitation rules which provides a precedent for a BTR exemption. 43. Fairness and equity: Option 1 is less equitable than the status quo, but more equitable than option 2, because it provides BTR assets with an advantage over other investors in non-BTR residential properties. However, new BTR properties would qualify for the new build exemption already, so providing an explicit BTR exemption would not provide any greater advantage to new BTR assets for 20 years (at which point the new build exemption would expire). Option Two – reintroduce depreciation deductions for BTR assets at a rate of 1.4% diminishing value 44. This would apply to both existing and new build dwellings that meet the BTR asset class definition. The rate of 1.4% is based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) economic depreciation rate of a multi-unit residential building (MURB). Depreciation would be deductible for the life of the asset. If the asset is eventually sold for less than its depreciated value, the loss can be deducted. However, if the asset is sold for more than its depreciated value (which is more likely for residential property) the excess deductions will be included as income. This is known as depreciation clawback (or depreciation recovery income) and is an existing feature of the tax depreciation rules. 45. Objective: This option would support objectives A and C more than option 1. This is because most BTR assets would qualify for the new build exemption and would therefore enjoy the benefit of depreciation deductions as well as the new build exemption from interest limitation for 20 years. However, any benefit provided by allowing depreciation deductions would be reduced to the extent to which depreciation deductions are clawed back when a BTR asset is sold, so the actual benefit could be quite small. It would not further objective B as it could incentivise greater investment in residential property. 46. Compliance costs: The compliance costs associated with option 2 would be greater than option 1 as taxpayers would have to apply the depreciation rate. For option 1, taxpayers would just continue to deduct interest. 47. Taxpayers will have to keep accurate records of their depreciated BTR assets, so that they can calculate whether there is a depreciation loss or depreciation recovery income Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] when they sell their BTR asset. Taxpayers will have to ensure that any amounts of loss or income are returned, and any resulting tax liability satisfied if they sell a BTR asset. 48. Similar to option 1, taxpayers would have to determine whether they satisfy the definition of BTR as an asset class, and will have to provide proof that they satisfy the definition to the relevant government agency. Taxpayers would have to consider whether their BTR assets continue to meet the definition, and report any changes to their eligibility to the relevant governmment agency. 49. Administrative costs: Option 2 could have high administration costs, depending on what data needs to be collected from taxpayers. 50. If data needs to be captured on the amount of depreciation deductions claimed in relation to BTR assets, this would impose high administrative costs, because this level of information about depreciation deductions is not currently captured. 51. Similar to option 1, there should be limited additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue associated with checking that taxpayers qualify for the BTR asset class exemption, as the relevant government agency will be providing the details of eligible taxpayers to Inland Revenue. 52. Economic impact: Option 2 would create a bias towards BTR assets compared with other residential property, by allowing depreciation deductions for BTR when these deductions are denied for other residential buildings. However, it would reduce the bias towards investment in commercial buildings, which are able to be depreciated. 53. From year 21, interest deductions would cease because the new build exemption would expire. Depreciation deductions alone, especially taking into account any potential clawback/depreciation recovery income on sale, would provide a similar NPV tax benefit than an exemption from interest limitation. 54. The NPV benefit of allowing the investor to claim depreciation deductions at a rate of 1.4% (diminishing value) over the same time period would be $879,161. The size of the NPV tax benefit of option 2, relative to the initial value of the BTR in this example is 5.86%. 55. Revenue impact: 56. While the new build exemption applies: The revenue impact of option 2 over the forecast period, and while the new build exemption applies to new BTR assets, would be greater than the revenue impact of option 1. 57. After the new build exemption expires: In the longer-term, option 2 would likely have less of a revenue impact than option 1. However, the fiscal impact over the 2021/22 to 2025/26 period is estimated to be $21.2milion. The fiscal impact is greater than option 1, despite having a similar economic impact. This is because under option 1 the new build exemption applies to most BTR, and interest deductions are phased out over four years for existing BTR. This means the cost over the forecast period for option 1 only takes into account the portion of interest that is denied for existing BTR. 58. Sustainability and coherence of the tax system: Option 2 is worse for the overall sustainability of the tax system, as Inland Revenue does not currently collect detailed data on depreciation deductions claimed by taxpayers. Collecting additional data on depreciation would impose a high administrative burden, and absent this data it would be difficult to determine whether the depreciation rules for BTR as an asset are being applied correctly (or whether there is any tax avoidance or arbitrage occurring). Option Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 2 is the less coherent option, because it would involve amending the depreciation rules just to provide support for a particular type of residential investment/asset. The aim of the tax depreciation rules is to ensure that a tax deduction is available each year for the amount by which the value of an asset declines over time, not to provide incentives so that taxpayers have extra support for investments in certain types of assets. 59. Fairness and equity: This option is less equitable, because it provides BTR assets with depreciation deductions, and these are not available for any other residential buildings. Some (but not all) BTR assets are MURBs. MURBs are long lived assets and in reality, depreciate at a slower rate than commercial and industrial buildings. Regulatory Impact Statement | 15 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] W h a t o p t i on i s l i k e l y t o b e s t a d d r e s s t h e p r o b l e m , m e e t t h e p o l i c y o b j e c t i v e s , a n d d e l i v e r t h e h i g h e s t n e t b e n e f i t s ? 62. The status quo best meets the stated objectives overall. It promotes objective B by retaining the scope of the interest limitation rules. It also results in the most coherent and equitable tax system of all the options. 63. Inland Revenue considers that there is no inherent difference between BTR assets and regular residential property, apart from scale. To provide BTR investors with concessionary treatment would be inequitable if the same concessions are not also provided to smaller investors. Options 1 and 2 would potentially meet objectives A and C, however, there is not enough available information to conclude that either of these options would make a considerable difference to the viability of the sector. 64. Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry for Housing and Urban Development considers option 1 best addresses the problem, provides the highest net benefits over the long run and that policy objective B is better met through direct support for first home buyers. It is important that Government interventions address needs for all New Zealanders, including renters.

As the preferred option is to retain the status quo, there would be no additional costs or benefits of the preferred option. 66. The proposal for Cabinet (option 1 -exemption from interest limitation) would also have no extra costs or benefits to most of the sector as the new build exemption will apply to new BTR assets. The revenue impact over the forecast period would be $2.1 million if existing BTR assets were to qualify for an exemption from interest limitation.

The recommended option is to retain the status quo. This will require no implementation. The interest limitation rules have already been enacted and educational material is available. Implementation of option 1 69. If Cabinet agrees to implement option 1, the relevant government agency would determine whether a taxpayer satisfies the BTR definition and keep a register of all qualifying taxpayers. This register will be accessible by Inland Revenue each tax year, so that Inland Revenue is aware of which taxpayers can be claiming interest or depreciation deductions for BTR assets, when these taxpayers first satisfied the criteria, and if these taxpayers cease to meet the criteria. Implementation of option 2 70. As with option 1, a relevant government agency will need to keep a register BTR assets the meet the required definition. This would be provided to Inland Revenue who would then allow depreciation deductions for qualifying taxpayers. 71. There would be an additional complexity with implementing option 2 if data is captured on the amount of depreciation deductions claimed in relation to BTR assets. This level of information about depreciation deductions is not currently captured.

Regulatory Impact Statement | 19 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54
\[IN CONFIDENCE\] Officials have been asked to compare two options to provide support to the BTR sector using the tax system. The following options have been compared: 1. Option 1: provide an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation for BTR assets; or 2. Option 2: reintroduce depreciation deductions for BTR assets at a rate of 1.4% 1 diminishing value (DV). If Cabinet decide to go with either of the above options, BTR must be defined as an asset class. Cabinet has already agreed to a partial definition of a BTR asset class (SWC-21-MIN-0228 refers), including the following components: a. 20 or more dwellings in a single building or multiple buildings that comprise a single development; b. the dwellings are owned by a single owner; c. the building/buildings that contain the dwellings may contain other dwellings or commercial premises that do not form part of the build-to-rent asset; d. the dwellings offer tenants benefits in relation to tenure and/or rights that are greater than those provided for under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986; e. the development includes dwellings where tenants are offered lifetime tenancies; f. the dwellings have continuously been used as a build-to-rent since they were constructed. There are two outstanding issues in defining the asset class -minimum tenure length requirement, and application to new or existing assets. Inland Revenue’s preferred option Recommended option – the status quo Inland Revenue recommends the status quo, for the following reasons: • There is nothing inherent in BTR that makes it different from other residential rental property, apart from scale. • While the interest limitation rules will make BTRs less attractive, the rules currently apply equally to all residential property. Inland Revenue previously advised against the introduction of the interest limitation rules, however, further exemptions for specific investment would undermine the purpose of the rules. • The development and new build exemptions already significantly mitigate the negative impact of the interest limitation rules for newly built BTRs (completed after 27 March 2020). As with all new builds, the exemptions would apply while new BTRs are being constructed, and then for 20 years after they are completed. The new build 1 The depreciation rate of 1.4% was chosen based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) economic depreciation rate set for multi-use residential buildings (MURBs). Regulatory Impact Statement | 2 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] exemption would apply to the initial owner of a BTR development, as well as to any subsequent owners of the BTR during the 20-year period for which the exemption applies. • An in-perpetuity exemption for BTRs (option 1) could be viewed as inequitable, because it would benefit large investors but provide no relief for smaller investors who hold similar properties. • An in-perpetuity exemption would also incentivise BTRs to only ever be used as rental properties. This is contrary to the objective of the interest limitation rule, which is to tilt the playing field away from investors to first home buyers and owner- occupiers. • Reintroducing depreciation deductions only for BTRs (options 2) would reduce fairness and efficiency within the tax system, as well as the overall coherence of the tax system. Additionally, some (but not all) BTRs are multi-unit residential buildings (MURBs). MURBs are long lived assets that in reality depreciate at a slower rate than commercial and industrial buildings. Second preference – an exemption from interest limitation (option 1) If Ministers decide to provide support to the BTR sector through the tax system, Inland Revenue recommends option 1, which would involve introducing an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation for BTR assets. Inland Revenue prefers option 1 as it provides a similar benefit to BTR assets as option 2, but is simpler from both a compliance and administrative perspective. Potential impact of option 1 Of the options, option 1 is likely to provide a slightly lower net present value (NPV) tax benefit for BTR when a particular set of assumptions is applied. The NPV is based on the following assumptions: 1 the investor has a new BTR asset which is initially worth $15m 2 the investor holds the BTR asset for 50 years 3 all future deductions are discounted at a rate of 5% 4 the investor borrows 50% of the cost of the BTR asset 5 the investor pays interest of 6% per annum. The NPV tax benefit of the extra interest deductions (beyond the benefit of the 20 year new build exemption) would be $730,008. The size of the NPV tax benefit of option 1, relative to the initial value of the BTR in this example, is 4.87%. In comparison, the NPV benefit of allowing the investor to claim depreciation deductions at a rate of 1.4% (diminishing value) over the same time period would be $879,161. The size of the NPV tax benefit of option 2, relative to the initial value of the BTR in this example is 5.86%. Regardless of the assumptions applied, the benefit of option 1 is relatively low. The NPV analysis for both options is also sensitive to changes in the debt ratio. For example, where the debt level is 70%, rather than 50%, the NPV of interest deductions is greater than that of depreciation deductions. Regulatory Impact Statement | 3 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] Views from consultation with stakeholders and general public Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry of Housing and Urban Development recommends option 1: an in-perpetuity exemption for BTR developments from interest limitation rules. The purpose of the change to interest limitation was to reduce investor demand for existing housing and improve housing affordability for first home buyers. As well as being supported by this policy, objective B is supported by other recent changes made by the Government including to the First Home Products (supports first home buyers to overcome the deposit barrier to home ownership). The Government is also addressing urban density through speeding up implementation of the National Policy Statement on Urban Development and including medium density residential standards in district plans. The initial policy (for interest limitation) did not take into full account the diversity of residential property supply, and was mostly built around standalone properties. Emerging residential models such as BTR were not captured in this model. Subsequently, the impact on BTR and its tenants were not considered. The 20-year new build exemption is not sufficient to encourage investment in BTR, and this is likely to have a negative impact on rental supply and the experiences of New Zealanders who rent. Exempting BTR developments will support housing objectives A and C (outline above in the problem definition), in conjunction with other measures to support objective B. The Treasury The Treasury does not recommend an exemption for build-to-rent assets. The sector will largely be comprised of new build developments that will already receive a 20-year exemption, and there is little evidence that the sector requires additional financial support via the tax system. The sector continues to expand in full knowledge of the tax changes, and several public funding-streams are available to directly support its continued development without the complexity outlined in this paper. Stakeholders Some submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the interest limitation proposals were in favour of a specific exemption for BTR assets. Submitters argued that when compared with regular residential rental accommodation, BTR assets provide greater tenure security to tenants, do not compete with first home buyers and are more comparable to commercial assets (such as student accommodation or retirement villages). Additionally, they stressed that the industry will not grow without an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation. Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga -Ministry of Housing and Urban Development convened a BTR reference group throughout 2021. This group provided input into the BTR asset class definition and an extension to the interest deductibility exemption: • Depreciation deductibility was identified as a potential incentive to developing BTRs. Deductibility of depreciation for BTRs would be more consistent with the treatment of commercial property. • Denying or limiting interest deductibility was characterised as a barrier to BTR development. BTR stakeholders have also been consulted in one-to-one discussions. Feedback from some institutional investors was that interest deductibility effectively determines whether investing in domestic BTR is viable, compared to international opportunities.

Housing affordability – supply-side issues: Supply-side restrictions have resulted in a housing market that has not kept up with increased demand over the last 40 years. Regulatory barriers, the increased cost of building and insufficient long-term infrastructure planning makes it difficult to increase housing supply in the short term. The increased cost of building has been further exacerbated by building material shortages caused by COVID-19. 3. Housing affordability – demand-side issues: Demand side factors are also putting upward pressure on prices. Falling interest rates resulted in an increase in house prices, creating capital gains for existing property owners but worsening the position of prospective first-home buyers. The removal of loan-to-value ratio (LVR) restrictions by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in response to COVID-19 allowed highly-leveraged investors to re-enter the market, thereby exacerbating price pressures. However, these have since been reinstated. High population growth has also increased demand for housing over recent decades. While tax settings are not the primary driver of housing affordability, current tax settings incentivise investment in housing. In the context of constrained supply, lightly taxing housing relative to other forms of income will lead to higher property prices than would otherwise be expected. 4. Government objectives: The Government currently has three key housing objectives- a. Ensure every New Zealander has a safe, warm, dry and affordable home to call their own – whether they are renters or owners. b. Support more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, which would improve affordability for first-home buyers. c. Create a housing and urban land market that credibly responds to population growth and changing housing preferences, that is competitive and affordable for renters and homeowners, and is well-planned and well regulated. 5. A barrier to achieving objectives A and C is a shortage of rental accommodation driven by an under-supply of housing stock. The build-to-rent (BTR) sector has the potential to enable dedicated rental supply, including needed rental typologies (i.e., one-and two- bedroom units), in areas of high demand. 6. Status quo: BTR assets are treated the same as any other residential investment property. Interest deductions are being phased out from 1 October 2021 for existing residential investment properties. New builds will have an exemption from the interest limitation rules for 20 years from their date of completion. This exemption will apply to new BTR assets. Depreciation deductions are not currently available for any residential property including BTR assets. 7. Impact of status quo on the BTR sector: Limits to available data make it hard to predict how the sector will be impacted if no tax support is introduced for BTR. The view from the sector is that that some developments have been put on hold or deferred indefinitely as a result of the interest limitation rules. However, there are many factors at play that are making it difficult for the BTR sector to emerge at scale in New Zealand. 8. The introduction of the interest limitation rules from 1 October 2021 is seen by the BTR industry as a barrier to its expansion in New Zealand. BTR stakeholders raised concerns that without an extended interest limitation exemption, the rules would Regulatory Impact Statement | 6 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] seriously harm the feasibility of commercially delivered BTR developments. Stakeholders have indicated that they are investing elsewhere (including overseas) because of the introduction of interest limitation rules. 9. The sector has provided two arguments why interest limitation may limit the industry: a. First, it increases taxation and reduces cashflow for rentals. Noting that this issue is partially solved for new BTR assets, as the new build exemption will apply for the first 20 years of the asset’s life. b. Second, it affects future sales. If a BTR asset needs to be sold, the lack of interest deductibility may affect asset value in the BTR market. BTR investors may see development in New Zealand as riskier than overseas options, or developments exempt from the interest limitation rules (such as retirement villages). Additionally, BTR assets that do go ahead may be split up and sold off as individual units after 20 years (once the new build exemption ceases) which could displace tenants. W h a t i s t h e p o l i c y p r o b l e m o r o p p o r t u n i t y? 10. The key policy problem is availability of rental accommodation in New Zealand. Housing costs tend to be a greater burden for renters than owner-occupiers. 2 In 2019, approximately one third of households were renters. 3 A greater proportion of lower- income households were renters, including nearly half of all households in the lowest income decile. 4 In 2020, 45 percent of renters spent 30 percent or more of their income on housing costs compared to 25 percent for owner-occupiers. 5 This high ratio of rents to incomes has been steady nationally for more than a decade. 6 However, rents have grown much faster than incomes for some groups, including renters in major centres (such as Auckland and Wellington). 7 Several factors explain increasing rent prices, including the cost of supplying rentals and increased incomes. 11. BTR provides a potential opportunity to further the Government’s objectives A and C by increasing supply of long-term affordable rental accommodation. Therefore, two options for support are being considered: an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation, or reintroducing depreciation deductions. 12. Treatment of BTR assets would need to balance the objectives of providing new housing (objectives A and C) while not undermining the intended purpose of the interest limitation rules in terms of dampening investor demand (objective B). As BTR is an emerging industry, neither of the options are expected to provide significant financial benefit the industry, as illustrated by the NPV analysis above.

Regulatory Impact Statement | 7 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] BTR investors tend to be large institutional investors, so it could be seen as unfair to provide support that is not available for smaller investors who own individual residential rental properties.

As noted on 8 March 2021 (CAB-21-MIN-0045 Amended refers), Cabinet’s policy objectives for the housing market are to: a. Ensure every New Zealander has a safe, warm, dry and affordable home to call their own – whether they are renters or owners. b. Support more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, which would improve affordability for first-home buyers. c. Create a housing and urban land market that credibly responds to population growth and changing housing preferences, that is competitive and affordable for renters and homeowners, and is well-planned and well regulated. 14. The options presented in this Regulatory Impact Statement seek primarily to address supply-side housing objectives in support of objectives A and C. Specifically, to ensure that renters have a safe, warm, dry and affordable home to call their own. However, the options will also be considered in terms how they impact objective B.

The options will be assessed against the three housing objectives: a. Ensure every New Zealander has a safe, warm, dry and affordable home to call their own – whether they are renters or owners. b. Support more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, which would improve affordability for first-home buyers. c. Create a housing and urban land market that credibly responds to population growth and changing housing preferences, that is competitive and affordable for renters and homeowners, and is well-planned and well regulated. 16. The options will also be evaluated against traditional tax policy criteria including: a. Compliance costs: options should be as simple and as low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with. b. Administrative costs: administrative costs imposed on Inland Revenue should be appropriate for the issue. c. Economic impact: taxes should be efficient and minimise as far as possible impediments to economic growth. Options should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (that is, causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. d. Revenue impact: options for reform should be appropriate given fiscal constraints. e. Sustainability and coherence of the tax system: options should collect the revenue required in a transparent and timely manner while not leading to tax driven outcomes, or opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. Options for reform should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. f. Fairness and equity: The tax system should be fair. Options should, to the extent possible, seek to treat similar taxpayers in similar circumstances in a similar way.

D e c i s i o n s b y C a b i n e t Options for comparison 17. Officials were directed to compare two specific options to provide support to the BTR sector using the tax system \[SWC-21-MIN-0228 refers\]. The first option is to provide an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation for BTR assets. The second option is to reintroduce depreciation deductions for BTR assets. Definition of a build-to-rent asset 18. Cabinet has agreed to a partial definition of a BTR asset class (SWC-21-MIN-0228 refers), including the following components: a. 20 or more dwellings in a single building or multiple buildings that comprise a single development; b. the dwellings are owned by a single owner; c. the building/buildings that contain the dwellings may contain other dwellings or commercial premises that do not form part of the build-to-rent asset; d. the dwellings offer tenants benefits in relation to tenure and/or rights that are greater than those provided for under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986; e. the development includes dwellings where tenants are offered lifetime tenancies; f. the dwellings have continuously been used as a build-to-rent since they were constructed. 19. Cabinet is yet to agree on a minimum tenure length requirement to be included as part of the build-to-rent asset class definition, and whether the definition would apply to existing or new BTRs. Regulatory Impact Statement | 10 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] W h a t o p t i o n s a r e b e i n g c o n s i d e r e d? 20. Two options are being considered in addition to the status quo: a. Option 1: provide an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation for BTR assets. b. Option 2: reintroduce depreciation deductions for BTR assets at a rate of 1.4% 8 diminishing value. 21. The assessment is limited to these two options. It does not analyse any other avenues of support the tax system could provide, or the other programmes that address Government housing objectives. Status quo 22. Currently, depreciation is disallowed for BTR units (as it is for all residential buildings). Interest deductions are also being phased out over approximately four years for existing BTR assets, and interest will eventually be completely denied in relation to borrowing for BTR assets by 2025/26. BTR assets that receive their code compliance certificates on or after 27 March 2020 will be considered new builds and could qualify for the new build exemption from interest limitation for 20 years from the date they receive their code compliance certificate. 23. Objective: This option would not achieve objectives A and C as it provides no additional support to BTR assets, so it does not support the supply-side objectives. However, new BTR assets would still have access to the new build exemption. The status quo best achieves objective B as it does not further incentivise investor demand in residential property. 24. Compliance costs: This option would impose no further compliance costs. 25. Administrative costs: This option would impose no further administrative costs. 26. Economic impact: This option would have no further economic impact. 27. Revenue impact: This option would have no revenue impact over the forecast period. 28. Sustainability and coherence of the tax system: This option would be best for the overall sustainability of the tax system, as it creates no new opportunities for tax driven behaviour, avoidance, or arbitrage. It is the most coherent option in terms of the tax system. 29. Fairness and equity: This option has no impact on fairness and equity. Option One – provide an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation for BTR assets 30. The interest limitation rules apply from 1 October 2021 to limit the ability for residential property investors to deduct interest on loans relating to residential property. Option 1 would provide an in-perpetuity exemption from interest limitation for BTR assets. The 8 The depreciation rate of 1.4% was chosen based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) economic depreciation rate set for multi-use residential buildings (MURBs). Regulatory Impact Statement | 11 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] exemption would allow interest incurred in relation to BTR assets to continue to be deducted indefinitely. 31. Objective: Option 1 would support objectives A and C. However, for most BTR assets there will be no additional tax benefit for 20 years, as the new build exemption already applies over the first 20 years of a new BTR asset’s life. It would not support objective B, as it would provide a further exemption from the interest limitation rules that aim to dampen investor demand. 32. Compliance costs: The compliance costs associated with option 1 are low. The interest limitation rules are complex, however, most taxpayers with BTR assets will already be interacting with the rules and applying exemptions. Taxpayers that own BTR assets would be able to continue to deduct interest costs. Taxpayers would have to determine whether they satisfy the definition of BTR as an asset class and will have to provide proof of this to the relevant government agency. 9 Taxpayers would have to consider whether their BTR assets continue to meet the definition and report any changes to their eligibility to the relevant government agency. 33. Administrative costs: Option 1 would have low administrative costs. It would be straightforward to administer a new exemption from interest limitation, as similar exemptions (such as the new build exemption) already exist. 34. Adding a new exemption reason to tax return forms going forward would be simple, and it should be relatively easy to collect any data required for reporting purposes. 35. There should be limited additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue associated with checking that taxpayers qualify for the BTR asset class exemption, as the relevant government agency will be providing the details of eligible taxpayers to Inland Revenue. 36. Economic impact: Option 1 would create a bias towards investment in BTR assets compared with other residential property. However, it would reduce the current bias against investing in BTR compared with other investments (such as commercial property), by restoring interest deductions. 37. The NPV tax benefit (when applying the assumptions set out in the executive summary) of the extra interest deductions would be $730,008. The size of the NPV tax benefit of option 1, relative to the initial value of the BTR in this example, is 4.87%.This analysis assumes the investor has an interest only mortgage with a constant debt level of 50%. 38. Revenue impact: 39. New BTR assets: This option would have no revenue impact for first 20 years after a new BTR asset receives its code compliance certificate, because the existing new build exemption would apply. 40. Existing BTR assets: HUD estimates there may be up to 500 existing dwellings that would not qualify for the new build exemption (existing BTR assets). If these existing BTR assets were to qualify for a BTR-specific exemption from interest limitation, this would have an estimated cost of $2.1m over the 2021/22 to 2025/26 period. Those 9 The relevant government agency that will hold and monitor the asset class register has not yet been determined. Regulatory Impact Statement | 12 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] BTR that do not qualify for the new build exemption will be subject to the four-year phasing out of interest deductions. This means the costing for option 1 will only account for the portion of interest that would otherwise have been phased out for existing BTR. 41. After the 20-year new build exemption expires: BTR assets would continue to have interest deductions under option 1 in perpetuity from year 21. The extent to which option 1 provides a greater benefit than option 2 depends upon a number of factors, in particular the interest rate and the level of borrowing to fund the BTR asset. There is no forecast revenue impact because the reduction in revenue occurs well after the forecast period. 42. Sustainability and coherence of the tax system: Option 1 is better for the overall sustainability of the tax system than option 2, because it would be easier to collect data on the amount of support this option would provide to BTR assets. This better access to data would also make it more likely that Inland Revenue would be able to identify and prevent tax avoidance and arbitrage. Option 1 is less coherent than the status quo, but more coherent than option 2. There are already a number of exemptions from the interest limitation rules which provides a precedent for a BTR exemption. 43. Fairness and equity: Option 1 is less equitable than the status quo, but more equitable than option 2, because it provides BTR assets with an advantage over other investors in non-BTR residential properties. However, new BTR properties would qualify for the new build exemption already, so providing an explicit BTR exemption would not provide any greater advantage to new BTR assets for 20 years (at which point the new build exemption would expire). Option Two – reintroduce depreciation deductions for BTR assets at a rate of 1.4% diminishing value 44. This would apply to both existing and new build dwellings that meet the BTR asset class definition. The rate of 1.4% is based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) economic depreciation rate of a multi-unit residential building (MURB). Depreciation would be deductible for the life of the asset. If the asset is eventually sold for less than its depreciated value, the loss can be deducted. However, if the asset is sold for more than its depreciated value (which is more likely for residential property) the excess deductions will be included as income. This is known as depreciation clawback (or depreciation recovery income) and is an existing feature of the tax depreciation rules. 45. Objective: This option would support objectives A and C more than option 1. This is because most BTR assets would qualify for the new build exemption and would therefore enjoy the benefit of depreciation deductions as well as the new build exemption from interest limitation for 20 years. However, any benefit provided by allowing depreciation deductions would be reduced to the extent to which depreciation deductions are clawed back when a BTR asset is sold, so the actual benefit could be quite small. It would not further objective B as it could incentivise greater investment in residential property. 46. Compliance costs: The compliance costs associated with option 2 would be greater than option 1 as taxpayers would have to apply the depreciation rate. For option 1, taxpayers would just continue to deduct interest. 47. Taxpayers will have to keep accurate records of their depreciated BTR assets, so that they can calculate whether there is a depreciation loss or depreciation recovery income Regulatory Impact Statement | 13 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] when they sell their BTR asset. Taxpayers will have to ensure that any amounts of loss or income are returned, and any resulting tax liability satisfied if they sell a BTR asset. 48. Similar to option 1, taxpayers would have to determine whether they satisfy the definition of BTR as an asset class, and will have to provide proof that they satisfy the definition to the relevant government agency. Taxpayers would have to consider whether their BTR assets continue to meet the definition, and report any changes to their eligibility to the relevant governmment agency. 49. Administrative costs: Option 2 could have high administration costs, depending on what data needs to be collected from taxpayers. 50. If data needs to be captured on the amount of depreciation deductions claimed in relation to BTR assets, this would impose high administrative costs, because this level of information about depreciation deductions is not currently captured. 51. Similar to option 1, there should be limited additional administrative costs for Inland Revenue associated with checking that taxpayers qualify for the BTR asset class exemption, as the relevant government agency will be providing the details of eligible taxpayers to Inland Revenue. 52. Economic impact: Option 2 would create a bias towards BTR assets compared with other residential property, by allowing depreciation deductions for BTR when these deductions are denied for other residential buildings. However, it would reduce the bias towards investment in commercial buildings, which are able to be depreciated. 53. From year 21, interest deductions would cease because the new build exemption would expire. Depreciation deductions alone, especially taking into account any potential clawback/depreciation recovery income on sale, would provide a similar NPV tax benefit than an exemption from interest limitation. 54. The NPV benefit of allowing the investor to claim depreciation deductions at a rate of 1.4% (diminishing value) over the same time period would be $879,161. The size of the NPV tax benefit of option 2, relative to the initial value of the BTR in this example is 5.86%. 55. Revenue impact: 56. While the new build exemption applies: The revenue impact of option 2 over the forecast period, and while the new build exemption applies to new BTR assets, would be greater than the revenue impact of option 1. 57. After the new build exemption expires: In the longer-term, option 2 would likely have less of a revenue impact than option 1. However, the fiscal impact over the 2021/22 to 2025/26 period is estimated to be $21.2milion. The fiscal impact is greater than option 1, despite having a similar economic impact. This is because under option 1 the new build exemption applies to most BTR, and interest deductions are phased out over four years for existing BTR. This means the cost over the forecast period for option 1 only takes into account the portion of interest that is denied for existing BTR. 58. Sustainability and coherence of the tax system: Option 2 is worse for the overall sustainability of the tax system, as Inland Revenue does not currently collect detailed data on depreciation deductions claimed by taxpayers. Collecting additional data on depreciation would impose a high administrative burden, and absent this data it would be difficult to determine whether the depreciation rules for BTR as an asset are being applied correctly (or whether there is any tax avoidance or arbitrage occurring). Option Regulatory Impact Statement | 14 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] 2 is the less coherent option, because it would involve amending the depreciation rules just to provide support for a particular type of residential investment/asset. The aim of the tax depreciation rules is to ensure that a tax deduction is available each year for the amount by which the value of an asset declines over time, not to provide incentives so that taxpayers have extra support for investments in certain types of assets. 59. Fairness and equity: This option is less equitable, because it provides BTR assets with depreciation deductions, and these are not available for any other residential buildings. Some (but not all) BTR assets are MURBs. MURBs are long lived assets and in reality, depreciate at a slower rate than commercial and industrial buildings. Regulatory Impact Statement | 15 3oenpfhurq 2022-08-11 15:50:54 \[IN CONFIDENCE\] W h a t o p t i on i s l i k e l y t o b e s t a d d r e s s t h e p r o b l e m , m e e t t h e p o l i c y o b j e c t i v e s , a n d d e l i v e r t h e h i g h e s t n e t b e n e f i t s ? 62. The status quo best meets the stated objectives overall. It promotes objective B by retaining the scope of the interest limitation rules. It also results in the most coherent and equitable tax system of all the options. 63. Inland Revenue considers that there is no inherent difference between BTR assets and regular residential property, apart from scale. To provide BTR investors with concessionary treatment would be inequitable if the same concessions are not also provided to smaller investors. Options 1 and 2 would potentially meet objectives A and C, however, there is not enough available information to conclude that either of these options would make a considerable difference to the viability of the sector. 64. Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga – Ministry for Housing and Urban Development considers option 1 best addresses the problem, provides the highest net benefits over the long run and that policy objective B is better met through direct support for first home buyers. It is important that Government interventions address needs for all New Zealanders, including renters.

As the preferred option is to retain the status quo, there would be no additional costs or benefits of the preferred option. 66. The proposal for Cabinet (option 1 -exemption from interest limitation) would also have no extra costs or benefits to most of the sector as the new build exemption will apply to new BTR assets. The revenue impact over the forecast period would be $2.1 million if existing BTR assets were to qualify for an exemption from interest limitation.

The recommended option is to retain the status quo. This will require no implementation. The interest limitation rules have already been enacted and educational material is available. Implementation of option 1 69. If Cabinet agrees to implement option 1, the relevant government agency would determine whether a taxpayer satisfies the BTR definition and keep a register of all qualifying taxpayers. This register will be accessible by Inland Revenue each tax year, so that Inland Revenue is aware of which taxpayers can be claiming interest or depreciation deductions for BTR assets, when these taxpayers first satisfied the criteria, and if these taxpayers cease to meet the criteria. Implementation of option 2 70. As with option 1, a relevant government agency will need to keep a register BTR assets the meet the required definition. This would be provided to Inland Revenue who would then allow depreciation deductions for qualifying taxpayers. 71. There would be an additional complexity with implementing option 2 if data is captured on the amount of depreciation deductions claimed in relation to BTR assets. This level of information about depreciation deductions is not currently captured.
