Associated persons These are: • people related by blood, adoption, marriage or de facto relationships • companies with mainly the same shareholders • a partner and a partnership • trusts and their association with trustees, beneficiaries and settlors. The association rules are complex and it is important to seek professional advice if there is any possibility of an association applying to you. Business Any enterprise or activity intended to make a profit is classed as a business. If an organisation runs a business, it must pay tax on all profits after expenses (except certain transactions made with its members). However, if a charity runs a business, it may be exempt from income tax on any profits that it uses for charitable purposes within New Zealand - see page 23. Charitable organisation or charity This is an organisation (incorporated or not) that carries on charitable activities or exists exclusively for charitable purposes. Generally, to obtain tax benefits, charities must be registered with Charities Services.. Many organisations consider themselves charitable because of the work they do or because they're registered under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957. As a result, they may also think they're exempt from income tax. However, an organisation is generally only exempt from income tax if it's registered with Charities Services, or if registration with Charities Services is unavailable (for example, because the entity is a non-resident), has been granted an exemption from Inland Revenue. This exemption does not apply to GST or PAYE. The organisation must still account for these. 7 ird.govt.nz Charitable purposes These include: • the relief of poverty • the advancement of education • the advancement of religion • activities for the benefit of the community. An organisation's purposes must fall within one of these categories to be charitable. Its activities or aims must be for public purposes and the benefit must be available to a large section of the community. In addition, it must not be carried on for the benefit or profit of any individual. If the beneficiaries are limited by blood ties the charitable purpose can still be met in some circumstances. Charitable purpose of marae A marae has a charitable purpose if: • the physical structure of the marae is on land that is a Māori reservation, and • the funds of the marae are not used for a purpose other than the administration and maintenance of the land and of the physical structure of the marae or another charitable purpose. Charities Services (previously known as the Charities Commission) This is part of the Department of Internal Affairs and provides; • a registration and monitoring system for charitable organisations, • collection and processing of Annual Returns, and • support and education to the charitable sector on good governance, and management practice. Community housing entity A trustee, or a company whose activities are mainly the provision of housing, who meet specific criteria and are registered under the Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters Act 1992. They may be a registered charity or alternatively contact Inland Revenue to confirm if they qualify under a specific income tax exemption for community housing entities. 8 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Deregistration There are certain tax implications that apply when an organisation ceases to be a registered charity. For the purposes of this booklet, the deregistration rules outlined in part 4 apply to a charity that: • has been removed from the Charities Register by Charities Services, or • voluntarily deregisters, or • no longer meets the criteria for the income tax exemption for business income under section CW 42 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donee organisation This is an organisation Inland Revenue considers having met the requirements set out in the Income Tax Act 2007. Generally, a donee organisation is one which applies its funds wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropy or cultural purposes within New Zealand. Certain other organisations may also qualify, such as a school board of trustees, tertiary education institutes or community housing entities. Individuals, companies and Ma ̄ ori authorities can get tax benefits by making gifts of money to a donee organisation - see page 25. Donor A person, company or other organisation that gives money or property to another. Incorporated organisations Organisations registered with the Companies Office of the Ministry of Economic Development are classed as incorporated organisations. For more information about becoming incorporated, see societies.govt.nz Non-profit body or Not-for-profit organisation A non-profit body is any society, association or organisation (incorporated or not): • that is not carried on for the profit or gain of any member, and • whose rules do not allow money, property or any other benefit to be distributed to any of its members. Organisation This is a general term, which covers all types of societies, institutions, companies, estates, trusts, funds, whether or not they have a charitable nature or are considered tax-exempt. 9 ird.govt.nz Payroll giving Payroll giving is a voluntary scheme where employees can make donations from their pay to support approved donee organisations. People who donate through payroll giving receive immediate tax credits relating to the donations they make each payday. Registered charity A trust, society or institution that is registered by Charities Services under the Charities Act. This is not the same as trusts registered with the Ministry of Business Innovation & Employment under the Charitable Trust Act. Residual income tax Residual income tax is the amount payable for the year, after deducting any tax credits from income tax assessed, but before deducting any provisional tax paid. Taxable activity Any activity carried on continuously or regularly that supplies (or intends to supply) goods and services to others for some form of payment (but not necessarily for a profit) is a taxable activity. Businesses, trades and professions are all taxable activities. Charitable organisations of any type can carry on taxable activities. Setting up a business is part of the taxable activity, as is the closing down and sale of a business. Taxable activities do not include: • employment as a salary or wage-earner • hobby activities • the occasional sale of domestic or private assets • making GST-exempt supplies such as residential rent or financial services. Turnover Turnover is the total gross value of all goods and services supplied, excluding GST. It includes: • goods and services sold or provided in New Zealand • exported goods • grants or subsidies • non-monetary items received under barter arrangements. 10 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Charities Act The Charities Act 2005 established a Charities Commission, now known as Charities Services, who provide: • a registration and monitoring system for charitable organisations • support and education for the charitable sector on good governance and management. Charities Services has published A guide to the Charities Act, which you can download from charities.govt.nz or order a copy by calling 0508 242 748. Charities Services also set up a Charities Register. Registration is voluntary but, unregistered charities are not eligible for tax exemptions on the grounds of charitable purposes. Charitable organisations can apply for registration online at charities.govt.nz or by posting a completed application form, with a copy of their rules, to Charities Services. Send an officer certification form for each officer of the organisation. You can get details about registration and copies of forms from Charities Services at charities.govt.nz or by calling 0508 242 748. Turnover for GST purposes does not include: • GST-exempt goods and services • unconditional gifts received. See page 15 for the treatment of assets. Unconditional gift An unconditional gift is a donation or payment made voluntarily to any not-for-profit organisation, where there's no identifiable direct benefit to the donor or the donor's family. Some unconditional gifts can be: • donations or koha • money from door-to-door appeals and street collections • bequests • voluntary school fees (but not school activity fees). Subscriptions, payments from trading activities and payments made by the Crown or a public authority are not unconditional gifts for GST purposes. 11 ird.govt.nz Part 1 - Basic tax information Whatever type of charitable organisation you're setting up or running, you'll usually have some tax obligations. These may include: • making several tax payments each year - some of these may be for your organisation's own tax liability, others may be on behalf of its employees • filing various return forms each year - these may be for income tax, GST, PAYE and/or FBT • calculating the profit from any business to work out how much tax is due - this is explained in our Smart business - IR320 guide and there is also some information in Part 3 of this guide • keeping certain business records - see page 20 for more information on this. This part of the guide explains all these obligations and gives you other general tax information you need to know. Income tax Charitable organisations are liable for income tax if they are not within the meaning of a 'tax charity'. To be a tax charity means the organisation is either: • a registered charity, or • a non-resident charity that has been approved by Inland Revenue, or • a business carried on by, or for the benefit of a registered charity, for example a company which is fully owned by a tax charity. The business needs to be a registered charity to qualify. A charitable organisation is not exempt for income tax on business income applied for charitable purposes outside New Zealand - see page 28. Other benefits The Income Tax Act 2007 contains specific income tax exemptions for charities. Some of these exemptions give benefits to charitable organisations and some give benefits to people, certain companies, or Māori authorities who make donations to such organisations. The 'Tax benefits' section on page 22 of this guide gives more detail on these main conditions. It also covers other benefits available such as exemption from: • FBT (fringe benefit tax) on certain fringe benefits, and • RWT (resident withholding tax) on interest and dividends. 12 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS The Tax benefits section also covers any criteria and limitations to these exemptions. Your organisation may still be liable for other taxes, such as GST and PAYE. If your organisation is not entitled to any tax exemptions, it will be liable for income tax on some types of income it earns. Part 3 of this guide will help you work out which types of income are taxable. Income tax rates If a charitable organisation is incorporated under the Incorporated Societies Act 1908 or Companies Act 1993, then it's considered to be a company for income tax purposes. If it does not qualify for a tax exemption, its income is taxed at the company rate. Organisations that operate as trusts, including trusts incorporated under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and are not tax-exempt are liable for tax on trustee's income. Our guide Trusts and estates income tax rules - IR288 gives you more information about this. Charitable organisations not incorporated under a specific Act are treated as unincorporated charitable organisations. If such an organisation is not entitled to a tax exemption, it will be liable for income tax at the same rate as an individual taxpayer. However, it will not qualify for any of the tax credits that individual taxpayers can claim. For more information on individual and PAYE rates go to ird.govt.nz/tax-rates If a non-exempt organisation's residual income tax for a financial year is more than $5,000, it may have to pay provisional tax for the following year. For more information on provisional tax, read our guide Provisional tax - IR289 Filing income tax returns Generally, if your organisation is a tax charity, it's exempt from income tax. You do not need to file an income tax return unless we request one or you have income not covered by the exemption. You need to be registered by Charities Services to be eligible for an income tax exemption. If your organisation is not a tax charity or is a tax charity but receives non-exempt income, it will be required to file a return You must include a copy of the financial accounts or you can use our Schedule of business income - IR3B or Rental income - IR3R form to work out the gross income and allowable deductions for these activities. We also provide a Financial statements summary - IR10 form, which you can use instead of a set of accounts. Companies must file an IR4 tax return, estates or trusts must file an IR6 tax return, and any other society or association must file an IR 9 tax return. Returns can be filed along with your financial accounts (including IR3B, IR3R and IR10) in myIR. 13 ird.govt.nz If your organisation has a balance date between October and March, you must file your tax return to us by 7 July. For other approved balance dates (see page 21), file the return by the 7th day of the 4th month after your balance date. If a tax agent completes the return, we may extend the due date. This is because most tax agents have extensions of time for filing their clients' tax returns. GST (goods and services tax) GST is a 15% tax on the supply (sale) of most goods and services in New Zealand, most goods imported into New Zealand and some specified imported services. Supplying or making a supply is your taxable activity. Important GST changes ‘Tax invoice’ requirements replaced by ‘taxable supply information’ From 1 April 2023, the requirement to use tax invoices has been replaced by a more general requirement to provide and keep certain records known as taxable supply information. Taxable supply information refers to a minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. The taxable supply information required depends on the value and the type of supply and no longer needs to be in a single physical document, such as a tax invoice. Your transaction records, accounting systems and contractual documents may, in combination, contain all the information you need to support the figures in your GST returns. For more information about taxable supply information go to ird.govt.nz/gst or the GST guide - IR375. ‘Debit note’ and ‘credit note’ replaced by ‘supply correction information’ From 1 April 2023, debit and credit notes used to correct previously issued tax invoices, have been replaced with supply correction information. Supply correction information must be provided when the taxable supply information (for example, invoice) included an incorrect amount of GST, or when the seller has included an incorrect amount in their GST return for a taxable supply they have made. For more information about supply correction information go to ird.govt.nz/gst or the GST guide - IR375. 14 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Registering for GST You must register for GST if your income from your taxable activities (turnover), including certain imported services you receive: • was over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or • is expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. You can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. If you have not already registered for GST and need help deciding, use our guided help – Do I need to register for GST? If you are GST-registered you must collect GST and pay it to us. You can also claim back any GST on expenses you have as part of your business. A taxable activity is any activity continuously or regularly carried on by your charitable organisation that supplies, or intends to supply, goods and services to someone else for a consideration – it does not have to be an activity carried on with the intention of making a profit. To work out turnover, only include income liable for GST (including amounts which would be zero-rated). Do not include any income not liable for or exempt from GST. For example, include income from trading activities (both with members and non-members), subscriptions, grants and subsidies, but exclude income from donations, koha, bequests, residential rent, interest and dividends. You can register for GST online. To register for a myIR account visit ird.govt.nz/myir Registration of branches and divisions Generally, if an organisation operates through separate branches or divisions, they may each register separately for GST. If the total turnover of all the branches or divisions is more than $60,000 your organisation must register for GST. Not-for-profit organisations (including charitable organisations) may apply to us in writing to treat each branch or division separately, and only register the individual branches with a turnover of more than $60,000. However, branches with a turnover of less than $60,000 may still register voluntarily. To register separately, each branch or division must: • have its own independent accounting system, and • be separately identified by its location or by the different activities it undertakes. 15 ird.govt.nz Voluntary registration You can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. The advantage of voluntary registration is that charitable organisations may get frequent refunds of GST. This may happen when a charity runs a taxable activity and receives income liable for GST, but also receives donations or koha (unconditional gifts), which are not liable for GST. The charity can claim a GST credit for most of its expenses, but it only pays GST on its taxable activity income. However, charitable organisations need to be aware of the possible disadvantages of voluntary registration. • The organisation must provide and retain taxable supply information and file GST returns. • When you stop your registration, you must pay GST on the open (current) market value of any business assets you keep for private use. If you acquired the asset before 1 October 1986, the adjustment would be the lesser of cost price and the open market value. • Accounting for GST becomes difficult if non-liable income is involved, or if some assets are used for exempt purposes and others for business purposes. • If someone within the organisation completes the GST returns, there may be problems if that person's services become unavailable and their experience is lost. For more help You'll find more information on registering branches and divisions separately, or on voluntary registration, go to ird.govt.nz/register-for-gst-voluntarily GST and assets Generally, if you’re registered, GST can be claimed on the purchase of a business asset or for expenses relating to that asset. If you do claim GST on an asset or on expenses relating to that asset, you’ll have to pay GST on the sale of the asset or equivalent event such as an insurance pay out. For further information go to ird.govt.nz/gst 16 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Employing staff If your organisation employs staff, you must register as an employer. You can register online at ird.govt.nz/myir Your tax obligations as an employer are: • Ask new employees to fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330, which will tell you the tax code to use and the rate for deducting tax from their wages. If any employees do not fill in an IR330, you must deduct tax from their wages at the non-notified rate of 45% (not including employees' ACC earners' levy). • Ask new contractors who receive schedular payments to fill in a Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C, this tells you the rate of tax to deduct from their schedular payments. If any contractors do not provide you with an IR330C, you must deduct tax from their schedular payments at the non-notified rate. This rate is 20% for non-resident contractor companies, and 45% for all other contractors. You'll need to fill out a New employee details - IR346 form for each new employee and send it to us either: • before their first pay day; or • with the Employment information - IR348 form that includes their first pay. You’ll need their name, KiwiSaver status, IRD number, tax code and contact details. Include their date of birth if they have provided you with this information. After you submit your first Employment information - IR348, this information will be automatically shown on your subsequent IR348 forms. • Deduct PAYE from your employees' wages and pay it to us either once or twice a month, depending on the total amount of wages paid. PAYE includes the ACC earners' levy to cover the cost of employees' non-work injuries. • Complete an Employment information - IR348 form with details of the required deductions for each employee. You can file your IR348 electronically through myIR. • Pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) on any fringe benefits (perks) you give your employees - see page 18. • Deduct child support payments and student loan repayments from employees' wages if required. • Automatically enrol new employees who are eligible to join KiwiSaver and deduct their KiwiSaver contributions from their pay. • If you're making KiwiSaver employee deductions or employer contributions you need to send these to us with the PAYE. 17 ird.govt.nz • Pay employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) on any employer cash contributions made to a superannuation scheme. For more information on your obligations as an employer, see the Employer's guide - IR335 Employees and contractors If members in your organisation carry out paid work, they're treated as employees. PAYE must be deducted from the payments they receive. If your organisation gives board and lodging rather than money to any employees for their work, generally you must work out the gross value of the benefit given to them, calculate PAYE based on this amount and pay it to us - see the 'Allowances' section in the Employer's guide - IR335 Other benefits paid to replace wages may be liable for FBT - see page 17. An exception to this is for certain benefits received by members of religious orders - see page 29 for more information. PAYE deducted from your employees' wages does not belong to your organisation and it must not be used for anything other than payment to us. If a self-employed contractor does a job for the organisation, this generally does not make the organisation an employer. However, if the job is one of those listed on the back of the Tax rate notification for contractors - IR330C, you must deduct tax and pay this to us. You must also ask the contractor to complete the IR330C. If they've completed the IR330C and have chosen their own tax rate on page 1, deduct tax at that rate. Note: there are minimum tax rates that apply, refer to the Employer's guide - IR335 If they've completed the IR330C and have not chosen a tax rate, use the standard rate listed on the back of the IR330C. If the contractor shows you a current Certificate of exemption or is a company (not in the agricultural industry), you do not need to deduct tax. A certificate of exemption cannot apply to any payments made under a labour hire arrangement by a labour hire business. If the type of work done is not listed on the IR330C, you do not need to deduct tax as the contractor is responsible for paying the tax. Some workers call themselves self-employed contractors or something similar, so their employers will not deduct PAYE. If, as the employer, the organisation has control over the work done, including what the person does and how, and where it's done, the worker is almost certainly an employee and is liable for PAYE. It's illegal to treat a true employee as self-employed to avoid deducting tax. If you're not sure whether a worker is a true employee, read Part 1 of the Employer's guide - IR335 and our leaflet, Self-employed or an employee? - IR336 18 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Employer's superannuation cash contribution (employer contribution) An employer contribution is money paid by the employer to a superannuation fund, for the benefit of their employees. If your employees ask you to make deductions from their wages and pay them to a superannuation scheme, these are not employer contributions. Any employer contribution an employer makes to a superannuation fund for the benefit of an employee is liable for tax. There are several options for taxing these contributions - see the Employer's guide - IR335 for more information. A 'superannuation fund' is a scheme that has been registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. For more detailed information about superannuation fund contributions, refer to the Employer's guide - IR335 FBT (fringe benefit tax) Charitable organisations are generally exempt from paying FBT on any benefits provided to employees while they're carrying out the organisation's charitable activities. For example, if an employee has the use of a car while carrying out charitable work for the organisation, any private benefit arising is not subject to FBT. The exemption does not apply to any short-term charge facilities provided to employees of your charitable organisation above a certain threshold. This includes vouchers and store value cards, for example, petrol and supermarket voucher cards, Prezzy™ cards. For more information see Part 4 of our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 However, if your organisation operates a business which is outside its charitable, benevolent, cultural or philanthropic purposes and provides fringe benefits to any person employed in that business, FBT must be paid on those benefits. For example, if that business provides a car as part of a salary package, for use with its business activities, FBT must be paid on any private benefit. GST on fringe benefits If an organisation is registered for both GST and FBT, it must make an adjustment for GST in its FBT returns for fringe benefits provided (unless the benefits are GST-exempt or zero-rated). See Part 8 of our Fringe benefit tax guide - IR409 for more information. 19 ird.govt.nz Entertainment expenses If your organisation is not fully income tax exempt, only 50% of entertainment expenses that are not subject to FBT are deductible for income tax purposes. For more information, read our Entertainment expenses - IR268 guide. RWT (resident withholding tax) Charitable organisations registered with Charities Services are eligible for RWT exempt status. This means if your charitable organisation has money deposited in a bank or other financial institution, or has shares in a company, your organisation can receive interest or dividends without having RWT deducted. When Charities Services registers or deregisters an organisation as charitable, they inform us. We accept their decision and approve or cancel RWT exempt status. The IRD number of everyone with RWT exempt status is listed on the RWT exemption register on our website at ird.govt.nz/rwt-exemption Payers of investment income (for example, banks) access this register to confirm which of their customers are exempt from having RWT deducted. You may also like to tell anyone paying you interest or dividends about your exemption, so they stop deducting RWT. For more help Our Resident withholding tax on interest (RWT) payer's guide - IR283 has the information you'll need if your organisation pays interest and deducts RWT. NRWT (non-resident withholding tax) If your organisation pays interest, dividends, or royalties to a non-resident, this is called non- resident passive income and your organisation must deduct NRWT. For more information on NRWT go to ird.govt.nz/nrwt You can also contact our Non-resident Centre if you want to know more about the New Zealand tax residency rules for deducting and paying NRWT. For more help These guides will help if you have questions about residency or NRWT: • New Zealand tax residence - IR292 • NRWT - payer's guide - IR291 • Visitor's tax guide - IR294 20 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS General information Record keeping You must keep enough records to be able to calculate your organisation’s income, expenses, and tax liabilities and to enable us to confirm your accounts if required. Some records you must keep are: • invoices and receipts (taxable supply information if you are GST registered) • debit and credit notes (supply correction information if you are GST registered) • any other necessary documents to confirm your accounts • bank statements • stocktake figures for the end of the financial year • wage records for all employees, including Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax records • interest and dividend payment records • any donations you receive • how funds have been used within New Zealand or overseas. You must keep all records for 7 years, even if you cease operating (except for incorporated organisations that have been wound up and dissolved). All records must be in English or Māori unless you have written approval from us to use another language. If we request it, you should be able to fill in a tax return for your organisation and identify the source and end use of all its funds. It's important to keep all this information as we routinely audit these records. You can read more about audits on our website at ird.govt.nz/audits IRD numbers No matter what type of charitable organisation you're running, it will need an IRD number. The IRD number for GST, PAYE, FBT or RWT purposes. You’ll need your IRD number is also used for Charities Services when applying for charitable registration. To get an IRD number, you'll need to send us a completed IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 form. If you're incorporating a new company online through the Companies Office website, you can apply for an IRD number at the same time. Or, you can complete the IR596 form online, print, sign and send it to us. You'll need to provide a photocopy 21 ird.govt.nz of one of the following: • certificate of incorporation • deed of trust • certificate of registration. You must also supply the names, addresses and personal IRD numbers of each shareholder, director, trustee, or executive office holder. Balance dates For most customers, the accounting year ends on 31 March - the balance date. If you require a different balance date for your organisation other than 31 March, you must apply to us in writing, stating your reasons. We usually only approve a change if there are sound business reasons for doing so, or if your business activity is in an industry where there is a recognised balance date other than 31 March. Due dates Some organisations may have to file returns and make payments to us for several tax types. To keep track of the due dates for payments and returns, use the calculator on ird.govt.nz or our Tax due date calendar - IR328 22 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Part 2 - Tax benefits Tax legislation benefits charities by allowing them income tax exemptions. It also allows a tax credit or deduction for donations by individuals, companies or Māori authorities to donee organisations. Note that a charity may also be a donee organisation but will need to register with Charity Services to be one. If an organisation with charitable purposes is on Inland Revenue’s approved donee list, but is not registered with Charities Services, it will need to register by 1 April 2020 to retain its donee status. This part of the guide explains how these benefits work and the conditions an organisation must meet to get a particular benefit. Charities To qualify for an exemption from income tax, trustees of a trust must derive income for charitable purposes, and societies or institutions must be established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes. A charitable purpose is where the rules of an organisation clearly state that its purposes are for one or more of the following: • the relief of poverty • the advancement of education • the advancement of religion • any other matters that are beneficial to the community. The organisation's aims must also be for a public purpose except where they are for the relief of poverty. The benefit must be available to a large part of the community and the activities must not result in the private benefit or profit of any individual. You'll find further information about charitable purposes on the Charities Services website at charities.govt.nz 23 ird.govt.nz Income tax for charities Non-business (investment) income Registered charities are exempt from income tax on non-business income such as interest, dividends and rents. They may use the non-business income for charitable purposes in and outside New Zealand and still keep the income tax exemption. Business income The portion of a registered charity's business income which is used for charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt from income tax. If an organisation uses its business income for charitable purposes outside New Zealand as well, only the New Zealand part is exempt. Business income will not be exempt if anyone connected with the charitable organisation: • receives or can receive any type of benefit or income from the organisation, and • can determine or influence the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. Page 28 has more details about the limitations to this exemption. These exemptions only apply to the charitable organisation's income. They do not apply to any other earned income passed on to a charitable organisation for charitable purposes. The people or organisation who earned the income must pay tax on it. However, the gifting of this income may qualify for a donation tax credit or deduction - see page 26. Income derived from a business carried on by, or for, or for the benefit of a charitable organisation is exempt from income tax. From 1 April 2020 to qualify for or retain this exemption the business will need to register with Charities Services in its own right. It will no longer be sufficient that the income is for the benefit of a registered charitable organisation. Non-resident charities Non-resident charities that only carry out charitable purposes outside New Zealand may not be able to be registered with Charities Services because they: • are not established in New Zealand, and • do not have a strong connection with New Zealand. In these circumstances we may be able to approve an income tax exemption for non-business income if the entity meets certain criteria. You can find out more about the criteria and the application process at ird.govt.nz/non-resident-charities 24 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Non-resident charities with business income used to carry out charitable purposes in New Zealand must be registered with Charities Services to be eligible for an income tax exemption on that income. This exemption covers both business and non-business income used for charitable purposes in New Zealand, but not business income applied overseas. Charitable estates The executor or administrator of a deceased person's estate may derive income from any money or assets left to charitable organisations while the will is being finalised. If the organisation benefiting from the will is entitled to an income tax exemption, the income derived while the funds are held awaiting finalisation is also exempt. This exemption only covers the income derived from the money or assets of the estate that have been left to the charity. The estate must still pay tax on any income it earns from other assets or money. If the trustees want to confirm their tax exemption they need to send us, during that intervening period, a copy of the deceased's will and the following details: • details of any charity that will receive gifts under the will and the amount they will receive • the rights of the various beneficiaries under the will • the net value (after debts and liabilities) of the estate available to be distributed to the beneficiaries • the shares and the prospective shares of the beneficiaries in the income and assets of the estate. Gift duty Gift duty was repealed for gifts made after 1 October 2011. If your organisation needs information on the tax implications for gifts made before this date, then you can contact us for further information. Donee organisations When an organisation is considered a donee organisation for tax purposes, any gifts of money it receives from individuals, Ma ̄ ori authorities and certain companies, qualify for tax advantages. You will need to apply to Inland Revenue for approval to become a donee organisation. See pages 26 and 27 for more information on these tax benefits. An organisation does not have to be a registered charity to be eligible for donee organisation status. However, from 1 April 2020 if the organisation has only charitable purposes it must register as a charity to obtain donee status. 25 ird.govt.nz A donee organisation must be a New Zealand society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund. Its funds must be applied wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. This means that the organisation's aims or purposes should be carried out in New Zealand, even if this results in paying money outside New Zealand to achieve these purposes. Inland Revenue administers the 'wholly or mainly' requirement on a 'safe harbour' basis of '75% or more'. This means Inland Revenue will generally accept that an organisation meeting or exceeding the safe harbour percentage of 75% has wholly or mainly applied funds to specified purposes within New Zealand. This applies to and from the 2019/20 income year. For more information, see our Interpretation Statement IS 18/05 Income tax – donee organisations and its accompanying fact sheet on applying the 'safe harbour' approach. These can be found at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/safe-harbour The safe harbour percentage is relevant only if the organisation applies funds to purposes that are not specified purposes within New Zealand. Cultural purposes include dramatic, theatrical, operatic, ballet, choral or musical purposes. Benevolent and philanthropic purposes basically mean doing good for other people. This includes organisations that are not charitable in the strict legal sense, but are popularly seen as charitable, for example, organisations whose proceeds or funds are used to benefit all or a large part of the public. Another condition is that the organisation must not be carried on for the private benefit of any member or an associate of any member. Charities that apply the principal part or all of their funds outside New Zealand must be approved for donee organisation status by Parliament. Approval is limited to organisations whose funds are mainly used for: • the relief of poverty, hunger, sickness or the results of war or natural disaster • the economy of developing countries (as recognised by the United Nations) • raising the educational standards of a developing country. Inland Revenue considers these applications and makes a recommendation to government. Organisations that are approved are listed in the Income Tax Act. A donee organisation is still liable for income tax on any taxable income it earns from sources outside its own membership if it has no other income tax exemption. There are government guidelines for organisations seeking charitable donee status for their overseas activities. For information on the guidelines go to ird.govt.nz/overseas-donee-status 26 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Donation tax credit or deduction Gifts of money by individuals Individuals who give cash donations of $5 or more to donee organisations may claim a tax credit of one-third (33.33%) of the total of all donations, up to the amount of their taxable income. To qualify for this tax credit: • the gift must be made in money - gifts of goods or property do not qualify • the gift cannot be made under the will of a deceased person • each gift must be $5 or more. However, gifts can still qualify for a tax credit if an arrangement is in place to make a gift of under $5 through regular instalments throughout the year, and the total at the end of the year is $5 or more (for example, if you give $1 each week to your church, making the total contribution for the year $52). Where an employer offers payroll giving, they must make sure all donations are passed to the requested donee organisations. This must be done by the PAYE payment due date closest to the end of the two months from the last day of the pay period when the donation was deducted from their employee's wage. When receipts are issued by the donee organisation they should be in the employer's name and state the donation was made under the payroll giving scheme. The employee does not receive a receipt from the donee as they receive a tax credit reducing their PAYE at the time the donation was deducted from their wages. Gifts of money by certain companies A company (including an unlisted close company), can claim a donation deduction for cash donations it makes to donee organisations. A 'close company' is one that has five or fewer shareholders. The maximum donation deduction that can be claimed is limited to the company's net income (that is, income, less expenses, but before the donation deduction is deducted). For more on tax credits on gifts and donations go to ird.govt.nz/donations Gift of money by Māāori aauthorities A Māori authority may claim a deduction against its net income for cash donations it makes to a Māori association or a donee organisation. The maximum deduction allowed is limited by the Māori authority's net income (that is, income less expenses, but before the donation deduction is deducted). 27 ird.govt.nz Receipts Please provide the donor with a receipt that contains: 1. An official stamp or letterhead and the full name of the organisation. Where the local organisation is part of a larger group or organisation, please provide clear reference to this on the receipt. For example, 'Relief of Poverty Foundation, Wellington Branch'. 2. The following identifiers for the organisation: a) the DIA-Charities Services registration number, and b) its IRD number 3. A clear statement that the amount received is a donation. Exclude membership subscriptions or fees, purchases of goods or services and raffle tickets as they do not qualify for donation tax credits. Where the donation is stock or other goods, the receipt must clearly indicate that it was not a cash donation as they do not qualify for donation tax credits. 4. The full name of the donor and their address if held 5. The full amount and date of the donation (or if there were regular payments throughout the year you may show the total amount for the income year ending 31 March) 6. The full name, designation (for example, Treasurer, Secretary), and signature of an authorised person 7. A receipt number, unique to each receipt. Make sure the organisation: • keeps copies of all receipts issued for seven years. We may wish to inspect or verify issued receipts • does not use correction fluid on or cross out details and write corrections on receipts. Just cancel the incorrect receipt, ensure the donor’s incorrect copy is returned and noted as cancelled in the organisation’s records. Then redo a correct receipt for the donor and your records. • Treasurers and officers should not authorise or sign their own receipts or those relating to their immediate family. • Keep the contact details of authorised persons that oversee donations, such as the secretary or treasurer, up-to-date, as we may wish to contact them to verify receipts.

For more information go to ird.govt.nz Eligibility for exemption or donee organisation status Charities registered with Charities Services You do not need to apply to Inland Revenue to confirm your income tax-exempt status. When you register as a charity, as long as they have your IRD number, Charities Services will pass on the details to us so you will not need to contact us separately. In most cases, charities with non-business income only, which are registered with Charities Services, will be eligible for the exemptions. Registered charities carrying out a business will need to consider some limitations and exceptions to the exemption, (summarised on pages 28-31), and self-determine their tax position. These details will also show if you're applying for donee organisation status. We'll decide about your status based on this information, and advise you in writing. This is a valuable document for your organisation so keep a copy in a safe place. For more information on tax exemption go to ird.govt.nz/charity-services Basic necessities for members of religious organisations If certain conditions are met, a member of a religious society or order can be provided with board, lodging and/or basic personal necessities, and receive these tax exempt. This only applies when the member is unpaid, their only occupation is service in that religious society or order, and it is the nature of the service that members are not paid or rewarded for their work. For more information on this tax exemption, go to ird.govt.nz/exempt-income- religious-organisations Not registered with Charities Services From 1 April 2020 all organisations with charitable purposes will need to be registered with Charities Services to be considered for donee status. If your organisations has benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes but not charitable purposes, and you want us to consider you as a donee organisation, send us: • an up-to-date, signed copy of your rules, constitution, trust deed or other founding document • a copy of your certificate of incorporation (if incorporated) 29 ird.govt.nz • a letter requesting donee status • details of how the organisation has been (or will be) operating. We'll consider your application and let you know in writing. The criteria that we  look at for donee status is summarised on the following pages. Inland Revenue's criteria There are some specific requirements for your organisation to have donee organisation status and for charities claiming the income tax exemption on business income. In addition to Inland Revenue's rules, your governing document needs to contain certain rules and clauses to register as a charity. For information about the registration criteria go to Charities Services website charities.govt.nz or call 0508 242 748. Personal benefits A donee organisation's funds cannot be used to provide personal benefit to its members, trustees or associates. Sometimes the aims or powers may allow benefits to members, but they may only benefit to a limited extent from their membership. Some acceptable benefits are newsletters that do not require a subscription, voting rights to appoint officers of the organisation and any benefit also available to the general public. If any member can receive more than these benefits, the organisation cannot be considered as a donee organisation. Also, if a member can in any way influence the amount of any benefit they receive, the organisation will not qualify as a donee organisation. The organisation may pay members for their services, as long as the payments are reasonable, not more than normal commercial rates and for services actually provided. A member may also be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred on the organisation's behalf and earn interest on money lent to the organisation (provided the loan is at a normal commercial rate). If an organisation's rules allow unrestricted benefits to members, a clause preventing this must be added before we'll grant donee organisation status. An example of such a clause is: " (1) All income, benefit, or advantage must be used to advance the charitable purposes of the organisation (2) No member of the organisation, or anyone associated with a member, is allowed to take part in, or influence any decision made by the organisation in respect of payments to, or on behalf of, the member or associated person of any income, benefit, or advantage. 30 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS (3) Any payments made must be for goods or services that advance the charitable purpose and must be reasonable and relative to payments that would be made between unrelated parties (4) The provisions and effect of this clause shall not be removed from this document and shall be included and implied in any document replacing this document." Altering the rules An organisation may change its rules, constitution or trust deed through a rule alteration clause. To qualify as a donee organisation, this must be worded so any clauses dealing with purposes, benefit to members and winding up cannot be changed so that they would affect the requirements for donee organisation status. If the rule alteration clause is not restricted, we will not grant donee organisation status. The following is a suitable restriction (proviso) for a rule alteration clause: 'No addition to or alteration or removal of the rules shall be approved if it detracts from or alters the nature of the organisation'. If the organisation is a registered charity or intending to register it will not need a proviso (as above) because all alterations must be sent to Charities Services to comply with the Charities Act. Purposes limited to New Zealand An organisation seeking donee organisation status must be a society, association, or trust that applies its funds wholly or mainly in New Zealand to promote charitable, benevolent, philanthropic and cultural purposes. If your organisation applies funds for purposes both within and outside New Zealand we advise you to record these separately in your accounts. Any funds applied overseas will not qualify for a tax credit or deduction unless your organisation has been approved as a donee organisation. Some organisations (such as overseas charities) apply all or most of their general funds outside New Zealand. If the organisation sets up a separate fund for use in New Zealand it may qualify as a donee organisation. Winding up If an organisation's rules or constitution allows it to be wound up, the winding-up clause must prevent the funds or assets from passing to a private purpose. This means the rules for a donee organisation must have a clause stating that, on winding up, the income and assets will be held for charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes in New Zealand. 31 ird.govt.nz When a donee organisation is wound up, any remaining income and assets must be distributed to an organisation that carries on activities wholly or mainly in New Zealand. The organisation receiving the distribution may be either a donee organisation or a charity. However, if the donee organisation is a registered charity the clause must state that, on winding up, the income and assets must be used for charitable purposes in New Zealand. Business activity Only the business income of a registered charity used for charitable purposes in New Zealand is exempt from tax. Any business income used overseas is liable for income tax. It will also be liable if anyone connected to the organisation: • receives or can receive any type of benefit or income from the organisation, and • can determine or influence the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. However, there are two situations when an organisation may pay someone connected with it (or provide other benefits) without losing its exemption. If the person: • is reimbursed on a reasonable basis for expenses incurred on behalf of the organisation • lends money to the organisation, it may pay interest at normal commercial rates. A person who provides services to the organisation as part of their professional practice cannot influence or determine the nature or amount of any benefit they receive. The Public Trustee, the Māori Trustee and any trustee company are deemed to be carrying on business as a professional public practice. A person is considered connected to a charitable organisation carrying on a business if they are: • the settlor or trustee of a trust • a shareholder or director of a company • a settlor or trustee of a trust who is a shareholder of the company • an associated person of any of these people. There are two further examples where an exemption does not apply. • If someone transfers an asset to a trust but retains an interest in the asset, they're considered to be a settlor of the trust and to be gaining a benefit. • If a person connected to the organisation transfers an asset to the organisation but retains an interest in the asset. If the organisation uses the asset to earn rental income, the person will be considered to be receiving a benefit since they still have an interest in the asset. 32 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Part 3 - Income Charitable organisations can receive many types of income, including subscriptions, grants, subsidies, donations or koha, fees, raffle money, trading profits and proceeds from selling assets. Some grants made to not-for-profit organisations fall within the meaning of an unconditional gift or donation (see page 10) especially if given by a tax charity. These are not liable for GST. If you're not sure please contact us to discuss. The table on page 35 shows whether the different types of income are liable for: • income tax (for organisations not entitled to an exemption), and • GST (for those organisations registered for GST). You'll notice that income 'exempt from GST' is different from income that's 'not liable for GST'. This is important when working out your claim for GST input tax credits on goods and services bought to run your organisation. GST-registered not-for-profit organisations (including charities) may claim input tax credits on expenses incurred in deriving income that's either liable or not liable for GST, but not in deriving income that is exempt from GST. Example A GST-registered charitable organisation receives income from: a government grantliable for GST trading activitiesliable for GST donationsnot liable for GST renting a residential property exempt from GST The charitable organisation can claim a GST input tax credit for all the expenses except those incurred in deriving the rent, which is exempt from GST. Income exempt from GST includes: • income from financial services, including interest from banks and dividends from public companies • proceeds made by a not-for-profit organisation from selling goods and services that were donated to it • rent received from residential accommodation. 33 ird.govt.nz Table of income types Liable for income tax if no tax exemption applies  Not liable for income tax Liable for GST Not liable for GST Exempt from GST Subscriptions   Donations  †  Koha  †  Bequests  Grants   Unconditional gifts  Subsidies  \* Suspensory loans  Trading activities  Raffles or housie proceeds  \* Admission fees  Affiliation fees  Receipt of stock and donated goods  \* Sale of donated goods or services  \* Sale of purchased goods  Sale of assets or equipment   Insurance receipts   \* Hall or equipment hire  Rent received (residential)  Rent received (commercial)  Penalty payments (fines)  Advertising or sponsorship  Interest or dividends  Gaming machines  \* Liable in certain situations † Donations and koha may be taxable income, depending on the circumstances of the payment. See our Interpretation statement IS 23/11 Income tax: Income - when gifts are assessable income for more information  Registered charities are generally exempt from income tax for both business and non-business income. There are some limitations to this. See pages 23 and 28-32 for more information. 34 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Part 4 - Charity deregistration There are a number of different reasons a charity may be deregistered. The reason will determine the date of deregistration and the tax treatment of the charity from this date. A charity can be deregistered from the Charities Register by: • voluntary deregistration or • Charities Services deregisters it. From 6 April 2016 the tax treatment that applies to a deregistered charity also applies to non- registered charities that stop meeting the specific exemption in section CW 42(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for business income. For more information on the tax treatment of charities that deregister or charities that stop meeting the business income tax exemption go to ird.govt.nz/charitable-organisations Voluntary deregistration A voluntary deregistration is when the charity requests Charities Services to remove them from their register. This can occur when either the charity has: • ceased and is winding up, or • not ceased but no longer operates as a charitable organisation. From 14 April 2014, a charity's voluntary deregistration date will be the day it's removed from the charities register. Deregistered by Charities Services Charities Services will deregister a charity which has failed to comply with the Charities Act 2005. From 1 April 2015 the date of deregistration will be based on the type of non-compliance that occurred as follows: If the charity...the date of deregistration will be... never acted in accordance with its constitution backdated to the start date stopped acting in accordance with its constitution from the date of the change did not file an annual return.from the date Charities Services removes it from the register. 35 ird.govt.nz Court proceedings/appeals If the charity is involved in court proceedings or appealing a decision to deregister it for any of the above reasons, it will be deregistered on the date when all court proceedings or appeals are finished or exhausted. Entities not registered with Charities Services From 6 April 2016 the deregistration tax rules also apply to a non-registered Charity that stops meeting the specific exemption in section CW 42(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 for their business income. Because the deregistration date does not apply to these entities, the references to 'date of deregistration' below need to be read as the date the charity no longer meets the requirements for an income tax exemption. Tax treatment The charity will have one year from the date of deregistration to either: • Reregister as a charity, or • dispose of or transfer any assets (including accumulated income) less liabilities to a registered charity or a New Zealand tax-exempt entity. If the charity does not do this, for example if they keep assets or they transfer assets to an overseas charity, income tax will be payable on the net assets one year from the date of deregistration. From 1 April 2019, small charities with net assets of $10,000 or less do not pay deregistration tax. Charities with over $10,000 net assets are required to pay tax on the total value of the net assets (including the first $10,000). There are certain adjustments to exclude certain assets. For example the charity can make an adjustment for any assets, other than money, donated to the charity while it was registered. You make the adjustment by: • taking the entity’s assets (less liabilities) on the end date • less: – assets disposed of or transferred to a registered charity or a New Zealand tax-exempt entity within one year of the deregistration date – the value of any assets, other than money, donated to the charity while it was registered • record the resulting value of assets in the entity’s income tax return for the period that includes the day one year after the charity was deregistered (or stopped meeting the criteria for its charitable income tax exemption). 36 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Example: $10,000 and under net assets Charity One’s date of deregistration is 1 July 2019. Its balance sheet at 1 July 2019 is shown below. AssetsLiabilities Cash $ 50Loan $ 200 Inventory $ 500Organisations Equity $ 350 The income calculation will be: • Assets $550 less liabilities $200 equals net assets of $350 As deregistration is after 1 April 2019 and net assets are not more than $10,000 no income arises. Example: Assets over $10,000 Charity D’s date of deregistration is 1 July 2019. It’s balance sheet at 1 July 2019 is shown below. AssetsLiabilities Cash $ 10,500Loan $ 200 Inventory $ 500Equity Land (donated) $ 3,000Organisations equity $ 13,150 One year later no assets have been disposed of or transferred to a registered charity or a New Zealand tax-exempt entity. The income calculation will be: • assets $14,000 less $200 liabilities equals $13,800 • less the value of the (donated) land 3,000 = $10,800. The de-registered Charity D will include $10,800 as income for tax purposes. 37 ird.govt.nz How to calculate the value of an asset or financial arrangement Example: Depreciable property Charity A registered as a charitable entity in 2013. That same year, it bought office furniture for $50,000 (GST-exclusive) during the first month of the 2013 tax year. In 2018, Charities Services deregistered it because it has not complied with its constitution since registering. Charity A still owned the office furniture at the date of deregistration so it must file an income tax return for each year starting from the 2013 year. The value of the cost of premises, plant and equipment at the 'date of cessation' must be depreciated, under the general tax rules, for each year it is used in Charity A's business. Using the depreciation rate of 19.2%, the cost of office furniture for each year from 2013 to the present day is: Year201320142015201620172018 Opening value ($)50,00040,40032,64326,37621,31217,220 Depreciation 9,600 7,757 6,267 5,064 4,092 3,306 Year-end balance ($)40,40032,64326,37621,31217,22013,914 Charity A's assets are worth $50,000 and it applies depreciation of $9,600 in its 2013 income tax return. 38 CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS AND DONEE ORGANISATIONS Example: Financial arrangement Charity A lent $100,000 to B in 2013. The loan was repayable on demand and the annual interest rate was 10% (compounding). No loan repayments were made. Charity A must account for this loan under the financial arrangement rules in each of the years it had ceased to meet the requirements of being a charity. It must also calculate an opening value using this formula: Consideration paid to person + expenditure - consideration paid by person - income Consideration paid to person is the amount paid to the person before the date the charity ceased. Expenditure is the amount incurred under the financial arrangement rules before the date the charity ceased. Consideration paid by the person is the amount repaid before the date the charity ceased. Income is the amount that would have been derived under the financial arrangement rules before the date the charity ceased. Charity A calculates the loan as follows: Year201320142015201620172018 Opening value ($) 100,000110,000121,000133,100146,410161,051 Interest ($)10,00011,00012,10013,31014,64116,105 Year-end balance ($) 110,000121,000133,100146,410161,051177,156 In 2013 the opening value would be $100,000 and the closing value would be $110,000. Charity A accounts for $10,000 accrued interest income in its 2013 income tax return. 39 ird.govt.nz FBT When the deregistered charity is no longer eligible for the FBT exemption, the FBT rules will apply from the date of deregistration as explained earlier. A charity that has deregistered voluntarily will lose their FBT exemption from the date it's removed from the charities register. It will be liable for FBT for the return period from this date onwards. A charity that did not comply with their constitution will lose its FBT exemption from the date of non-compliance and FBT will apply for the return period from this date. Community housing entity Where a community housing entity no longer meets the requirements of being a charity and is deregistered from the charities register, it may be able to apply for an income tax exemption.

Foreign superannuation scheme - a savings plan, sometimes called a pension or retirement plan created outside New Zealand, to accumulate funds for retirement. The scheme is often set up through an employer, trade union or insurance company. On retirement it's paid out as a lump sum, pension or both. It doesn't include an arrangement set up under another country's social security law to provide retirement benefits resembling New Zealand Superannuation. A life insurance policy is generally not classed as a foreign superannuation scheme. Instead, you'll need to apply the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules to work out your tax obligations for your foreign life insurance policy. For more information about your obligations under the FIF rules see A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461). Foreign superannuation withdrawal - an amount received from a foreign superannuation scheme that is not a pension or annuity. This includes: • a cash withdrawal • a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand superannuation scheme • a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme outside Australia into an Australian superannuation scheme • a withdrawal from a foreign superannuation scheme to reinvest as an interest of another person in a superannuation scheme. In some circumstances, it may exclude transfers on the death of a partner or under a relationship property agreement following a relationship split. Grandparenting - where you have correctly applied the FIF rules to your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme in an income tax return lodged before 20 May 2013 and continue to do this for all income years after 1 April 2014. Pension - a regular payment, generally from a foreign superannuation scheme or pension fund, when you reach retirement age. www.ird.govt.nz 5 Permanent place of abode - to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand there must be a place where you usually live or could live in New Zealand, ie a house or other dwelling. If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, all of your ties and links with New Zealand need to be considered to decide whether it's your permanent place of abode. The types of ties that are relevant are: • whether you make trips back to New Zealand and for how long • your past use of the dwelling in New Zealand • family and social ties • employment, economic and property ties • whether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live (and if you do, when). If you have strong ties to New Zealand it's likely you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, but all of your circumstances need to be considered. Social security pension - an income entitlement generally based on citizenship or residence and administered or paid by the government or state of a particular jurisdiction. For example, the State Pension in the United Kingdom (UK) and New Zealand Superannuation in New Zealand. Taxable income - income you have to pay tax on. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 6 Introduction This guide explains your tax responsibilities if you have an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme, or you receive an overseas periodic pension. It doesn't explain your tax obligations if you have an overseas social security pension. For more information see our Overseas social security pensions (IR258) guide. If you're a New Zealand tax resident, you're generally taxed only on the payments or transfers from the scheme. In some cases you may be taxed annually on the increase in value of your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. You'll find information in this guide on: • working out if you're a New Zealand tax resident • whether you'll have to pay tax on the value of your investment, on lump-sum withdrawals and transfers (known as "foreign superannuation withdrawals"), or on the pension payments • how a New Zealand double tax agreement could affect your tax • whether you can claim a tax credit in your New Zealand tax return for tax paid overseas. Are you a New Zealand tax resident? If you're a New Zealand tax resident, you generally have to include your worldwide income in your New Zealand tax return, unless that income is exempt under our tax laws. This includes your foreign superannuation scheme (sometimes known as an overseas pension scheme or retirement plan). You're a New Zealand tax resident if: • you have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand, or • you've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and not become a non-resident, or • you're away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government. If you're a New Zealand tax resident, you become a non-resident for tax purposes if: • you no longer have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, and • you're away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period. These don't have to be consecutive days and part-days are counted as full days of presence in New Zealand. www.ird.govt.nz 7 For more information on tax residency go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: tax residency) for: • the Tax Residence Interpretation Statement IS16/03, and • the New Zealand tax residence (IR292) guide. Have you recently moved to New Zealand? If you're a new migrant or a returning New Zealander you may qualify to be a transitional resident. This means you're exempt from paying tax on most of your overseas income for a temporary period. You're a transitional resident if: • you've qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and • you're a new migrant or a returning New Zealander, who hasn't been resident for tax purposes for at least 10 years before arriving in New Zealand, and • neither you nor your partner are receiving Working for Families Tax Credits, and • you haven't been a transitional resident at all before. Where these conditions are met, you're a transitional resident and the exemption starts for you on the first day you're a tax resident. It ends 48 months after the month you meet the requirements for being a New Zealand tax resident. The tax exemption is automatically granted if you qualify. You can elect not to be a transitional resident. You can read about the four-year exemption period for foreign superannuation withdrawals (page 12). For more information on the temporary tax exemption for transitional residents go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: temporary tax exemption). OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 8 How we tax your foreign superannuation scheme From 1 April 2014, the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules generally no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes that are acquired while the holder isn't a New Zealand tax resident. This includes New Zealand tax residents which tie break towards a country New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA). For more information on the tie breaker tests of a DTA go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: tax residency) for: • the Tax Residence Interpretation Statement IS16/03, and • the New Zealand tax residence (IR292) guide. Interests in foreign superannuation schemes are taxed when you withdraw a lump sum or transfer your interest to a New Zealand or Australian scheme, or when you receive a pension from the scheme. This section explains your tax obligations on lump-sum withdrawals or transfers from a foreign superannuation scheme made: • from 1 April 2014, or • prior to 1 April 2014 if you didn't comply with the tax rules that applied at the time. For more information about how we tax periodic pensions see page 22. Using the FIF rules from 1 April 2014 In some cases you must, or may, apply the FIF rules in relation to your interest in the foreign superannuation scheme. Distributions are considered under the FIF rules, so you don't pay tax again when you receive a payment or make a transfer. For more information about your obligations under the FIF rules go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR461) for A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461). www.ird.govt.nz 9 If you're a New Zealand tax resident when you first join the scheme If you're a New Zealand tax resident, or treated as a New Zealand tax resident under a DTA, when you first join a foreign superannuation scheme, you need to consider the New Zealand FIF rules. This is regardless of whether you acquired your rights in the scheme before or after 1 April 2014. If you do not have FIF income or FIF loss because your interest in all FIFs is below the de minimis threshold of $50,000, you need to apply the new schedule method (page 11). For more information about your obligations under the FIF rules and the de minimis threshold go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR461) for A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461). Grandparenting rules If your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme was first acquired while you were a non-tax resident and you correctly applied the FIF rules to it in a tax return lodged before 20 May 2013, you can: 1. continue to apply the FIF rules to that interest, or 2. apply the new rules (refer to "schedule and formula tax methods" on page 11). You must meet the following criteria in each income year you want to apply the FIF rules to a particular foreign superannuation interest, for all income years from 1 April 2014: • you must have had an attributing interest in a FIF for an income year ending before 1 April 2014. This is the "qualifying year". For that qualifying year: –you must have calculated your FIF income or loss arising from that attributing interest under one of the approved methods, and –included that FIF income or loss in a tax return filed with Inland Revenue before 20 May 2013, and • from the end of the qualifying year to the beginning of the current year, (the "qualifying period") you must have: –continued to hold the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme, and –calculated your FIF income or loss from your interest for all income years, and –returned it in all tax returns for income years in the qualifying period. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 10 The criteria are applied on an interest-by-interest basis, so you may be grandparented for one interest but not another. To remain grandparented, you must continue to return FIF income or losses for your grandparented interest in all future income years. If you do this, any future distributions from your scheme won't be taxed. If you don't correctly return FIF income or losses for an income year during which you still hold the interest, that interest ceases to be grandparented. Any subsequent lump-sum withdrawals or transfers will be taxed under the new foreign superannuation scheme tax rules as a foreign superannuation withdrawal (ie, under the schedule method or formula method) or when you receive a periodic pension. In this situation you won't get any credit for the tax you've paid under the FIF rules. www.ird.govt.nz 11 Schedule and formula tax methods In most cases you'll pay income tax when you receive a foreign superannuation withdrawal unless you qualify for an exemption. There are two methods available to you from 1 April 2014 to tax this income: • The schedule method - this is the default method. Using this method means a certain portion of your foreign superannuation withdrawal will be income and is based on the number of years you've been a New Zealand tax resident. • The formula method - this is an alternative to the schedule method and can be used if your foreign superannuation scheme is a defined contribution scheme and certain other requirements are met. It taxes the actual investment gains that have accrued to your scheme while you've been a New Zealand tax resident. These two methods are generally only available if you acquired your interest in the foreign superannuation scheme while you were a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes. If you were a New Zealand tax resident when you first acquired the interest see page 8. Calculating your assessable income using either method requires you to calculate your assessable period (page 13). A transfer of your foreign superannuation interest from one scheme into another non-Australian foreign superannuation scheme isn't a foreign superannuation withdrawal and so it's not taxed at that point. It will affect how your assessable period is calculated. Note In some circumstances, a transfer of a foreign superannuation interest from one New Zealand tax resident (the transferor) to another (the recipient) isn't taxed. This happens when: • the transferor first acquired the interest while a non-resident, and • the transferor and recipient were married or in a relationship, and • the transfer occurs: –following the death of the transferor, or OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 12 –under a relationship agreement resulting from a relationship split. This will affect how your assessable period is calculated. Note that insurance policies generally don't fall within the meaning of a superannuation scheme, so the schedule and formula methods don't apply to foreign life insurance policies. Instead, you'll need to apply the FIF rules to your foreign life insurance policy. For more information about your obligations under the FIF rules go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: ir461) for A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate (IR461). Four-year exemption period for foreign superannuation withdrawals The four-year exemption period is similar to the transitional resident tax exemption and applies to foreign superannuation withdrawals received during the period. If you qualify for a four-year exemption period, a foreign superannuation withdrawal received during this period is exempt from New Zealand tax. If you qualify for a four-year exemption period and receive a foreign superannuation withdrawal after your exemption period: • the schedule method ignores your years of residence during the exemption period • the formula method doesn't tax the gains that have accrued to your scheme during the exemption period. The exemption doesn't require a person to be a non-tax resident for a minimum period. The exemption period is available to both new migrants and returning New Zealanders. This exemption applies if you: • first acquired an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, and • haven't previously had this exemption. The exemption starts on the first day you're a New Zealand tax resident. It finishes 48 months after the month you first meet the requirements for being a New Zealand tax resident, by either having a permanent place of abode or by being in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period. The exemption also ends if you become a non-tax resident. www.ird.govt.nz 13 The timing is the same as the transitional resident tax exemption. You'll still qualify for this exemption if you cease to be a transitional resident because you receive Working for Families Tax Credits, or if you don't meet the requirements to qualify as a transitional resident. Calculating your assessable period Your assessable period starts when your exemption period ends, eg if the last day of your exemption period is 30 September, the first day of your assessable period is 1 October. If you don't have an exemption period, your assessable period starts on the first day you're a New Zealand tax resident with an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. Your assessable period ends when you receive your foreign superannuation withdrawal. It doesn't include any periods of non-tax residence. If you transferred your interest from one foreign superannuation scheme (scheme A) into a non-Australian foreign superannuation scheme (scheme B), there's no tax on that transfer. If you then transfer to a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme (this means you receive a foreign superannuation withdrawal from scheme B), your assessable period starts on the same day as your assessable period for scheme A. If your scheme interest came from your previous partner because they died or as part of a relationship agreement following a relationship split, and the transfer wasn't taxable at the time, then your assessable period starts on the same day as their assessable period for that interest. The schedule method This method uses set percentages that represent the proportion of your foreign superannuation withdrawal which you'll need to include as assessable income in your income tax return. The schedule year percentages increase with the number of years you're a tax resident in New Zealand. The rest of your foreign superannuation withdrawal not deemed to be assessable income is exempt from New Zealand tax, and is not included in your income tax return. Calculate your assessable income for the schedule method as follows: (superannuation withdrawal − contributions left) × schedule year % OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 14 Put the amount of your foreign superannuation withdrawal in the "superannuation withdrawal" part of the formula. What are "contributions left"? If the contributions you've made while you've been a New Zealand tax resident satisfy all the following conditions, you may be allowed a deduction for these contributions: • You must be a New Zealand tax resident and treated as a New Zealand tax resident under all applicable double tax agreements when the contributions are made. • They must be made by you, your employer, or for your benefit. • They are required under the rules of your foreign superannuation scheme. • They're subject to employer superannuation contribution tax or fringe benefit tax if they're made by your employer. A given contribution may only be deducted once, and only the contributions made during the assessable period that fit the above criteria can be deducted. Insert the amount of contributions that satisfy all of these requirements in the "contributions left" part of the formula. This amount can't be greater than the amount of your foreign superannuation withdrawal. Calculating the "schedule years" To get the appropriate "schedule year %" calculate the number of income years that start in your assessable period. Then use the table (page 15) to get the corresponding percentage. If no income years have started in your assessable period, use the schedule year 1 percentage. For most people, the New Zealand income year starts on 1 April and ends on 31 March. If your income year is 1 April - 31 March, then your 2014 income year covers the period 1 April 2013 - 31 March 2014. If your income year begins on 1 April, an easy way to calculate the correct number of years to find your schedule year percentage is to count the number of times 1 April occurs during your assessable period. If the result is zero, eg your assessable period starts on 1 October and you receive your foreign superannuation withdrawal later that month, then you'll use year 1. www.ird.govt.nz 15 You can also find the correct number of years using the following steps: 1. Work out the last day of your four-year exemption period. If you don't have one, work out the last day you were a non-tax resident with an interest in your scheme. 2. Take note of the income year this date falls in. This is year A. 3. Also note the income year you receive the foreign superannuation withdrawal. This is year B. 4. Subtract year A from year B. This gives you the "year" to use in the table below. (If the result is zero, you use year 1). 5. Now find your percentage. Schedule year percentages YearPercentage % 14.76 29.45 314.06 418.60 523.07 627.47 731.80 836.06 940.26 1044.39 1148.45 1252.45 1356.39 1460.27 1564.08 1667.84 1771.53 1875.17 1978.75 2082.28 2185.74 2289.16 2392.58 2495.83 2599.08 26+100 OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 16 Steve became a New Zealand tax resident on 21 February 2006. On 12 August 2018, he withdrew $25,000 from his foreign superannuation scheme. He made no other withdrawals, and no further contributions were made after 21 February 2006. Steve's four-year exemption expired on 28 February 2010, which is in the 2010 income year (year A). The lump sum was withdrawn in the 2019 income year (year B). Year B (2019) − year A (2010) = 9, so the percentage to use is 40.26% - see highlighted row in the table (page 15). Steve must include $10,065 as assessable income in his 2019 tax return ($25,000 × 40.26% = $10,065). Example The formula method This method is an alternative to the schedule method and can only be used for foreign defined contribution schemes, if all of these conditions have been met: • You must have the information required to use the formula method. • You must not have received a distribution from the scheme before 1 April 2014, other than a pension or an annuity. • You haven't used the schedule method before for this scheme. If the interest came from your previous partner after they died or as part of a relationship agreement following a relationship split, they must not have used the schedule method for the interest. The formula method uses a number of formulae. Because these are quite complex we recommend you talk with a tax professional if you're thinking about using this option. You’ll need to know: • what the value of your scheme was at the beginning of your assessable period, • the value of previous superannuation withdrawals (if any), and • the value of your scheme before your most recent foreign superannuation withdrawal. For more information and examples read the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 26 No 4 (May 2014). Go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: formula method). www.ird.govt.nz 17 Tax on lump-sum withdrawals and transfers made between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014 If you received a payment or made a withdrawal prior to 1 April 2014 and you didn't pay any tax at the time, you may need to consider whether you have tax obligations in respect of previous years (generally for the 2013-14 and earlier years). If you made the withdrawal or transfer between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014 or applied to withdraw or transfer the amount by 31 March 2014, and you didn't comply with the tax laws at the time you can: • pay tax on 15% of the withdrawn or transferred amount using the 15% option, or • return your income by: –filing previous year tax returns using the tax rules that existed at the time of the withdrawal or when you held the interest (either ordinary tax rules or the FIF rules), or –asking us to amend previous year tax returns using the tax rules that existed at the time of the withdrawal or when you held the interest (either ordinary tax rules or the FIF rules). If you use the tax rules that existed at the time of the withdrawal or when you held the interest, you may need to pay penalties and use-of-money interest. However, if you: • acquired your interest in a scheme while you were non- resident, and • didn't receive any payments or make a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme before 1 April 2014, and • haven't returned any income under the FIF rules then there's generally nothing you need to do in respect of previous tax years. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 18 15% option This option allows you to include 15% of the lump sum withdrawn or transferred as income in your tax return. You can use it if you've withdrawn a lump sum from or transferred your foreign superannuation scheme between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014, but didn't comply with your tax obligations at the time. The 15% option is also available if you made a formal request to withdraw or transfer your funds by 31 March 2014, even if you didn't receive the funds until after this date. If this applies to you and you want to use this option, you have to show us that you did everything you needed to do to withdraw or transfer your funds by 31 March 2014. If you meet this requirement, but don't want to use the 15% option, see the schedule and formula tax methods (page 11). The 15% must be returned in either your 2013-14 or 2014-15 income tax returns as overseas income. The corresponding 2013-14 or 2014-15 due dates for tax will apply. Kathryn transferred $150,000 from her foreign superannuation scheme to a New Zealand scheme in February 2004. She didn't include this income in her IR3 return for the 2003-04 income year, and didn't pay tax on her interest under the FIF rules. She decides to use the 15% option for her lump-sum transfer. She declares $22,500 (being 15% of $150,000) as income in her IR3 return for the 2014-15 income year. Kathryn will be liable for any penalties or use-of-money interest applied to her 2013-14 tax return, not her 2003-04 tax return. Example For further information and examples please refer to the Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 26 No 4 (May 2014). www.ird.govt.nz 19 KiwiSaver withdrawal facility If you transfer a lump sum from your foreign superannuation scheme into a KiwiSaver scheme, this could make it difficult for you to meet your resulting tax obligation, because KiwiSaver schemes are locked in until retirement. The withdrawal facility gives you the option to request a withdrawal from your KiwiSaver scheme to meet your income tax and student loan repayment obligations that arise from the transfer. The withdrawal amount is limited to the amount of tax and/or student loan repayment obligation. This facility isn't available for any resulting penalties and interest. The maximum amount that you may withdraw to meet your income tax obligation is the lesser of: • your tax obligation resulting from the transfer of your foreign superannuation interest into a KiwiSaver scheme, and • your terminal tax obligation for the tax year that your foreign superannuation income was assessed. The maximum amount you may withdraw to meet your student loan repayment obligation is the amount of repayment obligation that arose from the transfer of your foreign superannuation into a KiwiSaver scheme. To make an application for a withdrawal you need to have included the income resulting from the transfer in your income tax return. You must apply within 24 months from the end of the month that your income tax and/or student loan repayment obligation is assessed. Your KiwiSaver provider deals with the application and you're required to make a statutory declaration containing details of the tax obligation. If you're thinking about making a withdrawal from your KiwiSaver scheme to pay your tax obligation, contact your KiwiSaver provider for information about this. If you're thinking about using this withdrawal facility, remember that making a withdrawal could trigger obligations or conditions imposed when you transferred your foreign superannuation interest into KiwiSaver. This may include penalties imposed on withdrawals made within a certain period following migration (possibly under the rules of the scheme, or under the other country's law). OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 20 How we taxed your foreign superannuation scheme before 1 April 2014 Before 1 April 2014, your foreign superannuation scheme was taxed either: • on the increase in value of your investment under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, or • if the FIF rules didn't apply, on any payments (income) from the scheme. This generally included pension payments, lump- sum withdrawals and transfers to other schemes. It's also possible that the temporary exemption for transitional residents may have applied to some or all of your payments. See page 7 for further details. These rules can be complex and you may want to get advice from a professional specialising in this area. If you still hold some of your interest in the foreign superannuation scheme see page 8. Foreign investment funds (FIF) Your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme was likely to have been a FIF before 1 April 2014, unless, for example it was a locked-in scheme (according to certain criteria), or an Australian superannuation scheme. The FIF rules generally didn't apply if all your overseas portfolio interests cost less than NZ$50,000, or in the first four years after you first became a New Zealand resident (before 1 April 2006). If the FIF rules applied, you needed to calculate your taxable FIF income for each year that you held the FIF interest under the FIF rules at the time, and include it in your Individual tax return (IR3) for those years. When your scheme was taxed as a FIF, no other income from the scheme was taxable in New Zealand. For more information about FIF, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: foreign investment funds) or read our Guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate method (IR461). www.ird.govt.nz 21 If the FIF rules didn't apply If the FIF rules didn't apply, you needed to pay tax on any income/payments you received from the foreign superannuation scheme. This generally included pension payments and, in some cases, lump-sum withdrawals and transfers from the scheme. If there were no payments or transfers from the scheme, there was no income to be returned for New Zealand tax purposes. If you did receive income or payments from the scheme, you were generally required to include the before-tax (gross) income in your Individual tax return (IR3). The amount of tax to pay generally depended on the legal structure of your foreign superannuation scheme such as whether the scheme was a company, trust, or unit trust. Christine is a new migrant and became a New Zealand tax resident on 30 January 2002. Christine transferred $150,000 from her foreign superannuation scheme to a New Zealand scheme in February 2004. She didn't include this income in her IR3 return for the 2003-04 income year. She decides to use the law that applied at the time she made the withdrawal to calculate the tax on her lump-sum transfer. In her situation, her interest wasn't an interest in a FIF, and the majority of her $150,000 was a return of capital, and only $2,000 of the amount was income. She has her 2003-04 IR3 return amended to include the $2,000. Christine will be liable for penalties and use-of-money interest from the 2003-04 income year. Example OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 22 How we tax your periodic pension Most periodic pensions received from foreign superannuation schemes are taxed in full and you need to include the before-tax (gross) income in your Individual tax return (IR3). However, in a very small number of cases, your periodic pension may be taxable in the other country which holds the taxing rights under a double tax agreement. See pages 26 and 27 under "Where a foreign tax credit is available" and "No tax in New Zealand". If you receive a social security pension, please refer to the Overseas social security pensions (IR258) guide for more information on how this is taxed in New Zealand. www.ird.govt.nz 23 How a double tax agreement could affect your New Zealand tax How the payments you receive from your foreign superannuation scheme (retirement lump sums and periodic pensions) are treated depends on whether New Zealand has a double tax agreement or a tax information exchange agreement with the country where your superannuation scheme is and whether the agreement contains an article on pension taxing rights. Each double tax agreement and tax information exchange agreement is different and may treat periodic pensions and retirement lump sums differently. It's important to check the terms of the appropriate double tax agreement or tax information exchange agreement to make sure you pay the right amount of tax and claim the right amount of foreign tax credits in your New Zealand tax return. You can find out more about New Zealand's double tax agreements, tax information exchange agreements and the right to tax pension income at www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: double tax agreement). No foreign tax credit available If tax was paid overseas on pensions or retirement lump sums where the tax treaty rules didn't allow this, then you should apply to the foreign superannuation scheme administrators or to the overseas tax authorities for a refund. You can't claim the overseas tax paid as a foreign tax credit in your New Zealand tax return. You should also advise the foreign superannuation scheme administrators that you're a New Zealand tax resident and apply to have your pension paid without them deducting tax. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 24 If you're a tax resident of New Zealand and you receive UK pension payments, you need to do the following. • Fill out the relevant HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) application form "Form New Zealand - Individual". This application form asks the UK tax authority not to tax UK income and also to refund UK income tax deducted from payments made. • Send the form to us to certify you're a New Zealand tax resident at: Inland Revenue PO Box 39010 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 These forms can be found at www.hmrc.gov.uk/cnr/nz\_indiv.pdf James, a former UK citizen, retired to New Zealand and became a New Zealand tax resident. He receives a yearly pension of £18,000 from his former UK employer, and £3,500 tax is deducted in the UK. Because his UK pension scheme was exempt from the FIF rules, he converts the before-tax amount into New Zealand dollars and declares this income in his Individual tax return (IR3) each year. Because the pension is only taxable in New Zealand under the tax treaty between New Zealand and the UK, he cannot claim the UK tax paid as a foreign tax credit in his IR3 return. Instead, James contacts HMRC to claim a refund and apply for an exemption so his pension will be paid free of any UK income tax in future. Example If you receive a pension from a country, other than the UK, and require assistance to apply for a refund, contact us at the address above. www.ird.govt.nz 25 Transitional residents If you're a transitional resident completing an application for double tax relief (such as the HMRC form mentioned previously) you should ensure you complete this form correctly. In particular, transitional residents should be careful not to elect out of the transitional residence rules by advising the foreign jurisdiction and Inland Revenue that the pension income received during the transitional residency has or will be subject to New Zealand tax. We'll generally treat this application as giving notice to Inland Revenue that you've made an election not to be a transitional resident if you confirm to the foreign jurisdiction and Inland Revenue that you've paid or will pay tax in New Zealand on the pension income from a date that falls within your transitional residency period. Once you've given us notice, you can't change your mind. If you're in any doubt, contact us before you send an application for double tax relief. If you have any questions about transitional residency, you can email us at Transactional.International@ird.govt.nz Please don't send any taxpayer or customer information to the email address. Part B of the HMRC form The HMRC form for relief referred to above asks at Part B, Question 2: "On what date did you become resident in New Zealand?" Question 3: "From what date have you paid, or will you pay, tax in New Zealand on income that you include in this claim? (This may differ from the date you have given in answer to Question 2.)" Where you don't have to pay tax in New Zealand on this income, you need to give the reason(s) on a separate sheet. If you're using this form you must include the date you paid or will pay tax in New Zealand on income included in this claim. For a transitional resident the pension is generally only taxable from the date when your transitional residency ends (or has ended), which is of course later than the date you become resident, so you need to enter that later date as the answer for this question. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 26 This later date won't impact on the requirement for the United Kingdom to provide relief from tax from the date you became a New Zealand tax resident. If you don't have to pay tax in New Zealand on the pension income this form relates to because you are or have been a transitional resident, you need to give details of your transitional residency on a separate sheet attached to the form. Contact us at the address (page 24) before you send us any application for double tax relief if you are in any doubt. Where a foreign tax credit is available In a few situations, New Zealand will give a foreign tax credit for income tax paid overseas. Generally this is where the tax treaty gives the source country the right to tax or partially tax the pension, or where there's no tax treaty with that country. To find out if you can claim a foreign tax credit on your overseas pension go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: double tax agreement). Where a foreign tax credit is available, you need to include the before-tax (gross) income in your New Zealand tax return. You can then claim a tax credit for the tax paid overseas. If you're allowed to claim a tax credit in your New Zealand tax return for the tax paid overseas, the New Zealand foreign tax credit is limited to the lowest of the following: • the actual tax paid overseas • the amount of New Zealand tax you would pay on the same income • the rate set out in the relevant tax treaty. New Zealand only has a partial right to tax a Russian social security pension - only 50% of the payment before tax (and 50% of the normally allowable foreign tax credits) should be included in your New Zealand tax return. You'll need to convert the tax paid on overseas income to New Zealand currency using the same method you used for the income (page 28). To claim a foreign tax credit, you must give us proof of the tax deducted, eg, an overseas tax deduction certificate. www.ird.govt.nz 27 No tax in New Zealand In a very small number of cases, New Zealand has no right to tax pension income and the income shouldn't be included in your New Zealand tax return. This applies, for example: • to social security pensions from Finland, France, Germany (Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund), the Philippines, and the United States of America, and/or • war pensions from France and Germany • war pensions (and allowances) paid under the Dutch AVBP Scheme (Dutch (Benefit Act for Victims of Persecution 1940-1945) Scheme). In certain circumstances some pensions paid for government service may also be exempt from New Zealand tax. To find out whether or not your particular pension is taxable in New Zealand, go to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: double tax agreement). For information about overseas social security pensions, read our guide Overseas social security pensions (IR258). Australian pensions If you receive an Australian pension that would have been taxable in Australia had you received it while still resident there, then it's taxable in New Zealand and you need to include it in your New Zealand tax return. You can't claim a foreign tax credit. If you receive an Australian pension that wouldn't have been taxable in Australia had you received it while still resident there, then it's exempt in New Zealand and you don't need to include it in your New Zealand tax return. You also don't need to include lump sums from Australia paid: • by a retirement benefit scheme • as a result of retirement, invalidity, disability or death • by way of compensation for injuries in your New Zealand tax return. These are taxed only in Australia. Contact the Australian Taxation Office to check if the Australian pension you receive would normally be taxed in Australia. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 28 Converting overseas currency amounts to New Zealand dollars You need to convert the overseas currency amounts (taxable income and foreign tax credit claims) into New Zealand dollars. Pension payments made to a New Zealand bank account will have already been converted to New Zealand dollars. Otherwise you can do the currency conversion by: • going to www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: overseas currency) and using the latest rates • using the mid-month exchange rates published in our Conversion of New Zealand dollars to overseas currency (IR270) exchange rate form. This is published in May each year and covers the previous 12 months • getting the exchange rate for the day the pension went into your overseas bank account from any trading bank. To convert an amount of overseas currency to New Zealand dollars, divide the overseas amount by the rate for the month you received it. You must use the same conversion method for the whole year. You receive a UK payment of £2,400 in October 2010. The exchange rate in that month was 0.4729: £2,400 ÷ 0.4729 = NZ$5,075.07 Example www.ird.govt.nz 29 More help if you need it Need to speak with us?

Foreign superannuation scheme - a savings plan, sometimes called a pension or retirement plan created outside New Zealand, to accumulate funds for retirement. The scheme is often set up through an employer, trade union or insurance company. On retirement it's paid out as a lump sum, pension or both. It doesn't include an arrangement set up under another country's social security law to provide retirement benefits resembling New Zealand Superannuation. A life insurance policy is generally not classed as a foreign superannuation scheme. Instead, you'll need to apply the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules to work out your tax obligations for your foreign life insurance policy. For more information about your obligations under the FIF rules go to ird.govt.nz for A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. Foreign superannuation withdrawal - an amount received from a foreign superannuation scheme that is not a pension or annuity. This includes: • • a cash withdrawal • • a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand superannuation scheme • • a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme outside Australia into an Australian superannuation scheme • • a withdrawal from a foreign superannuation scheme to reinvest as an interest of another person in a superannuation scheme. In some circumstances, it may exclude transfers on the death of a partner or under a relationship property agreement following a relationship split. Grandparenting - where you have correctly applied the FIF rules to your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme in an income tax return lodged before 20 May 2013 and continue to do this for all income years after 1 April 2014. Pension - a regular payment, generally from a foreign superannuation scheme or pension fund, when you reach retirement age. ird.govt.nz 5 Permanent place of abode - to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand there must be a place where you usually live or could live in New Zealand, ie a house or other dwelling. If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, all of your ties and links with New Zealand need to be considered to decide whether it's your permanent place of abode. The types of ties that are relevant are: • • whether you make trips back to New Zealand and for how long • • your past use of the dwelling in New Zealand • • family and social ties • • employment, economic and property ties • • whether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live (and if you do, when). If you have strong ties to New Zealand it's likely you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, but all of your circumstances need to be considered. Social security pension - an income entitlement generally based on citizenship or residence and administered or paid by the government or state of a particular jurisdiction. For example, the State Pension in the United Kingdom (UK) and New Zealand Superannuation in New Zealand. Taxable income - income you have to pay tax on. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 6 Introduction This guide explains your tax responsibilities if you have an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme, or you receive an overseas periodic pension. It doesn't explain your tax obligations if you have an overseas social security pension. For more information see our Overseas social security pensions - IR258 guide. If you're a New Zealand tax resident, you're generally taxed only on the payments or transfers from the scheme. In some cases you may be taxed annually on the increase in value of your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. You'll find information in this guide on: • • working out if you're a New Zealand tax resident • • whether you'll have to pay tax on the value of your investment, on lump-sum withdrawals and transfers (known as "foreign superannuation withdrawals"), or on the pension payments • • how a New Zealand double tax agreement could affect your tax • • whether you can claim a tax credit in your New Zealand tax return for tax paid overseas. Are you a New Zealand tax resident? If you're a New Zealand tax resident, you generally have to include your worldwide income in your New Zealand tax return, unless that income is exempt under our tax laws. This includes your foreign superannuation scheme (sometimes known as an overseas pension scheme or retirement plan). You're a New Zealand tax resident if: • • you have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand, or • • you've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and not become a non-resident, or • • you're away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government. If you're a New Zealand tax resident, you become a non-resident for tax purposes if: • • you no longer have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, and • • you're away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period. These don't have to be consecutive days and part-days are counted as full days of presence in New Zealand. ird.govt.nz 7 For more information on tax residency go to ird.govt.nz/international-for-individuals for: • • the Tax Residence Interpretation Statement IS16/03, and • • the New Zealand tax residence - IR292 guide. Have you recently moved to New Zealand? If you're a new migrant or a returning New Zealander you may qualify to be a transitional resident. This means you're exempt from paying tax on most of your overseas income for a temporary period. You're a transitional resident if: • • you've qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and • • you're a new migrant or a returning New Zealander, who hasn't been resident for tax purposes for at least 10 years before arriving in New Zealand, and • • neither you nor your partner are receiving Working for Families Tax Credits, and • • you haven't been a transitional resident at all before. Where these conditions are met, you're a transitional resident and the exemption starts for you on the first day you're a tax resident. It ends 48 months after the month you meet the requirements for being a New Zealand tax resident. The tax exemption is automatically granted if you qualify. You can elect not to be a transitional resident. You can read about the four-year exemption period for foreign superannuation withdrawals (page 12). For more information on the temporary tax exemption for transitional residents go to ird.govt.nz/tte OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 8 How we tax your foreign superannuation scheme From 1 April 2014, the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules generally no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes that are acquired while the holder isn't a New Zealand tax resident. This includes New Zealand tax residents which tie break towards a country New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA). For more information on the tie breaker tests of a DTA go to ird.govt.nz for: • • the Tax Residence Interpretation Statement IS16/03, and • • the New Zealand tax residence IR292 guide. Interests in foreign superannuation schemes are taxed when you withdraw a lump sum or transfer your interest to a New Zealand or Australian scheme, or when you receive a pension from the scheme. This section explains your tax obligations on lump-sum withdrawals or transfers from a foreign superannuation scheme made: • • from 1 April 2014, or • • prior to 1 April 2014 if you didn't comply with the tax rules that applied at the time. For more information about how we tax periodic pensions see page 22. Using the FIF rules from 1 April 2014 In some cases you must, or may, apply the FIF rules in relation to your interest in the foreign superannuation scheme. Distributions are considered under the FIF rules, so you don't pay tax again when you receive a payment or make a transfer. For more information about your obligations under the FIF rules go to ird.govt.nz for A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. ird.govt.nz 9 If you're a New Zealand tax resident when you first join the scheme If you're a New Zealand tax resident, or treated as a New Zealand tax resident under a DTA, when you first join a foreign superannuation scheme, you need to consider the New Zealand FIF rules. This is regardless of whether you acquired your rights in the scheme before or after 1 April 2014. If you do not have FIF income or FIF loss because your interest in all FIFs is below the de minimis threshold of $50,000, you need to apply the new schedule method (page 11). For more information about your obligations under the FIF rules and the de minimis threshold go to ird.govt.nz for A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. Grandparenting rules If your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme was first acquired while you were a non-tax resident and you correctly applied the FIF rules to it in a tax return lodged before 20 May 2013, you can: 1. continue to apply the FIF rules to that interest, or 2. apply the new rules (refer to "schedule and formula tax methods" on page 11). You must meet the following criteria in each income year you want to apply the FIF rules to a particular foreign superannuation interest, for all income years from 1 April 2014: • • you must have had an attributing interest in a FIF for an income year ending before 1 April 2014. This is the "qualifying year". For that qualifying year: –you must have calculated your FIF income or loss arising from that attributing interest under one of the approved methods, and –included that FIF income or loss in a tax return filed with Inland Revenue before 20 May 2013, and • • from the end of the qualifying year to the beginning of the current year, (the "qualifying period") you must have: –continued to hold the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme, and –calculated your FIF income or loss from your interest for all income years, and –returned it in all tax returns for income years in the qualifying period. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 10 The criteria are applied on an interest-by-interest basis, so you may be grandparented for one interest but not another. To remain grandparented, you must continue to return FIF income or losses for your grandparented interest in all future income years. If you do this, any future distributions from your scheme won't be taxed. If you don't correctly return FIF income or losses for an income year during which you still hold the interest, that interest ceases to be grandparented. Any subsequent lump-sum withdrawals or transfers will be taxed under the new foreign superannuation scheme tax rules as a foreign superannuation withdrawal (ie, under the schedule method or formula method) or when you receive a periodic pension. In this situation you won't get any credit for the tax you've paid under the FIF rules. ird.govt.nz 11 Schedule and formula tax methods In most cases you'll pay income tax when you receive a foreign superannuation withdrawal unless you qualify for an exemption. There are two methods available to you from 1 April 2014 to tax this income: • • The schedule method - this is the default method. Using this method means a certain portion of your foreign superannuation withdrawal will be income and is based on the number of years you've been a New Zealand tax resident. • • The formula method - this is an alternative to the schedule method and can be used if your foreign superannuation scheme is a defined contribution scheme and certain other requirements are met. It taxes the actual investment gains that have accrued to your scheme while you've been a New Zealand tax resident. These two methods are generally only available if you acquired your interest in the foreign superannuation scheme while you were a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes. If you were a New Zealand tax resident when you first acquired the interest see page 8. Calculating your assessable income using either method requires you to calculate your assessable period (page 13). A transfer of your foreign superannuation interest from one scheme into another non-Australian foreign superannuation scheme isn't a foreign superannuation withdrawal and so it's not taxed at that point. It will affect how your assessable period is calculated. Note In some circumstances, a transfer of a foreign superannuation interest from one New Zealand tax resident (the transferor) to another (the recipient) isn't taxed. This happens when: • • the transferor first acquired the interest while a non-resident, and • • the transferor and recipient were married or in a relationship, and • • the transfer occurs: –following the death of the transferor, or OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 12 –under a relationship agreement resulting from a relationship split. This will affect how your assessable period is calculated. Note that insurance policies generally don't fall within the meaning of a superannuation scheme, so the schedule and formula methods don't apply to foreign life insurance policies. Instead, you'll need to apply the FIF rules to your foreign life insurance policy. For more information about your obligations under the FIF rules go to ird.govt.nz for A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. Four-year exemption period for foreign superannuation withdrawals The four-year exemption period is similar to the transitional resident tax exemption and applies to foreign superannuation withdrawals received during the period. If you qualify for a four-year exemption period, a foreign superannuation withdrawal received during this period is exempt from New Zealand tax. If you qualify for a four-year exemption period and receive a foreign superannuation withdrawal after your exemption period: • • the schedule method ignores your years of residence during the exemption period • • the formula method doesn't tax the gains that have accrued to your scheme during the exemption period. The exemption doesn't require a person to be a non-tax resident for a minimum period. The exemption period is available to both new migrants and returning New Zealanders. This exemption applies if you: • • first acquired an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, and • • haven't previously had this exemption. The exemption starts on the first day you're a New Zealand tax resident. It finishes 48 months after the month you first meet the requirements for being a New Zealand tax resident, by either having a permanent place of abode or by being in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period. The exemption also ends if you become a non-tax resident. ird.govt.nz 13 The timing is the same as the transitional resident tax exemption. You'll still qualify for this exemption if you cease to be a transitional resident because you receive Working for Families Tax Credits, or if you don't meet the requirements to qualify as a transitional resident. Calculating your assessable period Your assessable period starts when your exemption period ends, eg if the last day of your exemption period is 30 September, the first day of your assessable period is 1 October. If you don't have an exemption period, your assessable period starts on the first day you're a New Zealand tax resident with an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. Your assessable period ends when you receive your foreign superannuation withdrawal. It doesn't include any periods of non-tax residence. If you transferred your interest from one foreign superannuation scheme (scheme A) into a non-Australian foreign superannuation scheme (scheme B), there's no tax on that transfer. If you then transfer to a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme (this means you receive a foreign superannuation withdrawal from scheme B), your assessable period starts on the same day as your assessable period for scheme A. If your scheme interest came from your previous partner because they died or as part of a relationship agreement following a relationship split, and the transfer wasn't taxable at the time, then your assessable period starts on the same day as their assessable period for that interest. The schedule method This method uses set percentages that represent the proportion of your foreign superannuation withdrawal which you'll need to include as assessable income in your income tax return. The schedule year percentages increase with the number of years you're a tax resident in New Zealand. The rest of your foreign superannuation withdrawal not deemed to be assessable income is exempt from New Zealand tax, and is not included in your income tax return. Calculate your assessable income for the schedule method as follows: (superannuation withdrawal − contributions left) × schedule year % OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 14 Put the amount of your foreign superannuation withdrawal in the "superannuation withdrawal" part of the formula. What are "contributions left"? If the contributions you've made while you've been a New Zealand tax resident satisfy all the following conditions, you may be allowed a deduction for these contributions: • • You must be a New Zealand tax resident and treated as a New Zealand tax resident under all applicable double tax agreements when the contributions are made. • • They must be made by you, your employer, or for your benefit. • • They are required under the rules of your foreign superannuation scheme. • • They're subject to employer superannuation contribution tax or fringe benefit tax if they're made by your employer. A given contribution may only be deducted once, and only the contributions made during the assessable period that fit the above criteria can be deducted. Insert the amount of contributions that satisfy all of these requirements in the "contributions left" part of the formula. This amount can't be greater than the amount of your foreign superannuation withdrawal. Calculating the "schedule years" To get the appropriate "schedule year %" calculate the number of income years that start in your assessable period. Then use the table (page 15) to get the corresponding percentage. If no income years have started in your assessable period, use the schedule year 1 percentage. For most people, the New Zealand income year starts on 1 April and ends on 31 March. If your income year is 1 April - 31 March, then your 2014 income year covers the period 1 April 2013 - 31 March 2014. If your income year begins on 1 April, an easy way to calculate the correct number of years to find your schedule year percentage is to count the number of times 1 April occurs during your assessable period. If the result is zero, eg your assessable period starts on 1 October and you receive your foreign superannuation withdrawal later that month, then you'll use year 1. ird.govt.nz 15 You can also find the correct number of years using the following steps: 1. Work out the last day of your four-year exemption period. If you don't have one, work out the last day you were a non-tax resident with an interest in your scheme. 2. Take note of the income year this date falls in. This is year A. 3. Also note the income year you receive the foreign superannuation withdrawal. This is year B. 4. Subtract year A from year B. This gives you the "year" to use in the table below. (If the result is zero, you use year 1). 5. Now find your percentage. Schedule year percentages YearPercentage % 14.76 29.45 314.06 418.60 523.07 627.47 731.80 836.06 940.26 1044.39 1148.45 1252.45 1356.39 1460.27 1564.08 1667.84 1771.53 1875.17 1978.75 2082.28 2185.74 2289.16 2392.58 2495.83 2599.08 26+100 OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 16 Steve became a New Zealand tax resident on 21 February 2006. On 12 August 2018, he withdrew $25,000 from his foreign superannuation scheme. He made no other withdrawals, and no further contributions were made after 21 February 2006. Steve's four-year exemption expired on 28 February 2010, which is in the 2010 income year (year A). The lump sum was withdrawn in the 2019 income year (year B). Year B (2019) − year A (2010) = 9, so the percentage to use is 40.26% - see highlighted row in the table (page 15). Steve must include $10,065 as assessable income in his 2019 tax return ($25,000 × 40.26% = $10,065). Example The formula method This method is an alternative to the schedule method and can only be used for foreign defined contribution schemes, if all of these conditions have been met: • • You must have the information required to use the formula method. • • You must not have received a distribution from the scheme before 1 April 2014, other than a pension or an annuity. • • You haven't used the schedule method before for this scheme. If the interest came from your previous partner after they died or as part of a relationship agreement following a relationship split, they must not have used the schedule method for the interest. The formula method uses a number of formulae. Because these are quite complex we recommend you talk with a tax professional if you're thinking about using this option. You’ll need to know: • • what the value of your scheme was at the beginning of your assessable period, • • the value of previous superannuation withdrawals (if any), and • • the value of your scheme before your most recent foreign superannuation withdrawal. For more information and examples read the Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 26 No 4 (May 2014). Go to ird.govt.nz/income-types ird.govt.nz 17 Tax on lump-sum withdrawals and transfers made between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014 If you received a payment or made a withdrawal prior to 1 April 2014 and you didn't pay any tax at the time, you may need to consider whether you have tax obligations in respect of previous years (generally for the 2013-14 and earlier years). If you made the withdrawal or transfer between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014 or applied to withdraw or transfer the amount by 31 March 2014, and you didn't comply with the tax laws at the time you can: • • pay tax on 15% of the withdrawn or transferred amount using the 15% option, or • • return your income by: –filing previous year tax returns using the tax rules that existed at the time of the withdrawal or when you held the interest (either ordinary tax rules or the FIF rules), or –asking us to amend previous year tax returns using the tax rules that existed at the time of the withdrawal or when you held the interest (either ordinary tax rules or the FIF rules). If you use the tax rules that existed at the time of the withdrawal or when you held the interest, you may need to pay penalties and use-of-money interest. However, if you: • • acquired your interest in a scheme while you were non- resident, and • • didn't receive any payments or make a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme before 1 April 2014, and • • haven't returned any income under the FIF rules then there's generally nothing you need to do in respect of previous tax years. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 18 15% option This option allows you to include 15% of the lump sum withdrawn or transferred as income in your tax return. You can use it if you've withdrawn a lump sum from or transferred your foreign superannuation scheme between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014, but didn't comply with your tax obligations at the time. The 15% option is also available if you made a formal request to withdraw or transfer your funds by 31 March 2014, even if you didn't receive the funds until after this date. If this applies to you and you want to use this option, you have to show us that you did everything you needed to do to withdraw or transfer your funds by 31 March 2014. If you meet this requirement, but don't want to use the 15% option, see the schedule and formula tax methods (page 11). The 15% must be returned in either your 2013-14 or 2014-15 income tax returns as overseas income. The corresponding 2013-14 or 2014-15 due dates for tax will apply. Kathryn transferred $150,000 from her foreign superannuation scheme to a New Zealand scheme in February 2004. She didn't include this income in her IR3 return for the 2003-04 income year, and didn't pay tax on her interest under the FIF rules. She decides to use the 15% option for her lump-sum transfer. She declares $22,500 (being 15% of $150,000) as income in her IR3 return for the 2014-15 income year. Kathryn will be liable for any penalties or use-of-money interest applied to her 2013-14 tax return, not her 2003-04 tax return. Example For further information and examples please refer to the Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 26 No 4 (May 2014). ird.govt.nz 19 KiwiSaver withdrawal facility If you transfer a lump sum from your foreign superannuation scheme into a KiwiSaver scheme, this could make it difficult for you to meet your resulting tax obligation, because KiwiSaver schemes are locked in until retirement. The withdrawal facility gives you the option to request a withdrawal from your KiwiSaver scheme to meet your income tax and student loan repayment obligations that arise from the transfer. The withdrawal amount is limited to the amount of tax and/or student loan repayment obligation. This facility isn't available for any resulting penalties and interest. The maximum amount that you may withdraw to meet your income tax obligation is the lesser of: • • your tax obligation resulting from the transfer of your foreign superannuation interest into a KiwiSaver scheme, and • • your terminal tax obligation for the tax year that your foreign superannuation income was assessed. The maximum amount you may withdraw to meet your student loan repayment obligation is the amount of repayment obligation that arose from the transfer of your foreign superannuation into a KiwiSaver scheme. To make an application for a withdrawal you need to have included the income resulting from the transfer in your income tax return. You must apply within 24 months from the end of the month that your income tax and/or student loan repayment obligation is assessed. Your KiwiSaver provider deals with the application and you're required to make a statutory declaration containing details of the tax obligation. If you're thinking about making a withdrawal from your KiwiSaver scheme to pay your tax obligation, contact your KiwiSaver provider for information about this. If you're thinking about using this withdrawal facility, remember that making a withdrawal could trigger obligations or conditions imposed when you transferred your foreign superannuation interest into KiwiSaver. This may include penalties imposed on withdrawals made within a certain period following migration (possibly under the rules of the scheme, or under the other country's law). OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 20 How we taxed your foreign superannuation scheme before 1 April 2014 Before 1 April 2014, your foreign superannuation scheme was taxed either: • • on the increase in value of your investment under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, or • • if the FIF rules didn't apply, on any payments (income) from the scheme. This generally included pension payments, lump- sum withdrawals and transfers to other schemes. It's also possible that the temporary exemption for transitional residents may have applied to some or all of your payments. See page 7 for further details. These rules can be complex and you may want to get advice from a professional specialising in this area. If you still hold some of your interest in the foreign superannuation scheme see page 8. Foreign investment funds (FIF) Your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme was likely to have been a FIF before 1 April 2014, unless, for example it was a locked-in scheme (according to certain criteria), or an Australian superannuation scheme. The FIF rules generally didn't apply if all your overseas portfolio interests cost less than NZ$50,000, or in the first four years after you first became a New Zealand resident (before 1 April 2006). If the FIF rules applied, you needed to calculate your taxable FIF income for each year that you held the FIF interest under the FIF rules at the time, and include it in your Individual tax return - IR3 for those years. When your scheme was taxed as a FIF, no other income from the scheme was taxable in New Zealand. For more information about FIF, go to ird.govt.nz or read our Guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate method - IR461. ird.govt.nz 21 If the FIF rules didn't apply If the FIF rules didn't apply, you needed to pay tax on any income/payments you received from the foreign superannuation scheme. This generally included pension payments and, in some cases, lump-sum withdrawals and transfers from the scheme. If there were no payments or transfers from the scheme, there was no income to be returned for New Zealand tax purposes. If you did receive income or payments from the scheme, you were generally required to include the before-tax (gross) income in your Individual tax return - IR3. The amount of tax to pay generally depended on the legal structure of your foreign superannuation scheme such as whether the scheme was a company, trust, or unit trust. Christine is a new migrant and became a New Zealand tax resident on 30 January 2002. Christine transferred $150,000 from her foreign superannuation scheme to a New Zealand scheme in February 2004. She didn't include this income in her IR3 return for the 2003-04 income year. She decides to use the law that applied at the time she made the withdrawal to calculate the tax on her lump-sum transfer. In her situation, her interest wasn't an interest in a FIF, and the majority of her $150,000 was a return of capital, and only $2,000 of the amount was income. She has her 2003-04 IR3 return amended to include the $2,000. Christine will be liable for penalties and use-of-money interest from the 2003-04 income year. Example OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 22 How we tax your periodic pension Most periodic pensions received from foreign superannuation schemes are taxed in full and you need to include the before-tax (gross) income in your Individual tax return - IR3. However, in a very small number of cases, your periodic pension may be taxable in the other country which holds the taxing rights under a double tax agreement. See pages 26 and 27 under "Where a foreign tax credit is available" and "No tax in New Zealand". If you receive a social security pension, please refer to the Overseas social security pensions - IR258 guide for more information on how this is taxed in New Zealand. ird.govt.nz 23 How a double tax agreement could affect your New Zealand tax How the payments you receive from your foreign superannuation scheme (retirement lump sums and periodic pensions) are treated depends on whether New Zealand has a double tax agreement or a tax information exchange agreement with the country where your superannuation scheme is and whether the agreement contains an article on pension taxing rights. Each double tax agreement and tax information exchange agreement is different and may treat periodic pensions and retirement lump sums differently. It's important to check the terms of the appropriate double tax agreement or tax information exchange agreement to make sure you pay the right amount of tax and claim the right amount of foreign tax credits in your New Zealand tax return. You can find out more about New Zealand's double tax agreements, tax information exchange agreements and the right to tax pension income at ird.govt.nz/dta No foreign tax credit available If tax was paid overseas on pensions or retirement lump sums where the tax treaty rules didn't allow this, then you should apply to the foreign superannuation scheme administrators or to the overseas tax authorities for a refund. You can't claim the overseas tax paid as a foreign tax credit in your New Zealand tax return. You should also advise the foreign superannuation scheme administrators that you're a New Zealand tax resident and apply to have your pension paid without them deducting tax. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 24 If you're a tax resident of New Zealand and you receive UK pension payments, you need to do the following. • • Fill out the relevant HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) application form "Form New Zealand - Individual". This application form asks the UK tax authority not to tax UK income and also to refund UK income tax deducted from payments made. • • Send the form to us to certify you're a New Zealand tax resident at: Inland Revenue PO Box 39010 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 These forms can be found at hmrc.gov.uk/cnr/nz\_indiv.pdf James, a former UK citizen, retired to New Zealand and became a New Zealand tax resident. He receives a yearly pension of £18,000 from his former UK employer, and £3,500 tax is deducted in the UK. Because his UK pension scheme was exempt from the FIF rules, he converts the before-tax amount into New Zealand dollars and declares this income in his Individual tax return - IR3 each year. Because the pension is only taxable in New Zealand under the tax treaty between New Zealand and the UK, he cannot claim the UK tax paid as a foreign tax credit in his IR3 return. Instead, James contacts HMRC to claim a refund and apply for an exemption so his pension will be paid free of any UK income tax in future. Example If you receive a pension from a country, other than the UK, and require assistance to apply for a refund, contact us at the address above. ird.govt.nz 25 Transitional residents If you're a transitional resident completing an application for double tax relief (such as the HMRC form mentioned previously) you should ensure you complete this form correctly. In particular, transitional residents should be careful not to elect out of the transitional residence rules by advising the foreign jurisdiction and Inland Revenue that the pension income received during the transitional residency has or will be subject to New Zealand tax. We'll generally treat this application as giving notice to Inland Revenue that you've made an election not to be a transitional resident if you confirm to the foreign jurisdiction and Inland Revenue that you've paid or will pay tax in New Zealand on the pension income from a date that falls within your transitional residency period. Once you've given us notice, you can't change your mind. If you're in any doubt, contact us before you send an application for double tax relief. If you have any questions about transitional residency, you can email us at Transactional.International@ird.govt.nz Please don't send any taxpayer or customer information to the email address. Part B of the HMRC form The HMRC form for relief referred to above asks at Part B, Question 2: "On what date did you become resident in New Zealand?" Question 3: "From what date have you paid, or will you pay, tax in New Zealand on income that you include in this claim? (This may differ from the date you have given in answer to Question 2.)" Where you don't have to pay tax in New Zealand on this income, you need to give the reason(s) on a separate sheet. If you're using this form you must include the date you paid or will pay tax in New Zealand on income included in this claim. For a transitional resident the pension is generally only taxable from the date when your transitional residency ends (or has ended), which is of course later than the date you become resident, so you need to enter that later date as the answer for this question. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 26 This later date won't impact on the requirement for the United Kingdom to provide relief from tax from the date you became a New Zealand tax resident. If you don't have to pay tax in New Zealand on the pension income this form relates to because you are or have been a transitional resident, you need to give details of your transitional residency on a separate sheet attached to the form. Contact us at the address (page 24) before you send us any application for double tax relief if you are in any doubt. Where a foreign tax credit is available In a few situations, New Zealand will give a foreign tax credit for income tax paid overseas. Generally this is where the tax treaty gives the source country the right to tax or partially tax the pension, or where there's no tax treaty with that country. To find out if you can claim a foreign tax credit on your overseas pension go to ird.govt.nz/dta Where a foreign tax credit is available, you need to include the before-tax (gross) income in your New Zealand tax return. You can then claim a tax credit for the tax paid overseas. If you're allowed to claim a tax credit in your New Zealand tax return for the tax paid overseas, the New Zealand foreign tax credit is limited to the lowest of the following: • • the actual tax paid overseas • • the amount of New Zealand tax you would pay on the same income • • the rate set out in the relevant tax treaty. New Zealand only has a partial right to tax a Russian social security pension - only 50% of the payment before tax (and 50% of the normally allowable foreign tax credits) should be included in your New Zealand tax return. You'll need to convert the tax paid on overseas income to New Zealand currency using the same method you used for the income (page 28). To claim a foreign tax credit, you must give us proof of the tax deducted, eg, an overseas tax deduction certificate. ird.govt.nz 27 No tax in New Zealand In a very small number of cases, New Zealand has no right to tax pension income and the income shouldn't be included in your New Zealand tax return. This applies, for example: • • to social security pensions from Finland, France, Germany (Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund), the Philippines, and the United States of America, and/or • • war pensions from France and Germany • • war pensions (and allowances) paid under the Dutch AVBP Scheme (Dutch (Benefit Act for Victims of Persecution 1940-1945) Scheme). In certain circumstances some pensions paid for government service may also be exempt from New Zealand tax. To find out whether or not your particular pension is taxable in New Zealand, go to ird.govt.nz/dta For information about overseas social security pensions, read our guide Overseas social security pensions - IR258. Australian pensions If you receive an Australian pension that would have been taxable in Australia had you received it while still resident there, then it's taxable in New Zealand and you need to include it in your New Zealand tax return. You can't claim a foreign tax credit. If you receive an Australian pension that wouldn't have been taxable in Australia had you received it while still resident there, then it's exempt in New Zealand and you don't need to include it in your New Zealand tax return. You also don't need to include lump sums from Australia paid: • • by a retirement benefit scheme • • as a result of retirement, invalidity, disability or death • • by way of compensation for injuries in your New Zealand tax return. These are taxed only in Australia. Contact the Australian Taxation Office to check if the Australian pension you receive would normally be taxed in Australia. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 28 Converting overseas currency amounts to New Zealand dollars You need to convert the overseas currency amounts (taxable income and foreign tax credit claims) into New Zealand dollars. Pension payments made to a New Zealand bank account will have already been converted to New Zealand dollars. Otherwise you can do the currency conversion by: • • going to ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax and using the latest rates • • getting the exchange rate for the day the pension went into your overseas bank account from any trading bank. To convert an amount of overseas currency to New Zealand dollars, divide the overseas amount by the rate for the month you received it. You must use the same conversion method for the whole year. You receive a UK payment of £2,400 in October 2010. The exchange rate in that month was 0.4729: £2,400 ÷ 0.4729 = NZ$5,075.07 Example ird.govt.nz 29 More help if you need it Need to speak with us?

Foreign superannuation scheme - a savings plan, sometimes called a pension or retirement plan created outside New Zealand, to accumulate funds for retirement. The scheme is often set up through an employer, trade union or insurance company. On retirement it's paid out as a lump sum, pension or both. It doesn't include an arrangement set up under another country's social security law to provide retirement benefits resembling New Zealand Superannuation. A life insurance policy is generally not classed as a foreign superannuation scheme. Instead, you'll need to apply the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules to work out your tax obligations for your foreign life insurance policy. For more information about your obligations under the FIF rules go to ird.govt.nz for A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. Foreign superannuation withdrawal - an amount received from a foreign superannuation scheme that is not a pension or annuity. This includes: • • a cash withdrawal • • a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand superannuation scheme • • a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme outside Australia into an Australian superannuation scheme • • a withdrawal from a foreign superannuation scheme to reinvest as an interest of another person in a superannuation scheme. In some circumstances, it may exclude transfers on the death of a partner or under a relationship property agreement following a relationship split. Grandparenting - where you have correctly applied the FIF rules to your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme in an income tax return lodged before 20 May 2013 and continue to do this for all income years after 1 April 2014. Pension - a regular payment, generally from a foreign superannuation scheme or pension fund, when you reach retirement age. ird.govt.nz 5 Permanent place of abode - to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand there must be a place where you usually live or could live in New Zealand, ie a house or other dwelling. If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, all of your ties and links with New Zealand need to be considered to decide whether it's your permanent place of abode. The types of ties that are relevant are: • • whether you make trips back to New Zealand and for how long • • your past use of the dwelling in New Zealand • • family and social ties • • employment, economic and property ties • • whether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live (and if you do, when). If you have strong ties to New Zealand it's likely you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, but all of your circumstances need to be considered. Social security pension - an income entitlement generally based on citizenship or residence and administered or paid by the government or state of a particular jurisdiction. For example, the State Pension in the United Kingdom (UK) and New Zealand Superannuation in New Zealand. Taxable income - income you have to pay tax on. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 6 Introduction This guide explains your tax responsibilities if you have an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme, or you receive an overseas periodic pension. It doesn't explain your tax obligations if you have an overseas social security pension. For more information see our Overseas social security pensions - IR258 guide. If you're a New Zealand tax resident, you're generally taxed only on the payments or transfers from the scheme. In some cases you may be taxed annually on the increase in value of your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. You'll find information in this guide on: • • working out if you're a New Zealand tax resident • • whether you'll have to pay tax on the value of your investment, on lump-sum withdrawals and transfers (known as "foreign superannuation withdrawals"), or on the pension payments • • how a New Zealand double tax agreement could affect your tax • • whether you can claim a tax credit in your New Zealand tax return for tax paid overseas. Are you a New Zealand tax resident? If you're a New Zealand tax resident, you generally have to include your worldwide income in your New Zealand tax return, unless that income is exempt under our tax laws. This includes your foreign superannuation scheme (sometimes known as an overseas pension scheme or retirement plan). You're a New Zealand tax resident if: • • you have a "permanent place of abode" in New Zealand, or • • you've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and not become a non-resident, or • • you're away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government. If you're a New Zealand tax resident, you become a non-resident for tax purposes if: • • you no longer have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, and • • you're away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period. These don't have to be consecutive days and part-days are counted as full days of presence in New Zealand. ird.govt.nz 7 For more information on tax residency go to ird.govt.nz/international-for-individuals for: • • the Tax Residence Interpretation Statement IS16/03, and • • the New Zealand tax residence - IR292 guide. Have you recently moved to New Zealand? If you're a new migrant or a returning New Zealander you may qualify to be a transitional resident. This means you're exempt from paying tax on most of your overseas income for a temporary period. You're a transitional resident if: • • you've qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and • • you're a new migrant or a returning New Zealander, who hasn't been resident for tax purposes for at least 10 years before arriving in New Zealand, and • • neither you nor your partner are receiving Working for Families Tax Credits, and • • you haven't been a transitional resident at all before. Where these conditions are met, you're a transitional resident and the exemption starts for you on the first day you're a tax resident. It ends 48 months after the month you meet the requirements for being a New Zealand tax resident. The tax exemption is automatically granted if you qualify. You can elect not to be a transitional resident. You can read about the four-year exemption period for foreign superannuation withdrawals (page 12). For more information on the temporary tax exemption for transitional residents go to ird.govt.nz/tte OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 8 How we tax your foreign superannuation scheme From 1 April 2014, the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules generally no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes that are acquired while the holder isn't a New Zealand tax resident. This includes New Zealand tax residents which tie break towards a country New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA). For more information on the tie breaker tests of a DTA go to ird.govt.nz for: • • the Tax Residence Interpretation Statement IS16/03, and • • the New Zealand tax residence IR292 guide. Interests in foreign superannuation schemes are taxed when you withdraw a lump sum or transfer your interest to a New Zealand or Australian scheme, or when you receive a pension from the scheme. This section explains your tax obligations on lump-sum withdrawals or transfers from a foreign superannuation scheme made: • • from 1 April 2014, or • • prior to 1 April 2014 if you didn't comply with the tax rules that applied at the time. For more information about how we tax periodic pensions see page 22. Using the FIF rules from 1 April 2014 In some cases you must, or may, apply the FIF rules in relation to your interest in the foreign superannuation scheme. Distributions are considered under the FIF rules, so you don't pay tax again when you receive a payment or make a transfer. For more information about your obligations under the FIF rules go to ird.govt.nz for A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. ird.govt.nz 9 If you're a New Zealand tax resident when you first join the scheme If you're a New Zealand tax resident, or treated as a New Zealand tax resident under a DTA, when you first join a foreign superannuation scheme, you need to consider the New Zealand FIF rules. This is regardless of whether you acquired your rights in the scheme before or after 1 April 2014. If you do not have FIF income or FIF loss because your interest in all FIFs is below the de minimis threshold of $50,000, you need to apply the new schedule method (page 11). For more information about your obligations under the FIF rules and the de minimis threshold go to ird.govt.nz for A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. Grandparenting rules If your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme was first acquired while you were a non-tax resident and you correctly applied the FIF rules to it in a tax return lodged before 20 May 2013, you can: 1. continue to apply the FIF rules to that interest, or 2. apply the new rules (refer to "schedule and formula tax methods" on page 11). You must meet the following criteria in each income year you want to apply the FIF rules to a particular foreign superannuation interest, for all income years from 1 April 2014: • • you must have had an attributing interest in a FIF for an income year ending before 1 April 2014. This is the "qualifying year". For that qualifying year: –you must have calculated your FIF income or loss arising from that attributing interest under one of the approved methods, and –included that FIF income or loss in a tax return filed with Inland Revenue before 20 May 2013, and • • from the end of the qualifying year to the beginning of the current year, (the "qualifying period") you must have: –continued to hold the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme, and –calculated your FIF income or loss from your interest for all income years, and –returned it in all tax returns for income years in the qualifying period. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 10 The criteria are applied on an interest-by-interest basis, so you may be grandparented for one interest but not another. To remain grandparented, you must continue to return FIF income or losses for your grandparented interest in all future income years. If you do this, any future distributions from your scheme won't be taxed. If you don't correctly return FIF income or losses for an income year during which you still hold the interest, that interest ceases to be grandparented. Any subsequent lump-sum withdrawals or transfers will be taxed under the new foreign superannuation scheme tax rules as a foreign superannuation withdrawal (ie, under the schedule method or formula method) or when you receive a periodic pension. In this situation you won't get any credit for the tax you've paid under the FIF rules. ird.govt.nz 11 Schedule and formula tax methods In most cases you'll pay income tax when you receive a foreign superannuation withdrawal unless you qualify for an exemption. There are two methods available to you from 1 April 2014 to tax this income: • • The schedule method - this is the default method. Using this method means a certain portion of your foreign superannuation withdrawal will be income and is based on the number of years you've been a New Zealand tax resident. • • The formula method - this is an alternative to the schedule method and can be used if your foreign superannuation scheme is a defined contribution scheme and certain other requirements are met. It taxes the actual investment gains that have accrued to your scheme while you've been a New Zealand tax resident. These two methods are generally only available if you acquired your interest in the foreign superannuation scheme while you were a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes. If you were a New Zealand tax resident when you first acquired the interest see page 8. Calculating your assessable income using either method requires you to calculate your assessable period (page 13). A transfer of your foreign superannuation interest from one scheme into another non-Australian foreign superannuation scheme isn't a foreign superannuation withdrawal and so it's not taxed at that point. It will affect how your assessable period is calculated. Note In some circumstances, a transfer of a foreign superannuation interest from one New Zealand tax resident (the transferor) to another (the recipient) isn't taxed. This happens when: • • the transferor first acquired the interest while a non-resident, and • • the transferor and recipient were married or in a relationship, and • • the transfer occurs: –following the death of the transferor, or OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 12 –under a relationship agreement resulting from a relationship split. This will affect how your assessable period is calculated. Note that insurance policies generally don't fall within the meaning of a superannuation scheme, so the schedule and formula methods don't apply to foreign life insurance policies. Instead, you'll need to apply the FIF rules to your foreign life insurance policy. For more information about your obligations under the FIF rules go to ird.govt.nz for A guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate - IR461. Four-year exemption period for foreign superannuation withdrawals The four-year exemption period is similar to the transitional resident tax exemption and applies to foreign superannuation withdrawals received during the period. If you qualify for a four-year exemption period, a foreign superannuation withdrawal received during this period is exempt from New Zealand tax. If you qualify for a four-year exemption period and receive a foreign superannuation withdrawal after your exemption period: • • the schedule method ignores your years of residence during the exemption period • • the formula method doesn't tax the gains that have accrued to your scheme during the exemption period. The exemption doesn't require a person to be a non-tax resident for a minimum period. The exemption period is available to both new migrants and returning New Zealanders. This exemption applies if you: • • first acquired an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while a non-resident for New Zealand tax purposes, and • • haven't previously had this exemption. The exemption starts on the first day you're a New Zealand tax resident. It finishes 48 months after the month you first meet the requirements for being a New Zealand tax resident, by either having a permanent place of abode or by being in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period. The exemption also ends if you become a non-tax resident. ird.govt.nz 13 The timing is the same as the transitional resident tax exemption. You'll still qualify for this exemption if you cease to be a transitional resident because you receive Working for Families Tax Credits, or if you don't meet the requirements to qualify as a transitional resident. Calculating your assessable period Your assessable period starts when your exemption period ends, eg if the last day of your exemption period is 30 September, the first day of your assessable period is 1 October. If you don't have an exemption period, your assessable period starts on the first day you're a New Zealand tax resident with an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. Your assessable period ends when you receive your foreign superannuation withdrawal. It doesn't include any periods of non-tax residence. If you transferred your interest from one foreign superannuation scheme (scheme A) into a non-Australian foreign superannuation scheme (scheme B), there's no tax on that transfer. If you then transfer to a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme (this means you receive a foreign superannuation withdrawal from scheme B), your assessable period starts on the same day as your assessable period for scheme A. If your scheme interest came from your previous partner because they died or as part of a relationship agreement following a relationship split, and the transfer wasn't taxable at the time, then your assessable period starts on the same day as their assessable period for that interest. The schedule method This method uses set percentages that represent the proportion of your foreign superannuation withdrawal which you'll need to include as assessable income in your income tax return. The schedule year percentages increase with the number of years you're a tax resident in New Zealand. The rest of your foreign superannuation withdrawal not deemed to be assessable income is exempt from New Zealand tax, and is not included in your income tax return. Calculate your assessable income for the schedule method as follows: (superannuation withdrawal − contributions left) × schedule year % OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 14 Put the amount of your foreign superannuation withdrawal in the "superannuation withdrawal" part of the formula. What are "contributions left"? If the contributions you've made while you've been a New Zealand tax resident satisfy all the following conditions, you may be allowed a deduction for these contributions: • • You must be a New Zealand tax resident and treated as a New Zealand tax resident under all applicable double tax agreements when the contributions are made. • • They must be made by you, your employer, or for your benefit. • • They are required under the rules of your foreign superannuation scheme. • • They're subject to employer superannuation contribution tax or fringe benefit tax if they're made by your employer. A given contribution may only be deducted once, and only the contributions made during the assessable period that fit the above criteria can be deducted. Insert the amount of contributions that satisfy all of these requirements in the "contributions left" part of the formula. This amount can't be greater than the amount of your foreign superannuation withdrawal. Calculating the "schedule years" To get the appropriate "schedule year %" calculate the number of income years that start in your assessable period. Then use the table (page 15) to get the corresponding percentage. If no income years have started in your assessable period, use the schedule year 1 percentage. For most people, the New Zealand income year starts on 1 April and ends on 31 March. If your income year is 1 April - 31 March, then your 2014 income year covers the period 1 April 2013 - 31 March 2014. If your income year begins on 1 April, an easy way to calculate the correct number of years to find your schedule year percentage is to count the number of times 1 April occurs during your assessable period. If the result is zero, eg your assessable period starts on 1 October and you receive your foreign superannuation withdrawal later that month, then you'll use year 1. ird.govt.nz 15 You can also find the correct number of years using the following steps: 1. Work out the last day of your four-year exemption period. If you don't have one, work out the last day you were a non-tax resident with an interest in your scheme. 2. Take note of the income year this date falls in. This is year A. 3. Also note the income year you receive the foreign superannuation withdrawal. This is year B. 4. Subtract year A from year B. This gives you the "year" to use in the table below. (If the result is zero, you use year 1). 5. Now find your percentage. Schedule year percentages YearPercentage % 14.76 29.45 314.06 418.60 523.07 627.47 731.80 836.06 940.26 1044.39 1148.45 1252.45 1356.39 1460.27 1564.08 1667.84 1771.53 1875.17 1978.75 2082.28 2185.74 2289.16 2392.58 2495.83 2599.08 26+100 OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 16 Steve became a New Zealand tax resident on 21 February 2006. On 12 August 2018, he withdrew $25,000 from his foreign superannuation scheme. He made no other withdrawals, and no further contributions were made after 21 February 2006. Steve's four-year exemption expired on 28 February 2010, which is in the 2010 income year (year A). The lump sum was withdrawn in the 2019 income year (year B). Year B (2019) − year A (2010) = 9, so the percentage to use is 40.26% - see highlighted row in the table (page 15). Steve must include $10,065 as assessable income in his 2019 tax return ($25,000 × 40.26% = $10,065). Example The formula method This method is an alternative to the schedule method and can only be used for foreign defined contribution schemes, if all of these conditions have been met: • • You must have the information required to use the formula method. • • You must not have received a distribution from the scheme before 1 April 2014, other than a pension or an annuity. • • You haven't used the schedule method before for this scheme. If the interest came from your previous partner after they died or as part of a relationship agreement following a relationship split, they must not have used the schedule method for the interest. The formula method uses a number of formulae. Because these are quite complex we recommend you talk with a tax professional if you're thinking about using this option. You’ll need to know: • • what the value of your scheme was at the beginning of your assessable period, • • the value of previous superannuation withdrawals (if any), and • • the value of your scheme before your most recent foreign superannuation withdrawal. For more information and examples read the Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 26 No 4 (May 2014). Go to ird.govt.nz/income-types ird.govt.nz 17 Tax on lump-sum withdrawals and transfers made between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014 If you received a payment or made a withdrawal prior to 1 April 2014 and you didn't pay any tax at the time, you may need to consider whether you have tax obligations in respect of previous years (generally for the 2013-14 and earlier years). If you made the withdrawal or transfer between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014 or applied to withdraw or transfer the amount by 31 March 2014, and you didn't comply with the tax laws at the time you can: • • pay tax on 15% of the withdrawn or transferred amount using the 15% option, or • • return your income by: –filing previous year tax returns using the tax rules that existed at the time of the withdrawal or when you held the interest (either ordinary tax rules or the FIF rules), or –asking us to amend previous year tax returns using the tax rules that existed at the time of the withdrawal or when you held the interest (either ordinary tax rules or the FIF rules). If you use the tax rules that existed at the time of the withdrawal or when you held the interest, you may need to pay penalties and use-of-money interest. However, if you: • • acquired your interest in a scheme while you were non- resident, and • • didn't receive any payments or make a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme before 1 April 2014, and • • haven't returned any income under the FIF rules then there's generally nothing you need to do in respect of previous tax years. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 18 15% option This option allows you to include 15% of the lump sum withdrawn or transferred as income in your tax return. You can use it if you've withdrawn a lump sum from or transferred your foreign superannuation scheme between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014, but didn't comply with your tax obligations at the time. The 15% option is also available if you made a formal request to withdraw or transfer your funds by 31 March 2014, even if you didn't receive the funds until after this date. If this applies to you and you want to use this option, you have to show us that you did everything you needed to do to withdraw or transfer your funds by 31 March 2014. If you meet this requirement, but don't want to use the 15% option, see the schedule and formula tax methods (page 11). The 15% must be returned in either your 2013-14 or 2014-15 income tax returns as overseas income. The corresponding 2013-14 or 2014-15 due dates for tax will apply. Kathryn transferred $150,000 from her foreign superannuation scheme to a New Zealand scheme in February 2004. She didn't include this income in her IR3 return for the 2003-04 income year, and didn't pay tax on her interest under the FIF rules. She decides to use the 15% option for her lump-sum transfer. She declares $22,500 (being 15% of $150,000) as income in her IR3 return for the 2014-15 income year. Kathryn will be liable for any penalties or use-of-money interest applied to her 2013-14 tax return, not her 2003-04 tax return. Example For further information and examples please refer to the Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 26 No 4 (May 2014). ird.govt.nz 19 KiwiSaver withdrawal facility If you transfer a lump sum from your foreign superannuation scheme into a KiwiSaver scheme, this could make it difficult for you to meet your resulting tax obligation, because KiwiSaver schemes are locked in until retirement. The withdrawal facility gives you the option to request a withdrawal from your KiwiSaver scheme to meet your income tax and student loan repayment obligations that arise from the transfer. The withdrawal amount is limited to the amount of tax and/or student loan repayment obligation. This facility isn't available for any resulting penalties and interest. The maximum amount that you may withdraw to meet your income tax obligation is the lesser of: • • your tax obligation resulting from the transfer of your foreign superannuation interest into a KiwiSaver scheme, and • • your terminal tax obligation for the tax year that your foreign superannuation income was assessed. The maximum amount you may withdraw to meet your student loan repayment obligation is the amount of repayment obligation that arose from the transfer of your foreign superannuation into a KiwiSaver scheme. To make an application for a withdrawal you need to have included the income resulting from the transfer in your income tax return. You must apply within 24 months from the end of the month that your income tax and/or student loan repayment obligation is assessed. Your KiwiSaver provider deals with the application and you're required to make a statutory declaration containing details of the tax obligation. If you're thinking about making a withdrawal from your KiwiSaver scheme to pay your tax obligation, contact your KiwiSaver provider for information about this. If you're thinking about using this withdrawal facility, remember that making a withdrawal could trigger obligations or conditions imposed when you transferred your foreign superannuation interest into KiwiSaver. This may include penalties imposed on withdrawals made within a certain period following migration (possibly under the rules of the scheme, or under the other country's law). OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 20 How we taxed your foreign superannuation scheme before 1 April 2014 Before 1 April 2014, your foreign superannuation scheme was taxed either: • • on the increase in value of your investment under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules, or • • if the FIF rules didn't apply, on any payments (income) from the scheme. This generally included pension payments, lump- sum withdrawals and transfers to other schemes. It's also possible that the temporary exemption for transitional residents may have applied to some or all of your payments. See page 7 for further details. These rules can be complex and you may want to get advice from a professional specialising in this area. If you still hold some of your interest in the foreign superannuation scheme see page 8. Foreign investment funds (FIF) Your interest in a foreign superannuation scheme was likely to have been a FIF before 1 April 2014, unless, for example it was a locked-in scheme (according to certain criteria), or an Australian superannuation scheme. The FIF rules generally didn't apply if all your overseas portfolio interests cost less than NZ$50,000, or in the first four years after you first became a New Zealand resident (before 1 April 2006). If the FIF rules applied, you needed to calculate your taxable FIF income for each year that you held the FIF interest under the FIF rules at the time, and include it in your Individual tax return - IR3 for those years. When your scheme was taxed as a FIF, no other income from the scheme was taxable in New Zealand. For more information about FIF, go to ird.govt.nz or read our Guide to foreign investment funds and the fair dividend rate method - IR461. ird.govt.nz 21 If the FIF rules didn't apply If the FIF rules didn't apply, you needed to pay tax on any income/payments you received from the foreign superannuation scheme. This generally included pension payments and, in some cases, lump-sum withdrawals and transfers from the scheme. If there were no payments or transfers from the scheme, there was no income to be returned for New Zealand tax purposes. If you did receive income or payments from the scheme, you were generally required to include the before-tax (gross) income in your Individual tax return - IR3. The amount of tax to pay generally depended on the legal structure of your foreign superannuation scheme such as whether the scheme was a company, trust, or unit trust. Christine is a new migrant and became a New Zealand tax resident on 30 January 2002. Christine transferred $150,000 from her foreign superannuation scheme to a New Zealand scheme in February 2004. She didn't include this income in her IR3 return for the 2003-04 income year. She decides to use the law that applied at the time she made the withdrawal to calculate the tax on her lump-sum transfer. In her situation, her interest wasn't an interest in a FIF, and the majority of her $150,000 was a return of capital, and only $2,000 of the amount was income. She has her 2003-04 IR3 return amended to include the $2,000. Christine will be liable for penalties and use-of-money interest from the 2003-04 income year. Example OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 22 How we tax your periodic pension Most periodic pensions received from foreign superannuation schemes are taxed in full and you need to include the before-tax (gross) income in your Individual tax return - IR3. However, in a very small number of cases, your periodic pension may be taxable in the other country which holds the taxing rights under a double tax agreement. See pages 26 and 27 under "Where a foreign tax credit is available" and "No tax in New Zealand". If you receive a social security pension, please refer to the Overseas social security pensions - IR258 guide for more information on how this is taxed in New Zealand. ird.govt.nz 23 How a double tax agreement could affect your New Zealand tax How the payments you receive from your foreign superannuation scheme (retirement lump sums and periodic pensions) are treated depends on whether New Zealand has a double tax agreement or a tax information exchange agreement with the country where your superannuation scheme is and whether the agreement contains an article on pension taxing rights. Each double tax agreement and tax information exchange agreement is different and may treat periodic pensions and retirement lump sums differently. It's important to check the terms of the appropriate double tax agreement or tax information exchange agreement to make sure you pay the right amount of tax and claim the right amount of foreign tax credits in your New Zealand tax return. You can find out more about New Zealand's double tax agreements, tax information exchange agreements and the right to tax pension income at ird.govt.nz/dta No foreign tax credit available If tax was paid overseas on pensions or retirement lump sums where the tax treaty rules didn't allow this, then you should apply to the foreign superannuation scheme administrators or to the overseas tax authorities for a refund. You can't claim the overseas tax paid as a foreign tax credit in your New Zealand tax return. You should also advise the foreign superannuation scheme administrators that you're a New Zealand tax resident and apply to have your pension paid without them deducting tax. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 24 If you're a tax resident of New Zealand and you receive UK pension payments, you need to do the following. • • Fill out the relevant HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) application form "Form New Zealand - Individual". This application form asks the UK tax authority not to tax UK income and also to refund UK income tax deducted from payments made. • • Send the form to us to certify you're a New Zealand tax resident at: Inland Revenue PO Box 39010 Wellington Mail Centre Lower Hutt 5045 These forms can be found at hmrc.gov.uk/cnr/nz\_indiv.pdf James, a former UK citizen, retired to New Zealand and became a New Zealand tax resident. He receives a yearly pension of £18,000 from his former UK employer, and £3,500 tax is deducted in the UK. Because his UK pension scheme was exempt from the FIF rules, he converts the before-tax amount into New Zealand dollars and declares this income in his Individual tax return - IR3 each year. Because the pension is only taxable in New Zealand under the tax treaty between New Zealand and the UK, he cannot claim the UK tax paid as a foreign tax credit in his IR3 return. Instead, James contacts HMRC to claim a refund and apply for an exemption so his pension will be paid free of any UK income tax in future. Example If you receive a pension from a country, other than the UK, and require assistance to apply for a refund, contact us at the address above. ird.govt.nz 25 Transitional residents If you're a transitional resident completing an application for double tax relief (such as the HMRC form mentioned previously) you should ensure you complete this form correctly. In particular, transitional residents should be careful not to elect out of the transitional residence rules by advising the foreign jurisdiction and Inland Revenue that the pension income received during the transitional residency has or will be subject to New Zealand tax. We'll generally treat this application as giving notice to Inland Revenue that you've made an election not to be a transitional resident if you confirm to the foreign jurisdiction and Inland Revenue that you've paid or will pay tax in New Zealand on the pension income from a date that falls within your transitional residency period. Once you've given us notice, you can't change your mind. If you're in any doubt, contact us before you send an application for double tax relief. If you have any questions about transitional residency, you can email us at Transactional.International@ird.govt.nz Please don't send any taxpayer or customer information to the email address. Part B of the HMRC form The HMRC form for relief referred to above asks at Part B, Question 2: "On what date did you become resident in New Zealand?" Question 3: "From what date have you paid, or will you pay, tax in New Zealand on income that you include in this claim? (This may differ from the date you have given in answer to Question 2.)" Where you don't have to pay tax in New Zealand on this income, you need to give the reason(s) on a separate sheet. If you're using this form you must include the date you paid or will pay tax in New Zealand on income included in this claim. For a transitional resident the pension is generally only taxable from the date when your transitional residency ends (or has ended), which is of course later than the date you become resident, so you need to enter that later date as the answer for this question. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 26 This later date won't impact on the requirement for the United Kingdom to provide relief from tax from the date you became a New Zealand tax resident. If you don't have to pay tax in New Zealand on the pension income this form relates to because you are or have been a transitional resident, you need to give details of your transitional residency on a separate sheet attached to the form. Contact us at the address (page 24) before you send us any application for double tax relief if you are in any doubt. Where a foreign tax credit is available In a few situations, New Zealand will give a foreign tax credit for income tax paid overseas. Generally this is where the tax treaty gives the source country the right to tax or partially tax the pension, or where there's no tax treaty with that country. To find out if you can claim a foreign tax credit on your overseas pension go to ird.govt.nz/dta Where a foreign tax credit is available, you need to include the before-tax (gross) income in your New Zealand tax return. You can then claim a tax credit for the tax paid overseas. If you're allowed to claim a tax credit in your New Zealand tax return for the tax paid overseas, the New Zealand foreign tax credit is limited to the lowest of the following: • • the actual tax paid overseas • • the amount of New Zealand tax you would pay on the same income • • the rate set out in the relevant tax treaty. New Zealand only has a partial right to tax a Russian social security pension - only 50% of the payment before tax (and 50% of the normally allowable foreign tax credits) should be included in your New Zealand tax return. You'll need to convert the tax paid on overseas income to New Zealand currency using the same method you used for the income (page 28). To claim a foreign tax credit, you must give us proof of the tax deducted, eg, an overseas tax deduction certificate. ird.govt.nz 27 No tax in New Zealand In a very small number of cases, New Zealand has no right to tax pension income and the income shouldn't be included in your New Zealand tax return. This applies, for example: • • to social security pensions from Finland, France, Germany (Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund), the Philippines, and the United States of America, and/or • • war pensions from France and Germany • • war pensions (and allowances) paid under the Dutch AVBP Scheme (Dutch (Benefit Act for Victims of Persecution 1940-1945) Scheme). In certain circumstances some pensions paid for government service may also be exempt from New Zealand tax. To find out whether or not your particular pension is taxable in New Zealand, go to ird.govt.nz/dta For information about overseas social security pensions, read our guide Overseas social security pensions - IR258. Australian pensions If you receive an Australian pension that would have been taxable in Australia had you received it while still resident there, then it's taxable in New Zealand and you need to include it in your New Zealand tax return. You can't claim a foreign tax credit. If you receive an Australian pension that wouldn't have been taxable in Australia had you received it while still resident there, then it's exempt in New Zealand and you don't need to include it in your New Zealand tax return. You also don't need to include lump sums from Australia paid: • • by a retirement benefit scheme • • as a result of retirement, invalidity, disability or death • • by way of compensation for injuries in your New Zealand tax return. These are taxed only in Australia. Contact the Australian Taxation Office to check if the Australian pension you receive would normally be taxed in Australia. OVERSEAS PENSIONS AND ANNUITY SCHEMES 28 Converting overseas currency amounts to New Zealand dollars You need to convert the overseas currency amounts (taxable income and foreign tax credit claims) into New Zealand dollars. Pension payments made to a New Zealand bank account will have already been converted to New Zealand dollars. Otherwise you can do the currency conversion by: • • going to ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax and using the latest rates • • getting the exchange rate for the day the pension went into your overseas bank account from any trading bank. To convert an amount of overseas currency to New Zealand dollars, divide the overseas amount by the rate for the month you received it. You must use the same conversion method for the whole year. You receive a UK payment of £2,400 in October 2010. The exchange rate in that month was 0.4729: £2,400 ÷ 0.4729 = NZ$5,075.07 Example ird.govt.nz 29 More help if you need it Need to speak with us?

Pension scheme - a savings plan, sometimes called superannuation or retirement plans, to accumulate funds for retirement. On retirement the scheme may pay out a lump sum, pension or both. They are often set up through an employer, trade union or insurance company. Permanent place of abode - to have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand there must be somewhere in New Zealand you could live, ie, a house or other dwelling. If there is somewhere in New Zealand you could live, all of your ties and links with New Zealand need to be considered to decide whether it's your permanent place of abode. The types of ties that are relevant are: • whether you make trips back to New Zealand and for how long • your past use of the dwelling in New Zealand • family and social ties • employment, economic and property ties • whether you intend to come back to New Zealand to live (and if you do, when). If you have strong ties to New Zealand it's likely you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, but all of your circumstances need to be considered. Social security pension - an income entitlement generally based on citizenship or residence and administered or paid by the government or state of a particular jurisdiction. For example, the State Pension in the United Kingdom (UK) and New Zealand Superannuation in New Zealand. Taxable income - income you have to pay tax on. ird.govt.nz 5 Introduction This guide explains your tax responsibilities when you receive an overseas social security pension. If you're a New Zealand tax resident, generally you're taxed on your overseas social security pension in New Zealand. Information in this guide includes: • working out whether you're a New Zealand tax resident • receiving your overseas social security pension • calculating and paying New Zealand income tax • your New Zealand tax obligations • examples of calculating your tax when receiving a social security pension • whether you can claim a tax credit in your New Zealand tax return for tax paid overseas. The rules for paying tax on overseas social security pensions can be complex and you may want to get advice from a tax advisor specialising in this area. Are you a New Zealand tax resident? If you're a New Zealand tax resident, you generally have to include your worldwide income in your New Zealand tax return, unless that income is specifically exempted. This includes your overseas social security pension. You're a New Zealand tax resident (for tax purposes) if: • you have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, or • you've been in New Zealand for more than 183 days in any 12-month period and haven't become a non-resident, or • you're away from New Zealand in the service of the New Zealand Government. OVERSEAS SOCIAL SECURITY PENSIONS 6 You become a non-resident for tax purposes if: • you don't have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, and • you're away from New Zealand for more than 325 days in any 12-month period (these don't have to be consecutive days, and if you're here for only part of a day it's counted as a whole day). Temporary tax exemption on foreign income From 1 April 2006, new migrants and returning New Zealanders may be eligible for a temporary exemption from tax on most types of individual income derived from overseas, including overseas social security income. To be eligible for this temporary tax exemption you must: • have qualified as a tax resident in New Zealand on or after 1 April 2006, and • be a new migrant or returning New Zealander who hasn't been a New Zealand tax resident at any time in the 10 years prior to qualifying as a New Zealand tax resident, and • you haven't been a transitional resident at all before • not have been receiving Working for Families Tax Credits (this applies for your spouse or partner). If you qualify, you will be known as a transitional resident, and the tax exemption is automatically granted. The temporary tax exemption for foreign income starts on the first day you're a tax resident here. It ends 48 months after the month you qualify as a tax resident in New Zealand. You can elect not to be a transitional resident. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/tax-residency or read our guide New Zealand tax residence - IR292. ird.govt.nz 7 Receiving your overseas social security pension Generally, if you're entitled to NZ Super or a New Zealand benefit or pension, Work and Income will pay you any difference between your New Zealand entitlement and the amount of your overseas pension entitlement, so you don't lose out. There are two ways you can receive your overseas social security pension in New Zealand. Pension paid direct to you Your overseas social security pension may be paid direct into your New Zealand or overseas bank account on a regular basis during the year, or in a lump sum once a year, depending on the pension. Some overseas social security pensions are also taxable in the country you receive them from, even if you're a New Zealand resident. You may be able to claim a tax credit in your New Zealand tax return for tax you pay overseas. However, in most circumstances, New Zealand has full taxing rights on pensions. If tax was paid overseas on these particular pensions you should apply to the overseas pension scheme administrator or the overseas tax authority for a refund. You can't claim the overseas tax paid as a foreign tax credit in your New Zealand tax return. If you receive your overseas pension payments straight into your bank account, you must arrange to pay New Zealand income tax on the payments. You do this by completing an Individual tax return - IR3 at the end of each tax year - see page 10 for details. Special banking option Some overseas social security pensions can be paid through Work and Income using the special banking option. Under this option your overseas pension is deposited into a special Westpac bank account. Work and Income withdraws the funds and pays you an equivalent amount of NZ Super, veteran's pension or income-tested benefit. OVERSEAS SOCIAL SECURITY PENSIONS 8 Work and Income deducts New Zealand income tax from the payment before you receive it so you don't need to arrange this yourself. However, you will be sent an Income tax assessment at the end of each tax year - see page 12 for details. If you also receive direct payments of holiday pay and/or a voluntary component, you must arrange to pay New Zealand income tax on them. For more information about the special banking option, please contact your nearest Work and Income service centre or call them on 0800 777 227. Who can use the special banking option United Kingdom The special banking option is available to you if you receive pension payments from the UK Department of Work and Pensions. Netherlands The special banking option is available if you receive a Netherlands social security pension. Any additional Netherlands social security payments, such as holiday pay or any voluntary component will continue to be paid direct to you without any tax deducted. If you receive any of these you must arrange to pay New Zealand income tax on them. Ireland If you receive an Irish social security pension, you can choose to receive it either direct or by the special banking option. If you receive a Christmas bonus payment paid through the special bank account, Work and Income will pay this amount to your personal bank account. You must arrange to pay New Zealand income tax on these payments. Australia The special banking option is available if you receive a taxable Australian social security pension. If you have any questions about your overseas pension entitlements, please contact the relevant overseas agency direct. ird.govt.nz 9 Calculating and paying New Zealand income tax If you're a New Zealand tax resident, your overseas social security pension is generally taxable in New Zealand. Most overseas social security pensions are paid straight to recipients. This means you need to pay New Zealand income tax on the income by completing an Individual tax return (IR3) at the end of each tax year. You may also: • use a tailored tax code • pay provisional tax • make voluntary payments. If you receive your overseas social security pension through the special banking option, Work and Income deducts New Zealand income tax from the payment before you receive it so you don't need to arrange this yourself. However, you will be sent an Income tax assessment at the end of each t a x year. If you also receive payments of holiday pay and/or a voluntary component direct, you must arrange to pay New Zealand income tax on them. United States social security pensions A social security pension from the United States isn't taxable in New Zealand so doesn't need to be included in your tax return. Netherlands social security pensions If you receive a Netherlands social security pension while both a New Zealand tax resident and a New Zealand citizen, the pension is only taxable in New Zealand. If you receive a Netherlands social security pension while a New Zealand tax resident but you're not a New Zealand citizen, the pension may be subject to tax in both the Netherlands and New Zealand. New Zealand will allow a credit for the tax paid in the Netherlands under New Zealand's foreign tax credit rules. OVERSEAS SOCIAL SECURITY PENSIONS 10 Australian social security pensions If you receive an Australian social security pension that wouldn't have been taxable in Australia had you received it while still resident there, then it's exempt in New Zealand and you don't need to include it in your New Zealand tax return. In addition, lump sums paid from Australia as retirement benefit schemes resulting from invalidity, disability or death are only taxable in Australia so don't need to be included in your New Zealand tax return. If you're unsure if the Australian pension you receive is tax- free in Australia, you can contact the Australian Taxation Office for further advice. ird.govt.nz 11 Your New Zealand tax obligations As a New Zealand tax resident receiving an overseas social security pension, you'll need an IRD number and to know what your filing responsibilities are. Getting an IRD number If you haven't had a personal New Zealand IRD number before, you'll need to apply for one by filling in an IRD number application - individual - IR595 form and following the verification process. When you receive your IRD number, you'll need to have it with you when you call us. If you've had a New Zealand IRD number before, call us on 0800 227 774 to check it's still valid. When you need to file an Individual tax return - IR3 You need to complete an IR3 if you: • receive your overseas social security pension direct • receive other overseas income or have overseas investments • have other untaxed income over $200 • are in business • receive income from some New Zealand investments. If you received any untaxed payments direct, you must include these in your tax calculation. Find out more at ird.govt.nz/end-of-tax-year If you receive an Income tax assessment You will receive an Income tax assessment if we have all your income information for the tax year. Your assessment shows if you are due a refund or if you have tax to pay. OVERSEAS SOCIAL SECURITY PENSIONS 12 Paying your tax Estimating the approximate amount of tax to pay is a good way of working out if you'll have one tax payment (end-of-year tax) or have to pay it regularly during the year (provisional tax). How to estimate your tax When estimating your yearly taxable income, you need to treat your overseas social security pension as the "top dollar" of your income and use the top tax rate for estimating your pension income. Tax rates are progressive. For example, if you earn $71,000 a year, the first $14,000 is taxed at the lowest tax rate. The amount between $14,001 and $48,000 is taxed at the next level. Between $48,001 and $70,000 the tax is at the third level and any income over $70,000 is taxed at the highest rate. See the personal tax rates at ird.govt.nz/tax-rates Note The following information applies if your tax year ends on 31 March (standard balance date). If your balance date is different, some of your payment dates may also be different. Making an end-of-year payment If you have tax to pay, you must pay it by 7 February of the following year, or 7 April if you're linked to a tax agent with an extension of time. You can pay in a lump sum on or before the due date, or you can make a series of payments up to the due date. Paying provisional tax If your tax to pay (residual income tax) is more than $5,000 ($2,500 for 2019/20 and earlier years) and you expect it to be over $5,000 for the following year, you may have to pay provisional tax. ird.govt.nz 13 Most people pay provisional tax in three instalments during the income year - on 28 August, 15 January and 7 May. When you file your tax return after 31 March, the amount you have paid is deducted from the tax due in your return. If you're registered for GST and you make your GST payment six-monthly, or use the ratio option, your provisional tax payment dates will alter. Read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide for more information. In the year following your first year as a provisional tax payer, you'll have the previous year's end-of-year tax bill to pay, plus your three provisional tax instalments. Example Rita becomes a provisional tax payer for the first time in the 2020 tax year. She must pay: • the first instalment of her 2020 provisional tax on 28 August 2019 • the second instalment of her 2020 provisional tax on 15 January 2020 • her 2019 end-of-year tax on 7 February 2019 • the last instalment of her 2020 provisional tax on 7 May 2020. Using a tailored tax code If you receive NZ Super or income from employment in New Zealand, you can request a tailored tax code. This means tax is deducted at a special rate to suit your circumstances. So, instead of having to pay the tax on your overseas social security pension in a lump sum at the end of the year, you pay the tax progressively throughout the year, based on your estimated income. OVERSEAS SOCIAL SECURITY PENSIONS 14 Please note the following points if you're thinking about applying for a tailored tax code: • You can't have a tailored tax code on interest or dividends, a widow's benefit or any other income-tested benefit, or on a non-taxable pension (such as the Government Superannuation fund or life insurance funds). • You can choose to have a tailored tax code that covers only part of your tax liability and pay the rest of your tax in another way. • Using a tailored tax code may reduce your residual income tax so you're not liable for provisional tax. For more information about tailored tax codes, read our guide How to tell if you need a tailored tax code or declaration rate - IR23G. Making voluntary payments You can choose to make voluntary payments during the year as you receive your pension, instead of one lump sum at the end of the year. There's no formal procedure for making voluntary payments - you can choose the payment method most convenient for you and we'll credit your account. You can direct credit the amount (electronically through your bank). Please make sure you give us your IRD number, tax type and tax year when you make any payments, so we credit the right account. Keep a record of how much you pay in voluntary payments or ask us to send you a statement. You need to know how much you've already paid when you make your final payment of income tax or when you work out your tax return for the following year. To find out more about the different ways you can pay your tax, read our Making payments to Inland Revenue - IR584. ird.govt.nz 15 Keep your payment records Special banking option If you use the special banking option for your overseas social security pension, Work and Income will keep a record of your overseas pension payments. Payments received direct If you receive your overseas social security pension direct, you need to keep a record of the amounts you receive and the dates you receive them. You can use the chart on page 22 for this. You must also keep bank or internet banking statements or bank books as proof of your payments throughout the year. Payments received in a New Zealand bank account If you receive the payments in a New Zealand bank account, they'll be converted to New Zealand dollars on the day they go into your account. You can use the chart on page 22 to keep a record of them. You must also keep your bank statements or bank books as proof of your payments throughout the year. OVERSEAS SOCIAL SECURITY PENSIONS 16 Converting overseas amounts to New Zealand currency When preparing your tax returns you'll need to convert the overseas amounts (pension income and foreign tax credit claims) into New Zealand currency. If you receive your pension in a New Zealand bank account it will already have been converted to New Zealand dollars. Otherwise, you can do the currency conversion: • by going to ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators and using the latest rates • by using the mid-month exchange rates published in our Conversion of New Zealand dollars to overseas currency - IR270 exchange rate worksheet. The IR270 is published in May each year and covers the previous 12 months • by getting the exchange rate for the day the pension went into your overseas bank account (available from any trading bank). To convert an amount of overseas currency to New Zealand dollars, divide the overseas amount by the rate for the month you received it. You must use the same conversion method for the whole year. Example To convert a UK payment of £2,400 paid in August 2019: UK£2,400 ÷ 0.4729 = NZ$4626.06 ird.govt.nz 17 Examples of taxing pensions People receiving pensions in New Zealand come from all around the world, and we have double tax agreements with many countries. All the agreements are different and so are the rules for where and how pensions are taxed. Arrangements for countries we don't have agreements with are different again. The following examples cover the main situations for overseas pensioners. If you need more detailed information, go to ird.govt.nz/dta or contact a tax professional. Salary, interest and an overseas social security pension This is Keith's estimated income for the 2020 income year. Salary (NZ)$27,000 Interest (NZ)$3,000 UK social security pension (paid direct)$5,000 Total income$35,000 Keith will only have to pay tax on the UK pension. His salary and interest already have tax deducted when he receives them. Because he receives overseas income but isn't a transitional resident (see page 6), he'll have to file an IR3 for 2020. The tax to pay on his UK social security pension will be $875 ($5,000 × 17.5%), so his residual income tax will be under $5,000. Keith's payment options are to: • have a tailored tax code for his salary • make voluntary payments up to 7 February 2021 (or 7 April 2021 if he's linked to a tax agent) • pay the end-of-year tax on 7 February 2021 (or 7 April 2021 if linked to a tax agent). OVERSEAS SOCIAL SECURITY PENSIONS 18 If Keith's UK pension was also taxed in the UK, he can't claim a credit for the tax he paid overseas in his New Zealand tax return. He must contact HM Revenue & Customs to claim a refund and an exemption so his pension will in future be paid free of any future UK income tax. For more information go to HMRC.gov.uk/pensioners Overseas social security pension deducted from a Work and Income benefit or pension Theo's 2020 income is given below. Greek social security pension$6,000 NZ Super top-up from Work and Income$14,235 Total income$20,235 Because he receives overseas income but isn't a transitional resident (see page 6), he'll have to file an IR3 for 2020. The tax to pay on his Greek pension will be $1,050 ($6,000 × 17.5%), so his residual income tax will be under $5,000. Theo's payment options are to: • have a tailored tax code for his NZ Super • make voluntary payments up to 7 February 2021 (or 7 April 2021 if Theo is linked to a tax agent) • pay the end-of-year tax on 7 February 2021 (or 7 April 2021 if he's linked to a tax agent). If Theo's Greek pension was also taxed in Greece, he can claim a credit for the tax he paid overseas in his New Zealand tax return. He can only claim income tax paid and not social insurance or other levies because these are not substantially the same as New Zealand income tax. If Theo requests a tailored tax code for his NZ Super, he'll have little or no end-of-year tax to pay. ird.govt.nz 19 New Zealand salary and an overseas pension This is Costa's estimated income for the 2020 tax year. Salary (NZ)$40,000 Greek social security pension$18,000 Total income$58,000 Costa will have $5,400 tax to pay on his overseas pension ($18,000 × 30%) and he'll have to file an IR3. Because this is over $5,000 he'll need to pay provisional tax in 2021. Instead of paying provisional tax, Costa could cover the $5,400 by using a tailored tax code for his salary. Overseas pension and New Zealand interest and dividends This is Carol's income for the 2020 tax year. Overseas social security pension $12,000 Interest and dividends (NZ)$14,000 Overseas private pension$19,500 Total income$45,500 Carol is a provisional tax payer because the tax due on the overseas pensions will be over $5,000 ($12,000 + $19,500 = $31,500; $31,500 × 17.5% = $5,512.50) and she'll have to file an IR3. She can't use a tailored tax code because she has no New Zealand income. Carol's provisional tax to pay will be due in three equal instalments - on 28 August 2020, 15 January 2021 and 7 May 2021. Carol may be entitled to claim a credit for any tax she's already paid, depending on which country paid her pension.

Depreciation - a guide for businesses IR260 July 2019 2 DEPRECIATION www.ird.govt.nz 3 The information in this guide is based on the tax laws at the time of printing. Introduction This guide explains how to claim depreciation on your business assets. You're required to claim depreciation when you acquire an asset for your business and account for it when you dispose of that asset. We recommend you consult a tax agent when considering claiming for depreciation. However, it's still your responsibility to be aware of your tax obligations. Find the current depreciation rates by: using our Depreciation rate finder checking our General depreciation rates (IR265) guide. You'll find both of these at www.ird.govt.nz The rates are set out in two categories - industry and asset.

In legal terms, depreciable intangible assets, depreciable assets, excluded depreciable assets, fixed-life depreciable assets and intangible assets are known as "property". In this guide we refer to them as assets to avoid confusion, because the term "property" more commonly relates to land and buildings.

For tax purposes, the reduced value of an asset is recognised by allowing a deduction against income for the depreciation of that asset from the time it is used in a business until it is sold, disposed of or discarded. This means the cost of the asset will be written off over its useful life. Once the whole cost price of the asset has been written off, no further deduction is allowed. When you calculate your depreciation deduction it's important to remember: the date you acquired the asset, since this determines which rates are available to you which industry and/or asset category best describes your depreciable asset. Main features of depreciation law From the 1994 income year, depreciation law relates to all depreciable assets regardless of the date you acquired them. You must make depreciation deductions each year, unless you make an election not to treat a particular asset as depreciable. You can only claim a depreciation deduction once you own the asset and it's used or available for use in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Depreciation is calculated according to the number of months in an income year you own and use the asset. A daily basis applies to certain assets used in the petroleum industry. From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. You may not claim depreciation in the year you dispose of any asset, unless it's a building. Although the general depreciation rates are set by a formula, you can apply for a higher or lower special depreciation rate if you can establish the general rate is unsuitable for your particular circumstances. Higher depreciation rates, previously available for assets used for multiple shifts, do not apply to assets acquired after 1 April 1993. Expenditure for repairs and maintenance can be claimed as a deduction through business accounts. Anything more than repairs or maintenance is capital expenditure and isn't deductible, but will be subject to normal depreciation rules. In general terms the depreciation rate options available are as follows: 1. You must use the general rates set out in determinations we issue. For assets acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, use the rates listed in the General depreciation rates (IR265) guide. 2. For assets acquired between the 1996 income year and 31 March 2005 (or 18 May 2005 for buildings, including contracts of purchase entered into before 19 May 2005) use the rates listed in parts 2 and 3 of the Historic depreciation rates (IR267) guide. 3. For assets acquired on or after 1 April 1993, and before the end of the 1995 income year, you can use either the rates listed in parts 2 and 3 of the Historic depreciation rates (IR267) guide or the rates listed in part 1 of this guide plus 25% interim loading and any shift allowances. 4. Generally, for assets acquired before 1 April 1993 you must use the depreciation rates listed in part 1 of the Historic depreciation rates (IR267) guide. Both straight line and diminishing value methods are available for calculating depreciation on most assets and you can switch freely between the two. Assets that cost or have an adjusted tax value of $5,000 or less can be depreciated collectively, rather than individually, using the "pool" depreciation method. 6 DEPRECIATION Part 1 Subject to certain rules, assets costing $500 or less can be written off in the year of purchase or creation. Certain intangible assets first used or available for use after 1 April 1993 have been brought into the depreciation system. Intangible assets with a fixed life must be depreciated using the straight line method. Gains on sale or disposal must be recognised in the year of sale. Losses on sales of depreciable assets, other than buildings, are deductible in the year of sale. There are restrictions on the depreciation deductions that can be made to depreciable assets transferred between associated parties. From 1 April 1997, only those companies that are 100% commonly owned and that choose to consolidate are able to transfer assets within their group at the assets' adjusted tax value. Wholly owned companies which don't form a consolidated group are required to transfer assets at market value and recover or claim a loss of depreciation as applicable. You may be able to write off the residual tax value of any depreciable asset that you no longer use to derive gross income. Some assets can't be depreciated for income tax purposes either because they are specifically exempted (for example, land or trading stock) or they don't reduce in value over time (for example, Lotto franchise fees). A depreciation loading no longer applies for assets acquired after 20 May 2010. The loading will only apply to qualifying assets: –acquired on or before 20 May 2010, or –where a binding contract existed on or before 20 May 2010. Compulsory depreciation claims You must claim the amount of depreciation you are entitled to unless you elect an asset not to be depreciable property. It's usually not possible to defer or only partially claim allowable depreciation. If no depreciation deduction is claimed and no election is made, you're considered to have claimed depreciation for the purposes of calculating the adjusted tax value of the asset and when calculating the depreciation recovered (see "Disposals" on page 25). If you don't claim depreciation in your tax return, the adjusted tax value of the asset will still be reduced by the amount calculated using the appropriate method. The default method for calculating depreciation is diminishing value. For depreciation recovery purposes, where the depreciable asset is disposed of for more than the adjusted tax value, then the taxable income will be the lesser of: the previously allowed depreciation (including deemed to be allowed), or the amount by which the amount received exceeds the adjusted tax value. For assets purchased before the 1994 income year, and depending on the disposal amount, the depreciation recovered is the actual depreciation permitted under the old system (when the depreciation deduction was not compulsory) plus the allowable depreciation for the 1994 and subsequent income years. Taxpayers don't have to have claimed extra depreciation on excluded depreciable assets (generally, meaning assets purchased before 1 April 1993). This extra depreciation is allowed as either: a supplementary depreciation allowance, or a 25% interim loading. Electing not to depreciate Although it's compulsory for you to claim a depreciation deduction, we recognise there can be instances where you may not want to. If you don't want to claim depreciation on an asset, and you want to avoid paying tax on depreciation recovered when it was not claimed, you should elect not to treat the asset as depreciable. You can't pick and choose the years in which you depreciate an asset. However, if an asset periodically will be and then won't be used in your business (such as a residential building that is temporarily let), you may choose whether or not to depreciate the asset in each period. Our Rental income (IR264) guide discusses this option in more detail. If you elect not to depreciate your asset, it will no longer be a depreciable asset and the depreciation recovery or loss on sale provisions won't apply to it. www.ird.govt.nz 7 Part 1 From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note Who can claim depreciation? A depreciation deduction for a particular asset is only allowed once you own the asset and it's used or available for use in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Ownership You're considered to own an asset when: you acquire legal title (binding contract), or you take up beneficial ownership, which occurs when an asset passes by way of gift, bequest or distribution to a new owner. Where there is both an equitable owner and a legal owner of the same asset, depreciation may only be claimed by the owner who uses the asset or has that asset available for use in deriving their gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate their gross income. So, to claim a depreciation deduction for an asset, you must: own it, or lease it under a specified or finance lease (see page 15), or be buying it under a hire purchase agreement. Your asset must also be expected to reduce in value while it's used or is available for use in your business. Used or available for use The following are some examples of the criteria of "used" or "available for use". You can't start claiming depreciation on any equipment purchased until your business commences. How to make an election not to depreciate You'll need to let us know if you're making an election by attaching your notification to your tax return for the income year that you: purchase the asset, or changed the asset use from non-business to business, or elect not to depreciate an asset that you've not claimed depreciation on in any previous year. This election will then apply to every year from when the asset was purchased. Your notification needs to provide the following details: a description of the asset the purchase date the income year the election is being made for whether the asset has been newly acquired or its use has changed if the election is for retrospective depreciation. Assets that don't depreciate Some assets don't depreciate for tax purposes. These assets include: those you've elected to treat as not depreciable trading stock land (except for buildings, fixture or land improvements as specified in Schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007) financial arrangements under the accrual rules intangible assets, for example, goodwill (other than depreciable intangible assets of the type listed in Schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) low-value assets (costing less than $500) that are fully written off on acquisition an asset whose cost is allowed as a deduction under some other tax provision an asset that doesn't decline in economic value because of compensation for loss or damage an asset whose cost was or is allowed as a deduction in any income year to any other taxpayer under any of the special provisions relating to primary sector land improvements. 8 DEPRECIATION Part 1 In April 2014, Enid purchases equipment in anticipation of setting up a home tutoring business but doesn't start the business until March 2015. The depreciation deduction for Enid's 2015 income year is restricted to one-twelfth of the yearly depreciation rate. Example Cargo ship in dry docks - conducting normal ongoing maintenance is an ordinary incidence of business and the ship would still be wholly used or available for use in carrying on the business. Plant and machinery finished and awaiting other plant - depending on the facts, if the completed plant and machinery were available for use in isolation or in another production line if required, the depreciation could be claimed. However, if a further machine or plant was required in order to produce a product, depreciation could not commence until that other necessary plant or machinery was available for use. Plant and machinery in storage - this depends on the degree and time of reconnection or installation required. If the item (for example, a transformer) were a back-up piece of equipment necessary to keep an operation going, it would be regarded as being available for use and would be depreciable. However, if a new piece of machinery or a new plant were being delivered and had yet to be installed (for example, being shipped in from offshore) there would be no entitlement to depreciation until the installation process was completed. Assets temporarily out of operation for repair or inspection are regarded as being available for use and can be depreciated. Cost of assets for depreciation purposes Generally, the cost of an asset is the amount paid by the purchaser - normally the market value - and this principle applies to associated persons. For further information on transfers between associated persons see page 25. If the property has been inherited, the cost price for depreciation purposes is its market value at the time the property is transferred to the new owner. The exception is for a spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner where transfer is at cost or adjusted tax value. For income tax purposes a deduction isn't usually available for expenses incurred in acquiring a capital asset. This includes legal fees charged by a solicitor for preparing and registering the various documents relating to the purchase. From the 2010 income year business-related legal expenses for buying or selling a property can be deducted. This is provided your total legal expenses for the income year, including the fees associated with buying and selling a property, are equal to or less than $10,000. In all other cases, this type of expenditure may be added to the cost of the purchased asset when calculating depreciation on that asset. The depreciation you calculate each year is deducted from the value of your asset. The remaining value is called the asset's adjusted tax value. GST and depreciation If you're registered for GST (goods and services tax), you can generally claim a credit for the GST part of an asset's cost price. You calculate depreciation on the GST-exclusive price of the asset. If you aren't registered for GST, you base your depreciation on the actual price you pay for an asset, including GST. www.ird.govt.nz 9 Part 1 Records As with all tax matters you must keep sufficient and accurate records. For depreciation purposes, your records must be able to substantiate your depreciation claims, purchases and sales of your business assets so, if we need to, we can check your deductions (including losses) and depreciation recovered. You must keep your records for at least seven years. Individual or pooled assets You can account for depreciation on your assets in two ways, as an individual asset or as part of a group or pool of assets. See "Pooling method" in the next column. If you choose to calculate depreciation on individual assets you can use either the diminishing value (DV) method of calculating depreciation or the straight line (SL) method. If you decide to group your assets into a pool you must use the DV method for calculating depreciation. Diminishing value (DV) method With this method depreciation is calculated each year by using a constant percentage of the asset's adjusted tax value. This method is sometimes also referred to as the written down value or tax book value. The DV method means your depreciation deduction will progressively reduce each year. Depreciation on office equipment that cost $10,000 was calculated using the DV depreciation rate of 33%. The depreciation is calculated as follows: Adjusted tax valueDepreciation of 33% Year 1 $10,000$3,300 Year 2 $6,700$2,211 Ye a r 3$4,489$1,481 Example Straight line (SL) method With this method an asset depreciates every year by the same amount, which is a percentage of its original cost price. This method is sometimes called the cost price basis. Depreciation on office equipment that cost $10,000 was calculated using the SL depreciation rate of 24%. The depreciation is calculated as follows: Adjusted tax valueDepreciation of 24% Year 1 $10,000$2,400 Year 2 $7,600$2,400 Ye a r 3$5,200$2,400 Example Changing methods You can choose to use either the SL or DV method for individual assets (except for pooled assets and fixed- life intangible assets) regardless of when you bought the assets. If you decide to change depreciation methods, use the current adjusted tax value to calculate depreciation and not the original cost price of the asset. Once you've filed your tax return you can't change methods for that income year. Pooling method The pooling method allows you to group together (pool) a number of low-value assets and calculate depreciation on the pool. The advantage of pooling assets is the cost of compliance is reduced because all the assets in the pool are treated as one asset for the purposes of depreciation. The disadvantage of pooling assets is that if you sell an asset in a pool for more than its cost price, this capital gain amount must be included as taxable income. Main features of the pooling method Only diminishing value (DV) rates can be used for the pool method. Where items in the pool have different depreciation rates, the lowest rate is applied to the pool. Buildings can't be depreciated using the pooling method. The maximum pooling value is generally $5,000 for each individual asset, but you may apply for a higher pooling value for specific assets - see page 34. For GST-registered people, the maximum pooling value excludes GST. 10 DEPRECIATION Part 1 The maximum pooling value of $5,000 applies from the 2015-2016 income year. The maximum pooling value is $2,000 prior to this. All poolable assets must be used wholly in business (no private use), or be subject to FBT (fringe benefit tax). Once an asset is included in a pool it can't be separated out later, except where the asset must be isolated because you now use it privately. There is no restriction on the depreciation recovered for a pooled asset. Any capital gains are taxed - see page 26. When all assets in a pool have been disposed of but the pool still has a positive value, ie, the proceeds of the sale are less than the pool value, this remaining value of the pool is deductible from your gross income. Calculating depreciation for an asset pool Assets can only be pooled if individual assets within the pool each have a value equal to or less than the maximum pooling value. This maximum is currently set at $5,000, so assets that can be pooled are those that: individually cost you $5,000 or less, or have depreciated and whose adjusted tax value has been reduced to $5,000 or less. Hiram bought a printing machine for $5,500 and calculated depreciation using the DV method. CostDepreciation 10% DV Adjusted tax value at the end of year $5,500$550$4,950 Hiram could include the printing machine in a pool of assets for the second year. Example If your assets meet this requirement, you may pool any number of them and you may have as many pools as suit your circumstances. You can also combine two or more pools to form one pool. The maximum pooling value of $5,000 applies from the 2015-2016 income year. The maximum pooling value is $2,000 prior to this. Note Depreciation is calculated on the average value of the pool for the income year, using the DV method. Work out the average value of the pool by adding together the pool's value at the beginning and end of the income year, before depreciation has been deducted, and then dividing by two. Adam has a pool of assets with an adjusted tax value at the beginning of the year of $18,000. During the year he purchases three assets for $5,000 each. At the end of the year, he decides to include them in the pool. The value of the pool at the end of the income year (before deducting depreciation) is $33,000. The average pool value is: $18,000 + $33,000 =$25,500 2 Adam is using the DV rate of 22%, so the depreciation deduction and the adjusted tax value of the pool will be calculated as follows: Value of pool at the end of income year 33,000 Less annual depreciation ($25,500 x 22%) -$5,610 Adjusted tax value of pool$27,390 Example Where your income year is longer or shorter than 12 months because of a change in balance date, you'll need to apportion the annual depreciation to the number of whole or part months in your income year. When the assets in the pool have different depreciation rates you must use the lowest rate. This could happen when different types of assets are included in a pool. Richard owns a shop and these are some of his assets that he could pool. Cash register 40% DV Electric sign 20% DV Fittings 20% DV Furniture 20% DV The rate for this pool would be 20% DV. In a case such as this, Richard may decide to pool only those assets with the 20% DV depreciation rate and account for depreciation on the cash register separately or as an asset in another pool. Example www.ird.govt.nz 11 Part 1 In the first year of pooling, it's very important to carefully consider the date from which you'll pool your assets, because it will have a significant effect on the average pool value used when calculating depreciation. If you decide to pool your assets part-way through an income year, the pool value at the beginning of the income year will be nil. The amount of depreciation you can claim will be based on half the pool value at the end of the income year. Anne starts a business on 15 May 2013 and purchases five assets for $2,000 each, which she pools. She has a 31 March balance date and uses a depreciation rate of 20% DV. Her 2014 depreciation deduction is calculated as follows: Calculate average pool value: Pool value at beginning of year (1 April 2013)nil Pool value at end of year (31 March 2014)$10,000 Divide by 2 to average$5,000 Calculate annual depreciation: $5,000 x 20% x 11 months = $916.66 depreciation 12 (The 11 months is 15 May 2013 to 31 March 2014.) Example Adding assets to a pool The adjusted tax value of an existing pool is increased by: the cost price of the asset (if it's newly acquired), or the adjusted tax value of the asset (if it was previously depreciated separately). If assets are added to the pool at the beginning of an income year, the pool values at both the beginning and end of the year will increase. If the assets are added to the pool part-way through the income year, only the pool value at the end of the year will increase. Rates Once you've decided on the method (or methods) you'll use to account for depreciation, you have to identify the correct rate for calculating the amount of the deduction. The correct depreciation rate to use depends on the date you acquired the asset. To find the depreciation rates for all depreciable assets acquired after 1 April 1993, use our depreciation rate finder at www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: rate finder). For assets acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, use the rates listed in the General depreciation rates (IR265) guide. For all assets acquired before these dates refer to our Historic depreciation rates (IR267) guide. These guides are available from "Forms and guides" on our website. Loading Any asset purchased from 21 May 2010 onwards isn't entitled to the 20% depreciation loading. If you entered into a contract to purchase an asset on or before 20 May 2010, you can still depreciate this asset with the loading. Any asset being depreciated at a rate with loading before 21 May 2010 can continue to be depreciated at that rate for that asset's lifetime. However, if there is a capital improvement to an asset with the 20% loading, this improvement will need to be depreciated separately from the original asset, and will be depreciated without the loading allowance. Provisional and special rates If we haven't set a general depreciation rate for your particular type of asset, you may apply for a provisional rate to be set - see page 33. General depreciation rates are based on the average use of an asset. If you believe you use your asset more heavily or less heavily than is generally the case, or the conditions in which the asset is used are abnormal, you may want to apply for a special rate - see page 32. How rates are calculated If you'd like to know how we work out the general rates for assets see page 30. 12 DEPRECIATION Part 2 Buildings aren't eligible for the special deduction for assets you no longer use - see page 35. Generally, when a personal (non-business) asset is introduced into a business, the market value at that time is used to calculate depreciation. This rule doesn't apply to buildings, where the original cost (excluding land) must be used for calculating depreciation. Buildings transferred between companies where there is 100% common ownership or transfers under a relationship agreement can continue to use the depreciation rate applying to the building at the time of transfer. Depreciation claims on buildings acquired before the 1994 income year must be calculated using the SL method. However, you can choose between the SL and the DV methods to calculate depreciation for the 1994 and future income years on assets acquired before 1 April 1993. Depreciation on buildings is calculated on either the original cost or the adjusted tax value depending on which depreciation method you use. The first time you use the DV method you need to calculate the adjusted tax value of your building. The building's depreciation is calculated on this amount. To work out the adjusted tax value, deduct the amount of depreciation you've claimed since you bought the building, from the original cost of the building (excluding land). Sale of buildings When a building is sold for more than its adjusted tax value, the depreciation recovered is taxable income. The amount of depreciation recovered is the smaller of: the original cost price of the building minus the adjusted tax value the sale price minus the adjusted tax value. This ensures any capital profit made on the sale of a building isn't included as taxable income. Losses made when selling or disposing of buildings are generally not deductible. This section provides further information on certain assets of particular interest. Buildings From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties, including leasehold property. If the type of building you own currently has an estimated useful life, as determined by Inland Revenue, of less than 50 years you can simply continue to claim depreciation deductions as you have previously. Even though many buildings can no longer be depreciated, depreciation recovery will still apply for those buildings when they're sold for greater than their book value. This applies regardless of when the building was acquired. The chattels and fit-out of a building, where it doesn't form part of the building, can still be depreciated. Interpretation statement 10/01 "Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable property" sets out a three-step test that we apply to determine whether an item can be separated out or whether it's regarded as being part of the building. You can find this in our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). Further information on the treatment of commercial or industrial building fit-outs, "Clarifying that certain building fit-out is depreciable property", is available in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011). These special rules also apply to buildings. When disposing of a building a loss can't be claimed as a deduction, except where due to an emergency event, eg, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, the building has been rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income and is demolished. See "Event" page 38. Buildings can't be pooled. Depreciation on buildings, unlike other assets, can be claimed in the year of sale. Buildings don't qualify for the increased loading of 25% on the historic rates or 20% on the general rates. Part 2 - Detailed information on certain assets www.ird.govt.nz 13 Part 2 Definition of a "building" The term "building" can have various meanings depending on the context in which the term is used. A building in ordinary circumstances is defined as: a structure of considerable size permanent in the sense that it's intended to last a considerable time enclosed by walls and a roof able to function independently of any other structure. However, a building isn't necessarily a physically separate structure. The term building doesn't include certain affected structures acquired on or before 30 July 2009. Interpretation statement 10/02 provides a full explanation of the meaning of "building". Under this statement, some structures have been reclassified as buildings for the purposes of depreciation. To determine if your structure has been affected you'll need to refer back to the interpretation statement to determine the correct depreciation treatment for your asset. You can find the 10/02 Interpretation statement in our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 5 (June 2010). Resource consents The ability to depreciate expenditure on a resource consent depends on the type of expenditure, the type of consent and the resulting asset. Interpretation Statement IS 18/06, Income tax – Treatment of costs of resource consents, provides a full treatment of these issues and when expenditure on resource consents may be depreciable. You can download this statement from our website, www.ird.govt.nz Land You can't claim depreciation on land because land, generally, doesn't depreciate. When land and buildings are purchased and the price doesn't specify the cost of the buildings, the government valuation (at the time of purchase) may be used to calculate this cost: Value of improvements (buildings) × purchase price = cost of buildings Capital value (land and buildings) Land improvements Land improvements, however, may depreciate, and since 1 April 1993 there has been the provision for specific fixtures on the land (non-primary sector land) to be depreciated. These fixtures as listed in Schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are: airport runways bores and wells bridges chimneys culverts dams fences hardstanding (for example, asphalt car park) pipes purpose-built surfaces for outdoor sports facilities reservoirs retaining walls roads spillways swimming pools tanks tunnels wharves. In the same manner as plant and machinery, these fixtures are depreciable at the general rates if made in the 1996 and later income years. They also qualify for the 20% loading if made in the 1996 income year and before 21 May 2010. 14 DEPRECIATION Part 2 Expenditure on farm and forestry land and aquaculture improvements Although land isn't a depreciable asset, there are provisions allowing you to progressively deduct expenditure incurred in preparing or otherwise developing land within the farming, agriculture, forestry and aquaculture industries. This differs from the depreciation of other land improvements. While depreciation is subject to the period the asset was used during the financial year, the deduction for the development expenditure isn't time based. You can claim the full percentage of the deduction (plus any loading) even if the development expenditure occurs near the end of the financial year, provided the expenditure benefits the business in that income year. Deductions are allowed for losses on farm land improvements where an event has occurred either destroying or rendering the improvements useless for deriving income. When the land is sold there is no taxable recovery of any deductions allowed for the capitalised development expenditure. When the land is sold the undeducted balance of the development expenditure can be transferred to the new owner. The capitalised development expenditure effectively stays with the land, rather than with the person who incurred it. We recommend you consult a tax agent when considering this. Taxpayers involved in the primary sector may claim depreciation for assets listed in Schedule 13. However, they may only do so when they can't claim the expenditure under section DO 1 or DO 2 or Schedule 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007. To read tax legislation online, go to www.legislation.govt.nz The following are some examples of the specific provisions applying to farming and agriculture (Schedule 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007) for land improvements. Clearing land The expenditure incurred in clearing land is deductible in the year it was incurred. Cultivating land The expenditure incurred in cultivating land is deductible on a DV basis (similar to depreciation) at the rate of 5% each year. Expenditure incurred between 16 December 1991 and the end of the taxpayer's 1995 income year qualifies for a 25% loading, ie, 6.25%. Expenditure incurred in the 1996 or any subsequent income year (up until 1 April 2013) qualifies for a 20% loading, ie, 6%. Irrigation system and plant This is capital expenditure so normal depreciation rules apply. Installing tile drains This is deductible on a DV basis at the annual rate of 5% (plus any loading). This same rate would apply to the cost of replacing a tile drainage system. The fact that the retiling may be done over a period longer than one year doesn't affect the deduction that can be claimed. A loss can't be claimed on the old system because it's scrapped, nor can a continued deduction be made for the old system since the asset is no longer of benefit to the business. Sinking a bore This is deductible on a DV basis at the rate of 5% (plus any loading) each year. Regrassing and fertilising Expenditure incurred in connection with significant capital activity, such as a change from one type of farming to another, is deductible on a DV basis at the rate of 45% each year. A 20% depreciation loading applied to farming and agriculture land improvements acquired before 1 April 2013. www.ird.govt.nz 15 Part 2 Leased assets For tax purposes there are four kinds of lease. The type of lease determines whether the lessor (owner) or the lessee (person paying to use the asset) is entitled to claim depreciation on the asset. Specified leases A specified lease is a lease agreement entered into between 6 August 1982 and 19 May 1999 that meets certain criteria. The lease is a specified lease if: it has a guaranteed residual value, or the lease term is more than 36 consecutive months (or, if we consider the economic life of the asset is less than 36 months, a term equal to the economic life of the lease asset), and –the lessee becomes the owner at the end of the term, or –the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at the end of the term at a price significantly lower than market value, or –the total of all payments and the guaranteed residual value is more than, or roughly equal to, the cost price, or –both parties agree the lessee is liable for the payment of all, or nearly all, maintenance and other incidental costs. Specified leases include: leases acquired by any means whatsoever, whether from the lessor or another person, and leases entered into between 28 October 1983 and 19 May 1999 (both dates inclusive) if a person other than the lessee acquires the asset and they are associated with the lessee. Finance leases A finance lease is an agreement entered into on or after 20 May 1999 under which: ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee (or an associate of the lessee) at the end of the term, or the lessee (or an associate of the lessee) has the option of acquiring the asset for an amount significantly lower than market value, or the lease term is more than 75% of the asset's estimated useful life (as determined under section EE63 of the Income Tax Act 2007). For income years including 20 June 2007 and later income years, the lease, or an arrangement of which the lease is part, must: involve the use of the lease asset outside New Zealand for all or most of the term of the lease, and involve income from the use of the asset by any person other than the lessor which is exempt, excluded or non-residents' foreign sourced income, and be an arrangement in which substantially all the risks and rewards that are incidental to ownership are incurred by persons other than the lessor and/or it's a finance lease under NZIAS 17 either for the lessor or for another company in the same group of companies that derives assessable income from the arrangement. With both specified and finance leases, the lessor is treated as selling the asset to the lessee at the beginning of the lease. Therefore, the lessee is the owner and is entitled to the deduction for depreciation. Hire purchase A hire purchase agreement passing ownership to the person paying the hire purchase allows that person to claim any allowable depreciation. This provision overrides the general provision that limits the claim to the owner of the asset. Leasehold improvements A lessee is considered to own and be entitled to claim depreciation on the cost of leasehold fixtures or improvements incurred by that lessee, but under land law principles are technically owned by the lessor. When the lease expires, to calculate the loss on disposal, the lessee is considered to have disposed of the fixture or improvement. The lessor, including subsequent lessors, won't be able to depreciate such fixtures or improvements during the term of the lease. However, once the lease has expired, the lessor will be able to depreciate the fixtures and improvements if they have paid the lessee for these. This also applies when the lessee transfers the lease and the person the lease is transferred to pays the original lessee for the leasehold improvements. The same applies to licences to occupy. 16 DEPRECIATION Part 2 Non-specified and operating leases If a lease was entered into between 6 August 1982 and 19 May 1999 and it isn't a specified lease, it's known as a non-specified lease. If the lease was entered into on or after 20 May 1999 and it isn't a finance lease, it's an operating lease. For these kinds of leases, the owner (lessor) of the lease asset claims the deduction for depreciation. Renting out a residential property You must claim depreciation on a house or flat you're renting out as a deduction from the rent you receive, unless you make an election for the asset not to be a depreciable asset. You must also claim depreciation on any contents in the house or flat being used or available for use by the tenants, unless you elect otherwise - see page 6. Depreciation rules for the house itself are covered under "Buildings" on page 12. The contents of the house may be depreciated either on an individual item basis or using the pooling method - see page 9. If you're calculating depreciation on contents for the first time, the adjusted tax value will be the lesser of the cost of those items or their market value at the time they're first used or available for use in earning rental income. The rates for house or flat contents are set out in the industry category "Residential rental property chattels". You can find this in our depreciation rate finder on www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: rate finder). Or, you can use our guides General depreciation rates (IR265) for chattels acquired on or after 1 April 2005, and the Historic depreciation rates (IR267) for chattels acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and up to 31 March 2005. Depreciable item distinct from the building If an item in a residential rental property is distinct from the building and meets the definition of "depreciable property", it may be depreciated separately. If an item is part of the building it can't be depreciated separately, but can be depreciated with the building. It's important that the correct approach is applied to determine if these items are regarded as distinct from the building. To determine whether a particular item is part of or separate from the building there is a three-step test. 1. The item is in some way attached or connected to the building. 2. The item is an integral part of the residential rental property, so it wouldn't function as a rental without it. 3. The item is built-in or attached/connected in such a way that it's part of the "fabric" of the building. Full commentary on Interpretation statement 10/01 "Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable properties" can be found in the Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). For more information, read our Rental income (IR264) guide. It explains the taxable income and deductible expenses for people who own rental property. Holiday homes Where a holiday home is considered to be a "rental" property, depreciation may be claimed. The proportion of depreciation claimed on the assets will vary depending on the degree of actual rental time. The facts of a particular case always need to be considered carefully and so it may be necessary to seek advice from a tax advisor before making any claim for depreciation or other expenses on a holiday home. You can find more information on income tax treatment of holiday homes in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 3 (May 2009). Intangible assets Depreciating intangible assets Certain intangible assets have been included in the depreciation rules, and can be depreciated under the general rules applying to other depreciable assets. The only difference is that the rules apply to intangible assets acquired or created on or after 1 April 1993, rather than from a taxpayer's 1994 income or non- standard balance date accounting year. The 20% depreciation loading doesn't apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. www.ird.govt.nz 17 Part 2 Intangible assets acquired or created after 1 April 1993 that are depreciable, intangible property, are limited to those listed in Schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and they all have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of creation or acquisition. In brief, the intangible assets covered by Schedule 14 are: a patent, or the right to use a patent the right to use a copyright, trademark, design, plan or similar the right to use land, plant or machinery software copyright management rights and licence rights created under the Radiocommunications Act 1989 consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 copyright in a sound recording plant variety rights, or the right to use them. To be depreciable, an intangible asset must be both: an asset of the type listed in Schedule 14 an asset that might reasonably be expected to decline in value under normal circumstances. The most common feature of the assets listed in Schedule 14 is the "right to use". Take, for example, costs incurred in designing and producing a logo. A logo isn't listed in the schedule so the costs are considered to be a one-off capital cost and not depreciable. If the logo, once created, is then trademarked and the rights to use are sold, the purchaser can depreciate those rights. The depreciation rules vary according to whether or not intangible assets have a fixed life or an economic life. Intangible assets with a fixed life An intangible asset with a fixed life is any intangible asset that is depreciable with a legal life that could reasonably be expected, on the date of creation or acquisition of that asset, to be the same length as the asset's remaining estimated useful life. If an intangible asset falls into this category, the depreciation rate is self-assessed by the owner using the formula: 1 Legal life (years) In such cases the "legal life" is defined as the length of time the intangible asset may exist as specified by the contract or statute that created it. In addition, legal life will include any renewal or extension period where those renewals or extensions are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of a predetermined fee. The formula gives an SL depreciation rate. The SL method is the only depreciation method that can be used for fixed-life intangible assets. Intangible assets with a fixed life aren't eligible for the 20% loading that applies from the 1996 income year until 20 May 2010. Mark acquired the right to use a registered trademark from 1 April 2006 with a value of $10,000 and a legal life of five years. Using the above formula, the depreciation rate Mark would use is: 1 =0.2 or 20% 5 Mark can claim a $2,000 deduction for depreciation each year. Example A special depreciation rate may be applied if the economic life is different from the legal life of the intangible asset. Note Intangible assets with an economic life If the intangible asset doesn't have a fixed life, it can be expected to have an economic life shorter than its legal life. Unlike fixed-life intangible assets, economic- life intangible assets are depreciated using the same methods applied to all tangible depreciable assets, ie, a DV or SL depreciation rate. They can be pooled and, if purchased between 1996 and 20 May 2010, are eligible for a 20% loading. Taxpayers can also apply for a special or provisional depreciation rate for economic life intangibles. For example, a taxpayer may obtain a licence to use computer software for life, whereas the economic life of that software would possibly only be three years. 18 DEPRECIATION Part 2 Franchises Franchise agreements are not a category of intangible assets listed in Schedule 14 so they aren't normally considered to be depreciable intangible assets. However, any particular franchise agreement may give rise to specific rights listed in Schedule 14, for example, the right to use a trademark. Remember, the rights are the depreciable intangible assets, not the franchise agreement. If a franchise agreement stipulates a mixture of rights, and one particular right is specifically listed in Schedule 14 and is capable of being separately and clearly isolated and valued, that right will be a depreciable intangible asset, provided it might reasonably be expected to decline in value under normal circumstances. Whether or not the rights conferred under a franchise agreement are considered to be the type listed in Schedule 14, they won't be depreciable if any of the following situations apply: You can't estimate with any reasonable degree of certainty a finite and defined period of life. The rights aren't expected to decline in value over their life. The payment is made to purchase goodwill rather than the rights to secret formulas, processes, trademarks or similar. If a right conferred under a franchise agreement is depreciable, it will usually have a legal life equivalent to its estimated useful life. Accordingly, it must be depreciated using the SL method as an intangible asset with a fixed life. If a right conferred under a franchise agreement is automatically renewed or the right to renewal is only subject to the payment of a predetermined fee, the legal life of that right will be equal to the full term of the agreement, assuming the right to renewal is taken up. Cherrypoppin Ltd paid $50,000 to acquire the New Zealand franchise rights to manufacture and distribute Rolloseal towel rails. The franchise agreement is for a 10-year period. The majority of the $50,000 franchise fee went to capital expenditure, however, $20,000 of the fee related to the right to use a patent. The franchise was acquired on 1 April 2006 to extend until 1 April 2016. The right to use the patent is a fixed-life intangible asset. When the franchise was purchased, it appeared the right to use the patent would remain valuable to the end of its legal life. The legal life of this fixed-life intangible asset is 10 years. The SL depreciation rate to be used by Cherrypoppin Ltd for the right to use a patent is: 1/10 = 10% on cost of $20,000. The annual depreciation is $2,000. Example Additional costs Any additional costs, incurred in relation to an intangible asset with a fixed life during the legal life of that asset, are added to the book value. This is done at the beginning of the income year in which the costs are incurred. The aggregate costs are depreciated over the remaining legal life of that intangible asset (calculated from the beginning of the year in which they are incurred). A legal life includes any renewal or extension period where the renewal or extension is essentially unconditional or conditional only on the payment of predetermined fees. So, the depreciation rate for the fixed-life intangible asset changes. In effect, the fixed-life intangible asset is treated as newly acquired from the beginning of that year for the sum of the adjusted tax value and additional costs. www.ird.govt.nz 19 Part 2 Karion Ltd acquires the right to use a copyright for five years for $10,000 and has an option to renew for a further five years on payment of an additional $5,000. The legal life is therefore: 1/10 = 10% on cost of $10,000. The annual depreciation is $1,000. In the first five years, Karion Ltd claims annual deductions totalling $5,000. In year six, Karion Ltd pays the additional $5,000. The sum of the adjusted tax value and additional cost is $10,000 ($5,000 + $5,000). The remaining legal life of the right is five years, so the depreciation rate for years six to ten is: 1/5 = 20% on cost of $10,000. The annual depreciation in years six to ten is $2,000. Example It is necessary to calculate a loss or gain on disposal of a depreciable intangible asset - see page 26. Patents Patent rights acquired after 1 April 1993 are also depreciable intangible assets. Timing of depreciation For patent applications lodged before 1 April 2005 and granted in the 2005-06 income year or later, depreciation begins from the date the application is granted. However, there's a catch-up deduction for the period between when the application is lodged and when it's granted. For patent applications lodged on or after 1 April 2005, depreciation begins from the date the patent application is lodged with a complete specification. Depreciation rates for patents Patents have a legal life of 20 years, which is 240 months. To work out the depreciation rate divide the number of months in that year by 240. For patents with applications lodged before 1 April 2005 and granted in the 2005-06 tax year or later, divide the number of months the patent was pending by 240 to give the catch-up depreciation rate. Further details on the tax implications of selling patents are covered on page 27. Kariov filed for a patent on a new type of footwear on 4 April 2004. The patent is granted on 2 June 2007. The total patent costs were $10,000. The depreciation for the patent would be calculated as follows: Depreciation catch-up (April 04-May 07) 38 months/240 months = 16% on cost of $10,000 = $1,600 depreciation\* Annual rate for the year (June 07-March 08) 10 months/240 months = 4% on cost of $10,000 = $400 depreciation\* 2008-09 income year onwards 12 months/240 months = 5% on cost of $10,000 = $500 depreciation (as the SL method must be used). Kariov will be able to claim $500 each year until the patent expires. \* The total depreciation for the 2007-08 income year would be $2,000 ($1,600+$400) Example 1 - Patent application lodged before 1 April 2005 20 DEPRECIATION Part 2 KIZ Ltd files for a patent on a new type of cat- door. It lodged its application with complete specification on 15 September 2005. The patent is granted on 21 February 2008. The depreciation rate for the patent application and for the patent (once granted) would be calculated as follows: Depreciation rate for patent application 2005-06 income year (Sept 05 to Mar 06) 7 months/240 months = 0.03 2006-07 income year 12 months/240 months = 0.05 2007-08 income year (April 07-Jan 08) 10 months/240 months = 0.04\* Depreciation rate for patent 2007-08 income year (Feb 08-Mar 08) 2 months/240 months = 0.01\* 2008-09 income year onwards 12 months/240 months = 0.05 \* The total depreciation rate for the 2007-08 income year would be 0.05 (0.04+0.01) Example 2 - Application lodged after 1 April 2005 For more information on depreciation on patents see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 7 (September 2005). Go to www.ird.govt.nz/tib Fishing quotas There are two types of fishing quota: individual term quotas (ITQs), which are issued in perpetuity transferable term quotas (TTQs), which are issued for fixed periods. Most fishing quotas give the owner the right to catch a defined percentage of the total allowable commercial catch, so don't fall within any of the classes of intangible assets listed in Schedule 14. Also, the majority of quotas issued to date have been ITQs, which have an indefinite life, and are not depreciable anyway. Please note that a TTQ is depreciable property - specifically, it is fixed-life intangible property. For more information about fishing quotas, please refer to our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 3 (March 2000). Go to www.ird.govt.nz/tib Computer software This section explains our policy on the tax treatment of computer software expenditure. Some of the terms used in our software policy are explained below. Development The following activities are likely to be part of a development phase: gathering and analysing user requirements designing systems developing detailed software specifications constructing programs testing software testing the user or customer (acceptance testing) developing manuals and training material preparing documents for use in ongoing software product maintenance providing management review throughout the development phase (for example, quality assurance). Maintenance The following activities will generally be accepted as deductible maintenance payments: developing helpdesk facilities fixing program bugs bringing performance up to the original specifications making minor changes, such as increasing field sizes. Predevelopment This term refers to a feasibility study of a project as part of ongoing business. Software Software includes all programs or routines used to cause a computer to perform a desired task or set of tasks, and the documentation and training materials required to describe and maintain these programs. www.ird.govt.nz 21 Part 2 Upgrade Generally, an upgrade of computer software: adds new features to the structure increases its capacity or performance extends the life of the software provides a new version of the software that has more capacity or increased performance. Categories of software expenditure For tax purposes, software expenditure is divided into six categories, each treated differently. Software purchases Cost of purchase should be capitalised and depreciated. Immediate write-off is available for software costing less than $500. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Specified lease of software Cost price of software must be capitalised and depreciated. Interest component of lease payments may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Software developed in-house for use in business Predevelopment expenses may be deducted. Development expenses must be capitalised until the project is completed and depreciated. Costs of unsuccessful development may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Costs of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Commissioned software Development costs must be capitalised until the project is accepted. It must then be depreciated. Costs of unsuccessful development may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Costs of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Software leased other than under a specified lease Lease payments are deductible over the term of the lease. Software developed for sale or licence Development costs are deductible in the year they are incurred. The value of unbilled work in progress and unsold completed software must be taken into account as trading stock. The value of trading stock at balance date must be included as income in your return for that income year. Where a payment covers both maintenance and upgrading, the cost must be apportioned between the two. The cost of maintenance is deductible and the cost of upgrading must be capitalised, taking account of depreciation. Reservation of title clause (also known as Romalpa clause) Depreciation can be deducted from depreciable assets purchased subject to a reservation of title clause (ie, where the contract provides that the vendor reserves title to the asset until the purchase price has been paid but allows the purchaser to take possession of the asset before payment). Reservation of title clause doesn't apply to hire purchase assets subject to hire purchase agreements - see "Hire purchase" and "Leasehold improvements" on page 15. Note Where you purchase an asset subject to a reservation of title clause you're considered to own (and the vendor is considered not to own) the asset on the later date of entering the contract or taking possession of the asset. This considered ownership remains until: title to the asset passes to you the vendor repossesses the asset. If the asset is repossessed you're considered to have disposed of the asset at cost, less the net amount already paid to the vendor. 22 DEPRECIATION Part 2 Purchase price of an asset $10,000 Amount purchaser paid towards the asset $5,000 Asset repossessed - vendor refunds $3,000 This means the net payment for the asset has been $2,000. The purchaser is considered to have sold the asset for $8,000, so the depreciation recovered is calculated on the considered sale price of $8,000. Example The vendor of the asset won't be able to depreciate the asset while you, the purchaser, are deemed to own it. Assets costing $500 or less (including loose tools) acquired on or after 19 May 2005 From the 2005-06 income year low-value assets, ie, assets that cost less than $500, acquired on or after 19 May 2005, are deductible in the year they're acquired or created, provided: they aren't purchased from the same supplier at the same time as other assets to which the same depreciation rate applies (unless the entire purchase costs less than $500) the assets won't become part of an asset that is depreciable, for example, the cost of materials to build a wall in a factory. For assets acquired prior to 19 May 2005, you can claim a deduction if the cost is $200 or less. If you're GST-registered, the $500 is GST-exclusive and if you're not GST-registered, the $500 is GST-inclusive. Note If you sell an asset you've claimed this deduction for, or you start using it mainly for private purposes, you'll have to account for it in your next tax return. If the asset is sold, the entire sale proceeds are taxable in the year the asset is sold. If the asset becomes a private asset, the market value of the asset when it's first used privately will be taxable income. www.ird.govt.nz 23 Part 3 This part deals with adjustments you might make and how the various ways of disposing of depreciable assets will be treated for tax purposes. This includes calculating depreciation in the following situations: newly acquired assets private use of business assets transferring depreciable assets between associated persons private assets becoming business assets disposals transferring assets under a relationship agreement transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies local authority trading enterprises determinations. Newly acquired assets If you're using either the SL or DV methods you can claim depreciation for each calendar month or part- month you own an asset and it's used or available to be used in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Craig buys a new cash register on 27 January 2010 for $7,000, which he uses 100% in his business. Craig's balance date is 31 March and he uses a DV rate of 48% (including 20% loading). This is how he calculates his 2010 depreciation deduction: Three months' use (January, February, March 2010) 12 months' income year (1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010) The depreciation deduction is: $7,000×48%× 3 =$840 12 Even though he owned the cash register for only a few days in January, Craig can claim depreciation for the entire month. Example If you have pooled assets you may add a newly acquired asset to a pool - see page 9. Private use of business assets Use the most appropriate unit of measurement when calculating how much a business asset, other than a motor vehicle, is used privately, such as square metres for area or hours and minutes for time. When a business motor vehicle is used privately and the use is subject to FBT (fringe benefit tax), you don't need to adjust the depreciation deduction to exclude the private use. This is because FBT itself is a way of accounting for the non-business use. However, self-employed people (including partners in a partnership) who use a business vehicle for private purposes, must apportion the vehicle's depreciation between business and non-business use. If you keep an accurate vehicle logbook as an ongoing record, you can make a precise apportionment for depreciation. Alternatively, you may keep a record for a minimum of three months to establish an apportionment that may then be used for three years, provided the business use of the vehicle doesn't change by more than 20%. Mike is a self-employed salesperson. He bought a car for $30,000 at the beginning of the income year and 85% of its use is for business purposes. Mike's car has a DV rate of 36% (including 20% loading) and depreciation on the car is calculated as: Step 1 Opening adjusted tax value $30,000 Depreciation $10,800 Closing adjusted value $19,200 Step 2 Total depreciation $10,800 Less 15% private use (non-deductible) $1,620 Equals 85% business use (deductible) $9,180 Example Part 3 - Adjustments and disposals The 20% depreciation loading doesn't apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. 24 DEPRECIATION Part 3 The adjusted tax value is calculated taking into account 100% of the annual depreciation, not just the deductible proportion - see the table below. YearOpening adjusted tax value DepreciationClosing adjusted tax value Deductible portion 130,00010,80019,2009,180 (85%) 219,2006,91212,2885,875 (85%) 312,2884,4247,8643,760 (85%) When a business asset that's been used privately is sold, resulting in either depreciation recovered or a loss, the loss or gain must be apportioned between business and private use. Calculate the apportionment using this formula: a - b × c a = adjusted tax value at time of sale b = sale price c = percentage of business use If Mike, from the previous example, sells his car after three years for $6,000, the loss on the sale must be apportioned between business and private use. Business purposes made up 85% of the car's use. The deductible portion of the loss on the sale is calculated as: Adjusted tax value (at time of sale) $7,864 Sale price -$6,000 $1,864 85% business use of $1,864 $1,584 Mike can claim $1,584 as loss on the sale. Example www.ird.govt.nz 25 Part 3 Transferring depreciable assets between associated persons Under normal rules a purchaser is entitled to claim depreciation based on the purchase price of an asset. The new owner of a secondhand asset can claim depreciation based on the amount paid for the asset, as long as it's an arm's length sale where: the sale is bona fide the purchase price is a fair market value for the asset the purchaser buys the asset for use in income- producing activities and the seller no longer uses it for income-producing activities. The fact the parties are related doesn't prevent depreciation being claimed. In the case of transfers of assets between associated persons (apart from assets transferred under a relationship agreement - see page 29) a restriction applies to the amount and rate of depreciation that may be claimed by the person acquiring the asset. Depreciation on an asset is restricted to the base value of the asset purchased from an associate, being the lower of: the price the seller originally paid for the asset (or, if applicable, the market value of the asset at the time the associated seller was first entitled to depreciate the asset) the price paid by the buyer. This applies unless we give written approval to use the price paid by the buyer. To grant approval, we must consider such treatment is appropriate in the circumstances. Restrictions on the depreciation rate The depreciation rate that may be applied to an asset acquired from an associate can't be higher than the depreciation rate applied to the asset by that associated seller. If a different depreciation method is used, the restriction applies so the depreciation rate used must not exceed a rate equivalent to that used by the associate. This restriction doesn't apply if: the value being used for the transfer is gross income to the associated seller, other than under the provisions for depreciation recovered the asset is intangible with a fixed life. The depreciation rate for such intangible assets is calculated using a formula that spreads the cost of the fixed-life intangible asset evenly across its remaining life. The restrictions on the base value of an asset, and the depreciation rate that may be used with the asset, apply whether the asset is transferred directly or indirectly to an associate. Private assets becoming business assets If a private asset becomes a business asset, depreciation is first calculated on the market value of that asset when it was first used in the business (except in the case of buildings, which must always be depreciated on cost - see page 12). Whether or not the market value is GST-inclusive depends on whether you are registered for GST. However, if we ask, you must be able to provide documentation (for example, a valuation) showing how you arrived at the market value. Buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more have a depreciation rate of 0% from the 2011-12 income year. Note Disposals Selling and disposing of assets When you sell or dispose of an asset (other than a pooled asset) for a different amount from its adjusted tax value, you must make an adjustment in your end- of-year tax return to account for the loss or gain. If the asset has been used for both business and non-business purposes, you must apportion any loss or gain on disposal between business and non-business use. You can't claim a deduction for depreciation in the year you dispose of an asset, except in the case of buildings. Costs incurred in selling an asset, such as commission and advertising, can be deducted from the sale price before you work out the loss or gain on sale. The adjustment is generally made in the year you sell or dispose of an asset, except when the disposal is because business has ceased. See page 28 for depreciation adjustments when a business ceases. 26 DEPRECIATION Part 3 When a group of assets is sold for a lump sum it may sometimes be necessary to apportion the sale price between the various assets. If, for example, a group of assets that were sold included business and private assets or assets that don't depreciate, such as land, an apportionment would have to be made. We may sometimes ask for an independent valuation of assets if we decide the apportionment agreed to by the buyer and the seller isn't acceptable. What constitutes a disposal The term "disposal" includes: an asset that is compulsorily acquired an asset taken out of New Zealand (other than only temporarily) changes in use or location of use of a business asset ceasing intangible asset rights an asset that is irreparably damaged - see page 28 any distribution of assets, including distributions of assets to the beneficial owners for no cost ceasing deemed ownership of a fixture or improvement - see page 15 an asset that is lost or stolen if that asset isn't recovered in the income year when the loss or theft occurs - see page 28 an asset contributed to a partnership by a person. A disposal or sale of a depreciable asset triggers either a gain or loss on disposal. A gain on disposal or sale Where there's no election for an asset not to be a depreciable asset and the sale price received for the asset exceeds the adjusted tax value, the lesser of the following amounts must be included as gross income in that income year: the total depreciation that could have been deducted since the asset was purchased or first used in the business (this amount relates to the allowable depreciation deduction rather than the amount of depreciation actually deducted), or the amount by which the sale price received exceeds the adjusted tax value. For any asset owned prior to the 1994 income year, only the actual amount of depreciation claimed prior to the 1994 income year needs to be taken into account. You still need to work out the amount of depreciation that could have been claimed from the 1994 income year until date of sale. Note A loss on disposal or sale When you sell or dispose of an asset for less than its adjusted tax value, the difference between this consideration and the adjusted tax value is allowed as a deduction. If an asset is sold for less than its market value we can fix the sale price as the market value of the asset. This may happen if you sold an asset to someone close to you or your business, for example, a relative or a shareholder of the company. In this situation, the actual sale price may be ignored and the calculations made as if the asset was sold for its market value. The exception to this is when you dispose of pooled assets. For the treatment of pooled assets - see Disposing of pooled assets on page 27. A deduction for loss on disposal doesn't apply to buildings , unless due to an event the building has been damaged or affected by its surroundings rendering it useless for the purposes of deriving income. See pages 12 and 38. Note Disposing of intangible assets You must calculate a loss or gain when disposing of a depreciable intangible asset. This will include calculating loss or gain from disposing of any franchise rights that are depreciable - see page 18. A disposal of an intangible asset must fall within one of the following two circumstances: any event which means that the owner can no longer apply, at any time, the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset, or any event that causes the asset to be irreparably damaged. A disposal of an intangible asset doesn't include disposing of that asset as part of an arrangement to replace it with an asset of the same type. www.ird.govt.nz 27 Part 3 Where a depreciable intangible asset is considered worthless it's unlikely ceasing to use that intangible asset could be seen as a disposal. A disposal of such an asset must fall within one of the following circumstances: any event which means the owner can no longer apply, at any time, the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset any event that causes the asset to be irreparably damaged any event which means the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset are moved overseas. Although worthless, you still have the legal right to use the intangible assets, and they have probably not been irreparably damaged - it's just the value of those assets that has diminished. The write-off provisions could apply to intangible assets. We need to be satisfied: the intangible asset will no longer be used, and is not intended to be used the costs (for example, legal) of disposal would exceed the consideration received (the intangible asset is worthless) no one else could use it (or would want to use it) perhaps due to unmarketability through the liability of defects. We explain write-offs on page 35. Patents Where a patent is sold, the proceeds from the sale are taxable on the net amount after cost. Generally, a corresponding adjustment has been allowed for the total costs of the patent rights (at least those acquired on or after 1 April 1993). As a depreciation allowance has been available for patents since 1 April 1993, there is the potential for a double deduction. So, in calculating the profit or loss on sale of a patent, the cost of the patent is reduced by depreciation deductions that have been allowed. This restricts any deduction for loss on sale to the adjusted tax value. If a patent application is sold while the patent is pending, so that the patent is granted to a person other than the person who filed the application, the legal life for the new owner is reduced by the number of months between when the patent application was lodged and when it was sold to the new owner. Making arrangements between associated persons - intangible assets An intangible asset that wasn't depreciable to the seller remains non-depreciable to the associate, even though assets of the same type have become depreciable since the seller acquired that asset. The provision prevents an intangible asset being transferred to an associate to bring it within the depreciation rules and applies to intangible assets transferred on or after 1 July 1997. Disposing of pooled assets When you dispose of pooled assets, the sale price must be deducted from the adjusted tax value of the pool before calculating depreciation for the year. If the asset is discarded or lost, the adjusted tax value of the pool isn't reduced. Where the sale price is greater than the adjusted tax value of the pool, the difference is treated as depreciation recovered and is taxable income. The adjusted tax value of the pool will then be nil and no further depreciation deductions will be allowed until new assets are added to the pool. Once assets are pooled, they're no longer treated as individual assets, so any capital gain made on the sale of any or all assets from the pool can't be separated from depreciation recovered. The entire proceeds of any sale of pooled assets must be accounted for and any gains are taxable income. When all the assets in a pool are sold and the sale proceeds are less than the pool's adjusted tax value, the balance is deductible. Special rule for sale of assets previously held under the globo accounting method Please note from 12 December 1995 a limitation was placed on the amount of taxable income derived from selling assets in a pool that consists only of assets previously depreciated under the globo accounting method (this method could only be used before 1 April 1993). If this applies to you please see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 9 (February 1996) for a fuller explanation of how gains are to be treated. Go to www.ird.govt.nz/tib 28 DEPRECIATION Part 3 Ceasing business or now using the asset for non-business purposes If you cease business and don't sell your business assets immediately or if they're kept for private use, the loss or gain must be accounted for using the market value of the assets as at the beginning of the next income year. You'll have to make an adjustment in your income tax return for the year after the business ceased or the asset changed use, even if the loss or gain isn't realised until a later income year. Using a pooled asset privately When an asset is no longer used solely for business purposes after it's been pooled, it must be isolated from the pool. Andy has an asset pool with an adjusted tax value of $18,000 at 1 April 2009. The pool includes an asset that Andy is now using for private purposes. He uses it privately for 20% of the time which started on 5 December 2009. The market value of the asset on 5 December 2009 was $1,500. The pool depreciation rate is 22%. Step 1 Pool adjusted tax value (beginning of 2010 income year) $ 18,000 Value at end of 2010 income year ($18,000 less deemed sale at $1,500) + $ 16,500 $ 34,500 Average pool value (divide $34,500 by 2) $ 17,250 Depreciation on the pool at 22% for the year will be: $ 3,795 Step 2 Calculate depreciation on ex-pool assets (market value $1,500) $1,500 x 22% x 4/12\* months = $ 110 (\*December 2009 to March 2010) Total depreciation $ 110 less 20% personal use $ 22 Deductible depreciation $ 88 Deductible depreciation for the 2010 income year is $3,883 ($88 plus $3,795). Example At the time the asset is first used privately, it will be treated for depreciation purposes as though the business bought and sold it for the market value. Damaged assets You must take into account any insurance proceeds, indemnity damages or compensation payments you receive when an asset is damaged. If such payments exceed the cost of repairing the damaged asset, the surplus isn't a capital receipt but must be deducted from the adjusted tax value of the asset for depreciation purposes. If the result is a negative amount, that amount is considered to be gross income in that year. Irreparably damaged assets are considered to be disposed of for a consideration of the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnity payment or other consideration received in relation to that event or damage. A full deduction is allowed for disposal costs, including demolition costs. Lost or stolen assets The loss or theft of a depreciable asset constitutes a disposal if the asset isn't recovered in the income year in which the loss or theft occurs. Any insurance proceeds, indemnity payment or other consideration received in relation to the loss or theft of the depreciable asset is taken to be consideration received, minus disposal costs (where applicable), for the disposal of that asset. This consideration for the disposal will then be used in calculating the gain or loss on disposal of the asset. If the lost or stolen asset is recovered in a subsequent income year, and is still owned and used or available for use in deriving income, the following assumptions apply. You're considered to derive gross income equal to any loss on sale deduction allowed in the previous year. The gross income will be considered to be derived either in the year of disposal or of recovery. You're considered to have acquired the recovered asset on the date it was retrieved at the adjusted tax value that applied at the beginning of the year of loss or theft. If you're registered for GST, don't include the GST component of these payments in your calculation - account for it in your GST return. Note www.ird.govt.nz 29 Part 3 Transferring assets under a relationship agreement Depreciable assets transferred under a relationship agreement are transferred at the adjusted tax value and the person acquiring the assets, provided they use them for business purposes, is allowed the deductions that would have been allowed had the transfer not taken place. Colin and Jennifer Day separate and they agree to enter into a relationship agreement. Colin will transfer half the business assets to Jennifer. The general rule is that depreciable assets are transferred: • at adjusted tax value at the beginning of the year of transfer • at cost price for assets acquired in the year of transfer. As a result, no depreciation gain or loss arises to the transferor (Colin). The transferee (Jennifer) can continue to depreciate the remaining adjusted tax value of the assets. However, if she sells, Jennifer is considered to have claimed the depreciation deductions claimed by Colin and will be required to account for any excess of sale proceeds above the transfer value (up to the cost of the asset to Colin) as depreciation recovered. In relation to buildings, Jennifer's depreciation claim is based on the cost of the building to Colin. He is considered to have disposed of the building at adjusted tax value. Example Transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies Companies that are 100% commonly owned and choose to enter the consolidated system can transfer assets within their group at the assets' adjusted tax value. When wholly owned companies amalgamate, they're treated as one company and all assets, liabilities, property, rights, powers and privileges of the amalgamating companies are held in the new amalgamated company. This means there is no depreciation recovered when assets are transferred on a qualifying amalgamation. Wholly owned companies that don't form a consolidated group are required to transfer assets at market value and recover or claim a loss of depreciation, as applicable. The vendor company is required to calculate depreciation recovered or a loss on disposal: on actual sale price, or on market value, when the asset has been disposed of for a consideration that isn't market value, but we consider the market value is greater than the sale price and consider it to be the more appropriate value for the asset. The purchasing company should value the asset at the cost incurred, or the value we consider the seller to have disposed of that asset, to calculate the depreciation claimed. Council-controlled organisations Council-controlled organisations are established by local government legislation to operate as trading enterprises liable for tax and so are competitively neutral. When a council-controlled organisation is set up, assets transferred to it from a local authority should be transferred for tax purposes at either their: adjusted tax value true market value. 30 DEPRECIATION Part 3 Regardless of which value is adopted: a local authority must make an actual sale of assets to a council-controlled organisation full consideration for the sale must pass between the parties there must be complete and detailed documentation providing evidence of the transaction (including listing individual asset values). Our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 2 (August 1991) has a full policy statement on how to value assets that are transferred from local authorities to council- controlled organisations (previously known as LATEs). To read the Tax Information Bulletin go to www.ird.govt.nz/tib Determinations Inland Revenue must follow a formal procedure to set new depreciation rates or create new categories for assets and industries. This is known as "issuing a determination" and the general rates listed in our General depreciation rates (IR265) and the Historic depreciation rates (IR267) guides are the result of determinations issued by us. The determination process is also used for setting depreciation rates following applications from taxpayers. You can apply for a determination of depreciation rate if, for example, you find there is no general depreciation rate for your asset. You can also apply to us for a new rate if you believe the relevant existing general depreciation rate shouldn't apply to your asset. There are three different types of determinations that you can apply for, depending on your circumstances: a special depreciation rate a provisional depreciation rate a higher maximum pooling value. How rates are calculated The formula below is used for calculating a DV depreciation rate for an asset. 1 - (( residual value ) 1 ) cost n n =the estimated useful life of the asset. Estimated useful life The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which the asset might reasonably be expected to be useful in earning income in New Zealand. This period of time is calculated taking into account factors such as likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion and obsolescence. Normal and reasonable maintenance over the expected life of the asset is also taken into account. The fact an asset may have been previously used for a purpose other than deriving income (for example, private use) or carrying on a business overseas won't reduce its estimated useful life. The estimate of useful life must take into account the length of time the asset is used by all business owners in New Zealand (ie, first owner plus second owner and so on). Grant, an owner-driver, buys a new truck every five years and sells his old one. He expects the New Zealand business that buys each truck from him will use it for another five years and then scrap it. If this is the typical useful lifespan of trucks, the estimated useful life is 10 years. Example We use valuation consultants' advice when determining the estimated useful life for each asset class. The estimated useful life is determined after averaging the usage of various businesses. The estimated useful life is listed with the depreciation rates in our General depreciation rates (IR265) guide. Go to www.ird.govt.nz "Work it out" and view our depreciation rates finder, or "Forms and guides" to read the IR265 online or download a copy. Residual value The residual value of an asset is the greater of: 13.5% of the original cost an estimate of the asset's market value (GST-exclusive) at the end of its estimated useful life. This must be a reasonable estimate made at the time of purchase. In estimating the residual value it must be assumed normal and reasonable maintenance is carried out on the asset during its use. www.ird.govt.nz 31 Part 3 Once the rates are calculated they're rounded up or down to the nearest rate. The full range of general DV and SL rates are shown below: 1994 to 2005 rates For assets you acquired on or after 1 April 1993, and before the end of the 1995 income year, you can use the general rates listed in table 1 or the historic rates listed in part 1 of the IR267 guide plus 25% interim loading and any shift allowances. For assets acquired from the 1996 income year to the end of the 2005 income year (or before 19 May 2005 for buildings), use the general rates listed in table 1. For new assets, including those never used or held for use in New Zealand, and imported secondhand goods (but excluding buildings or used imported cars) depreciation is calculated using the general rate plus 20% loading. The general rates listed in table 1 can also be found in parts 2 and 3 of the Historic depreciation rates (IR267) guide at www.ird.govt.nz "Forms and guides". Table 1 General DV rate with 20% loading General SL rate with 20% loading 22.41.51.8 44.833.6 67.244.8 7.595.56.6 9.511.46.57.8 1214.489.6 15181012 1821.612.515 2226.415.518.6 2631.21821.6 3339.62428.8 40483036 50604048 63.576.263.576.2 100100100100 2006 and future years For assets acquired from the 2006 income year (or buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005) use the general rates listed in table 2. For new assets (including those never used or held for use in New Zealand) and imported secondhand goods, but excluding buildings or used imported cars, depreciation is calculated using the general DV or SL rates plus 20% loading. The general rates listed in table 2 can be found in parts 1 and 2 of our General depreciation rates (IR265) guide at www.ird.govt.nz "Forms and guides". Table 2 General DV rate with 20% loading General SL rate with 20% loading 22.41.51.8 44.833.6 67.244.8 89.667.2 101278.4 1315.68.510.2 1619.210.512.6 202413.516.2 253017.521 30362125.2 40483036 50604048 6780.46780.4 100100100100 The 20% loading has been removed from 21 May 2010, so for any assets acquired on or after this date, use only the general DV or SL rates in table 2. Note From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note 32 DEPRECIATION Part 3 Disputable decisions Sometimes you may not agree with some of our decisions, for example: a determination setting a special rate a decision not to set a special rate revoking a special rate a determination setting a provisional rate a decision not to set a provisional rate. If you want to challenge any of these decisions, see our factsheet If you disagree with an assessment (IR778). Special depreciation rates We've calculated the general depreciation rates by using the formula given on page 30. We've considered the way assets are normally used, to arrive at the values used in the formula. For example, where it's usual to operate a piece of machinery in two or three shifts a day, the general depreciation rate we've set will reflect this heavier usage. If you believe the general depreciation rate we've set isn't appropriate for your asset because, for example, you use your machine in an unusually heavy or light manner, or it will be operated in corrosive conditions, you may apply for a special depreciation rate. As we set a special rate because of individual circumstances, it can only be set for a specific taxpayer's asset or class of assets. Once set, it can only be used by the taxpayer who made the application. After 20 May 2010 you can no longer apply for a special depreciation rate on buildings. Note Your application for a special depreciation rate must be supported by evidence of how your unique circumstances will affect the life of your asset. If we agree you should have a special depreciation rate, the formula set out on page 30 will be used to calculate the rate. To qualify for a special rate, the rate you've calculated must be halfway or more to the next rate on the general rates table, either higher or lower. A personal computer purchased after 1 April 2005 has a general DV rate of 50%. The next higher general rate is 67%. The calculation must result in a rate of 58.5% or higher to qualify for a higher rate, or 45% or lower to qualify for a lower rate to be set since the next lower general rate is 40%. Example When considering a special rate, we'll take into account any factors relevant in determining estimated useful life. You can download and complete an Application for a special depreciation rate (IR260B) from www.ird.govt.nz (search keyword: IR260B). Send your completed application to: LTS Manager - Technical Standards National Office Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140. How we set a special rate If we agree a special depreciation rate should be set, we follow three steps. They are: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing the determination. The process, from the time the application is received to the time the determination is issued, must be completed within six months, unless you agree to an extension of time. Draft determination Once we've considered your application, and agree a special depreciation rate should be set, we'll send you a draft determination along with a letter setting out the special depreciation rate we recommend. If this rate is different from the rate you requested, we'll also set out the reasons why we chose this rate. Conference At this point you may request a conference to discuss the determination. There is a time limit for requesting a conference, which will be at least 10 working days from the date we send the draft determination to you. Full details of the time limit will appear with the draft. www.ird.govt.nz 33 Part 3 If it's decided not to hold a conference, we'll finalise the determination. If it's decided to hold a conference, we'll set a date, time and place. We'll give you at least 20 working days' notice of the conference date. Issuing the determination The final step in the process is to issue the determination. Hopefully, due to the consultation following the draft determination or if a conference is held, both parties will have agreed on the rate to be set. If, however, you don't agree with the rate in the determination, you may dispute that decision. For more information, see our guide Disputing an assessment (IR776). Declining an application We'll turn down your application for a special rate if: your rate is too close to the general rate - see page 31 the general rate is under review you haven't supplied enough information. If we turn down your application or set a rate you don't agree with, you're entitled to dispute this decision - see page 32. Fees Application fee If you're applying for a special rate there's a fee of $150 plus GST, payable with your application. Processing fee There is a processing fee of $75 plus GST for each hour (or part-hour) after the first two hours for work by Inland Revenue. Consultant's fee If we engage a consultant to advise on the estimated useful life or estimated residual value of the asset, we'll charge you the consultant's fees plus GST. If you request a conference and a consultant paid by us attends the conference, or if you ask our consultant to carry out further work, we'll also charge you for the consultant's fee plus GST. If you request a conference we'll advise you of the likely fees before engaging a consultant so you can decide whether you want to continue with the application. Before we engage a consultant we'll take into account the information you've provided with your application. We won't seek a consultant's advice if you've already provided us with enough information to work out an appropriate rate. We'll send you an account for all fees you have incurred. The costs incurred can be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes and you can claim the GST part of the cost as a credit, if you're registered for GST. Withdrawing applications You can withdraw your application at any time. If you wish to do this, please let us know in writing as soon as possible because you'll have to pay fees incurred in processing your application, including any consultant's fees, up to the day we receive notice of your withdrawal. Revoking a special rate If we've approved your application for a special rate and your circumstances change so your asset no longer qualifies, we may either: revoke the determination, in which case you must use the general rate applying to the asset, or revoke the determination and issue a new one setting a new special rate. If this happens we'll let you know. The special rate we have already issued will lapse the day after you've been notified. Provisional depreciation rates You should apply for a provisional depreciation rate if you consider the asset classes for the general rates (excluding the default asset class in each category) don't appropriately cover the assets in a category. This could happen, for example, when an asset is newly invented or imported into New Zealand for the first time and we haven't listed the asset class under the general asset category. 34 DEPRECIATION Part 3 To apply for a provisional rate, fill in an Application for a provisional depreciation rate (IR260A) form. There are no application fees for a provisional rate. However, we'll charge you a fee if we: decline to issue a provisional rate determination or issue an unfavourable determination and you ask our consultant to carry out further work that doesn't result in a determination favourable to you. The fee for the further work done, or time attending a conference will include GST. When a provisional rate is set, it will usually apply to all businesses that own and use that class of asset and we don't have sufficient information at the time to set a general rate. However, in some cases it may be appropriate for a provisional rate to be set for a specific taxpayer or class of taxpayers owning that type of asset, for example, where the asset is unique to a specific taxpayer or taxpayer group. Provisional rates (other than taxpayer specific rates) are published in our Tax Information Bulletin and on our website at www.ird.govt.nz (search keywords: provisional rates). When a general rate is subsequently set for a class of asset, the provisional rate will lapse. Calculating a provisional rate Unless the determination provides otherwise, once a provisional rate is set, it's available to all owners of the particular class of asset. So, the basis of the calculation must relate to the typical asset within the class of assets and typical use within an industry. It's important the information you supply with your application is representative for normal use of the asset within your industry. We take into account the rate of depreciation you and other industry members use in your financial reporting when setting a provisional rate. We calculate a provisional or special rate using the formula explained on page 30, or the SL method. The answer is then rounded up or down to the nearest SL or DV rate. How a provisional rate is set As with general and special rates, provisional rates are set by us issuing a determination. There are three main stages: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing a determination. This three-stage process must be completed within six months from the time we receive your application, unless you agree to an extension of time. These stages are explained in more detail on page 32. We'll turn down an application for a provisional rate if: a general rate for the asset already exists we're in the process of setting a general rate you haven't supplied enough information. If we turn down your application or set a rate you don't agree with, you're entitled to dispute the determination - see page 32. When we've set a provisional rate (other than a taxpayer specific rate) we'll notify the making of the determination and publish the determination in our Tax Information Bulletin and on our website at www.ird.govt.nz Higher maximum pooling values The aim of the pooling method of depreciation is to reduce compliance costs by calculating depreciation on low-value assets collectively, rather than individually. The maximum pooling value is $5,000. This means you can only pool assets that individually have an adjusted tax value of $5,000 or less. However, you may wish to apply for a higher maximum pooling value. You can do this by completing an Application for a higher maximum pooling value (IR719) form. www.ird.govt.nz 35 Part 3 Factors we take into account When deciding whether to set a higher maximum pooling value we consider the following three factors. Whether the assets you wish to include under a higher maximum pooling value are relatively similar in nature. Whether you'll make savings in compliance costs, such as clerical, computing and overhead costs, by having a higher maximum pooling value. You should show these in your application. How often you buy and sell the assets for which you want a higher maximum pooling value. How a higher maximum is set There are three stages to issuing a determination to set a higher maximum pooling value. These are: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing a determination. These stages are explained on page 32. Fees If you're applying for a higher maximum pooling value there is an application fee of $150 plus GST. We charge a processing fee of $75, plus GST, for each hour (or part-hour) after the first two hours for work by Inland Revenue. Send the application fee with your application. If we hire a consultant to advise on the estimated useful life or estimated residual value of an asset, we'll charge you for the consultant's fees plus GST. We'll also charge you for the consultant's fee plus GST if you request a conference and a consultant paid by us attends, or if you ask our consultant to carry out further work that doesn't result in a determination favourable to you. We'll send you an account for all fees you've incurred. The account will show the fee, the GST and the total unless we state otherwise. The costs incurred can be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes and if you're registered for GST you can claim the GST part of the cost as a credit. You can withdraw your application at any time - see page 33. Deductions for assets you no longer use This section relates to assets that are no longer used but haven't been physically disposed of. For example, if a business discards machinery because it's outdated and unsafe, but doesn't sell, assign or transfer it, the machinery hasn't been disposed of. If the cost of disposing of an asset you no longer use would be greater than the proceeds from its sale, you may claim the adjusted tax value as a deduction. If the scrap value of the machinery in the above example is greater than the costs of disposing of that machinery, a write-off won't apply. In such cases the machinery would need to be disposed of to claim a deduction. Dumping off site constitutes a disposal. These rules don't apply to buildings and pooled assets. See page 26 for more help on how to account for losses and gains on sale or disposal of assets. Conditions for a deduction To write off the adjusted tax value of an asset, you must meet the following conditions. You no longer use the asset in business or in producing income. Neither you nor an associate intend to use the asset in the future to derive gross income or in future business. It's uneconomic to dispose of the asset. 36 DEPRECIATION Part 4 Need to speak with us?

The term "depreciable assets" refers to all depreciable assets regardless of their acquisition date, and it includes assets acquired in the 1993 and earlier income years. Disposal occurs where a depreciable asset is sold or disposed of for a consideration. Event is a natural disaster such as an earthquake or flood resulting in the building being demolished or abandoned and later demolished. The damage to either the building or to the neighbourhood of the building has rendered the building useless for the purposes of deriving income, and isn't due to the action or failure to act of the person, their agent, or an associate. You can find out more in our Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 8 (October 2011), page 66, "Losses on buildings". Excluded depreciable assets are any assets purchased before 1 April 1993 and any of the following circumstances apply. The assets were used or available for use by the taxpayer in New Zealand, other than as trading stock, before 1 April 1993. Before 16 December 1991, the taxpayer entered into a binding contract to purchase the assets or have them constructed. They are or have been qualifying assets for a person or are or have been a qualifying improvement for the person. They are intangible assets used or available for use by the taxpayer before 1 April 1993. Excluded depreciable assets don't include assets in existence at the end of the 1993 income year that were accounted for using the standard value, replacement value or annual revaluation method. Glossary Adjusted tax value is the remaining value of your asset once the depreciation you calculate each year has been deducted from the value. Asset is the unit to be depreciated. For depreciation purposes it must not be subdivided into its separate components. Associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007 (sub-part YB) sets out rules that define when two persons are associated. These rules are categorised as tests of association as follows: two companies a company and a person other than a company two relatives a person and a trustee for a relative a trustee and a beneficiary trustees with a common settlor a trustee and a settlor a settlor and a beneficiary a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee a partnership and a partner two persons who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test). Base value means: the cost of an asset acquired after the beginning of the 1994 income year, or the adjusted tax value at the end of the 1993 income year if it's acquired before this date, or the market value at the time the asset is taken from private to business use, if this is after the beginning of the 1994 income year. This market value rule doesn't apply to buildings or schedule depreciable assets - see page 39. Depreciable intangible assets are intangible assets acquired or created on or after 1 April 1993 and listed in Schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and have a finite useful life. www.ird.govt.nz 39 Fixed-life depreciable assets are any intangible assets that: are depreciable intangible assets, and have a legal life which could reasonably be expected, on the date of creation or acquisition of those assets, to be the same length as the assets' remaining estimated useful life. Income year for depreciation purposes, includes any corresponding non-standard accounting year. Intangible assets are assets with a finite life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of their creation or acquisition. Legal life is defined for any intangible asset and means the number of years and any monthly fraction the asset may remain or continue to remain in existence by virtue of the contract or statute that creates the asset for the owner. It assumes the owner will exercise any rights of renewal or extension that are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of predetermined fees. Poolable assets are assets with a similar base value you can group for depreciation purposes, with a maximum value of $5,000 per asset. Schedule depreciable assets are petroleum drilling rigs, support vessels for offshore petroleum drilling rigs and support vessels for offshore petroleum production platforms. Because of the special nature of these assets, the depreciation calculation is made on a daily rather than a monthly basis. In addition, the base value for schedule depreciable assets acquired by a taxpayer from an associated person is the lower of the cost of the asset to the taxpayer or the aggregate of: the cost of the asset to: –the associated person who didn't acquire the asset from either the taxpayer or another associated person, or –the taxpayer or an associated person who owned the asset at the beginning of an unbroken chain of ownership, and all expenditure (excluding any expenditure allowed as depreciation allowances) incurred for the asset by the taxpayer and any associated persons before the date the taxpayer acquired the asset. The cost is determined as exclusive of any expenditure allowed as depreciation allowances. No adjustment is made on disposition or exit from the tax base for a schedule depreciable asset.
Depreciation - a guide for businesses IR260 November 2020 2 DEPRECIATION New Zealand allowed depreciation on all buildings until 2010. From the 2011-2012 income year depreciation was removed for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Legislative changes enacted on 25 March 2020, as part of a wider economic recovery package in response to COVID-19, reintroduces building depreciation but only for non-residential buildings (those that are not primarily used for residential accommodation). Non-residential building Non-residential building is defined as a building that is not a residential building. A residential building is defined as a dwelling; and includes a building intended to ordinarily provide accommodation for periods of less than 28 days at a time, if the building, together with other buildings on the same land, has less than 4 units for separate accommodation. The second part of the definition includes some buildings accommodating short-term stays to ensure there is certainty that the definition of “residential building” includes buildings such as a bach that the owner uses but also rents out on a short-term basis, and also buildings used exclusively for some short- term accommodation provided by owners such as Airbnb properties. These may be within the definition of “dwelling”, but this would put it beyond doubt those buildings remain non-depreciable. The less-than four units provision is meant to exclude larger commercial operations such as motels from being treated as a residential building. Effective date Depreciation for non-residential buildings has been reintroduced effective from the 2020-21 income year. Depreciation rate The depreciation rate for non-residential buildings is 2% diminishing value or 1.5% straight-line. Opening tax book value The opening tax book value for the beginning of the 2020-21 income year: for buildings that were owned by the taxpayer in the 2010–11 income year, will be: –the adjusted tax book value at the end of the 2010–11 income year, less fit-out deductions taken under the section DB 65 transitional rule if applicable; plus –non-deductible capital expenditure incurred with respect to the building from the end of the 2010–11 income year to the start of the 2020–21 income year. for buildings acquired after the end of the 2010–11 income year, will be: –the cost of the building; plus –non-deductible capital expenditure incurred with respect to the building from the time it was acquired until the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. Straight-line depreciation If a taxpayer elects to use the straight-line method, the building’s cost for the purpose of calculating the depreciation deduction would be the original cost price. The amount of depreciation is then deducted from the opening tax book value (not original cost) for the 2020–21 and subsequent income years. Repeal of the 2010 transitional rule As a result of reinstating depreciation on non- residential buildings, the transitional building fit-out rule introduced as part of the 2010 reforms is no longer required. Section DB 65 has been repealed, and the tax book value of the building will be adjusted for past DB 65 deductions. Special depreciation rate The ability to receive a special depreciation rate from the Commissioner has been restored for non- residential buildings.

Introduction This guide explains how to claim depreciation on your business assets. You're required to claim depreciation when you acquire an asset for your business and account for it when you dispose of that asset. We recommend you consult a tax agent when considering claiming for depreciation. However, it's still your responsibility to be aware of your tax obligations. Find the current depreciation rates by: using our Depreciation rate finder checking our General depreciation rates - IR265 guide. You'll find both of these at ird.govt.nz The rates are set out in two categories - industry and asset.

Note In legal terms, depreciable intangible assets, depreciable assets, excluded depreciable assets, fixed-life depreciable assets and intangible assets are known as "property". In this guide we refer to them as assets to avoid confusion, because the term "property" more commonly relates to land and buildings. 4 DEPRECIATION Contents Introduction 3 ird.govt.nz 3 How to get our forms and guides 3 How to use this guide 3 Part 1 - Overview 5 Main features of depreciation law 5 Compulsory depreciation claims 6 Electing not to depreciate 6 How to make an election not to depreciate 7 Assets that do not depreciate 7 Who can claim depreciation? 7 Cost of assets for depreciation purposes 8 GST and depreciation 8 Records 9 Individual or pooled assets 9 Diminishing value (DV) method 9 Straight line (SL) method 9 Changing methods 9 Pooling method 9 Rates 11 Part 2 - Detailed information on certain assets 12 Buildings 12 Land 13 Leased assets 15 Renting out a residential property 16 Holiday homes 16 Intangible assets 16 Computer software 20 Reservation of title clause (also known as Romalpa clause) 21 Low value assets (including loose tools) acquired on or after 19 May 2005 22 Part 3 - Adjustments and disposals 23 Newly acquired assets 23 Private use of business assets 23 Transferring depreciable assets between associated persons 25 Private assets becoming business assets 25 Disposals 25 Transferring assets under a relationship agreement 29 Transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies 29 Local authority trading enterprises 29 Determinations 30 1994 to 2005 rates 31 2006 and future years 31 Disputable decisions 32 Special depreciation rates 32 How we set a special rate 32 Provisional depreciation rates 33 Higher maximum pooling values 34 Deductions for assets you no longer use 35 Part 4 - Services you may need 36 Need to talk to us? 36 Supporting businesses in our community 36 0800 self-service numbers 36 Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) 36 Business Tax Update 36 Privacy 36 If you have a complaint about our service 37 Glossary 38 Part 1 ird.govt.nz 5 Part 1 - Overview Depreciation allows a deduction for capital expenditure, where a deduction wouldn't normally apply and acknowledges that the asset will eventually wear out or become outdated. For tax purposes, the reduced value of an asset is recognised by allowing a deduction against income for the depreciation of that asset from the time it is used in a business until it is sold, disposed of or discarded. This means the cost of the asset will be written off over its useful life. Once the whole cost price of the asset has been written off, no further deduction is allowed. When you calculate your depreciation deduction it's important to remember: the date you acquired the asset, since this determines which rates are available to you which industry and/or asset category best describes your depreciable asset. Main features of depreciation law From the 1994 income year, depreciation law relates to all depreciable assets regardless of the date you acquired them. You must make depreciation deductions each year, unless you make an election not to treat a particular asset as depreciable. You can only claim a depreciation deduction once you own the asset and it's used or available for use in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Depreciation is calculated according to the number of months in an income year you own and use the asset. A daily basis applies to certain assets used in the petroleum industry. From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non-residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. You may not claim depreciation in the year you dispose of any asset, unless it's a building. Although the general depreciation rates are set by a formula, you can apply for a higher or lower special depreciation rate if you can establish the general rate is unsuitable for your particular circumstances. Higher depreciation rates, previously available for assets used for multiple shifts, do not apply to assets acquired after 1 April 1993. Expenditure for repairs and maintenance can be claimed as a deduction through business accounts. Anything more than repairs or maintenance is capital expenditure and is not deductible, but will be subject to normal depreciation rules. In general terms the depreciation rate options available are as follows: 1. You must use the general rates set out in determinations we issue. For assets acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, use the rates listed in the IR265 guide. 2. For assets acquired between the 1996 income year and 31 March 2005 (or 18 May 2005 for buildings, including contracts of purchase entered into before 19 May 2005) use the rates listed in parts 2 and 3 of the IR267 guide. 3. For assets acquired on or after 1 April 1993, and before the end of the 1995 income year, you can use either the rates listed in parts 2 and 3 of the IR267 guide or the rates listed in part 1 of this guide plus 25% interim loading and any shift allowances. 4. Generally, for assets acquired before 1 April 1993 you must use the depreciation rates listed in part 1 of the IR267 guide. Both straight line and diminishing value methods are available for calculating depreciation on most assets and you can switch freely between the two. Assets that cost or have an adjusted tax value of $5,000 or less can be depreciated collectively, rather than individually, using the "pool" depreciation method (refer also next bullet for low value assets). Part 1 6 DEPRECIATION Generally low value assets can be written off in the year of purchase or creation based on the following thresholds. Up till 16 March 2020Up to $500 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021Up to $5,000 From 17 March 2021Up to $1,000 Certain intangible assets first used or available for use after 1 April 1993 have been brought into the depreciation system. Intangible assets with a fixed life must be depreciated using the straight line method. Gains on sale or disposal must be recognised in the year of sale. Losses on sales of depreciable assets, other than buildings, are deductible in the year of sale. There are restrictions on the depreciation deductions that can be made to depreciable assets transferred between associated parties. From 1 April 1997, only those companies that are 100% commonly owned and that choose to consolidate are able to transfer assets within their group at the assets' adjusted tax value. Wholly owned companies which do not form a consolidated group are required to transfer assets at market value and recover or claim a loss of depreciation as applicable. You may be able to write off the residual tax value of any depreciable asset that you no longer use to derive gross income. Some assets cannot be depreciated for income tax purposes either because they are specifically exempted (for example, land or trading stock) or they do not reduce in value over time (for example, Lotto franchise fees). A depreciation loading no longer applies for assets acquired after 20 May 2010. The loading will only apply to qualifying assets: –acquired on or before 20 May 2010, or –where a binding contract existed on or before 20 May 2010. Compulsory depreciation claims You must claim the amount of depreciation you are entitled to unless you elect an asset not to be depreciable property. It's usually not possible to defer or only partially claim allowable depreciation. If no depreciation deduction is claimed and no election is made, you're considered to have claimed depreciation for the purposes of calculating the adjusted tax value of the asset and when calculating the depreciation recovered (see "Disposals" on page 25). If you do not claim depreciation in your tax return, the adjusted tax value of the asset will still be reduced by the amount calculated using the appropriate method. The default method for calculating depreciation is diminishing value. For depreciation recovery purposes, where the depreciable asset is disposed of for more than the adjusted tax value, then the taxable income will be the lesser of: the previously allowed depreciation (including deemed to be allowed), or the amount by which the amount received exceeds the adjusted tax value. For assets purchased before the 1994 income year, and depending on the disposal amount, the depreciation recovered is the actual depreciation permitted under the old system (when the depreciation deduction was not compulsory) plus the allowable depreciation for the 1994 and subsequent income years. Taxpayers do not have to have claimed extra depreciation on excluded depreciable assets (generally, meaning assets purchased before 1 April 1993). This extra depreciation is allowed as either: a supplementary depreciation allowance, or a 25% interim loading. Electing not to depreciate Although it's compulsory for you to claim a depreciation deduction, we recognise there can be instances where you may not want to. If you do not want to claim depreciation on an asset, and you want to avoid paying tax on depreciation recovered when it was not claimed, you should elect not to treat the asset as depreciable. You cannot pick and choose the years in which you depreciate an asset. However, if an asset periodically will be and then will not be used in your business (such as a residential building that is temporarily let), you may choose whether or not to depreciate the asset in each period. Our IR264 guide discusses this option in more detail. If you elect not to depreciate your asset, it will no longer be a depreciable asset and the depreciation recovery or loss on sale provisions will not apply to it. Part 1 ird.govt.nz 7 Note From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Who can claim depreciation? A depreciation deduction for a particular asset is only allowed once you own the asset and it's used or available for use in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Ownership You're considered to own an asset when: you acquire legal title (binding contract), or you take up beneficial ownership, which occurs when an asset passes by way of gift, bequest or distribution to a new owner. Where there is both an equitable owner and a legal owner of the same asset, depreciation may only be claimed by the owner who uses the asset or has that asset available for use in deriving their gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate their gross income. So, to claim a depreciation deduction for an asset, you must: own it, or lease it under a specified or finance lease (see page 15), or be buying it under a hire purchase agreement. Your asset must also be expected to reduce in value while it's used or is available for use in your business. Used or available for use The following are some examples of the criteria of "used" or "available for use". You cannot start claiming depreciation on any equipment purchased until your business commences. How to make an election not to depreciate You'll need to let us know if you're making an election by attaching your notification to your tax return for the income year that you: purchase the asset, or changed the asset use from non-business to business, or elect not to depreciate an asset that you've not claimed depreciation on in any previous year. This election will then apply to every year from when the asset was purchased. Your notification needs to provide the following details: a description of the asset the purchase date the income year the election is being made for whether the asset has been newly acquired or its use has changed if the election is for retrospective depreciation. Assets that do not depreciate Some assets do not depreciate for tax purposes. These assets include: those you've elected to treat as not depreciable trading stock land (except for buildings, fixture or land improvements as specified in Schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007) financial arrangements under the accrual rules intangible assets, for example, goodwill (other than depreciable intangible assets of the type listed in Schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) low-value assets that are fully written off on acquisition Up till 16 March 2020Up to $500 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021Up to $5,000 From 17 March 2021Up to $1,000 an asset whose cost is allowed as a deduction under some other tax provision an asset that does not decline in economic value because of compensation for loss or damage an asset whose cost was or is allowed as a deduction in any income year to any other taxpayer under any of the special provisions relating to primary sector land improvements. Part 1 8 DEPRECIATION Example In April 2014, Enid purchases equipment in anticipation of setting up a home tutoring business but does not start the business until March 2015. The depreciation deduction for Enid's 2015 income year is restricted to one-twelfth of the yearly depreciation rate. Cargo ship in dry docks - conducting normal ongoing maintenance is an ordinary incidence of business and the ship would still be wholly used or available for use in carrying on the business. Plant and machinery finished and awaiting other plant - depending on the facts, if the completed plant and machinery were available for use in isolation or in another production line if required, the depreciation could be claimed. However, if a further machine or plant was required in order to produce a product, depreciation could not commence until that other necessary plant or machinery was available for use. Plant and machinery in storage - this depends on the degree and time of reconnection or installation required. If the item (for example, a transformer) were a back-up piece of equipment necessary to keep an operation going, it would be regarded as being available for use and would be depreciable. However, if a new piece of machinery or a new plant were being delivered and had yet to be installed (for example, being shipped in from offshore) there would be no entitlement to depreciation until the installation process was completed. Assets temporarily out of operation for repair or inspection are regarded as being available for use and can be depreciated. Cost of assets for depreciation purposes Generally, the cost of an asset is the amount paid by the purchaser - normally the market value - and this principle applies to associated persons. For further information on transfers between associated persons see page 25. If the property has been inherited, the cost price for depreciation purposes is its market value at the time the property is transferred to the new owner. The exception is for a spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner where transfer is at cost or adjusted tax value. For income tax purposes a deduction is not usually available for expenses incurred in acquiring a capital asset. This includes legal fees charged by a solicitor for preparing and registering the various documents relating to the purchase. From the 2010 income year business-related legal expenses for buying or selling a property can be deducted. This is provided your total legal expenses for the income year, including the fees associated with buying and selling a property, are equal to or less than $10,000. In all other cases, this type of expenditure may be added to the cost of the purchased asset when calculating depreciation on that asset. The depreciation you calculate each year is deducted from the value of your asset. The remaining value is called the asset's adjusted tax value. GST and depreciation If you're registered for GST (goods and services tax), you can generally claim a credit for the GST part of an asset's cost price. You calculate depreciation on the GST-exclusive price of the asset. If you are not registered for GST, you base your depreciation on the actual price you pay for an asset, including GST. Part 1 ird.govt.nz 9 Records As with all tax matters you must keep sufficient and accurate records. For depreciation purposes, your records must be able to substantiate your depreciation claims, purchases and sales of your business assets so, if we need to, we can check your deductions (including losses) and depreciation recovered. You must keep your records for at least seven years. Individual or pooled assets You can account for depreciation on your assets in two ways, as an individual asset or as part of a group or pool of assets. See "Pooling method" in the next column. If you choose to calculate depreciation on individual assets you can use either the diminishing value (DV) method of calculating depreciation or the straight line (SL) method. If you decide to group your assets into a pool you must use the DV method for calculating depreciation. Diminishing value (DV) method With this method depreciation is calculated each year by using a constant percentage of the asset's adjusted tax value. This method is sometimes also referred to as the written down value or tax book value. The DV method means your depreciation deduction will progressively reduce each year. Example Depreciation on office equipment that cost $10,000 was calculated using the DV depreciation rate of 33%. The depreciation is calculated as follows: Adjusted tax valueDepreciation of 33% Year 1 $10,000$3,300 Year 2 $6,700$2,211 Ye a r 3$4,489$1,481 Straight line (SL) method With this method an asset depreciates every year by the same amount, which is a percentage of its original cost price. This method is sometimes called the cost price basis. Example Depreciation on office equipment that cost $10,000 was calculated using the SL depreciation rate of 24%. The depreciation is calculated as follows: Adjusted tax valueDepreciation of 24% Year 1 $10,000$2,400 Year 2 $7,600$2,400 Ye a r 3$5,200$2,400 Changing methods You can choose to use either the SL or DV method for individual assets (except for pooled assets and fixed- life intangible assets) regardless of when you bought the assets. If you decide to change depreciation methods, use the current adjusted tax value to calculate depreciation and not the original cost price of the asset. Once you've filed your tax return you cannot change methods for that income year. Pooling method The pooling method allows you to group together (pool) a number of low-value assets and calculate depreciation on the pool. The advantage of pooling assets is the cost of compliance is reduced because all the assets in the pool are treated as one asset for the purposes of depreciation. The disadvantage of pooling assets is that if you sell an asset in a pool for more than its cost price, this capital gain amount must be included as taxable income. Main features of the pooling method Only diminishing value (DV) rates can be used for the pool method. Where items in the pool have different depreciation rates, the lowest rate is applied to the pool. Buildings cannot be depreciated using the pooling method. The maximum pooling value is generally $5,000 for each individual asset, but you may apply for a higher pooling value for specific assets - see page 34. For GST-registered people, the maximum pooling value excludes GST. Part 1 10 DEPRECIATION The maximum pooling value of $5,000 applies from the 2015-2016 income year. The maximum pooling value is $2,000 prior to this. All poolable assets must be used wholly in business (no private use), or be subject to FBT (fringe benefit tax). Once an asset is included in a pool it cannot be separated out later, except where the asset must be isolated because you now use it privately. There is no restriction on the depreciation recovered for a pooled asset. Any capital gains are taxed - see page 26. When all assets in a pool have been disposed of but the pool still has a positive value, ie, the proceeds of the sale are less than the pool value, this remaining value of the pool is deductible from your gross income. Calculating depreciation for an asset pool Assets can only be pooled if individual assets within the pool each have a value equal to or less than the maximum pooling value. This maximum is currently set at $5,000, so assets that can be pooled are those that: individually cost you $5,000 or less, or have depreciated and whose adjusted tax value has been reduced to $5,000 or less. Example Hiram bought a printing machine for $5,500 and calculated depreciation using the DV method. CostDepreciation 10% DV Adjusted tax value at the end of year $5,500$550$4,950 Hiram could include the printing machine in a pool of assets for the second year. If your assets meet this requirement, you may pool any number of them and you may have as many pools as suit your circumstances. You can also combine two or more pools to form one pool. Note The maximum pooling value of $5,000 applies from the 2015-2016 income year. The maximum pooling value is $2,000 prior to this. Depreciation is calculated on the average value of the pool for the income year, using the DV method. Work out the average value of the pool by adding together the pool's value at the beginning and end of the income year, before depreciation has been deducted, and then dividing by two. Example Adam has a pool of assets with an adjusted tax value at the beginning of the year of $18,000. During the year he purchases three assets for $5,000 each. At the end of the year, he decides to include them in the pool. The value of the pool at the end of the income year (before deducting depreciation) is $33,000. The average pool value is: $18,000 + $33,000 =$25,500 2 Adam is using the DV rate of 22%, so the depreciation deduction and the adjusted tax value of the pool will be calculated as follows: Value of pool at the end of income year 33,000 Less annual depreciation ($25,500 x 22%) -$5,610 Adjusted tax value of pool$27,390 Where your income year is longer or shorter than 12 months because of a change in balance date, you'll need to apportion the annual depreciation to the number of whole or part months in your income year. When the assets in the pool have different depreciation rates you must use the lowest rate. This could happen when different types of assets are included in a pool. Example Richard owns a shop and these are some of his assets that he could pool. Cash register 40% DV Electric sign 20% DV Fittings 20% DV Furniture 20% DV The rate for this pool would be 20% DV. In a case such as this, Richard may decide to pool only those assets with the 20% DV depreciation rate and account for depreciation on the cash register separately or as an asset in another pool. In the first year of pooling, it's very important to carefully consider the date from which you'll pool your assets, because it will have a significant effect on the average pool value used when calculating depreciation. Part 1 ird.govt.nz 11 If you decide to pool your assets part-way through an income year, the pool value at the beginning of the income year will be nil. The amount of depreciation you can claim will be based on half the pool value at the end of the income year. Example Anne starts a business on 15 May 2013 and purchases five assets for $2,000 each, which she pools. She has a 31 March balance date and uses a depreciation rate of 20% DV. Her 2014 depreciation deduction is calculated as follows: Calculate average pool value: Pool value at beginning of year (1 April 2013)nil Pool value at end of year (31 March 2014)$10,000 Divide by 2 to average$5,000 Calculate annual depreciation: $5,000 x 20% x 11 months = $916.66 depreciation 12 (The 11 months is 15 May 2013 to 31 March 2014.) Adding assets to a pool The adjusted tax value of an existing pool is increased by: the cost price of the asset (if it's newly acquired), or the adjusted tax value of the asset (if it was previously depreciated separately). If assets are added to the pool at the beginning of an income year, the pool values at both the beginning and end of the year will increase. If the assets are added to the pool part-way through the income year, only the pool value at the end of the year will increase. Rates Once you've decided on the method (or methods) you'll use to account for depreciation, you have to identify the correct rate for calculating the amount of the deduction. The correct depreciation rate to use depends on the date you acquired the asset. To find the depreciation rates for all depreciable assets acquired after 1 April 1993, use our depreciation rate finder at ird.govt.nz/depreciation For assets acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, use the rates listed in the IR265 guide. For all assets acquired before these dates refer to our IR267 guide. These guides are available on our website ird.govt.nz Loading Any asset purchased from 21 May 2010 onwards is not entitled to the 20% depreciation loading. If you entered into a contract to purchase an asset on or before 20 May 2010, you can still depreciate this asset with the loading. Any asset being depreciated at a rate with loading before 21 May 2010 can continue to be depreciated at that rate for that asset's lifetime. However, if there is a capital improvement to an asset with the 20% loading, this improvement will need to be depreciated separately from the original asset, and will be depreciated without the loading allowance. Provisional and special rates If we haven't set a general depreciation rate for your particular type of asset, you may apply for a provisional rate to be set - see page 33. General depreciation rates are based on the average use of an asset. If you believe you use your asset more heavily or less heavily than is generally the case, or the conditions in which the asset is used are abnormal, you may want to apply for a special rate - see page 32. How rates are calculated If you'd like to know how we work out the general rates for assets see page 30. Part 2 12 DEPRECIATION Buildings do not qualify for the increased loading of 25% on the historic rates or 20% on the general rates. Buildings are not eligible for the special deduction for assets you no longer use - see page 35. Generally, when a personal (non-business) asset is introduced into a business, the market value at that time is used to calculate depreciation. This rule does not apply to buildings, where the original cost (excluding land) must be used for calculating depreciation. Buildings transferred between companies where there is 100% common ownership or transfers under a relationship agreement can continue to use the depreciation rate applying to the building at the time of transfer. Depreciation claims on buildings acquired before the 1994 income year must be calculated using the SL method. However, you can choose between the SL and the DV methods to calculate depreciation for the 1994 and future income years on assets acquired before 1 April 1993. Depreciation on buildings is calculated on either the original cost or the adjusted tax value depending on which depreciation method you use. The first time you use the DV method you need to calculate the adjusted tax value of your building. The building's depreciation is calculated on this amount. To work out the adjusted tax value, deduct the amount of depreciation you've claimed since you bought the building, from the original cost of the building (excluding land). Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Sale of buildings When a building is sold for more than its adjusted tax value, the depreciation recovered is taxable income. The amount of depreciation recovered is the smaller of: the original cost price of the building minus the adjusted tax value the sale price minus the adjusted tax value. This ensures any capital profit made on the sale of a building is not included as taxable income. Losses made when selling or disposing of buildings are generally not deductible. This section provides further information on certain assets of particular interest. Buildings From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties, including leasehold property. If the type of building you own currently has an estimated useful life, as determined by Inland Revenue, of less than 50 years you can simply continue to claim depreciation deductions as you have previously. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Even though many buildings can no longer be depreciated, depreciation recovery will still apply for those buildings when they're sold for greater than their book value. This applies regardless of when the building was acquired. The chattels and fit-out of a building, where it does not form part of the building, can still be depreciated. Interpretation statement 10/01 "Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable property" sets out a three-step test that we apply to determine whether an item can be separated out or whether it's regarded as being part of the building. You can find this in our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). Further information on the treatment of commercial or industrial building fit-outs, "Clarifying that certain building fit-out is depreciable property", is available in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011). These special rules also apply to buildings. When disposing of a building a loss cannot be claimed as a deduction, except where due to an emergency event, eg, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, the building has been rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income and is demolished. See "Event" page 38. Buildings cannot be pooled. Depreciation on buildings, unlike other assets, can be claimed in the year of sale. Part 2 - Detailed information on certain assets Part 2 ird.govt.nz 13 Definition of a "building" The term "building" can have various meanings depending on the context in which the term is used. A building in ordinary circumstances is defined as: a structure of considerable size permanent in the sense that it's intended to last a considerable time enclosed by walls and a roof able to function independently of any other structure. However, a building is not necessarily a physically separate structure. The term building does not include certain affected structures acquired on or before 30 July 2009. Interpretation statement 10/02 provides a full explanation of the meaning of "building". Under this statement, some structures have been reclassified as buildings for the purposes of depreciation. To determine if your structure has been affected you'll need to refer back to the interpretation statement to determine the correct depreciation treatment for your asset. You can find the 10/02 Interpretation statement in our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 5 (June 2010). Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Resource consents The ability to depreciate expenditure on a resource consent depends on the type of expenditure, the type of consent and the resulting asset. Interpretation Statement IS 18/06, Income tax – Treatment of costs of resource consents, provides a full treatment of these issues and when expenditure on resource consents may be depreciable. You can download this statement from our website ird.govt.nz Land You cannot claim depreciation on land because land, generally, does not depreciate. When land and buildings are purchased and the price does not specify the cost of the buildings, the government valuation (at the time of purchase) may be used to calculate this cost: Value of improvements (buildings) × purchase price = cost of buildings Capital value (land and buildings) Land improvements Land improvements, however, may depreciate, and since 1 April 1993 there has been the provision for specific fixtures on the land (non-primary sector land) to be depreciated. These fixtures as listed in Schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are: airport runways bores and wells bridges chimneys culverts dams fences hardstanding (for example, asphalt car park) pipes purpose-built surfaces for outdoor sports facilities reservoirs retaining walls roads spillways swimming pools tanks tunnels wharves. In the same manner as plant and machinery, these fixtures are depreciable at the general rates if made in the 1996 and later income years. They also qualify for the 20% loading if made in the 1996 income year and before 21 May 2010. Part 2 14 DEPRECIATION Expenditure on farm and forestry land and aquaculture improvements Although land is not a depreciable asset, there are provisions allowing you to progressively deduct expenditure incurred in preparing or otherwise developing land within the farming, agriculture, forestry and aquaculture industries. This differs from the depreciation of other land improvements. While depreciation is subject to the period the asset was used during the financial year, the deduction for the development expenditure is not time based. You can claim the full percentage of the deduction (plus any loading) even if the development expenditure occurs near the end of the financial year, provided the expenditure benefits the business in that income year. Deductions are allowed for losses on farm land improvements where an event has occurred either destroying or rendering the improvements useless for deriving income. When the land is sold there is no taxable recovery of any deductions allowed for the capitalised development expenditure. When the land is sold the undeducted balance of the development expenditure can be transferred to the new owner. The capitalised development expenditure effectively stays with the land, rather than with the person who incurred it. We recommend you consult a tax agent when considering this. Taxpayers involved in the primary sector may claim depreciation for assets listed in Schedule 13. However, they may only do so when they cannot claim the expenditure under section DO 1 or DO 2 or Schedule 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007. To read tax legislation online, go to legislation.govt.nz The following are some examples of the specific provisions applying to farming and agriculture (Schedule 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007) for land improvements. Clearing land The expenditure incurred in clearing land is deductible in the year it was incurred. Cultivating land The expenditure incurred in cultivating land is deductible on a DV basis (similar to depreciation) at the rate of 5% each year. Expenditure incurred between 16 December 1991 and the end of the taxpayer's 1995 income year qualifies for a 25% loading, ie, 6.25%. Expenditure incurred in the 1996 or any subsequent income year (up until 1 April 2013) qualifies for a 20% loading, ie, 6%. Irrigation system and plant This is capital expenditure so normal depreciation rules apply. Installing tile drains This is deductible on a DV basis at the annual rate of 5% (plus any loading). This same rate would apply to the cost of replacing a tile drainage system. The fact that the retiling may be done over a period longer than one year does not affect the deduction that can be claimed. A loss cannot be claimed on the old system because it's scrapped, nor can a continued deduction be made for the old system since the asset is no longer of benefit to the business. Sinking a bore This is deductible on a DV basis at the rate of 5% (plus any loading) each year. Regrassing and fertilising Expenditure incurred in connection with significant capital activity, such as a change from one type of farming to another, is deductible on a DV basis at the rate of 45% each year. A 20% depreciation loading applied to farming and agriculture land improvements acquired before 1 April 2013. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 15 Leased assets For tax purposes there are four kinds of lease. The type of lease determines whether the lessor (owner) or the lessee (person paying to use the asset) is entitled to claim depreciation on the asset. Specified leases A specified lease is a lease agreement entered into between 6 August 1982 and 19 May 1999 that meets certain criteria. The lease is a specified lease if: it has a guaranteed residual value, or the lease term is more than 36 consecutive months (or, if we consider the economic life of the asset is less than 36 months, a term equal to the economic life of the lease asset), and –the lessee becomes the owner at the end of the term, or –the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at the end of the term at a price significantly lower than market value, or –the total of all payments and the guaranteed residual value is more than, or roughly equal to, the cost price, or –both parties agree the lessee is liable for the payment of all, or nearly all, maintenance and other incidental costs. Specified leases include: leases acquired by any means whatsoever, whether from the lessor or another person, and leases entered into between 28 October 1983 and 19 May 1999 (both dates inclusive) if a person other than the lessee acquires the asset and they are associated with the lessee. Finance leases A finance lease is an agreement entered into on or after 20 May 1999 under which: ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee (or an associate of the lessee) at the end of the term, or the lessee (or an associate of the lessee) has the option of acquiring the asset for an amount significantly lower than market value, or the lease term is more than 75% of the asset's estimated useful life (as determined under section EE63 of the Income Tax Act 2007). For income years including 20 June 2007 and later income years, the lease, or an arrangement of which the lease is part, must: involve the use of the lease asset outside New Zealand for all or most of the term of the lease, and involve income from the use of the asset by any person other than the lessor which is exempt, excluded or non-residents' foreign sourced income, and be an arrangement in which substantially all the risks and rewards that are incidental to ownership are incurred by persons other than the lessor and/ or it's a finance lease under NZIAS 17 either for the lessor or for another company in the same group of companies that derives assessable income from the arrangement. With both specified and finance leases, the lessor is treated as selling the asset to the lessee at the beginning of the lease. Therefore, the lessee is the owner and is entitled to the deduction for depreciation. Hire purchase A hire purchase agreement passing ownership to the person paying the hire purchase allows that person to claim any allowable depreciation. This provision overrides the general provision that limits the claim to the owner of the asset. Leasehold improvements A lessee is considered to own and be entitled to claim depreciation on the cost of leasehold fixtures or improvements incurred by that lessee, but under land law principles are technically owned by the lessor. When the lease expires, to calculate the loss on disposal, the lessee is considered to have disposed of the fixture or improvement. The lessor, including subsequent lessors, will not be able to depreciate such fixtures or improvements during the term of the lease. However, once the lease has expired, the lessor will be able to depreciate the fixtures and improvements if they have paid the lessee for these. This also applies when the lessee transfers the lease and the person the lease is transferred to pays the original lessee for the leasehold improvements. The same applies to licences to occupy. Part 2 16 DEPRECIATION Non-specified and operating leases If a lease was entered into between 6 August 1982 and 19 May 1999 and it is not a specified lease, it's known as a non-specified lease. If the lease was entered into on or after 20 May 1999 and it is not a finance lease, it's an operating lease. For these kinds of leases, the owner (lessor) of the lease asset claims the deduction for depreciation. Renting out a residential property You must claim depreciation on a house or flat you're renting out as a deduction from the rent you receive, unless you make an election for the asset not to be a depreciable asset. You must also claim depreciation on any contents in the house or flat being used or available for use by the tenants, unless you elect otherwise - see page 6. Depreciation rules for the house itself are covered under "Buildings" on page 12. The contents of the house may be depreciated either on an individual item basis or using the pooling method - see page 9. If you're calculating depreciation on contents for the first time, the adjusted tax value will be the lesser of the cost of those items or their market value at the time they're first used or available for use in earning rental income. The rates for house or flat contents are set out in the industry category "Residential rental property chattels". You can find this in our depreciation rate finder on ird.govt.nz/depreciation Or, you can use our guides IR265 for chattels acquired on or after 1 April 2005, and the IR267 for chattels acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and up to 31 March 2005. Depreciable item distinct from the building If an item in a residential rental property is distinct from the building and meets the definition of "depreciable property", it may be depreciated separately. If an item is part of the building it cannot be depreciated separately, but can be depreciated with the building. It's important that the correct approach is applied to determine if these items are regarded as distinct from the building. To determine whether a particular item is part of or separate from the building there is a three- step test. 1. The item is in some way attached or connected to the building. 2. The item is an integral part of the residential rental property, so it wouldn't function as a rental without it. 3. The item is built-in or attached/connected in such a way that it's part of the "fabric" of the building. Full commentary on Interpretation statement 10/01 "Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable properties" can be found in the Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). For more information, read our IR264 guide. It explains the taxable income and deductible expenses for people who own rental property. Holiday homes Where a holiday home is considered to be a "rental" property, depreciation may be claimed. The proportion of depreciation claimed on the assets will vary depending on the degree of actual rental time. The facts of a particular case always need to be considered carefully and so it may be necessary to seek advice from a tax advisor before making any claim for depreciation or other expenses on a holiday home. You can find more information on income tax treatment of holiday homes in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 3 (May 2009). Intangible assets Depreciating intangible assets Certain intangible assets have been included in the depreciation rules, and can be depreciated under the general rules applying to other depreciable assets. The only difference is that the rules apply to intangible assets acquired or created on or after 1 April 1993, rather than from a taxpayer's 1994 income or non- standard balance date accounting year. The 20% depreciation loading does not apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 17 Intangible assets acquired or created after 1 April 1993 that are depreciable, intangible property, are limited to those listed in Schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and they all have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of creation or acquisition. In brief, the intangible assets covered by Schedule 14 are: a patent, or the right to use a patent the right to use a copyright, trademark, design, plan or similar the right to use land, plant or machinery software copyright management rights and licence rights created under the Radiocommunications Act 1989 consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 copyright in a sound recording plant variety rights, or the right to use them. To be depreciable, an intangible asset must be both: an asset of the type listed in Schedule 14 an asset that might reasonably be expected to decline in value under normal circumstances. The most common feature of the assets listed in Schedule 14 is the "right to use". Take, for example, costs incurred in designing and producing a logo. A logo is not listed in the schedule so the costs are considered to be a one-off capital cost and not depreciable. If the logo, once created, is then trademarked and the rights to use are sold, the purchaser can depreciate those rights. The depreciation rules vary according to whether or not intangible assets have a fixed life or an economic life. Intangible assets with a fixed life An intangible asset with a fixed life is any intangible asset that is depreciable with a legal life that could reasonably be expected, on the date of creation or acquisition of that asset, to be the same length as the asset's remaining estimated useful life. If an intangible asset falls into this category, the depreciation rate is self-assessed by the owner using the formula: 1 Legal life (years) In such cases the "legal life" is defined as the length of time the intangible asset may exist as specified by the contract or statute that created it. In addition, legal life will include any renewal or extension period where those renewals or extensions are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of a predetermined fee. The formula gives an SL depreciation rate. The SL method is the only depreciation method that can be used for fixed-life intangible assets. Intangible assets with a fixed life are not eligible for the 20% loading that applies from the 1996 income year until 20 May 2010. Example Mark acquired the right to use a registered trademark from 1 April 2006 with a value of $10,000 and a legal life of five years. Using the above formula, the depreciation rate Mark would use is: 1 =0.2 or 20% 5 Mark can claim a $2,000 deduction for depreciation each year. Note A special depreciation rate may be applied if the economic life is different from the legal life of the intangible asset. Intangible assets with an economic life If the intangible asset does not have a fixed life, it can be expected to have an economic life shorter than its legal life. Unlike fixed-life intangible assets, economic- life intangible assets are depreciated using the same methods applied to all tangible depreciable assets, ie, a DV or SL depreciation rate. They can be pooled and, if purchased between 1996 and 20 May 2010, are eligible for a 20% loading. Taxpayers can also apply for a special or provisional depreciation rate for economic life intangibles. For example, a taxpayer may obtain a licence to use computer software for life, whereas the economic life of that software would possibly only be three years. Part 2 18 DEPRECIATION Franchises Franchise agreements are not a category of intangible assets listed in Schedule 14 so they are not normally considered to be depreciable intangible assets. However, any particular franchise agreement may give rise to specific rights listed in Schedule 14, for example, the right to use a trademark. Remember, the rights are the depreciable intangible assets, not the franchise agreement. If a franchise agreement stipulates a mixture of rights, and one particular right is specifically listed in Schedule 14 and is capable of being separately and clearly isolated and valued, that right will be a depreciable intangible asset, provided it might reasonably be expected to decline in value under normal circumstances. Whether or not the rights conferred under a franchise agreement are considered to be the type listed in Schedule 14, they will not be depreciable if any of the following situations apply: You cannot estimate with any reasonable degree of certainty a finite and defined period of life. The rights are not expected to decline in value over their life. The payment is made to purchase goodwill rather than the rights to secret formulas, processes, trademarks or similar. If a right conferred under a franchise agreement is depreciable, it will usually have a legal life equivalent to its estimated useful life. Accordingly, it must be depreciated using the SL method as an intangible asset with a fixed life. If a right conferred under a franchise agreement is automatically renewed or the right to renewal is only subject to the payment of a predetermined fee, the legal life of that right will be equal to the full term of the agreement, assuming the right to renewal is taken up. Example Cherrypoppin Ltd paid $50,000 to acquire the New Zealand franchise rights to manufacture and distribute Rolloseal towel rails. The franchise agreement is for a 10-year period. The majority of the $50,000 franchise fee went to capital expenditure, however, $20,000 of the fee related to the right to use a patent. The franchise was acquired on 1 April 2006 to extend until 1 April 2016. The right to use the patent is a fixed-life intangible asset. When the franchise was purchased, it appeared the right to use the patent would remain valuable to the end of its legal life. The legal life of this fixed-life intangible asset is 10 years. The SL depreciation rate to be used by Cherrypoppin Ltd for the right to use a patent is: 1/10 = 10% on cost of $20,000. The annual depreciation is $2,000. Additional costs Any additional costs, incurred in relation to an intangible asset with a fixed life during the legal life of that asset, are added to the book value. This is done at the beginning of the income year in which the costs are incurred. The aggregate costs are depreciated over the remaining legal life of that intangible asset (calculated from the beginning of the year in which they are incurred). A legal life includes any renewal or extension period where the renewal or extension is essentially unconditional or conditional only on the payment of predetermined fees. So, the depreciation rate for the fixed-life intangible asset changes. In effect, the fixed-life intangible asset is treated as newly acquired from the beginning of that year for the sum of the adjusted tax value and additional costs. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 19 Example Karion Ltd acquires the right to use a copyright for five years for $10,000 and has an option to renew for a further five years on payment of an additional $5,000. The legal life is therefore: 1/10 = 10% on cost of $10,000. The annual depreciation is $1,000. In the first five years, Karion Ltd claims annual deductions totalling $5,000. In year six, Karion Ltd pays the additional $5,000. The sum of the adjusted tax value and additional cost is $10,000 ($5,000 + $5,000). The remaining legal life of the right is five years, so the depreciation rate for years six to ten is: 1/5 = 20% on cost of $10,000. The annual depreciation in years six to ten is $2,000. It is necessary to calculate a loss or gain on disposal of a depreciable intangible asset - see page 26. Patents Patent rights acquired after 1 April 1993 are also depreciable intangible assets. Timing of depreciation For patent applications lodged before 1 April 2005 and granted in the 2005-06 income year or later, depreciation begins from the date the application is granted. However, there's a catch-up deduction for the period between when the application is lodged and when it's granted. For patent applications lodged on or after 1 April 2005, depreciation begins from the date the patent application is lodged with a complete specification. Depreciation rates for patents Patents have a legal life of 20 years, which is 240 months. To work out the depreciation rate divide the number of months in that year by 240. For patents with applications lodged before 1 April 2005 and granted in the 2005-06 tax year or later, divide the number of months the patent was pending by 240 to give the catch-up depreciation rate. Further details on the tax implications of selling patents are covered on page 27. Example 1 - Patent application lodged before 1 April 2005 Kariov filed for a patent on a new type of footwear on 4 April 2004. The patent is granted on 2 June 2007. The total patent costs were $10,000. The depreciation for the patent would be calculated as follows: Depreciation catch-up (April 04-May 07) 38 months/240 months = 16% on cost of $10,000 = $1,600 depreciation\* Annual rate for the year (June 07-March 08) 10 months/240 months = 4% on cost of $10,000 = $400 depreciation\* 2008-09 income year onwards 12 months/240 months = 5% on cost of $10,000 = $500 depreciation (as the SL method must be used). Kariov will be able to claim $500 each year until the patent expires. \* The total depreciation for the 2007-08 income year would be $2,000 ($1,600+$400) Example 2 - Application lodged after 1 April 2005 KIZ Ltd files for a patent on a new type of cat-door. It lodged its application with complete specification on 15 September 2005. The patent is granted on 21 February 2008. The depreciation rate for the patent application and for the patent (once granted) would be calculated as follows: Depreciation rate for patent application 2005-06 income year (Sept 05 to Mar 06) 7 months/240 months = 0.03 2006-07 income year 12 months/240 months = 0.05 2007-08 income year (April 07-Jan 08) 10 months/240 months = 0.04\* Depreciation rate for patent 2007-08 income year (Feb 08-Mar 08) 2 months/240 months = 0.01\* 2008-09 income year onwards 12 months/240 months = 0.05 \* The total depreciation rate for the 2007-08 income year would be 0.05 (0.04+0.01) Part 2 20 DEPRECIATION For more information on depreciation on patents see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 7 (September 2005). Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Fishing quotas There are two types of fishing quota: individual term quotas (ITQs), which are issued in perpetuity transferable term quotas (TTQs), which are issued for fixed periods. Most fishing quotas give the owner the right to catch a defined percentage of the total allowable commercial catch, so do not fall within any of the classes of intangible assets listed in Schedule 14. Also, the majority of quotas issued to date have been ITQs, which have an indefinite life, and are not depreciable anyway. Please note that a TTQ is depreciable property - specifically, it is fixed-life intangible property. For more information about fishing quotas, please refer to our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 3 (March 2000). Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Computer software This section explains our policy on the tax treatment of computer software expenditure. Some of the terms used in our software policy are explained below. Development The following activities are likely to be part of a development phase: gathering and analysing user requirements designing systems developing detailed software specifications constructing programs testing software testing the user or customer (acceptance testing) developing manuals and training material preparing documents for use in ongoing software product maintenance providing management review throughout the development phase (for example, quality assurance). Maintenance The following activities will generally be accepted as deductible maintenance payments: developing helpdesk facilities fixing program bugs bringing performance up to the original specifications making minor changes, such as increasing field sizes. Predevelopment This term refers to a feasibility study of a project as part of ongoing business. Software Software includes all programs or routines used to cause a computer to perform a desired task or set of tasks, and the documentation and training materials required to describe and maintain these programs. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 21 Upgrade Generally, an upgrade of computer software: adds new features to the structure increases its capacity or performance extends the life of the software provides a new version of the software that has more capacity or increased performance. Categories of software expenditure For tax purposes, software expenditure is divided into six categories, each treated differently. Software purchases Cost of purchase should be capitalised and depreciated. Immediate write-off is available for software costing less than $500. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Specified lease of software Cost price of software must be capitalised and depreciated. Interest component of lease payments may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Software developed in-house for use in business Predevelopment expenses may be deducted. Development expenses must be capitalised until the project is completed and depreciated. Costs of unsuccessful development may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Costs of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Commissioned software Development costs must be capitalised until the project is accepted. It must then be depreciated. Costs of unsuccessful development may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Costs of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Software leased other than under a specified lease Lease payments are deductible over the term of the lease. Software developed for sale or licence Development costs are deductible in the year they are incurred. The value of unbilled work in progress and unsold completed software must be taken into account as trading stock. The value of trading stock at balance date must be included as income in your return for that income year. Where a payment covers both maintenance and upgrading, the cost must be apportioned between the two. The cost of maintenance is deductible and the cost of upgrading must be capitalised, taking account of depreciation. Reservation of title clause (also known as Romalpa clause) Depreciation can be deducted from depreciable assets purchased subject to a reservation of title clause (ie, where the contract provides that the vendor reserves title to the asset until the purchase price has been paid but allows the purchaser to take possession of the asset before payment). Note Reservation of title clause does not apply to hire purchase assets subject to hire purchase agreements - see "Hire purchase" and "Leasehold improvements" on page 15. Where you purchase an asset subject to a reservation of title clause you're considered to own (and the vendor is considered not to own) the asset on the later date of entering the contract or taking possession of the asset. This considered ownership remains until: title to the asset passes to you the vendor repossesses the asset. If the asset is repossessed you're considered to have disposed of the asset at cost, less the net amount already paid to the vendor. Part 2 22 DEPRECIATION Example Purchase price of an asset $10,000 Amount purchaser paid towards the asset $5,000 Asset repossessed - vendor refunds $3,000 This means the net payment for the asset has been $2,000. The purchaser is considered to have sold the asset for $8,000, so the depreciation recovered is calculated on the considered sale price of $8,000. The vendor of the asset will not be able to depreciate the asset while you, the purchaser, are deemed to own it. Low Value Assets (including loose tools) Low-value assets, are deductible in the year they're acquired or created, provided: they are not purchased from the same supplier at the same time as other assets to which the same depreciation rate applies the assets will not become part of an asset that is depreciable, for example, the cost of materials to build a wall in a factory. Assets are considered low value where their cost was as follows: Up till 16 March 2020Up to $500 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021Up to $5,000 From 17 March 2021Up to $1,000 If you're GST-registered, the cost is GST-exclusive and if you're not GST-registered, then the cost is GST- inclusive. If you sell an asset you've claimed this deduction for, or you start using it mainly for private purposes, you'll have to account for it in your next tax return. If the asset is sold, the entire sale proceeds are taxable in the year the asset is sold. If the asset becomes a private asset, the market value of the asset when it's first used privately will be taxable income. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 23 This part deals with adjustments you might make and how the various ways of disposing of depreciable assets will be treated for tax purposes. This includes calculating depreciation in the following situations: newly acquired assets private use of business assets transferring depreciable assets between associated persons private assets becoming business assets disposals transferring assets under a relationship agreement transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies local authority trading enterprises determinations. Newly acquired assets If you're using either the SL or DV methods you can claim depreciation for each calendar month or part- month you own an asset and it's used or available to be used in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Example Craig buys a new cash register on 27 January 2010 for $7,000, which he uses 100% in his business. Craig's balance date is 31 March and he uses a DV rate of 48% (including 20% loading). This is how he calculates his 2010 depreciation deduction: Three months' use (January, February, March 2010) 12 months' income year (1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010) The depreciation deduction is: $7,000×48%× 3 =$840 12 Even though he owned the cash register for only a few days in January, Craig can claim depreciation for the entire month. If you have pooled assets you may add a newly acquired asset to a pool - see page 9. Private use of business assets Use the most appropriate unit of measurement when calculating how much a business asset, other than a motor vehicle, is used privately, such as square metres for area or hours and minutes for time. When a business motor vehicle is used privately and the use is subject to FBT (fringe benefit tax), you do not need to adjust the depreciation deduction to exclude the private use. This is because FBT itself is a way of accounting for the non-business use. However, self-employed people (including partners in a partnership) who use a business vehicle for private purposes, must apportion the vehicle's depreciation between business and non-business use. If you keep an accurate vehicle logbook as an ongoing record, you can make a precise apportionment for depreciation. Alternatively, you may keep a record for a minimum of three months to establish an apportionment that may then be used for three years, provided the business use of the vehicle does not change by more than 20%. Example Mike is a self-employed salesperson. He bought a car for $30,000 at the beginning of the income year and 85% of its use is for business purposes. Mike's car has a DV rate of 36% (including 20% loading) and depreciation on the car is calculated as: Step 1 Opening adjusted tax value $30,000 Depreciation $10,800 Closing adjusted value $19,200 Step 2 Total depreciation $10,800 Less 15% private use (non-deductible) $1,620 Equals 85% business use (deductible) $9,180 Part 3 - Adjustments and disposals The 20% depreciation loading does not apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. Part 3 24 DEPRECIATION The adjusted tax value is calculated taking into account 100% of the annual depreciation, not just the deductible proportion - see the table below. YearOpening adjusted tax value DepreciationClosing adjusted tax value Deductible portion 130,00010,80019,2009,180 (85%) 219,2006,91212,2885,875 (85%) 312,2884,4247,8643,760 (85%) When a business asset that's been used privately is sold, resulting in either depreciation recovered or a loss, the loss or gain must be apportioned between business and private use. Calculate the apportionment using this formula: a - b × c a = adjusted tax value at time of sale b = sale price c = percentage of business use Example If Mike, from the previous example, sells his car after three years for $6,000, the loss on the sale must be apportioned between business and private use. Business purposes made up 85% of the car's use. The deductible portion of the loss on the sale is calculated as: Adjusted tax value (at time of sale) $7,864 Sale price -$6,000 $1,864 85% business use of $1,864 $1,584 Mike can claim $1,584 as loss on the sale. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 25 Transferring depreciable assets between associated persons Under normal rules a purchaser is entitled to claim depreciation based on the purchase price of an asset. The new owner of a secondhand asset can claim depreciation based on the amount paid for the asset, as long as it's an arm's length sale where: the sale is bona fide the purchase price is a fair market value for the asset the purchaser buys the asset for use in income- producing activities and the seller no longer uses it for income-producing activities. The fact the parties are related does not prevent depreciation being claimed. In the case of transfers of assets between associated persons (apart from assets transferred under a relationship agreement - see page 29) a restriction applies to the amount and rate of depreciation that may be claimed by the person acquiring the asset. Depreciation on an asset is restricted to the base value of the asset purchased from an associate, being the lower of: the price the seller originally paid for the asset (or, if applicable, the market value of the asset at the time the associated seller was first entitled to depreciate the asset) the price paid by the buyer. This applies unless we give written approval to use the price paid by the buyer. To grant approval, we must consider such treatment is appropriate in the circumstances. Restrictions on the depreciation rate The depreciation rate that may be applied to an asset acquired from an associate cannot be higher than the depreciation rate applied to the asset by that associated seller. If a different depreciation method is used, the restriction applies so the depreciation rate used must not exceed a rate equivalent to that used by the associate. This restriction does not apply if: the value being used for the transfer is gross income to the associated seller, other than under the provisions for depreciation recovered the asset is intangible with a fixed life. The depreciation rate for such intangible assets is calculated using a formula that spreads the cost of the fixed-life intangible asset evenly across its remaining life. The restrictions on the base value of an asset, and the depreciation rate that may be used with the asset, apply whether the asset is transferred directly or indirectly to an associate. Private assets becoming business assets If a private asset becomes a business asset, depreciation is first calculated on the market value of that asset when it was first used in the business (except in the case of buildings, which must always be depreciated on cost - see page 12). Whether or not the market value is GST-inclusive depends on whether you are registered for GST. However, if we ask, you must be able to provide documentation (for example, a valuation) showing how you arrived at the market value. Note Buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more have a depreciation rate of 0% from the 2011- 12 income year. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Disposals Selling and disposing of assets When you sell or dispose of an asset (other than a pooled asset) for a different amount from its adjusted tax value, you must make an adjustment in your end- of-year tax return to account for the loss or gain. If the asset has been used for both business and non-business purposes, you must apportion any loss or gain on disposal between business and non-business use. You cannot claim a deduction for depreciation in the year you dispose of an asset, except in the case of buildings. Costs incurred in selling an asset, such as commission and advertising, can be deducted from the sale price before you work out the loss or gain on sale. The adjustment is generally made in the year you sell or dispose of an asset, except when the disposal is because business has ceased. See page 28 for depreciation adjustments when a business ceases. Part 3 26 DEPRECIATION When a group of assets is sold for a lump sum it may sometimes be necessary to apportion the sale price between the various assets. If, for example, a group of assets that were sold included business and private assets or assets that do not depreciate, such as land, an apportionment would have to be made. We may sometimes ask for an independent valuation of assets if we decide the apportionment agreed to by the buyer and the seller is not acceptable. What constitutes a disposal The term "disposal" includes: an asset that is compulsorily acquired an asset taken out of New Zealand (other than only temporarily) changes in use or location of use of a business asset ceasing intangible asset rights an asset that is irreparably damaged - see page 28 any distribution of assets, including distributions of assets to the beneficial owners for no cost ceasing deemed ownership of a fixture or improvement - see page 15 an asset that is lost or stolen if that asset is not recovered in the income year when the loss or theft occurs - see page 28 an asset contributed to a partnership by a person. A disposal or sale of a depreciable asset triggers either a gain or loss on disposal. A gain on disposal or sale Where there's no election for an asset not to be a depreciable asset and the sale price received for the asset exceeds the adjusted tax value, the lesser of the following amounts must be included as gross income in that income year: the total depreciation that could have been deducted since the asset was purchased or first used in the business (this amount relates to the allowable depreciation deduction rather than the amount of depreciation actually deducted), or the amount by which the sale price received exceeds the adjusted tax value. Note For any asset owned prior to the 1994 income year, only the actual amount of depreciation claimed prior to the 1994 income year needs to be taken into account. You still need to work out the amount of depreciation that could have been claimed from the 1994 income year until date of sale. A loss on disposal or sale When you sell or dispose of an asset for less than its adjusted tax value, the difference between this consideration and the adjusted tax value is allowed as a deduction. If an asset is sold for less than its market value we can fix the sale price as the market value of the asset. This may happen if you sold an asset to someone close to you or your business, for example, a relative or a shareholder of the company. In this situation, the actual sale price may be ignored and the calculations made as if the asset was sold for its market value. The exception to this is when you dispose of pooled assets. For the treatment of pooled assets - see Disposing of pooled assets on page 27. Note A deduction for loss on disposal does not apply to buildings , unless due to an event the building has been damaged or affected by its surroundings rendering it useless for the purposes of deriving income. See pages 12 and 38. Disposing of intangible assets You must calculate a loss or gain when disposing of a depreciable intangible asset. This will include calculating loss or gain from disposing of any franchise rights that are depreciable - see page 18. A disposal of an intangible asset must fall within one of the following two circumstances: any event which means that the owner can no longer apply, at any time, the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset, or any event that causes the asset to be irreparably damaged. A disposal of an intangible asset does not include disposing of that asset as part of an arrangement to replace it with an asset of the same type. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 27 Where a depreciable intangible asset is considered worthless it's unlikely ceasing to use that intangible asset could be seen as a disposal. A disposal of such an asset must fall within one of the following circumstances: any event which means the owner can no longer apply, at any time, the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset any event that causes the asset to be irreparably damaged any event which means the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset are moved overseas. Although worthless, you still have the legal right to use the intangible assets, and they have probably not been irreparably damaged - it's just the value of those assets that has diminished. The write-off provisions could apply to intangible assets. We need to be satisfied: the intangible asset will no longer be used, and is not intended to be used the costs (for example, legal) of disposal would exceed the consideration received (the intangible asset is worthless) no one else could use it (or would want to use it) perhaps due to unmarketability through the liability of defects. We explain write-offs on page 35. Patents Where a patent is sold, the proceeds from the sale are taxable on the net amount after cost. Generally, a corresponding adjustment has been allowed for the total costs of the patent rights (at least those acquired on or after 1 April 1993). As a depreciation allowance has been available for patents since 1 April 1993, there is the potential for a double deduction. So, in calculating the profit or loss on sale of a patent, the cost of the patent is reduced by depreciation deductions that have been allowed. This restricts any deduction for loss on sale to the adjusted tax value. If a patent application is sold while the patent is pending, so that the patent is granted to a person other than the person who filed the application, the legal life for the new owner is reduced by the number of months between when the patent application was lodged and when it was sold to the new owner. Making arrangements between associated persons - intangible assets An intangible asset that wasn't depreciable to the seller remains non-depreciable to the associate, even though assets of the same type have become depreciable since the seller acquired that asset. The provision prevents an intangible asset being transferred to an associate to bring it within the depreciation rules and applies to intangible assets transferred on or after 1 July 1997. Disposing of pooled assets When you dispose of pooled assets, the sale price must be deducted from the adjusted tax value of the pool before calculating depreciation for the year. If the asset is discarded or lost, the adjusted tax value of the pool is not reduced. Where the sale price is greater than the adjusted tax value of the pool, the difference is treated as depreciation recovered and is taxable income. The adjusted tax value of the pool will then be nil and no further depreciation deductions will be allowed until new assets are added to the pool. Once assets are pooled, they're no longer treated as individual assets, so any capital gain made on the sale of any or all assets from the pool cannot be separated from depreciation recovered. The entire proceeds of any sale of pooled assets must be accounted for and any gains are taxable income. When all the assets in a pool are sold and the sale proceeds are less than the pool's adjusted tax value, the balance is deductible. Special rule for sale of assets previously held under the globo accounting method Please note from 12 December 1995 a limitation was placed on the amount of taxable income derived from selling assets in a pool that consists only of assets previously depreciated under the globo accounting method (this method could only be used before 1 April 1993). If this applies to you please see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 9 (February 1996) for a fuller explanation of how gains are to be treated. Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Part 3 28 DEPRECIATION Ceasing business or now using the asset for non- business purposes If you cease business and do not sell your business assets immediately or if they're kept for private use, the loss or gain must be accounted for using the market value of the assets as at the beginning of the next income year. You'll have to make an adjustment in your income tax return for the year after the business ceased or the asset changed use, even if the loss or gain is not realised until a later income year. Using a pooled asset privately When an asset is no longer used solely for business purposes after it's been pooled, it must be isolated from the pool. Example Andy has an asset pool with an adjusted tax value of $18,000 at 1 April 2009. The pool includes an asset that Andy is now using for private purposes. He uses it privately for 20% of the time which started on 5 December 2009. The market value of the asset on 5 December 2009 was $1,500. The pool depreciation rate is 22%. Step 1 Pool adjusted tax value (beginning of 2010 income year) $ 18,000 Value at end of 2010 income year ($18,000 less deemed sale at $1,500) + $ 16,500 $ 34,500 Average pool value (divide $34,500 by 2) $ 17,250 Depreciation on the pool at 22% for the year will be: $ 3,795 Step 2 Calculate depreciation on ex-pool assets (market value $1,500) $1,500 x 22% x 4/12\* months = $ 110 (\*December 2009 to March 2010) Total depreciation $ 110 less 20% personal use $ 22 Deductible depreciation $ 88 Deductible depreciation for the 2010 income year is $3,883 ($88 plus $3,795). At the time the asset is first used privately, it will be treated for depreciation purposes as though the business bought and sold it for the market value. Damaged assets You must take into account any insurance proceeds, indemnity damages or compensation payments you receive when an asset is damaged. If such payments exceed the cost of repairing the damaged asset, the surplus is not a capital receipt but must be deducted from the adjusted tax value of the asset for depreciation purposes. If the result is a negative amount, that amount is considered to be gross income in that year. Irreparably damaged assets are considered to be disposed of for a consideration of the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnity payment or other consideration received in relation to that event or damage. A full deduction is allowed for disposal costs, including demolition costs. Lost or stolen assets The loss or theft of a depreciable asset constitutes a disposal if the asset is not recovered in the income year in which the loss or theft occurs. Any insurance proceeds, indemnity payment or other consideration received in relation to the loss or theft of the depreciable asset is taken to be consideration received, minus disposal costs (where applicable), for the disposal of that asset. This consideration for the disposal will then be used in calculating the gain or loss on disposal of the asset. If the lost or stolen asset is recovered in a subsequent income year, and is still owned and used or available for use in deriving income, the following assumptions apply. You're considered to derive gross income equal to any loss on sale deduction allowed in the previous year. The gross income will be considered to be derived either in the year of disposal or of recovery. You're considered to have acquired the recovered asset on the date it was retrieved at the adjusted tax value that applied at the beginning of the year of loss or theft. Note If you're registered for GST, do not include the GST component of these payments in your calculation - account for it in your GST return. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 29 Transferring assets under a relationship agreement Depreciable assets transferred under a relationship agreement are transferred at the adjusted tax value and the person acquiring the assets, provided they use them for business purposes, is allowed the deductions that would have been allowed had the transfer not taken place. Example Colin and Jennifer Day separate and they agree to enter into a relationship agreement. Colin will transfer half the business assets to Jennifer. The general rule is that depreciable assets are transferred: at adjusted tax value at the beginning of the year of transfer at cost price for assets acquired in the year of transfer. As a result, no depreciation gain or loss arises to the transferor (Colin). The transferee (Jennifer) can continue to depreciate the remaining adjusted tax value of the assets. However, if she sells, Jennifer is considered to have claimed the depreciation deductions claimed by Colin and will be required to account for any excess of sale proceeds above the transfer value (up to the cost of the asset to Colin) as depreciation recovered. In relation to buildings, Jennifer's depreciation claim is based on the cost of the building to Colin. He is considered to have disposed of the building at adjusted tax value. Transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies Companies that are 100% commonly owned and choose to enter the consolidated system can transfer assets within their group at the assets' adjusted tax value. When wholly owned companies amalgamate, they're treated as one company and all assets, liabilities, property, rights, powers and privileges of the amalgamating companies are held in the new amalgamated company. This means there is no depreciation recovered when assets are transferred on a qualifying amalgamation. Wholly owned companies that do not form a consolidated group are required to transfer assets at market value and recover or claim a loss of depreciation, as applicable. The vendor company is required to calculate depreciation recovered or a loss on disposal: on actual sale price, or on market value, when the asset has been disposed of for a consideration that is not market value, but we consider the market value is greater than the sale price and consider it to be the more appropriate value for the asset. The purchasing company should value the asset at the cost incurred, or the value we consider the seller to have disposed of that asset, to calculate the depreciation claimed. Council-controlled organisations Council-controlled organisations are established by local government legislation to operate as trading enterprises liable for tax and so are competitively neutral. When a council-controlled organisation is set up, assets transferred to it from a local authority should be transferred for tax purposes at either their: adjusted tax value true market value. Part 3 30 DEPRECIATION Regardless of which value is adopted: a local authority must make an actual sale of assets to a council-controlled organisation full consideration for the sale must pass between the parties there must be complete and detailed documentation providing evidence of the transaction (including listing individual asset values). Our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 2 (August 1991) has a full policy statement on how to value assets that are transferred from local authorities to council-controlled organisations (previously known as LATEs). To read the Tax Information Bulletin go to ird.govt.nz/tib Determinations Inland Revenue must follow a formal procedure to set new depreciation rates or create new categories for assets and industries. This is known as "issuing a determination" and the general rates listed in our IR265 and the IR267 guides are the result of determinations issued by us. The determination process is also used for setting depreciation rates following applications from taxpayers. You can apply for a determination of depreciation rate if, for example, you find there is no general depreciation rate for your asset. You can also apply to us for a new rate if you believe the relevant existing general depreciation rate shouldn't apply to your asset. There are three different types of determinations that you can apply for, depending on your circumstances: a special depreciation rate a provisional depreciation rate a higher maximum pooling value. How rates are calculated The formula below is used for calculating a DV depreciation rate for an asset. 1 - (( residual value ) 1 ) cost n n =the estimated useful life of the asset. Estimated useful life The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which the asset might reasonably be expected to be useful in earning income in New Zealand. This period of time is calculated taking into account factors such as likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion and obsolescence. Normal and reasonable maintenance over the expected life of the asset is also taken into account. The fact an asset may have been previously used for a purpose other than deriving income (for example, private use) or carrying on a business overseas will not reduce its estimated useful life. The estimate of useful life must take into account the length of time the asset is used by all business owners in New Zealand (ie, first owner plus second owner and so on). Example Grant, an owner-driver, buys a new truck every five years and sells his old one. He expects the New Zealand business that buys each truck from him will use it for another five years and then scrap it. If this is the typical useful lifespan of trucks, the estimated useful life is 10 years. We use valuation consultants' advice when determining the estimated useful life for each asset class. The estimated useful life is determined after averaging the usage of various businesses. The estimated useful life is listed with the depreciation rates in our IR265 guide. You can view our depreciation rates finder or the IR265 at ird.govt.nz Residual value The residual value of an asset is the greater of: 13.5% of the original cost an estimate of the asset's market value (GST-exclusive) at the end of its estimated useful life. This must be a reasonable estimate made at the time of purchase. In estimating the residual value it must be assumed normal and reasonable maintenance is carried out on the asset during its use. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 31 Once the rates are calculated they're rounded up or down to the nearest rate. The full range of general DV and SL rates are shown below: 1994 to 2005 rates For assets you acquired on or after 1 April 1993, and before the end of the 1995 income year, you can use the general rates listed in table 1 or the historic rates listed in part 1 of the IR267 guide plus 25% interim loading and any shift allowances. For assets acquired from the 1996 income year to the end of the 2005 income year (or before 19 May 2005 for buildings), use the general rates listed in table 1. For new assets, including those never used or held for use in New Zealand, and imported secondhand goods (but excluding buildings or used imported cars) depreciation is calculated using the general rate plus 20% loading. The general rates listed in table 1 can also be found in parts 2 and 3 of the IR267 guide at ird.govt.nz Table 1 General DV rate with 20% loading General SL rate with 20% loading 22.41.51.8 44.833.6 67.244.8 7.595.56.6 9.511.46.57.8 1214.489.6 15181012 1821.612.515 2226.415.518.6 2631.21821.6 3339.62428.8 40483036 50604048 63.576.263.576.2 100100100100 2006 and future years For assets acquired from the 2006 income year (or buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005) use the general rates listed in table 2. For new assets (including those never used or held for use in New Zealand) and imported secondhand goods, but excluding buildings or used imported cars, depreciation is calculated using the general DV or SL rates plus 20% loading. The general rates listed in table 2 can be found in parts 1 and 2 of our IR265 guide at ird.govt.nz Table 2 General DV rate with 20% loading General SL rate with 20% loading 22.41.51.8 44.833.6 67.244.8 89.667.2 101278.4 1315.68.510.2 1619.210.512.6 202413.516.2 253017.521 30362125.2 40483036 50604048 6780.46780.4 100100100100 Note The 20% loading has been removed from 21 May 2010, so for any assets acquired on or after this date, use only the general DV or SL rates in table 2. Note From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Part 3 32 DEPRECIATION Disputable decisions Sometimes you may not agree with some of our decisions, for example: a determination setting a special rate a decision not to set a special rate revoking a special rate a determination setting a provisional rate a decision not to set a provisional rate. If you want to challenge any of these decisions, see our factsheet If you disagree with an assessment - IR778. Special depreciation rates We've calculated the general depreciation rates by using the formula given on page 30. We've considered the way assets are normally used, to arrive at the values used in the formula. For example, where it's usual to operate a piece of machinery in two or three shifts a day, the general depreciation rate we've set will reflect this heavier usage. If you believe the general depreciation rate we've set is not appropriate for your asset because, for example, you use your machine in an unusually heavy or light manner, or it will be operated in corrosive conditions, you may apply for a special depreciation rate. As we set a special rate because of individual circumstances, it can only be set for a specific taxpayer's asset or class of assets. Once set, it can only be used by the taxpayer who made the application. Note After 20 May 2010 you can no longer apply for a special depreciation rate on buildings. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Your application for a special depreciation rate must be supported by evidence of how your unique circumstances will affect the life of your asset. If we agree you should have a special depreciation rate, the formula set out on page 30 will be used to calculate the rate. To qualify for a special rate, the rate you've calculated must be halfway or more to the next rate on the general rates table, either higher or lower. Example A personal computer purchased after 1 April 2005 has a general DV rate of 50%. The next higher general rate is 67%. The calculation must result in a rate of 58.5% or higher to qualify for a higher rate, or 45% or lower to qualify for a lower rate to be set since the next lower general rate is 40%. When considering a special rate, we'll take into account any factors relevant in determining estimated useful life. You can download and complete an Application for a special depreciation rate - IR260B from ird.govt.nz Send your completed application to: LTS Manager - Technical Standards National Office Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140. How we set a special rate If we agree a special depreciation rate should be set, we follow three steps. They are: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing the determination. The process, from the time the application is received to the time the determination is issued, must be completed within six months, unless you agree to an extension of time. Draft determination Once we've considered your application, and agree a special depreciation rate should be set, we'll send you a draft determination along with a letter setting out the special depreciation rate we recommend. If this rate is different from the rate you requested, we'll also set out the reasons why we chose this rate. Conference At this point you may request a conference to discuss the determination. There is a time limit for requesting a conference, which will be at least 10 working days from the date we send the draft determination to you. Full details of the time limit will appear with the draft. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 33 If it's decided not to hold a conference, we'll finalise the determination. If it's decided to hold a conference, we'll set a date, time and place. We'll give you at least 20 working days' notice of the conference date. Issuing the determination The final step in the process is to issue the determination. Hopefully, due to the consultation following the draft determination or if a conference is held, both parties will have agreed on the rate to be set. If, however, you do not agree with the rate in the determination, you may dispute that decision. For more information, see our guide Disputing an assessment - IR776. Declining an application We'll turn down your application for a special rate if: your rate is too close to the general rate - see page 31 the general rate is under review you haven't supplied enough information. If we turn down your application or set a rate you do not agree with, you're entitled to dispute this decision - see page 32. Fees Application fee If you're applying for a special rate there's a fee of $150 plus GST, payable with your application. Processing fee There is a processing fee of $75 plus GST for each hour (or part-hour) after the first two hours for work by Inland Revenue. Consultant's fee If we engage a consultant to advise on the estimated useful life or estimated residual value of the asset, we'll charge you the consultant's fees plus G ST. If you request a conference and a consultant paid by us attends the conference, or if you ask our consultant to carry out further work, we'll also charge you for the consultant's fee plus GST. If you request a conference we'll advise you of the likely fees before engaging a consultant so you can decide whether you want to continue with the application. Before we engage a consultant we'll take into account the information you've provided with your application. We will not seek a consultant's advice if you've already provided us with enough information to work out an appropriate rate. We'll send you an account for all fees you have incurred. The costs incurred can be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes and you can claim the GST part of the cost as a credit, if you're registered for GST. Withdrawing applications You can withdraw your application at any time. If you wish to do this, please let us know in writing as soon as possible because you'll have to pay fees incurred in processing your application, including any consultant's fees, up to the day we receive notice of your withdrawal. Revoking a special rate If we've approved your application for a special rate and your circumstances change so your asset no longer qualifies, we may either: revoke the determination, in which case you must use the general rate applying to the asset, or revoke the determination and issue a new one setting a new special rate. If this happens we'll let you know. The special rate we have already issued will lapse the day after you've been notified. Provisional depreciation rates You should apply for a provisional depreciation rate if you consider the asset classes for the general rates (excluding the default asset class in each category) do not appropriately cover the assets in a category. This could happen, for example, when an asset is newly invented or imported into New Zealand for the first time and we haven't listed the asset class under the general asset category. Part 3 34 DEPRECIATION To apply for a provisional rate, fill in an Application for a provisional depreciation rate - IR260A form. There are no application fees for a provisional rate. However, we'll charge you a fee if we: decline to issue a provisional rate determination or issue an unfavourable determination and you ask our consultant to carry out further work that does not result in a determination favourable to you. The fee for the further work done, or time attending a conference will include GST. When a provisional rate is set, it will usually apply to all businesses that own and use that class of asset and we do not have sufficient information at the time to set a general rate. However, in some cases it may be appropriate for a provisional rate to be set for a specific taxpayer or class of taxpayers owning that type of asset, for example, where the asset is unique to a specific taxpayer or taxpayer group. Provisional rates (other than taxpayer specific rates) are published in our Tax Information Bulletin and on our website at ird.govt.nz/depreciation When a general rate is subsequently set for a class of asset, the provisional rate will lapse. Calculating a provisional rate Unless the determination provides otherwise, once a provisional rate is set, it's available to all owners of the particular class of asset. So, the basis of the calculation must relate to the typical asset within the class of assets and typical use within an industry. It's important the information you supply with your application is representative for normal use of the asset within your industry. We take into account the rate of depreciation you and other industry members use in your financial reporting when setting a provisional rate. We calculate a provisional or special rate using the formula explained on page 30, or the SL method. The answer is then rounded up or down to the nearest SL or DV rate. How a provisional rate is set As with general and special rates, provisional rates are set by us issuing a determination. There are three main stages: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing a determination. This three-stage process must be completed within six months from the time we receive your application, unless you agree to an extension of time. These stages are explained in more detail on page 32. We'll turn down an application for a provisional rate if: a general rate for the asset already exists we're in the process of setting a general rate you haven't supplied enough information. If we turn down your application or set a rate you do not agree with, you're entitled to dispute the determination - see page 32. When we've set a provisional rate (other than a taxpayer specific rate) we'll notify the making of the determination and publish the determination in our Tax Information Bulletin and on our website at ird.govt.nz Higher maximum pooling values The aim of the pooling method of depreciation is to reduce compliance costs by calculating depreciation on low-value assets collectively, rather than individually. The maximum pooling value is $5,000. This means you can only pool assets that individually have an adjusted tax value of $5,000 or less. However, you may wish to apply for a higher maximum pooling value. You can do this by completing an Application for a higher maximum pooling value - IR719 form. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 35 Factors we take into account When deciding whether to set a higher maximum pooling value we consider the following three factors. Whether the assets you wish to include under a higher maximum pooling value are relatively similar in nature. Whether you'll make savings in compliance costs, such as clerical, computing and overhead costs, by having a higher maximum pooling value. You should show these in your application. How often you buy and sell the assets for which you want a higher maximum pooling value. How a higher maximum is set There are three stages to issuing a determination to set a higher maximum pooling value. These are: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing a determination. These stages are explained on page 32. Fees If you're applying for a higher maximum pooling value there is an application fee of $150 plus GST. We charge a processing fee of $75, plus GST, for each hour (or part-hour) after the first two hours for work by Inland Revenue. Send the application fee with your application. If we hire a consultant to advise on the estimated useful life or estimated residual value of an asset, we'll charge you for the consultant's fees plus GST. We'll also charge you for the consultant's fee plus GST if you request a conference and a consultant paid by us attends, or if you ask our consultant to carry out further work that does not result in a determination favourable to you. We'll send you an account for all fees you've incurred. The account will show the fee, the GST and the total unless we state otherwise. The costs incurred can be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes and if you're registered for GST you can claim the GST part of the cost as a credit. You can withdraw your application at any time - see page 33. Deductions for assets you no longer use This section relates to assets that are no longer used but haven't been physically disposed of. For example, if a business discards machinery because it's outdated and unsafe, but does not sell, assign or transfer it, the machinery hasn't been disposed of. If the cost of disposing of an asset you no longer use would be greater than the proceeds from its sale, you may claim the adjusted tax value as a deduction. If the scrap value of the machinery in the above example is greater than the costs of disposing of that machinery, a write-off will not apply. In such cases the machinery would need to be disposed of to claim a deduction. Dumping off site constitutes a disposal. These rules do not apply to buildings and pooled assets. See page 26 for more help on how to account for losses and gains on sale or disposal of assets. Conditions for a deduction To write off the adjusted tax value of an asset, you must meet the following conditions. You no longer use the asset in business or in producing income. Neither you nor an associate intend to use the asset in the future to derive gross income or in future business. It's uneconomic to dispose of the asset.

Disposal occurs where a depreciable asset is sold or disposed of for a consideration. Event is a natural disaster such as an earthquake or flood resulting in the building being demolished or abandoned and later demolished. The damage to either the building or to the neighbourhood of the building has rendered the building useless for the purposes of deriving income, and is not due to the action or failure to act of the person, their agent, or an associate. You can find out more in our Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 8 (October 2011), page 66, "Losses on buildings". Excluded depreciable assets are any assets purchased before 1 April 1993 and any of the following circumstances apply. The assets were used or available for use by the taxpayer in New Zealand, other than as trading stock, before 1 April 1993. Before 16 December 1991, the taxpayer entered into a binding contract to purchase the assets or have them constructed. They are or have been qualifying assets for a person or are or have been a qualifying improvement for the person. They are intangible assets used or available for use by the taxpayer before 1 April 1993. Excluded depreciable assets do not include assets in existence at the end of the 1993 income year that were accounted for using the standard value, replacement value or annual revaluation method. Fixed-life depreciable assets are any intangible assets that: are depreciable intangible assets, and have a legal life which could reasonably be expected, on the date of creation or acquisition of those assets, to be the same length as the assets' remaining estimated useful life. Income year for depreciation purposes, includes any corresponding non-standard accounting year. Glossary Adjusted tax value is the remaining value of your asset once the depreciation you calculate each year has been deducted from the value. Asset is the unit to be depreciated. For depreciation purposes it must not be subdivided into its separate components. Associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007 (sub-part YB) sets out rules that define when two persons are associated. These rules are categorised as tests of association as follows: two companies a company and a person other than a company two relatives a person and a trustee for a relative a trustee and a beneficiary trustees with a common settlor a trustee and a settlor a settlor and a beneficiary a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee a partnership and a partner two persons who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test). Base value means: the cost of an asset acquired after the beginning of the 1994 income year, or the adjusted tax value at the end of the 1993 income year if it's acquired before this date, or the market value at the time the asset is taken from private to business use, if this is after the beginning of the 1994 income year. This market value rule does not apply to buildings or schedule depreciable assets - see page 39. Depreciable intangible assets are intangible assets acquired or created on or after 1 April 1993 and listed in Schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and have a finite useful life. Depreciable assets are assets that might reasonably be expected, in normal circumstances, to decline in value while used or available for use: in deriving gross income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. ird.govt.nz 39 Intangible assets are assets with a finite life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of their creation or acquisition. Legal life is defined for any intangible asset and means the number of years and any monthly fraction the asset may remain or continue to remain in existence by virtue of the contract or statute that creates the asset for the owner. It assumes the owner will exercise any rights of renewal or extension that are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of predetermined fees. Poolable assets are assets with a similar base value you can group for depreciation purposes, with a maximum value of $5,000 per asset. Schedule depreciable assets are petroleum drilling rigs, support vessels for offshore petroleum drilling rigs and support vessels for offshore petroleum production platforms. Because of the special nature of these assets, the depreciation calculation is made on a daily rather than a monthly basis. In addition, the base value for schedule depreciable assets acquired by a taxpayer from an associated person is the lower of the cost of the asset to the taxpayer or the aggregate of: the cost of the asset to: –the associated person who didn't acquire the asset from either the taxpayer or another associated person, or –the taxpayer or an associated person who owned the asset at the beginning of an unbroken chain of ownership, and all expenditure (excluding any expenditure allowed as depreciation allowances) incurred for the asset by the taxpayer and any associated persons before the date the taxpayer acquired the asset. The cost is determined as exclusive of any expenditure allowed as depreciation allowances. No adjustment is made on disposition or exit from the tax base for a schedule depreciable asset.
Depreciation - a guide for businesses IR260 August 2022 2 DEPRECIATION New Zealand allowed depreciation on all buildings until 2010. From the 2011-2012 income year depreciation was removed for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Legislative changes enacted on 25 March 2020, as part of a wider economic recovery package in response to COVID-19, reintroduces building depreciation but only for non-residential buildings (those that are not primarily used for residential accommodation). Non-residential building Non-residential building is defined as a building that is not a residential building. A residential building is defined as a dwelling; and includes a building intended to ordinarily provide accommodation for periods of less than 28 days at a time, if the building, together with other buildings on the same land, has less than 4 units for separate accommodation. The second part of the definition includes some buildings accommodating short-term stays to ensure there is certainty that the definition of “residential building” includes buildings such as a bach that the owner uses but also rents out on a short-term basis, and also buildings used exclusively for some short- term accommodation provided by owners such as Airbnb properties. These may be within the definition of “dwelling”, but this would put it beyond doubt those buildings remain non-depreciable. The less-than four units provision is meant to exclude larger commercial operations such as motels from being treated as a residential building. Effective date Depreciation for non-residential buildings has been reintroduced effective from the 2020-21 income year. Depreciation rate The depreciation rate for non-residential buildings is 2% diminishing value or 1.5% straight-line. Opening tax book value The opening tax book value for the beginning of the 2020-21 income year: for buildings that were owned by the taxpayer in the 2010–11 income year, will be: –the adjusted tax book value at the end of the 2010–11 income year, less fit-out deductions taken under the section DB 65 transitional rule if applicable; plus –non-deductible capital expenditure incurred with respect to the building from the end of the 2010–11 income year to the start of the 2020–21 income year. for buildings acquired after the end of the 2010–11 income year, will be: –the cost of the building; plus –non-deductible capital expenditure incurred with respect to the building from the time it was acquired until the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. Straight-line depreciation If a taxpayer elects to use the straight-line method, the building’s cost for the purpose of calculating the depreciation deduction would be the original cost price. The amount of depreciation is then deducted from the opening tax book value (not original cost) for the 2020–21 and subsequent income years. Repeal of the 2010 transitional rule As a result of reinstating depreciation on non- residential buildings, the transitional building fit-out rule introduced as part of the 2010 reforms is no longer required. Section DB 65 has been repealed, and the tax book value of the building will be adjusted for past DB 65 deductions. Special depreciation rate The ability to receive a special depreciation rate from the Commissioner has been restored for non- residential buildings.

Introduction This guide explains how to claim depreciation on your business assets. You're required to claim depreciation when you acquire an asset for your business and account for it when you dispose of that asset. We recommend you consult a tax agent when considering claiming for depreciation. However, it's still your responsibility to be aware of your tax obligations. Find the current depreciation rates by: using our Depreciation rate finder checking our General depreciation rates - IR265 guide. You'll find both of these at ird.govt.nz The rates are set out in two categories - industry and asset.

Note In legal terms, depreciable intangible assets, depreciable assets, excluded depreciable assets, fixed-life depreciable assets and intangible assets are known as "property". In this guide we refer to them as assets to avoid confusion, because the term "property" more commonly relates to land and buildings. 4 DEPRECIATION Contents COVID-19 - Depreciation changes for non-residential buildings 2 Non-residential building 2 Effective date 2 Depreciation rate 2 Opening tax book value 2 Straight-line depreciation 2 Repeal of the 2010 transitional rule 2 Special depreciation rate 2 Introduction 3 ird.govt.nz 3 How to get our forms and guides 3 How to use this guide 3 Part 1 - Overview 5 Main features of depreciation law 5 Compulsory depreciation claims 6 Electing not to depreciate 6 How to make an election not to depreciate 7 Assets that do not depreciate 7 Who can claim depreciation? 7 Cost of assets for depreciation purposes 8 GST and depreciation 8 Records 9 Individual or pooled assets 9 Diminishing value (DV) method 9 Straight line (SL) method 9 Changing methods 9 Pooling method 9 Rates 11 Part 2 - Detailed information on certain assets 12 Buildings 12 Resource consents 13 Land 13 Leased assets 15 Renting out a residential property 16 Holiday homes 16 Intangible assets 16 Computer software 20 Reservation of title clause (also known as Romalpa clause) 21 Low Value Assets (including loose tools) 22 Newly acquired assets 23 Private use of business assets 23 Part 3 - Adjustments and disposals 23 Transferring depreciable assets between associated persons 25 Private assets becoming business assets 25 Disposals 25 Transferring assets under a relationship agreement 29 Transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies 29 Council-controlled organisations 29 Determinations 30 1994 to 2005 rates 31 2006 and future years 31 Disputable decisions 32 Special depreciation rates 32 How we set a special rate 32 Provisional depreciation rates 33 Higher maximum pooling values 34 Deductions for assets you no longer use 35 Part 4 - Services you may need 36 Need to speak with us? 36 Supporting businesses in our community 36 0800 self-service number 36 Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) 36 Privacy 36 If you have a complaint about our service 36 Glossary 37 Part 1 ird.govt.nz 5 Part 1 - Overview Depreciation allows a deduction for capital expenditure, where a deduction wouldn't normally apply and acknowledges that the asset will eventually wear out or become outdated. For tax purposes, the reduced value of an asset is recognised by allowing a deduction against income for the depreciation of that asset from the time it is used in a business until it is sold, disposed of or discarded. This means the cost of the asset will be written off over its useful life. Once the whole cost price of the asset has been written off, no further deduction is allowed. When you calculate your depreciation deduction it's important to remember: the date you acquired the asset, since this determines which rates are available to you which industry and/or asset category best describes your depreciable asset. Main features of depreciation law From the 1994 income year, depreciation law relates to all depreciable assets regardless of the date you acquired them. You must make depreciation deductions each year, unless you make an election not to treat a particular asset as depreciable. You can only claim a depreciation deduction once you own the asset and it's used or available for use in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Depreciation is calculated according to the number of months in an income year you own and use the asset. A daily basis applies to certain assets used in the petroleum industry. From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non-residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. You may not claim depreciation in the year you dispose of any asset, unless it's a building. Although the general depreciation rates are set by a formula, you can apply for a higher or lower special depreciation rate if you can establish the general rate is unsuitable for your particular circumstances. Higher depreciation rates, previously available for assets used for multiple shifts, do not apply to assets acquired after 1 April 1993. Expenditure for repairs and maintenance can be claimed as a deduction through business accounts. Anything more than repairs or maintenance is capital expenditure and is not deductible, but will be subject to normal depreciation rules. In general terms the depreciation rate options available are as follows: 1. You must use the general rates set out in determinations we issue. For assets acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, use the rates listed in the IR265 guide. 2. For assets acquired between the 1996 income year and 31 March 2005 (or 18 May 2005 for buildings, including contracts of purchase entered into before 19 May 2005) use the rates listed in parts 2 and 3 of the IR267 guide. 3. For assets acquired on or after 1 April 1993, and before the end of the 1995 income year, you can use either the rates listed in parts 2 and 3 of the IR267 guide or the rates listed in part 1 of this guide plus 25% interim loading and any shift allowances. 4. Generally, for assets acquired before 1 April 1993 you must use the depreciation rates listed in part 1 of the IR267 guide. Both straight line and diminishing value methods are available for calculating depreciation on most assets and you can switch freely between the two. Assets that cost or have an adjusted tax value of $5,000 or less can be depreciated collectively, rather than individually, using the "pool" depreciation method (refer also next bullet for low value assets). Part 1 6 DEPRECIATION Generally low value assets can be written off in the year of purchase or creation based on the following thresholds. Up till 16 March 2020Up to $500 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021Up to $5,000 From 17 March 2021Up to $1,000 Certain intangible assets first used or available for use after 1 April 1993 have been brought into the depreciation system. Intangible assets with a fixed life must be depreciated using the straight line method. Gains on sale or disposal must be recognised in the year of sale. Losses on sales of depreciable assets, other than buildings, are deductible in the year of sale. There are restrictions on the depreciation deductions that can be made to depreciable assets transferred between associated parties. From 1 April 1997, only those companies that are 100% commonly owned and that choose to consolidate are able to transfer assets within their group at the assets' adjusted tax value. Wholly owned companies which do not form a consolidated group are required to transfer assets at market value and recover or claim a loss of depreciation as applicable. You may be able to write off the residual tax value of any depreciable asset that you no longer use to derive gross income. Some assets cannot be depreciated for income tax purposes either because they are specifically exempted (for example, land or trading stock) or they do not reduce in value over time (for example, Lotto franchise fees). A depreciation loading no longer applies for assets acquired after 20 May 2010. The loading will only apply to qualifying assets: –acquired on or before 20 May 2010, or –where a binding contract existed on or before 20 May 2010. Compulsory depreciation claims You must claim the amount of depreciation you are entitled to unless you elect an asset not to be depreciable property. It's usually not possible to defer or only partially claim allowable depreciation. If no depreciation deduction is claimed and no election is made, you're considered to have claimed depreciation for the purposes of calculating the adjusted tax value of the asset and when calculating the depreciation recovered (see "Disposals" on page 25). If you do not claim depreciation in your tax return, the adjusted tax value of the asset will still be reduced by the amount calculated using the appropriate method. The default method for calculating depreciation is diminishing value. For depreciation recovery purposes, where the depreciable asset is disposed of for more than the adjusted tax value, then the taxable income will be the lesser of: the previously allowed depreciation (including deemed to be allowed), or the amount by which the amount received exceeds the adjusted tax value. For assets purchased before the 1994 income year, and depending on the disposal amount, the depreciation recovered is the actual depreciation permitted under the old system (when the depreciation deduction was not compulsory) plus the allowable depreciation for the 1994 and subsequent income years. Taxpayers do not have to have claimed extra depreciation on excluded depreciable assets (generally, meaning assets purchased before 1 April 1993). This extra depreciation is allowed as either: a supplementary depreciation allowance, or a 25% interim loading. Electing not to depreciate Although it's compulsory for you to claim a depreciation deduction, we recognise there can be instances where you may not want to. If you do not want to claim depreciation on an asset, and you want to avoid paying tax on depreciation recovered when it was not claimed, you should elect not to treat the asset as depreciable. You cannot pick and choose the years in which you depreciate an asset. However, if an asset periodically will be and then will not be used in your business (such as a residential building that is temporarily let), you may choose whether or not to depreciate the asset in each period. Our Rental income - IR264 guide discusses this option in more detail. If you elect not to depreciate your asset, it will no longer be a depreciable asset and the depreciation recovery or loss on sale provisions will not apply to it. Part 1 ird.govt.nz 7 Note From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Who can claim depreciation? A depreciation deduction for a particular asset is only allowed once you own the asset and it's used or available for use in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Ownership You're considered to own an asset when: you acquire legal title (binding contract), or you take up beneficial ownership, which occurs when an asset passes by way of gift, bequest or distribution to a new owner. Where there is both an equitable owner and a legal owner of the same asset, depreciation may only be claimed by the owner who uses the asset or has that asset available for use in deriving their gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate their gross income. So, to claim a depreciation deduction for an asset, you must: own it, or lease it under a specified or finance lease (see page 15), or be buying it under a hire purchase agreement. Your asset must also be expected to reduce in value while it's used or is available for use in your business. Used or available for use The following are some examples of the criteria of "used" or "available for use". You cannot start claiming depreciation on any equipment purchased until your business commences. How to make an election not to depreciate You'll need to let us know if you're making an election by attaching your notification to your tax return for the income year that you: purchase the asset, or changed the asset use from non-business to business, or elect not to depreciate an asset that you've not claimed depreciation on in any previous year. This election will then apply to every year from when the asset was purchased. Your notification needs to provide the following details: a description of the asset the purchase date the income year the election is being made for whether the asset has been newly acquired or its use has changed if the election is for retrospective depreciation. Assets that do not depreciate Some assets do not depreciate for tax purposes. These assets include: those you've elected to treat as not depreciable trading stock land (except for buildings, fixture or land improvements as specified in schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007) financial arrangements under the accrual rules intangible assets, for example, goodwill (other than depreciable intangible assets of the type listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) low-value assets that are fully written off on acquisition Up till 16 March 2020Up to $500 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021Up to $5,000 From 17 March 2021Up to $1,000 an asset whose cost is allowed as a deduction under some other tax provision an asset that does not decline in economic value because of compensation for loss or damage an asset whose cost was or is allowed as a deduction in any income year to any other taxpayer under any of the special provisions relating to primary sector land improvements. Part 1 8 DEPRECIATION Example In April 2014, Enid purchases equipment in anticipation of setting up a home tutoring business but does not start the business until March 2015. The depreciation deduction for Enid's 2015 income year is restricted to one-twelfth of the yearly depreciation rate. Cargo ship in dry docks - conducting normal ongoing maintenance is an ordinary incidence of business and the ship would still be wholly used or available for use in carrying on the business. Plant and machinery finished and awaiting other plant - depending on the facts, if the completed plant and machinery were available for use in isolation or in another production line if required, the depreciation could be claimed. However, if a further machine or plant was required in order to produce a product, depreciation could not commence until that other necessary plant or machinery was available for use. Plant and machinery in storage - this depends on the degree and time of reconnection or installation required. If the item (for example, a transformer) were a back-up piece of equipment necessary to keep an operation going, it would be regarded as being available for use and would be depreciable. However, if a new piece of machinery or a new plant were being delivered and had yet to be installed (for example, being shipped in from offshore) there would be no entitlement to depreciation until the installation process was completed. Assets temporarily out of operation for repair or inspection are regarded as being available for use and can be depreciated. Cost of assets for depreciation purposes Generally, the cost of an asset is the amount paid by the purchaser - normally the market value - and this principle applies to associated persons. For further information on transfers between associated persons see page 25. If the property has been inherited, the cost price for depreciation purposes is its market value at the time the property is transferred to the new owner. The exception is for a spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner where transfer is at cost or adjusted tax value. For income tax purposes a deduction is not usually available for expenses incurred in acquiring a capital asset. This includes legal fees charged by a solicitor for preparing and registering the various documents relating to the purchase. From the 2010 income year business-related legal expenses for buying or selling a property can be deducted. This is provided your total legal expenses for the income year, including the fees associated with buying and selling a property, are equal to or less than $10,000. In all other cases, this type of expenditure may be added to the cost of the purchased asset when calculating depreciation on that asset. The depreciation you calculate each year is deducted from the value of your asset. The remaining value is called the asset's adjusted tax value. GST and depreciation If you're registered for GST (goods and services tax), you can generally claim a credit for the GST part of an asset's cost price. You calculate depreciation on the GST-exclusive price of the asset. If you are not registered for GST, you base your depreciation on the actual price you pay for an asset, including GST. Part 1 ird.govt.nz 9 Records As with all tax matters you must keep sufficient and accurate records. For depreciation purposes, your records must be able to substantiate your depreciation claims, purchases and sales of your business assets so, if we need to, we can check your deductions (including losses) and depreciation recovered. You must keep your records for at least seven years. Individual or pooled assets You can account for depreciation on your assets in two ways, as an individual asset or as part of a group or pool of assets. See "Pooling method" in the next column. If you choose to calculate depreciation on individual assets you can use either the diminishing value (DV) method of calculating depreciation or the straight line (SL) method. If you decide to group your assets into a pool you must use the DV method for calculating depreciation. Diminishing value (DV) method With this method depreciation is calculated each year by using a constant percentage of the asset's adjusted tax value. This method is sometimes also referred to as the written down value or tax book value. The DV method means your depreciation deduction will progressively reduce each year. Example Depreciation on office equipment that cost $10,000 was calculated using the DV depreciation rate of 33%. The depreciation is calculated as follows: Adjusted tax valueDepreciation of 33% Year 1 $10,000$3,300 Year 2 $6,700$2,211 Ye a r 3$4,489$1,481 Straight line (SL) method With this method an asset depreciates every year by the same amount, which is a percentage of its original cost price. This method is sometimes called the cost price basis. Example Depreciation on office equipment that cost $10,000 was calculated using the SL depreciation rate of 24%. The depreciation is calculated as follows: Adjusted tax valueDepreciation of 24% Year 1 $10,000$2,400 Year 2 $7,600$2,400 Ye a r 3$5,200$2,400 Changing methods You can choose to use either the SL or DV method for individual assets (except for pooled assets and fixed- life intangible assets) regardless of when you bought the assets. If you decide to change depreciation methods, use the current adjusted tax value to calculate depreciation and not the original cost price of the asset. Once you've filed your tax return you cannot change methods for that income year. Pooling method The pooling method allows you to group together (pool) a number of low-value assets and calculate depreciation on the pool. The advantage of pooling assets is the cost of compliance is reduced because all the assets in the pool are treated as one asset for the purposes of depreciation. The disadvantage of pooling assets is that if you sell an asset in a pool for more than its cost price, this capital gain amount must be included as taxable income. Main features of the pooling method Only diminishing value (DV) rates can be used for the pool method. Where items in the pool have different depreciation rates, the lowest rate is applied to the pool. Buildings cannot be depreciated using the pooling method. The maximum pooling value is generally $5,000 for each individual asset, but you may apply for a higher pooling value for specific assets - see page 34. For GST-registered people, the maximum pooling value excludes GST. Part 1 10 DEPRECIATION The maximum pooling value of $5,000 applies from the 2015-2016 income year. The maximum pooling value is $2,000 prior to this. All poolable assets must be used wholly in business (no private use), or be subject to FBT (fringe benefit tax). Once an asset is included in a pool it cannot be separated out later, except where the asset must be isolated because you now use it privately. There is no restriction on the depreciation recovered for a pooled asset. Any capital gains are taxed - see page 26. When all assets in a pool have been disposed of but the pool still has a positive value, ie, the proceeds of the sale are less than the pool value, this remaining value of the pool is deductible from your gross income. Calculating depreciation for an asset pool Assets can only be pooled if individual assets within the pool each have a value equal to or less than the maximum pooling value. This maximum is currently set at $5,000, so assets that can be pooled are those that: individually cost you $5,000 or less, or have depreciated and whose adjusted tax value has been reduced to $5,000 or less. Example Hiram bought a printing machine for $5,500 and calculated depreciation using the DV method. CostDepreciation 10% DV Adjusted tax value at the end of year $5,500$550$4,950 Hiram could include the printing machine in a pool of assets for the second year. If your assets meet this requirement, you may pool any number of them and you may have as many pools as suit your circumstances. You can also combine two or more pools to form one pool. Note The maximum pooling value of $5,000 applies from the 2015-2016 income year. The maximum pooling value is $2,000 prior to this. Depreciation is calculated on the average value of the pool for the income year, using the DV method. Work out the average value of the pool by adding together the pool's value at the beginning and end of the income year, before depreciation has been deducted, and then dividing by two. Example Adam has a pool of assets with an adjusted tax value at the beginning of the year of $18,000. During the year he purchases three assets for $5,000 each. At the end of the year, he decides to include them in the pool. The value of the pool at the end of the income year (before deducting depreciation) is $33,000. The average pool value is: $18,000 + $33,000 =$25,500 2 Adam is using the DV rate of 22%, so the depreciation deduction and the adjusted tax value of the pool will be calculated as follows: Value of pool at the end of income year 33,000 Less annual depreciation ($25,500 x 22%) -$5,610 Adjusted tax value of pool$27,390 Where your income year is longer or shorter than 12 months because of a change in balance date, you'll need to apportion the annual depreciation to the number of whole or part months in your income year. When the assets in the pool have different depreciation rates you must use the lowest rate. This could happen when different types of assets are included in a pool. Example Richard owns a shop and these are some of his assets that he could pool. Cash register 40% DV Electric sign 20% DV Fittings 20% DV Furniture 20% DV The rate for this pool would be 20% DV. In a case such as this, Richard may decide to pool only those assets with the 20% DV depreciation rate and account for depreciation on the cash register separately or as an asset in another pool. In the first year of pooling, it's very important to carefully consider the date from which you'll pool your assets, because it will have a significant effect on the average pool value used when calculating depreciation. Part 1 ird.govt.nz 11 If you decide to pool your assets part-way through an income year, the pool value at the beginning of the income year will be nil. The amount of depreciation you can claim will be based on half the pool value at the end of the income year. Example Anne starts a business on 15 May 2013 and purchases five assets for $2,000 each, which she pools. She has a 31 March balance date and uses a depreciation rate of 20% DV. Her 2014 depreciation deduction is calculated as follows: Calculate average pool value: Pool value at beginning of year (1 April 2013)nil Pool value at end of year (31 March 2014)$10,000 Divide by 2 to average$5,000 Calculate annual depreciation: $5,000 x 20% x 11 months = $916.66 depreciation 12 (The 11 months is 15 May 2013 to 31 March 2014.) Adding assets to a pool The adjusted tax value of an existing pool is increased by: the cost price of the asset (if it's newly acquired), or the adjusted tax value of the asset (if it was previously depreciated separately). If assets are added to the pool at the beginning of an income year, the pool values at both the beginning and end of the year will increase. If the assets are added to the pool part-way through the income year, only the pool value at the end of the year will increase. Rates Once you've decided on the method (or methods) you'll use to account for depreciation, you have to identify the correct rate for calculating the amount of the deduction. The correct depreciation rate to use depends on the date you acquired the asset. To find the depreciation rates for all depreciable assets acquired after 1 April 1993, use our depreciation rate finder at ird.govt.nz/depreciation For assets acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, use the rates listed in the IR265 guide. For all assets acquired before these dates refer to our IR267 guide. These guides are available on our website ird.govt.nz Loading Any asset purchased from 21 May 2010 onwards is not entitled to the 20% depreciation loading. If you entered into a contract to purchase an asset on or before 20 May 2010, you can still depreciate this asset with the loading. Any asset being depreciated at a rate with loading before 21 May 2010 can continue to be depreciated at that rate for that asset's lifetime. However, if there is a capital improvement to an asset with the 20% loading, this improvement will need to be depreciated separately from the original asset, and will be depreciated without the loading allowance. Provisional and special rates If we haven't set a general depreciation rate for your particular type of asset, you may apply for a provisional rate to be set - see page 33. General depreciation rates are based on the average use of an asset. If you believe you use your asset more heavily or less heavily than is generally the case, or the conditions in which the asset is used are abnormal, you may want to apply for a special rate - see page 32. How rates are calculated If you'd like to know how we work out the general rates for assets see page 30. Part 2 12 DEPRECIATION Buildings do not qualify for the increased loading of 25% on the historic rates or 20% on the general rates. Buildings are not eligible for the special deduction for assets you no longer use - see page 35. Generally, when a personal (non-business) asset is introduced into a business, the market value at that time is used to calculate depreciation. This rule does not apply to buildings, where the original cost (excluding land) must be used for calculating depreciation. Buildings transferred between companies where there is 100% common ownership or transfers under a relationship agreement can continue to use the depreciation rate applying to the building at the time of transfer. Depreciation claims on buildings acquired before the 1994 income year must be calculated using the SL method. However, you can choose between the SL and the DV methods to calculate depreciation for the 1994 and future income years on assets acquired before 1 April 1993. Depreciation on buildings is calculated on either the original cost or the adjusted tax value depending on which depreciation method you use. The first time you use the DV method you need to calculate the adjusted tax value of your building. The building's depreciation is calculated on this amount. To work out the adjusted tax value, deduct the amount of depreciation you've claimed since you bought the building, from the original cost of the building (excluding land). Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Sale of buildings When a building is sold for more than its adjusted tax value, the depreciation recovered is taxable income. The amount of depreciation recovered is the smaller of: the original cost price of the building minus the adjusted tax value the sale price minus the adjusted tax value. This ensures any capital profit made on the sale of a building is not included as taxable income. Losses made when selling or disposing of buildings are generally not deductible. This section provides further information on certain assets of particular interest. Buildings From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties, including leasehold property. If the type of building you own currently has an estimated useful life, as determined by Inland Revenue, of less than 50 years you can simply continue to claim depreciation deductions as you have previously. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Even though many buildings can no longer be depreciated, depreciation recovery will still apply for those buildings when they're sold for greater than their book value. This applies regardless of when the building was acquired. The chattels and fit-out of a building, where it does not form part of the building, can still be depreciated. Interpretation statement 10/01 "Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable property" sets out a three-step test that we apply to determine whether an item can be separated out or whether it's regarded as being part of the building. You can find this in our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). Further information on the treatment of commercial or industrial building fit-outs, "Clarifying that certain building fit-out is depreciable property", is available in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011). These special rules also apply to buildings. When disposing of a building a loss cannot be claimed as a deduction, except where due to an emergency event, eg, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, the building has been rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income and is demolished. See "Event" page 37. Buildings cannot be pooled. Depreciation on buildings, unlike other assets, can be claimed in the year of sale. Part 2 - Detailed information on certain assets Part 2 ird.govt.nz 13 Definition of a "building" The term "building" can have various meanings depending on the context in which the term is used. A building in ordinary circumstances is defined as: a structure of considerable size permanent in the sense that it's intended to last a considerable time enclosed by walls and a roof able to function independently of any other structure. However, a building is not necessarily a physically separate structure. Interpretation statement 22/04 “Claiming depreciation on buildings” steps through the depreciation rules that apply to buildings and explains how to distinguish between a residential building and a non-residential building. You can find this in the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 34, No 8, (September 2022). Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Resource consents The ability to depreciate expenditure on a resource consent depends on the type of expenditure, the type of consent and the resulting asset. Interpretation Statement IS 18/06, Income tax – Treatment of costs of resource consents, provides a full treatment of these issues and when expenditure on resource consents may be depreciable. You can download this statement from our website ird.govt.nz Land You cannot claim depreciation on land because land, generally, does not depreciate. When land and buildings are purchased and the price does not specify the cost of the buildings, the government valuation (at the time of purchase) may be used to calculate this cost: Value of improvements (buildings) × purchase price = cost of buildings Capital value (land and buildings) Land improvements Land improvements, however, may depreciate, and since 1 April 1993 there has been the provision for specific fixtures on the land (non-primary sector land) to be depreciated. These fixtures as listed in schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are: airport runways bores and wells bridges chimneys culverts dams fences hardstanding (for example, asphalt car park) pipes purpose-built surfaces for outdoor sports facilities reservoirs retaining walls roads spillways swimming pools tanks tunnels wharves. In the same manner as plant and machinery, these fixtures are depreciable at the general rates if made in the 1996 and later income years. They also qualify for the 20% loading if made in the 1996 income year and before 21 May 2010. Part 2 14 DEPRECIATION Expenditure on farm and forestry land and aquaculture improvements Although land is not a depreciable asset, there are provisions allowing you to progressively deduct expenditure incurred in preparing or otherwise developing land within the farming, agriculture, forestry and aquaculture industries. This differs from the depreciation of other land improvements. While depreciation is subject to the period the asset was used during the financial year, the deduction for the development expenditure is not time based. You can claim the full percentage of the deduction (plus any loading) even if the development expenditure occurs near the end of the financial year, provided the expenditure benefits the business in that income year. Deductions are allowed for losses on farm land improvements where an event has occurred either destroying or rendering the improvements useless for deriving income. When the land is sold there is no taxable recovery of any deductions allowed for the capitalised development expenditure. When the land is sold the undeducted balance of the development expenditure can be transferred to the new owner. The capitalised development expenditure effectively stays with the land, rather than with the person who incurred it. We recommend you consult a tax agent when considering this. Taxpayers involved in the primary sector may claim depreciation for assets listed in schedule 13. However, they may only do so when they cannot claim the expenditure under section DO 1 or DO 2 or schedule 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007. To read tax legislation online, go to legislation.govt.nz The following are some examples of the specific provisions applying to farming and agriculture (schedule 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007) for land improvements. Clearing land The expenditure incurred in clearing land is deductible in the year it was incurred. Cultivating land The expenditure incurred in cultivating land is deductible on a DV basis (similar to depreciation) at the rate of 5% each year. Expenditure incurred between 16 December 1991 and the end of the taxpayer's 1995 income year qualifies for a 25% loading, ie, 6.25%. Expenditure incurred in the 1996 or any subsequent income year (up until 1 April 2013) qualifies for a 20% loading, ie, 6%. Irrigation system and plant This is capital expenditure so normal depreciation rules apply. Installing tile drains This is deductible on a DV basis at the annual rate of 5% (plus any loading). This same rate would apply to the cost of replacing a tile drainage system. The fact that the retiling may be done over a period longer than one year does not affect the deduction that can be claimed. A loss cannot be claimed on the old system because it's scrapped, nor can a continued deduction be made for the old system since the asset is no longer of benefit to the business. Sinking a bore This is deductible on a DV basis at the rate of 5% (plus any loading) each year. Regrassing and fertilising Expenditure incurred in connection with significant capital activity, such as a change from one type of farming to another, is deductible on a DV basis at the rate of 45% each year. A 20% depreciation loading applied to farming and agriculture land improvements acquired before 1 April 2013. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 15 Leased assets For tax purposes there are four kinds of lease. The type of lease determines whether the lessor (owner) or the lessee (person paying to use the asset) is entitled to claim depreciation on the asset. Specified leases A specified lease is a lease agreement entered into between 6 August 1982 and 19 May 1999 that meets certain criteria. The lease is a specified lease if: it has a guaranteed residual value, or the lease term is more than 36 consecutive months (or, if we consider the economic life of the asset is less than 36 months, a term equal to the economic life of the lease asset), and –the lessee becomes the owner at the end of the term, or –the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at the end of the term at a price significantly lower than market value, or –the total of all payments and the guaranteed residual value is more than, or roughly equal to, the cost price, or –both parties agree the lessee is liable for the payment of all, or nearly all, maintenance and other incidental costs. Specified leases include: leases acquired by any means whatsoever, whether from the lessor or another person, and leases entered into between 28 October 1983 and 19 May 1999 (both dates inclusive) if a person other than the lessee acquires the asset and they are associated with the lessee. Finance leases A finance lease is an agreement entered into on or after 20 May 1999 under which: ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee (or an associate of the lessee) at the end of the term, or the lessee (or an associate of the lessee) has the option of acquiring the asset for an amount significantly lower than market value, or the lease term is more than 75% of the asset's estimated useful life (as determined under section EE63 of the Income Tax Act 2007). For income years including 20 June 2007 and later income years, the lease, or an arrangement of which the lease is part, must: involve the use of the lease asset outside New Zealand for all or most of the term of the lease, and involve income from the use of the asset by any person other than the lessor which is exempt, excluded or non-residents' foreign sourced income, and be an arrangement in which substantially all the risks and rewards that are incidental to ownership are incurred by persons other than the lessor and/ or it's a finance lease under NZIAS 17 either for the lessor or for another company in the same group of companies that derives assessable income from the arrangement. With both specified and finance leases, the lessor is treated as selling the asset to the lessee at the beginning of the lease. Therefore, the lessee is the owner and is entitled to the deduction for depreciation. Hire purchase A hire purchase agreement passing ownership to the person paying the hire purchase allows that person to claim any allowable depreciation. This provision overrides the general provision that limits the claim to the owner of the asset. Leasehold improvements A lessee is considered to own and be entitled to claim depreciation on the cost of leasehold fixtures or improvements incurred by that lessee, but under land law principles are technically owned by the lessor. When the lease expires, to calculate the loss on disposal, the lessee is considered to have disposed of the fixture or improvement. The lessor, including subsequent lessors, will not be able to depreciate such fixtures or improvements during the term of the lease. However, once the lease has expired, the lessor will be able to depreciate the fixtures and improvements if they have paid the lessee for these. This also applies when the lessee transfers the lease and the person the lease is transferred to pays the original lessee for the leasehold improvements. The same applies to licences to occupy. Part 2 16 DEPRECIATION Non-specified and operating leases If a lease was entered into between 6 August 1982 and 19 May 1999 and it is not a specified lease, it's known as a non-specified lease. If the lease was entered into on or after 20 May 1999 and it is not a finance lease, it's an operating lease. For these kinds of leases, the owner (lessor) of the lease asset claims the deduction for depreciation. Renting out a residential property You must claim depreciation on a house or flat you're renting out as a deduction from the rent you receive, unless you make an election for the asset not to be a depreciable asset. You must also claim depreciation on any contents in the house or flat being used or available for use by the tenants, unless you elect otherwise - see page 6. Depreciation rules for the house itself are covered under "Buildings" on page 12. The contents of the house may be depreciated either on an individual item basis or using the pooling method - see page 9. If you're calculating depreciation on contents for the first time, the adjusted tax value will be the lesser of the cost of those items or their market value at the time they're first used or available for use in earning rental income. The rates for house or flat contents are set out in the industry category "Residential rental property chattels". You can find this in our depreciation rate finder on ird.govt.nz/depreciation Or, you can use our guides IR265 for chattels acquired on or after 1 April 2005, and the IR267 for chattels acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and up to 31 March 2005. Depreciable item distinct from the building If an item in a residential rental property is distinct from the building and meets the definition of "depreciable property", it may be depreciated separately. If an item is part of the building it cannot be depreciated separately, but can be depreciated with the building. It's important that the correct approach is applied to determine if these items are regarded as distinct from the building. To determine whether a particular item is part of or separate from the building there is a three- step test. 1. The item is in some way attached or connected to the building. 2. The item is an integral part of the residential rental property, so it wouldn't function as a rental without it. 3. The item is built-in or attached/connected in such a way that it's part of the "fabric" of the building. Full commentary on Interpretation statement 10/01 "Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable properties" can be found in the Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). For more information, read our IR264 guide. It explains the taxable income and deductible expenses for people who own rental property. Holiday homes Where a holiday home is considered to be a "rental" property, depreciation may be claimed. The proportion of depreciation claimed on the assets will vary depending on the degree of actual rental time. The facts of a particular case always need to be considered carefully and so it may be necessary to seek advice from a tax advisor before making any claim for depreciation or other expenses on a holiday home. You can find more information on income tax treatment of holiday homes in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 3 (May 2009). Intangible assets Depreciating intangible assets Certain intangible assets have been included in the depreciation rules, and can be depreciated under the general rules applying to other depreciable assets. The only difference is that the rules apply to intangible assets acquired or created on or after 1 April 1993, rather than from a taxpayer's 1994 income or non- standard balance date accounting year. The 20% depreciation loading does not apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 17 Intangible assets acquired or created after 1 April 1993 that are depreciable, intangible property, are limited to those listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and they all have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of creation or acquisition. In brief, the intangible assets covered by schedule 14 are: a patent, or the right to use a patent the right to use a copyright, trademark, design, plan or similar the right to use land, plant or machinery software copyright management rights and licence rights created under the Radiocommunications Act 1989 consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 copyright in a sound recording plant variety rights, or the right to use them. To be depreciable, an intangible asset must be both: an asset of the type listed in schedule 14 an asset that might reasonably be expected to decline in value under normal circumstances. The most common feature of the assets listed in schedule 14 is the "right to use". Take, for example, costs incurred in designing and producing a logo. A logo is not listed in the schedule so the costs are considered to be a one-off capital cost and not depreciable. If the logo, once created, is then trademarked and the rights to use are sold, the purchaser can depreciate those rights. The depreciation rules vary according to whether or not intangible assets have a fixed life or an economic life. Intangible assets with a fixed life An intangible asset with a fixed life is any intangible asset that is depreciable with a legal life that could reasonably be expected, on the date of creation or acquisition of that asset, to be the same length as the asset's remaining estimated useful life. If an intangible asset falls into this category, the depreciation rate is self-assessed by the owner using the formula: 1 Legal life (years) In such cases the "legal life" is defined as the length of time the intangible asset may exist as specified by the contract or statute that created it. In addition, legal life will include any renewal or extension period where those renewals or extensions are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of a predetermined fee. The formula gives an SL depreciation rate. The SL method is the only depreciation method that can be used for fixed-life intangible assets. Intangible assets with a fixed life are not eligible for the 20% loading that applies from the 1996 income year until 20 May 2010. Example Mark acquired the right to use a registered trademark from 1 April 2006 with a value of $10,000 and a legal life of five years. Using the above formula, the depreciation rate Mark would use is: 1 =0.2 or 20% 5 Mark can claim a $2,000 deduction for depreciation each year. Note A special depreciation rate may be applied if the economic life is different from the legal life of the intangible asset. Intangible assets with an economic life If the intangible asset does not have a fixed life, it can be expected to have an economic life shorter than its legal life. Unlike fixed-life intangible assets, economic- life intangible assets are depreciated using the same methods applied to all tangible depreciable assets, ie, a DV or SL depreciation rate. They can be pooled and, if purchased between 1996 and 20 May 2010, are eligible for a 20% loading. Taxpayers can also apply for a special or provisional depreciation rate for economic life intangibles. For example, a taxpayer may obtain a licence to use computer software for life, whereas the economic life of that software would possibly only be three years. Part 2 18 DEPRECIATION Franchises Franchise agreements are not a category of intangible assets listed in schedule 14 so they are not normally considered to be depreciable intangible assets. However, any particular franchise agreement may give rise to specific rights listed in schedule 14, for example, the right to use a trademark. Remember, the rights are the depreciable intangible assets, not the franchise agreement. If a franchise agreement stipulates a mixture of rights, and one particular right is specifically listed in schedule 14 and is capable of being separately and clearly isolated and valued, that right will be a depreciable intangible asset, provided it might reasonably be expected to decline in value under normal circumstances. Whether or not the rights conferred under a franchise agreement are considered to be the type listed in schedule 14, they will not be depreciable if any of the following situations apply: You cannot estimate with any reasonable degree of certainty a finite and defined period of life. The rights are not expected to decline in value over their life. The payment is made to purchase goodwill rather than the rights to secret formulas, processes, trademarks or similar. If a right conferred under a franchise agreement is depreciable, it will usually have a legal life equivalent to its estimated useful life. Accordingly, it must be depreciated using the SL method as an intangible asset with a fixed life. If a right conferred under a franchise agreement is automatically renewed or the right to renewal is only subject to the payment of a predetermined fee, the legal life of that right will be equal to the full term of the agreement, assuming the right to renewal is taken up. Example Cherrypoppin Ltd paid $50,000 to acquire the New Zealand franchise rights to manufacture and distribute Rolloseal towel rails. The franchise agreement is for a 10-year period. The majority of the $50,000 franchise fee went to capital expenditure, however, $20,000 of the fee related to the right to use a patent. The franchise was acquired on 1 April 2006 to extend until 1 April 2016. The right to use the patent is a fixed-life intangible asset. When the franchise was purchased, it appeared the right to use the patent would remain valuable to the end of its legal life. The legal life of this fixed-life intangible asset is 10 years. The SL depreciation rate to be used by Cherrypoppin Ltd for the right to use a patent is: 1/10 = 10% on cost of $20,000. The annual depreciation is $2,000. Additional costs Any additional costs, incurred in relation to an intangible asset with a fixed life during the legal life of that asset, are added to the book value. This is done at the beginning of the income year in which the costs are incurred. The aggregate costs are depreciated over the remaining legal life of that intangible asset (calculated from the beginning of the year in which they are incurred). A legal life includes any renewal or extension period where the renewal or extension is essentially unconditional or conditional only on the payment of predetermined fees. So, the depreciation rate for the fixed-life intangible asset changes. In effect, the fixed-life intangible asset is treated as newly acquired from the beginning of that year for the sum of the adjusted tax value and additional costs. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 19 Example Karion Ltd acquires the right to use a copyright for five years for $10,000 and has an option to renew for a further five years on payment of an additional $5,000. The legal life is therefore: 1/10 = 10% on cost of $10,000. The annual depreciation is $1,000. In the first five years, Karion Ltd claims annual deductions totalling $5,000. In year six, Karion Ltd pays the additional $5,000. The sum of the adjusted tax value and additional cost is $10,000 ($5,000 + $5,000). The remaining legal life of the right is five years, so the depreciation rate for years six to ten is: 1/5 = 20% on cost of $10,000. The annual depreciation in years six to ten is $2,000. It is necessary to calculate a loss or gain on disposal of a depreciable intangible asset - see page 26. Patents Patent rights acquired after 1 April 1993 are also depreciable intangible assets. Timing of depreciation For patent applications lodged before 1 April 2005 and granted in the 2005-06 income year or later, depreciation begins from the date the application is granted. However, there's a catch-up deduction for the period between when the application is lodged and when it's granted. For patent applications lodged on or after 1 April 2005, depreciation begins from the date the patent application is lodged with a complete specification. Depreciation rates for patents Patents have a legal life of 20 years, which is 240 months. To work out the depreciation rate divide the number of months in that year by 240. For patents with applications lodged before 1 April 2005 and granted in the 2005-06 tax year or later, divide the number of months the patent was pending by 240 to give the catch-up depreciation rate. Further details on the tax implications of selling patents are covered on page 27. Example 1 - Patent application lodged before 1 April 2005 Kariov filed for a patent on a new type of footwear on 4 April 2004. The patent is granted on 2 June 2007. The total patent costs were $10,000. The depreciation for the patent would be calculated as follows: Depreciation catch-up (April 04-May 07) 38 months/240 months = 16% on cost of $10,000 = $1,600 depreciation\* Annual rate for the year (June 07-March 08) 10 months/240 months = 4% on cost of $10,000 = $400 depreciation\* 2008-09 income year onwards 12 months/240 months = 5% on cost of $10,000 = $500 depreciation (as the SL method must be used). Kariov will be able to claim $500 each year until the patent expires. \* The total depreciation for the 2007-08 income year would be $2,000 ($1,600+$400) Example 2 - Application lodged after 1 April 2005 KIZ Ltd files for a patent on a new type of cat-door. It lodged its application with complete specification on 15 September 2005. The patent is granted on 21 February 2008. The depreciation rate for the patent application and for the patent (once granted) would be calculated as follows: Depreciation rate for patent application 2005-06 income year (Sept 05 to Mar 06) 7 months/240 months = 0.03 2006-07 income year 12 months/240 months = 0.05 2007-08 income year (April 07-Jan 08) 10 months/240 months = 0.04\* Depreciation rate for patent 2007-08 income year (Feb 08-Mar 08) 2 months/240 months = 0.01\* 2008-09 income year onwards 12 months/240 months = 0.05 \* The total depreciation rate for the 2007-08 income year would be 0.05 (0.04+0.01) Part 2 20 DEPRECIATION For more information on depreciation on patents see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 7 (September 2005). Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Fishing quotas There are two types of fishing quota: individual term quotas (ITQs), which are issued in perpetuity transferable term quotas (TTQs), which are issued for fixed periods. Most fishing quotas give the owner the right to catch a defined percentage of the total allowable commercial catch, so do not fall within any of the classes of intangible assets listed in schedule 14. Also, the majority of quotas issued to date have been ITQs, which have an indefinite life, and are not depreciable anyway. Please note that a TTQ is depreciable property - specifically, it is fixed-life intangible property. For more information about fishing quotas, please refer to our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 3 (March 2000). Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Computer software This section explains our policy on the tax treatment of computer software expenditure. Some of the terms used in our software policy are explained below. Development The following activities are likely to be part of a development phase: gathering and analysing user requirements designing systems developing detailed software specifications constructing programs testing software testing the user or customer (acceptance testing) developing manuals and training material preparing documents for use in ongoing software product maintenance providing management review throughout the development phase (for example, quality assurance). Maintenance The following activities will generally be accepted as deductible maintenance payments: developing helpdesk facilities fixing program bugs bringing performance up to the original specifications making minor changes, such as increasing field sizes. Predevelopment This term refers to a feasibility study of a project as part of ongoing business. Software Software includes all programs or routines used to cause a computer to perform a desired task or set of tasks, and the documentation and training materials required to describe and maintain these programs. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 21 Upgrade Generally, an upgrade of computer software: adds new features to the structure increases its capacity or performance extends the life of the software provides a new version of the software that has more capacity or increased performance. Categories of software expenditure For tax purposes, software expenditure is divided into six categories, each treated differently. Software purchases Cost of purchase should be capitalised and depreciated. Immediate write-off is available for software costing less than $500. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Specified lease of software Cost price of software must be capitalised and depreciated. Interest component of lease payments may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Software developed in-house for use in business Predevelopment expenses may be deducted. Development expenses must be capitalised until the project is completed and depreciated. Costs of unsuccessful development may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Costs of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Commissioned software Development costs must be capitalised until the project is accepted. It must then be depreciated. Costs of unsuccessful development may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Costs of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Software leased other than under a specified lease Lease payments are deductible over the term of the lease. Software developed for sale or licence Development costs are deductible in the year they are incurred. The value of unbilled work in progress and unsold completed software must be taken into account as trading stock. The value of trading stock at balance date must be included as income in your return for that income year. Where a payment covers both maintenance and upgrading, the cost must be apportioned between the two. The cost of maintenance is deductible and the cost of upgrading must be capitalised, taking account of depreciation. Reservation of title clause (also known as Romalpa clause) Depreciation can be deducted from depreciable assets purchased subject to a reservation of title clause (ie, where the contract provides that the vendor reserves title to the asset until the purchase price has been paid but allows the purchaser to take possession of the asset before payment). Note Reservation of title clause does not apply to hire purchase assets subject to hire purchase agreements - see "Hire purchase" and "Leasehold improvements" on page 15. Where you purchase an asset subject to a reservation of title clause you're considered to own (and the vendor is considered not to own) the asset on the later date of entering the contract or taking possession of the asset. This considered ownership remains until: title to the asset passes to you the vendor repossesses the asset. If the asset is repossessed you're considered to have disposed of the asset at cost, less the net amount already paid to the vendor. Part 2 22 DEPRECIATION Example Purchase price of an asset $10,000 Amount purchaser paid towards the asset $5,000 Asset repossessed - vendor refunds $3,000 This means the net payment for the asset has been $2,000. The purchaser is considered to have sold the asset for $8,000, so the depreciation recovered is calculated on the considered sale price of $8,000. The vendor of the asset will not be able to depreciate the asset while you, the purchaser, are deemed to own it. Low Value Assets (including loose tools) Low-value assets, are deductible in the year they're acquired or created, provided: they are not purchased from the same supplier at the same time as other assets to which the same depreciation rate applies the assets will not become part of an asset that is depreciable, for example, the cost of materials to build a wall in a factory. Assets are considered low value where their cost was as follows: Up till 16 March 2020Up to $500 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021Up to $5,000 From 17 March 2021Up to $1,000 If you're GST-registered, the cost is GST-exclusive and if you're not GST-registered, then the cost is GST- inclusive. If you sell an asset you've claimed this deduction for, or you start using it mainly for private purposes, you'll have to account for it in your next tax return. If the asset is sold, the entire sale proceeds are taxable in the year the asset is sold. If the asset becomes a private asset, the market value of the asset when it's first used privately will be taxable income. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 23 This part deals with adjustments you might make and how the various ways of disposing of depreciable assets will be treated for tax purposes. This includes calculating depreciation in the following situations: newly acquired assets private use of business assets transferring depreciable assets between associated persons private assets becoming business assets disposals transferring assets under a relationship agreement transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies local authority trading enterprises determinations. Newly acquired assets If you're using either the SL or DV methods you can claim depreciation for each calendar month or part- month you own an asset and it's used or available to be used in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Example Craig buys a new cash register on 27 January 2010 for $7,000, which he uses 100% in his business. Craig's balance date is 31 March and he uses a DV rate of 48% (including 20% loading). This is how he calculates his 2010 depreciation deduction: Three months' use (January, February, March 2010) 12 months' income year (1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010) The depreciation deduction is: $7,000×48%× 3 =$840 12 Even though he owned the cash register for only a few days in January, Craig can claim depreciation for the entire month. If you have pooled assets you may add a newly acquired asset to a pool - see page 9. Private use of business assets Use the most appropriate unit of measurement when calculating how much a business asset, other than a motor vehicle, is used privately, such as square metres for area or hours and minutes for time. When a business motor vehicle is used privately and the use is subject to FBT (fringe benefit tax), you do not need to adjust the depreciation deduction to exclude the private use. This is because FBT itself is a way of accounting for the non-business use. However, self-employed people (including partners in a partnership) who use a business vehicle for private purposes, must apportion the vehicle's depreciation between business and non-business use. If you keep an accurate vehicle logbook as an ongoing record, you can make a precise apportionment for depreciation. Alternatively, you may keep a record for a minimum of three months to establish an apportionment that may then be used for three years, provided the business use of the vehicle does not change by more than 20%. Example Mike is a self-employed salesperson. He bought a car for $30,000 at the beginning of the income year and 85% of its use is for business purposes. Mike's car has a DV rate of 36% (including 20% loading) and depreciation on the car is calculated as: Step 1 Opening adjusted tax value $30,000 Depreciation $10,800 Closing adjusted value $19,200 Step 2 Total depreciation $10,800 Less 15% private use (non-deductible) $1,620 Equals 85% business use (deductible) $9,180 Part 3 - Adjustments and disposals The 20% depreciation loading does not apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. Part 3 24 DEPRECIATION The adjusted tax value is calculated taking into account 100% of the annual depreciation, not just the deductible proportion - see the table below. YearOpening adjusted tax value DepreciationClosing adjusted tax value Deductible portion 130,00010,80019,2009,180 (85%) 219,2006,91212,2885,875 (85%) 312,2884,4247,8643,760 (85%) When a business asset that's been used privately is sold, resulting in either depreciation recovered or a loss, the loss or gain must be apportioned between business and private use. Calculate the apportionment using this formula: a - b × c a = adjusted tax value at time of sale b = sale price c = percentage of business use Example If Mike, from the previous example, sells his car after three years for $6,000, the loss on the sale must be apportioned between business and private use. Business purposes made up 85% of the car's use. The deductible portion of the loss on the sale is calculated as: Adjusted tax value (at time of sale) $7,864 Sale price -$6,000 $1,864 85% business use of $1,864 $1,584 Mike can claim $1,584 as loss on the sale. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 25 Transferring depreciable assets between associated persons Under normal rules a purchaser is entitled to claim depreciation based on the purchase price of an asset. The new owner of a secondhand asset can claim depreciation based on the amount paid for the asset, as long as it's an arm's length sale where: the sale is bona fide the purchase price is a fair market value for the asset the purchaser buys the asset for use in income- producing activities and the seller no longer uses it for income-producing activities. The fact the parties are related does not prevent depreciation being claimed. In the case of transfers of assets between associated persons (apart from assets transferred under a relationship agreement - see page 29) a restriction applies to the amount and rate of depreciation that may be claimed by the person acquiring the asset. Depreciation on an asset is restricted to the base value of the asset purchased from an associate, being the lower of: the price the seller originally paid for the asset (or, if applicable, the market value of the asset at the time the associated seller was first entitled to depreciate the asset) the price paid by the buyer. This applies unless we give written approval to use the price paid by the buyer. To grant approval, we must consider such treatment is appropriate in the circumstances. Restrictions on the depreciation rate The depreciation rate that may be applied to an asset acquired from an associate cannot be higher than the depreciation rate applied to the asset by that associated seller. If a different depreciation method is used, the restriction applies so the depreciation rate used must not exceed a rate equivalent to that used by the associate. This restriction does not apply if: the value being used for the transfer is gross income to the associated seller, other than under the provisions for depreciation recovered the asset is intangible with a fixed life. The depreciation rate for such intangible assets is calculated using a formula that spreads the cost of the fixed-life intangible asset evenly across its remaining life. The restrictions on the base value of an asset, and the depreciation rate that may be used with the asset, apply whether the asset is transferred directly or indirectly to an associate. Private assets becoming business assets If a private asset becomes a business asset, depreciation is first calculated on the market value of that asset when it was first used in the business (except in the case of buildings, which must always be depreciated on cost - see page 12). Whether or not the market value is GST-inclusive depends on whether you are registered for GST. However, if we ask, you must be able to provide documentation (for example, a valuation) showing how you arrived at the market value. Note Buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more have a depreciation rate of 0% from the 2011- 12 income year. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Disposals Selling and disposing of assets When you sell or dispose of an asset (other than a pooled asset) for a different amount from its adjusted tax value, you must make an adjustment in your end- of-year tax return to account for the loss or gain. If the asset has been used for both business and non-business purposes, you must apportion any loss or gain on disposal between business and non-business use. You cannot claim a deduction for depreciation in the year you dispose of an asset, except in the case of buildings. Costs incurred in selling an asset, such as commission and advertising, can be deducted from the sale price before you work out the loss or gain on sale. The adjustment is generally made in the year you sell or dispose of an asset, except when the disposal is because business has ceased. See page 28 for depreciation adjustments when a business ceases. Part 3 26 DEPRECIATION When a group of assets is sold for a lump sum it may sometimes be necessary to apportion the sale price between the various assets. If, for example, a group of assets that were sold included business and private assets or assets that do not depreciate, such as land, an apportionment would have to be made. We may sometimes ask for an independent valuation of assets if we decide the apportionment agreed to by the buyer and the seller is not acceptable. What constitutes a disposal The term "disposal" includes: an asset that is compulsorily acquired an asset taken out of New Zealand (other than only temporarily) changes in use or location of use of a business asset ceasing intangible asset rights an asset that is irreparably damaged - see page 28 any distribution of assets, including distributions of assets to the beneficial owners for no cost ceasing deemed ownership of a fixture or improvement - see page 15 an asset that is lost or stolen if that asset is not recovered in the income year when the loss or theft occurs - see page 28 an asset contributed to a partnership by a person. A disposal or sale of a depreciable asset triggers either a gain or loss on disposal. A gain on disposal or sale Where there's no election for an asset not to be a depreciable asset and the sale price received for the asset exceeds the adjusted tax value, the lesser of the following amounts must be included as gross income in that income year: the total depreciation that could have been deducted since the asset was purchased or first used in the business (this amount relates to the allowable depreciation deduction rather than the amount of depreciation actually deducted), or the amount by which the sale price received exceeds the adjusted tax value. Note For any asset owned prior to the 1994 income year, only the actual amount of depreciation claimed prior to the 1994 income year needs to be taken into account. You still need to work out the amount of depreciation that could have been claimed from the 1994 income year until date of sale. A loss on disposal or sale When you sell or dispose of an asset for less than its adjusted tax value, the difference between this consideration and the adjusted tax value is allowed as a deduction. If an asset is sold for less than its market value we can fix the sale price as the market value of the asset. This may happen if you sold an asset to someone close to you or your business, for example, a relative or a shareholder of the company. In this situation, the actual sale price may be ignored and the calculations made as if the asset was sold for its market value. The exception to this is when you dispose of pooled assets. For the treatment of pooled assets - see Disposing of pooled assets on page 27. Note A deduction for loss on disposal does not apply to buildings, unless due to an event the building has been damaged or affected by its surroundings rendering it useless for the purposes of deriving income. See pages 12 and 37. Disposing of intangible assets You must calculate a loss or gain when disposing of a depreciable intangible asset. This will include calculating loss or gain from disposing of any franchise rights that are depreciable - see page 18. A disposal of an intangible asset must fall within one of the following two circumstances: any event which means that the owner can no longer apply, at any time, the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset, or any event that causes the asset to be irreparably damaged. A disposal of an intangible asset does not include disposing of that asset as part of an arrangement to replace it with an asset of the same type. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 27 Where a depreciable intangible asset is considered worthless it's unlikely ceasing to use that intangible asset could be seen as a disposal. A disposal of such an asset must fall within one of the following circumstances: any event which means the owner can no longer apply, at any time, the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset any event that causes the asset to be irreparably damaged any event which means the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset are moved overseas. Although worthless, you still have the legal right to use the intangible assets, and they have probably not been irreparably damaged - it's just the value of those assets that has diminished. The write-off provisions could apply to intangible assets. We need to be satisfied: the intangible asset will no longer be used, and is not intended to be used the costs (for example, legal) of disposal would exceed the consideration received (the intangible asset is worthless) no one else could use it (or would want to use it) perhaps due to unmarketability through the liability of defects. We explain write-offs on page 35. Patents Where a patent is sold, the proceeds from the sale are taxable on the net amount after cost. Generally, a corresponding adjustment has been allowed for the total costs of the patent rights (at least those acquired on or after 1 April 1993). As a depreciation allowance has been available for patents since 1 April 1993, there is the potential for a double deduction. So, in calculating the profit or loss on sale of a patent, the cost of the patent is reduced by depreciation deductions that have been allowed. This restricts any deduction for loss on sale to the adjusted tax value. If a patent application is sold while the patent is pending, so that the patent is granted to a person other than the person who filed the application, the legal life for the new owner is reduced by the number of months between when the patent application was lodged and when it was sold to the new owner. Making arrangements between associated persons - intangible assets An intangible asset that wasn't depreciable to the seller remains non-depreciable to the associate, even though assets of the same type have become depreciable since the seller acquired that asset. The provision prevents an intangible asset being transferred to an associate to bring it within the depreciation rules and applies to intangible assets transferred on or after 1 July 1997. Disposing of pooled assets When you dispose of pooled assets, the sale price must be deducted from the adjusted tax value of the pool before calculating depreciation for the year. If the asset is discarded or lost, the adjusted tax value of the pool is not reduced. Where the sale price is greater than the adjusted tax value of the pool, the difference is treated as depreciation recovered and is taxable income. The adjusted tax value of the pool will then be nil and no further depreciation deductions will be allowed until new assets are added to the pool. Once assets are pooled, they're no longer treated as individual assets, so any capital gain made on the sale of any or all assets from the pool cannot be separated from depreciation recovered. The entire proceeds of any sale of pooled assets must be accounted for and any gains are taxable income. When all the assets in a pool are sold and the sale proceeds are less than the pool's adjusted tax value, the balance is deductible. Special rule for sale of assets previously held under the globo accounting method Please note from 12 December 1995 a limitation was placed on the amount of taxable income derived from selling assets in a pool that consists only of assets previously depreciated under the globo accounting method (this method could only be used before 1 April 1993). If this applies to you please see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 9 (February 1996) for a fuller explanation of how gains are to be treated. Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Part 3 28 DEPRECIATION Ceasing business or now using the asset for non- business purposes If you cease business and do not sell your business assets immediately or if they're kept for private use, the loss or gain must be accounted for using the market value of the assets as at the beginning of the next income year. You'll have to make an adjustment in your income tax return for the year after the business ceased or the asset changed use, even if the loss or gain is not realised until a later income year. Using a pooled asset privately When an asset is no longer used solely for business purposes after it's been pooled, it must be isolated from the pool. Example Andy has an asset pool with an adjusted tax value of $18,000 at 1 April 2009. The pool includes an asset that Andy is now using for private purposes. He uses it privately for 20% of the time which started on 5 December 2009. The market value of the asset on 5 December 2009 was $1,500. The pool depreciation rate is 22%. Step 1 Pool adjusted tax value (beginning of 2010 income year) $ 18,000 Value at end of 2010 income year ($18,000 less deemed sale at $1,500) + $ 16,500 $ 34,500 Average pool value (divide $34,500 by 2) $ 17,250 Depreciation on the pool at 22% for the year will be: $ 3,795 Step 2 Calculate depreciation on ex-pool assets (market value $1,500) $1,500 x 22% x 4/12\* months = $ 110 (\*December 2009 to March 2010) Total depreciation $ 110 less 20% personal use $ 22 Deductible depreciation $ 88 Deductible depreciation for the 2010 income year is $3,883 ($88 plus $3,795). At the time the asset is first used privately, it will be treated for depreciation purposes as though the business bought and sold it for the market value. Damaged assets You must take into account any insurance proceeds, indemnity damages or compensation payments you receive when an asset is damaged. If such payments exceed the cost of repairing the damaged asset, the surplus is not a capital receipt but must be deducted from the adjusted tax value of the asset for depreciation purposes. If the result is a negative amount, that amount is considered to be gross income in that year. Irreparably damaged assets are considered to be disposed of for a consideration of the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnity payment or other consideration received in relation to that event or damage. A full deduction is allowed for disposal costs, including demolition costs. Lost or stolen assets The loss or theft of a depreciable asset constitutes a disposal if the asset is not recovered in the income year in which the loss or theft occurs. Any insurance proceeds, indemnity payment or other consideration received in relation to the loss or theft of the depreciable asset is taken to be consideration received, minus disposal costs (where applicable), for the disposal of that asset. This consideration for the disposal will then be used in calculating the gain or loss on disposal of the asset. If the lost or stolen asset is recovered in a subsequent income year, and is still owned and used or available for use in deriving income, the following assumptions apply. You're considered to derive gross income equal to any loss on sale deduction allowed in the previous year. The gross income will be considered to be derived either in the year of disposal or of recovery. You're considered to have acquired the recovered asset on the date it was retrieved at the adjusted tax value that applied at the beginning of the year of loss or theft. Note If you're registered for GST, do not include the GST component of these payments in your calculation - account for it in your GST return. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 29 Transferring assets under a relationship agreement Depreciable assets transferred under a relationship agreement are transferred at the adjusted tax value and the person acquiring the assets, provided they use them for business purposes, is allowed the deductions that would have been allowed had the transfer not taken place. Example Colin and Jennifer Day separate and they agree to enter into a relationship agreement. Colin will transfer half the business assets to Jennifer. The general rule is that depreciable assets are transferred: at adjusted tax value at the beginning of the year of transfer at cost price for assets acquired in the year of transfer. As a result, no depreciation gain or loss arises to the transferor (Colin). The transferee (Jennifer) can continue to depreciate the remaining adjusted tax value of the assets. However, if she sells, Jennifer is considered to have claimed the depreciation deductions claimed by Colin and will be required to account for any excess of sale proceeds above the transfer value (up to the cost of the asset to Colin) as depreciation recovered. In relation to buildings, Jennifer's depreciation claim is based on the cost of the building to Colin. He is considered to have disposed of the building at adjusted tax value. Transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies Companies that are 100% commonly owned and choose to enter the consolidated system can transfer assets within their group at the assets' adjusted tax value. When wholly owned companies amalgamate, they're treated as one company and all assets, liabilities, property, rights, powers and privileges of the amalgamating companies are held in the new amalgamated company. This means there is no depreciation recovered when assets are transferred on a qualifying amalgamation. Wholly owned companies that do not form a consolidated group are required to transfer assets at market value and recover or claim a loss of depreciation, as applicable. The vendor company is required to calculate depreciation recovered or a loss on disposal: on actual sale price, or on market value, when the asset has been disposed of for a consideration that is not market value, but we consider the market value is greater than the sale price and consider it to be the more appropriate value for the asset. The purchasing company should value the asset at the cost incurred, or the value we consider the seller to have disposed of that asset, to calculate the depreciation claimed. Council-controlled organisations Council-controlled organisations are established by local government legislation to operate as trading enterprises liable for tax and so are competitively neutral. When a council-controlled organisation is set up, assets transferred to it from a local authority should be transferred for tax purposes at either their: adjusted tax value true market value. Part 3 30 DEPRECIATION Regardless of which value is adopted: a local authority must make an actual sale of assets to a council-controlled organisation full consideration for the sale must pass between the parties there must be complete and detailed documentation providing evidence of the transaction (including listing individual asset values). Our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 2 (August 1991) has a full policy statement on how to value assets that are transferred from local authorities to council-controlled organisations (previously known as LATEs). To read the Tax Information Bulletin go to ird.govt.nz/tib Determinations Inland Revenue must follow a formal procedure to set new depreciation rates or create new categories for assets and industries. This is known as "issuing a determination" and the general rates listed in our IR265 and the IR267 guides are the result of determinations issued by us. The determination process is also used for setting depreciation rates following applications from taxpayers. You can apply for a determination of depreciation rate if, for example, you find there is no general depreciation rate for your asset. You can also apply to us for a new rate if you believe the relevant existing general depreciation rate shouldn't apply to your asset. There are three different types of determinations that you can apply for, depending on your circumstances: a special depreciation rate a provisional depreciation rate a higher maximum pooling value. How rates are calculated The formula below is used for calculating a DV depreciation rate for an asset. 1 - (( residual value ) 1 ) cost n n =the estimated useful life of the asset. Estimated useful life The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which the asset might reasonably be expected to be useful in earning income in New Zealand. This period of time is calculated taking into account factors such as likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion and obsolescence. Normal and reasonable maintenance over the expected life of the asset is also taken into account. The fact an asset may have been previously used for a purpose other than deriving income (for example, private use) or carrying on a business overseas will not reduce its estimated useful life. The estimate of useful life must take into account the length of time the asset is used by all business owners in New Zealand (ie, first owner plus second owner and so on). Example Grant, an owner-driver, buys a new truck every five years and sells his old one. He expects the New Zealand business that buys each truck from him will use it for another five years and then scrap it. If this is the typical useful lifespan of trucks, the estimated useful life is 10 years. We use valuation consultants' advice when determining the estimated useful life for each asset class. The estimated useful life is determined after averaging the usage of various businesses. The estimated useful life is listed with the depreciation rates in our IR265 guide. You can view our depreciation rates finder or the IR265 at ird.govt.nz/rate-finder Residual value The residual value of an asset is the greater of: 13.5% of the original cost an estimate of the asset's market value (GST-exclusive) at the end of its estimated useful life. This must be a reasonable estimate made at the time of purchase. In estimating the residual value it must be assumed normal and reasonable maintenance is carried out on the asset during its use. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 31 Once the rates are calculated they're rounded up or down to the nearest rate. The full range of general DV and SL rates are shown below: 1994 to 2005 rates For assets you acquired on or after 1 April 1993, and before the end of the 1995 income year, you can use the general rates listed in table 1 or the historic rates listed in part 1 of the IR267 guide plus 25% interim loading and any shift allowances. For assets acquired from the 1996 income year to the end of the 2005 income year (or before 19 May 2005 for buildings), use the general rates listed in table 1. For new assets, including those never used or held for use in New Zealand, and imported secondhand goods (but excluding buildings or used imported cars) depreciation is calculated using the general rate plus 20% loading. The general rates listed in table 1 can also be found in parts 2 and 3 of the IR267 guide at ird.govt.nz Table 1 General DV rate with 20% loading General SL rate with 20% loading 22.41.51.8 44.833.6 67.244.8 7.595.56.6 9.511.46.57.8 1214.489.6 15181012 1821.612.515 2226.415.518.6 2631.21821.6 3339.62428.8 40483036 50604048 63.576.263.576.2 100100100100 2006 and future years For assets acquired from the 2006 income year (or buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005) use the general rates listed in table 2. For new assets (including those never used or held for use in New Zealand) and imported secondhand goods, but excluding buildings or used imported cars, depreciation is calculated using the general DV or SL rates plus 20% loading. The general rates listed in table 2 can be found in parts 1 and 2 of our IR265 guide at ird.govt.nz Table 2 General DV rate with 20% loading General SL rate with 20% loading 22.41.51.8 44.833.6 67.244.8 89.667.2 101278.4 1315.68.510.2 1619.210.512.6 202413.516.2 253017.521 30362125.2 40483036 50604048 6780.46780.4 100100100100 Note The 20% loading has been removed from 21 May 2010, so for any assets acquired on or after this date, use only the general DV or SL rates in table 2. Note From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Part 3 32 DEPRECIATION Disputable decisions Sometimes you may not agree with some of our decisions, for example: a determination setting a special rate a decision not to set a special rate revoking a special rate a determination setting a provisional rate a decision not to set a provisional rate. If you want to challenge any of these decisions, see our factsheet If you disagree with an assessment - IR778. Special depreciation rates We've calculated the general depreciation rates by using the formula given on page 30. We've considered the way assets are normally used, to arrive at the values used in the formula. For example, where it's usual to operate a piece of machinery in two or three shifts a day, the general depreciation rate we've set will reflect this heavier usage. If you believe the general depreciation rate we've set is not appropriate for your asset because, for example, you use your machine in an unusually heavy or light manner, or it will be operated in corrosive conditions, you may apply for a special depreciation rate. As we set a special rate because of individual circumstances, it can only be set for a specific taxpayer's asset or class of assets. Once set, it can only be used by the taxpayer who made the application. Note After 20 May 2010 you can no longer apply for a special depreciation rate on buildings. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Your application for a special depreciation rate must be supported by evidence of how your unique circumstances will affect the life of your asset. If we agree you should have a special depreciation rate, the formula set out on page 30 will be used to calculate the rate. To qualify for a special rate, the rate you've calculated must be halfway or more to the next rate on the general rates table, either higher or lower. Example A personal computer purchased after 1 April 2005 has a general DV rate of 50%. The next higher general rate is 67%. The calculation must result in a rate of 58.5% or higher to qualify for a higher rate, or 45% or lower to qualify for a lower rate to be set since the next lower general rate is 40%. When considering a special rate, we'll take into account any factors relevant in determining estimated useful life. You can download and complete an Application for a special depreciation rate - IR260B from ird.govt.nz/ir260b Send your completed application to: Technical Lead Legal Services - Technical Standards Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 How we set a special rate If we agree a special depreciation rate should be set, we follow three steps. They are: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing the determination. The process, from the time the application is received to the time the determination is issued, must be completed within six months, unless you agree to an extension of time. Draft determination Once we've considered your application, and agree a special depreciation rate should be set, we'll send you a draft determination along with a letter setting out the special depreciation rate we recommend. If this rate is different from the rate you requested, we'll also set out the reasons why we chose this rate. Conference At this point you may request a conference to discuss the determination. There is a time limit for requesting a conference, which will be at least 10 working days from the date we send the draft determination to you. Full details of the time limit will appear with the draft. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 33 If it's decided not to hold a conference, we'll finalise the determination. If it's decided to hold a conference, we'll set a date, time and place. We'll give you at least 20 working days' notice of the conference date. Issuing the determination The final step in the process is to issue the determination. Hopefully, due to the consultation following the draft determination or if a conference is held, both parties will have agreed on the rate to be set. If, however, you do not agree with the rate in the determination, you may dispute that decision. For more information, see our guide Disputing an assessment - IR776. Declining an application We'll turn down your application for a special rate if: your rate is too close to the general rate - see page 31 the general rate is under review you haven't supplied enough information. If we turn down your application or set a rate you do not agree with, you're entitled to dispute this decision - see page 32. Fees Application fee If you're applying for a special rate there's a fee of $150 plus GST, payable with your application. Processing fee There is a processing fee of $75 plus GST for each hour (or part-hour) after the first two hours for work by Inland Revenue. Consultant's fee If we engage a consultant to advise on the estimated useful life or estimated residual value of the asset, we'll charge you the consultant's fees plus GST. If you request a conference and a consultant paid by us attends the conference, or if you ask our consultant to carry out further work, we'll also charge you for the consultant's fee plus GST. If you request a conference we'll advise you of the likely fees before engaging a consultant so you can decide whether you want to continue with the application. Before we engage a consultant we'll take into account the information you've provided with your application. We will not seek a consultant's advice if you've already provided us with enough information to work out an appropriate rate. We'll send you an account for all fees you have incurred. The costs incurred can be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes and you can claim the GST part of the cost as a credit, if you're registered for GST. Withdrawing applications You can withdraw your application at any time. If you wish to do this, please let us know in writing as soon as possible because you'll have to pay fees incurred in processing your application, including any consultant's fees, up to the day we receive notice of your withdrawal. Revoking a special rate If we've approved your application for a special rate and your circumstances change so your asset no longer qualifies, we may either: revoke the determination, in which case you must use the general rate applying to the asset, or revoke the determination and issue a new one setting a new special rate. If this happens we'll let you know. The special rate we have already issued will lapse the day after you've been notified. Provisional depreciation rates You should apply for a provisional depreciation rate if you consider the asset classes for the general rates (excluding the default asset class in each category) do not appropriately cover the assets in a category. This could happen, for example, when an asset is newly invented or imported into New Zealand for the first time and we haven't listed the asset class under the general asset category. Part 3 34 DEPRECIATION To apply for a provisional rate, fill in an Application for a provisional depreciation rate - IR260A form. There are no application fees for a provisional rate. However, we'll charge you a fee if we: decline to issue a provisional rate determination or issue an unfavourable determination and you ask our consultant to carry out further work that does not result in a determination favourable to you. The fee for the further work done, or time attending a conference will include GST. When a provisional rate is set, it will usually apply to all businesses that own and use that class of asset and we do not have sufficient information at the time to set a general rate. However, in some cases it may be appropriate for a provisional rate to be set for a specific taxpayer or class of taxpayers owning that type of asset, for example, where the asset is unique to a specific taxpayer or taxpayer group. Provisional rates (other than taxpayer specific rates) are published in our Tax Information Bulletin and on our website at ird.govt.nz/depreciation When a general rate is subsequently set for a class of asset, the provisional rate will lapse. Calculating a provisional rate Unless the determination provides otherwise, once a provisional rate is set, it's available to all owners of the particular class of asset. So, the basis of the calculation must relate to the typical asset within the class of assets and typical use within an industry. It's important the information you supply with your application is representative for normal use of the asset within your industry. We take into account the rate of depreciation you and other industry members use in your financial reporting when setting a provisional rate. We calculate a provisional or special rate using the formula explained on page 30, or the SL method. The answer is then rounded up or down to the nearest SL or DV rate. How a provisional rate is set As with general and special rates, provisional rates are set by us issuing a determination. There are three main stages: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing a determination. This three-stage process must be completed within six months from the time we receive your application, unless you agree to an extension of time. These stages are explained in more detail on page 32. We'll turn down an application for a provisional rate if: a general rate for the asset already exists we're in the process of setting a general rate you haven't supplied enough information. If we turn down your application or set a rate you do not agree with, you're entitled to dispute the determination - see page 32. When we've set a provisional rate (other than a taxpayer specific rate) we'll notify the making of the determination and publish the determination in our Tax Information Bulletin and on our website at ird.govt.nz Higher maximum pooling values The aim of the pooling method of depreciation is to reduce compliance costs by calculating depreciation on low-value assets collectively, rather than individually. The maximum pooling value is $5,000. This means you can only pool assets that individually have an adjusted tax value of $5,000 or less. However, you may wish to apply for a higher maximum pooling value. You can do this by completing an Application for a higher maximum pooling value - IR719 form. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 35 Factors we take into account When deciding whether to set a higher maximum pooling value we consider the following three factors. Whether the assets you wish to include under a higher maximum pooling value are relatively similar in nature. Whether you'll make savings in compliance costs, such as clerical, computing and overhead costs, by having a higher maximum pooling value. You should show these in your application. How often you buy and sell the assets for which you want a higher maximum pooling value. How a higher maximum is set There are three stages to issuing a determination to set a higher maximum pooling value. These are: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing a determination. These stages are explained on page 32. Fees If you're applying for a higher maximum pooling value there is an application fee of $150 plus GST. We charge a processing fee of $75, plus GST, for each hour (or part-hour) after the first two hours for work by Inland Revenue. If we hire a consultant to advise on the estimated useful life or estimated residual value of an asset, we'll charge you for the consultant's fees plus GST. We'll also charge you for the consultant's fee plus GST if you request a conference and a consultant paid by us attends, or if you ask our consultant to carry out further work that does not result in a determination favourable to you. We'll send you an account for all fees you've incurred. The account will show the fee, the GST and the total unless we state otherwise. The costs incurred can be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes and if you're registered for GST you can claim the GST part of the cost as a credit. You can withdraw your application at any time - see page 33. Deductions for assets you no longer use This section relates to assets that are no longer used but haven't been physically disposed of. For example, if a business discards machinery because it's outdated and unsafe, but does not sell, assign or transfer it, the machinery hasn't been disposed of. If the cost of disposing of an asset you no longer use would be greater than the proceeds from its sale, you may claim the adjusted tax value as a deduction. If the scrap value of the machinery in the above example is greater than the costs of disposing of that machinery, a write-off will not apply. In such cases the machinery would need to be disposed of to claim a deduction. Dumping off site constitutes a disposal. These rules do not apply to buildings and pooled assets. See page 26 for more help on how to account for losses and gains on sale or disposal of assets. Conditions for a deduction To write off the adjusted tax value of an asset, you must meet the following conditions. You no longer use the asset in business or in producing income. Neither you nor an associate intend to use the asset in the future to derive gross income or in future business. It's uneconomic to dispose of the asset.

Asset is the unit to be depreciated. For depreciation purposes it must not be subdivided into its separate components. Associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007 (sub-part YB) sets out rules that define when two persons are associated. These rules are categorised as tests of association as follows: two companies a company and a person other than a company two relatives a person and a trustee for a relative a trustee and a beneficiary trustees with a common settlor a trustee and a settlor a settlor and a beneficiary a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee a partnership and a partner two persons who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test). Base value means: the cost of an asset acquired after the beginning of the 1994 income year, or the adjusted tax value at the end of the 1993 income year if it's acquired before this date, or the market value at the time the asset is taken from private to business use, if this is after the beginning of the 1994 income year. This market value rule does not apply to buildings or schedule depreciable assets - see page 39. Depreciable intangible assets are intangible assets acquired or created on or after 1 April 1993 and listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and have a finite useful life. Depreciable assets are assets that might reasonably be expected, in normal circumstances, to decline in value while used or available for use: in deriving gross income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Glossary The term "depreciable assets" refers to all depreciable assets regardless of their acquisition date, and it includes assets acquired in the 1993 and earlier income years. Disposal occurs where a depreciable asset is sold or disposed of for a consideration. Event is a natural disaster such as an earthquake or flood resulting in the building being demolished or abandoned and later demolished. The damage to either the building or to the neighbourhood of the building has rendered the building useless for the purposes of deriving income, and is not due to the action or failure to act of the person, their agent, or an associate. You can find out more in our Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 8 (October 2011), page 66, "Losses on buildings". Excluded depreciable assets are any assets purchased before 1 April 1993 and any of the following circumstances apply. The assets were used or available for use by the taxpayer in New Zealand, other than as trading stock, before 1 April 1993. Before 16 December 1991, the taxpayer entered into a binding contract to purchase the assets or have them constructed. They are or have been qualifying assets for a person or are or have been a qualifying improvement for the person. They are intangible assets used or available for use by the taxpayer before 1 April 1993. Excluded depreciable assets do not include assets in existence at the end of the 1993 income year that were accounted for using the standard value, replacement value or annual revaluation method. Fixed-life depreciable assets are any intangible assets that: are depreciable intangible assets, and have a legal life which could reasonably be expected, on the date of creation or acquisition of those assets, to be the same length as the assets' remaining estimated useful life. Income year for depreciation purposes, includes any corresponding non-standard accounting year. 38 DEPRECIATION Intangible assets are assets with a finite life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of their creation or acquisition. Legal life is defined for any intangible asset and means the number of years and any monthly fraction the asset may remain or continue to remain in existence by virtue of the contract or statute that creates the asset for the owner. It assumes the owner will exercise any rights of renewal or extension that are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of predetermined fees. Poolable assets are assets with a similar base value you can group for depreciation purposes, with a maximum value of $5,000 per asset. Schedule depreciable assets are petroleum drilling rigs, support vessels for offshore petroleum drilling rigs and support vessels for offshore petroleum production platforms. Because of the special nature of these assets, the depreciation calculation is made on a daily rather than a monthly basis. In addition, the base value for schedule depreciable assets acquired by a taxpayer from an associated person is the lower of the cost of the asset to the taxpayer or the aggregate of: the cost of the asset to: –the associated person who didn't acquire the asset from either the taxpayer or another associated person, or –the taxpayer or an associated person who owned the asset at the beginning of an unbroken chain of ownership, and all expenditure (excluding any expenditure allowed as depreciation allowances) incurred for the asset by the taxpayer and any associated persons before the date the taxpayer acquired the asset. The cost is determined as exclusive of any expenditure allowed as depreciation allowances. No adjustment is made on disposition or exit from the tax base for a schedule depreciable asset. ird.govt.nz 39
Depreciation - a guide for businesses IR260 April 2023 2 DEPRECIATION New Zealand allowed depreciation on all buildings until 2010. From the 2011-2012 income year depreciation was removed for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Legislative changes enacted on 25 March 2020, as part of a wider economic recovery package in response to COVID-19, reintroduces building depreciation but only for non-residential buildings (those that are not primarily used for residential accommodation). Non-residential building Non-residential building is defined as a building that is not a residential building. A residential building is defined as a dwelling; and includes a building intended to ordinarily provide accommodation for periods of less than 28 days at a time, if the building, together with other buildings on the same land, has less than 4 units for separate accommodation. The second part of the definition includes some buildings accommodating short-term stays to ensure there is certainty that the definition of “residential building” includes buildings such as a bach that the owner uses but also rents out on a short-term basis, and also buildings used exclusively for some short- term accommodation provided by owners such as Airbnb properties. These may be within the definition of “dwelling”, but this would put it beyond doubt those buildings remain non-depreciable. The less-than four units provision is meant to exclude larger commercial operations such as motels from being treated as a residential building. Effective date Depreciation for non-residential buildings has been reintroduced effective from the 2020-21 income year. Depreciation rate The depreciation rate for non-residential buildings is 2% diminishing value or 1.5% straight-line. Opening tax book value The opening tax book value for the beginning of the 2020-21 income year: for buildings that were owned by the taxpayer in the 2010–11 income year, will be: –the adjusted tax book value at the end of the 2010–11 income year, less fit-out deductions taken under the section DB 65 transitional rule if applicable; plus –non-deductible capital expenditure incurred with respect to the building from the end of the 2010–11 income year to the start of the 2020–21 income year. for buildings acquired after the end of the 2010–11 income year, will be: –the cost of the building; plus –non-deductible capital expenditure incurred with respect to the building from the time it was acquired until the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. Straight-line depreciation If a taxpayer elects to use the straight-line method, the building’s cost for the purpose of calculating the depreciation deduction would be the original cost price. The amount of depreciation is then deducted from the opening tax book value (not original cost) for the 2020–21 and subsequent income years. Repeal of the 2010 transitional rule As a result of reinstating depreciation on non- residential buildings, the transitional building fit-out rule introduced as part of the 2010 reforms is no longer required. Section DB 65 has been repealed, and the tax book value of the building will be adjusted for past DB 65 deductions. Special depreciation rate The ability to receive a special depreciation rate from the Commissioner has been restored for non- residential buildings.

Introduction This guide explains how to claim depreciation on your business assets. You're required to claim depreciation when you acquire an asset for your business and account for it when you dispose of that asset. We recommend you consult a tax agent when considering claiming for depreciation. However, it's still your responsibility to be aware of your tax obligations. Find the current depreciation rates by: using our Depreciation rate finder checking our General depreciation rates - IR265 guide. You'll find both of these at ird.govt.nz The rates are set out in two categories - industry and asset.

Note In legal terms, depreciable intangible assets, depreciable assets, excluded depreciable assets, fixed-life depreciable assets and intangible assets are known as "property". In this guide we refer to them as assets to avoid confusion, because the term "property" more commonly relates to land and buildings. 4 DEPRECIATION Contents COVID-19 - Depreciation changes for non-residential buildings 2 Non-residential building 2 Effective date 2 Depreciation rate 2 Opening tax book value 2 Straight-line depreciation 2 Repeal of the 2010 transitional rule 2 Special depreciation rate 2 Introduction 3 ird.govt.nz 3 How to get our forms and guides 3 How to use this guide 3 Part 1 - Overview 5 Main features of depreciation law 5 Compulsory depreciation claims 6 Electing not to depreciate 6 How to make an election not to depreciate 7 Assets that do not depreciate 7 Who can claim depreciation? 7 Cost of assets for depreciation purposes 8 GST and depreciation 8 Records 9 Individual or pooled assets 9 Diminishing value (DV) method 9 Straight line (SL) method 9 Changing methods 9 Pooling method 9 Rates 11 Part 2 - Detailed information on certain assets 12 Buildings 12 Resource consents 13 Land 13 Leased assets 15 Renting out a residential property 16 Holiday homes 16 Intangible assets 16 Computer software 20 Reservation of title clause (also known as Romalpa clause) 21 Low Value Assets (including loose tools) 22 Newly acquired assets 23 Private use of business assets 23 Part 3 - Adjustments and disposals 23 Transferring depreciable assets between associated persons 25 Private assets becoming business assets 25 Disposals 25 Transferring assets under a relationship agreement 29 Transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies 29 Council-controlled organisations 29 Determinations 30 1994 to 2005 rates 31 2006 and future years 31 Disputable decisions 32 Special depreciation rates 32 How we set a special rate 32 Provisional depreciation rates 33 Higher maximum pooling values 34 Deductions for assets you no longer use 35 Part 4 - Services you may need 36 Need to speak with us? 36 Supporting businesses in our community 36 0800 self-service number 36 Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) 36 Privacy 36 If you have a complaint about our service 36 Glossary 37 Part 1 ird.govt.nz 5 Part 1 - Overview Depreciation allows a deduction for capital expenditure, where a deduction wouldn't normally apply and acknowledges that the asset will eventually wear out or become outdated. For tax purposes, the reduced value of an asset is recognised by allowing a deduction against income for the depreciation of that asset from the time it is used in a business until it is sold, disposed of or discarded. This means the cost of the asset will be written off over its useful life. Once the whole cost price of the asset has been written off, no further deduction is allowed. When you calculate your depreciation deduction it's important to remember: the date you acquired the asset, since this determines which rates are available to you which industry and/or asset category best describes your depreciable asset. Main features of depreciation law From the 1994 income year, depreciation law relates to all depreciable assets regardless of the date you acquired them. You must make depreciation deductions each year, unless you make an election not to treat a particular asset as depreciable. You can only claim a depreciation deduction once you own the asset and it's used or available for use in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Depreciation is calculated according to the number of months in an income year you own and use the asset. A daily basis applies to certain assets used in the petroleum industry. From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non-residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. You may not claim depreciation in the year you dispose of any asset, unless it's a building. Although the general depreciation rates are set by a formula, you can apply for a higher or lower special depreciation rate if you can establish the general rate is unsuitable for your particular circumstances. Higher depreciation rates, previously available for assets used for multiple shifts, do not apply to assets acquired after 1 April 1993. Expenditure for repairs and maintenance can be claimed as a deduction through business accounts. Anything more than repairs or maintenance is capital expenditure and is not deductible, but will be subject to normal depreciation rules. In general terms the depreciation rate options available are as follows: 1. You must use the general rates set out in determinations we issue. For assets acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, use the rates listed in the IR265 guide. 2. For assets acquired between the 1996 income year and 31 March 2005 (or 18 May 2005 for buildings, including contracts of purchase entered into before 19 May 2005) use the rates listed in parts 2 and 3 of the IR267 guide. 3. For assets acquired on or after 1 April 1993, and before the end of the 1995 income year, you can use either the rates listed in parts 2 and 3 of the IR267 guide or the rates listed in part 1 of this guide plus 25% interim loading and any shift allowances. 4. Generally, for assets acquired before 1 April 1993 you must use the depreciation rates listed in part 1 of the IR267 guide. Both straight line and diminishing value methods are available for calculating depreciation on most assets and you can switch freely between the two. Assets that cost or have an adjusted tax value of $5,000 or less can be depreciated collectively, rather than individually, using the "pool" depreciation method (refer also next bullet for low value assets). Part 1 6 DEPRECIATION Generally low value assets can be written off in the year of purchase or creation based on the following thresholds. Up till 16 March 2020Up to $500 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021Up to $5,000 From 17 March 2021Up to $1,000 Certain intangible assets first used or available for use after 1 April 1993 have been brought into the depreciation system. Intangible assets with a fixed life must be depreciated using the straight line method. Gains on sale or disposal must be recognised in the year of sale. Losses on sales of depreciable assets, other than buildings, are deductible in the year of sale. There are restrictions on the depreciation deductions that can be made to depreciable assets transferred between associated parties. From 1 April 1997, only those companies that are 100% commonly owned and that choose to consolidate are able to transfer assets within their group at the assets' adjusted tax value. Wholly owned companies which do not form a consolidated group are required to transfer assets at market value and recover or claim a loss of depreciation as applicable. You may be able to write off the residual tax value of any depreciable asset that you no longer use to derive gross income. Some assets cannot be depreciated for income tax purposes either because they are specifically exempted (for example, land or trading stock) or they do not reduce in value over time (for example, Lotto franchise fees). A depreciation loading no longer applies for assets acquired after 20 May 2010. The loading will only apply to qualifying assets: –acquired on or before 20 May 2010, or –where a binding contract existed on or before 20 May 2010. Compulsory depreciation claims You must claim the amount of depreciation you are entitled to unless you elect an asset not to be depreciable property. It's usually not possible to defer or only partially claim allowable depreciation. If no depreciation deduction is claimed and no election is made, you're considered to have claimed depreciation for the purposes of calculating the adjusted tax value of the asset and when calculating the depreciation recovered (see "Disposals" on page 25). If you do not claim depreciation in your tax return, the adjusted tax value of the asset will still be reduced by the amount calculated using the appropriate method. The default method for calculating depreciation is diminishing value. For depreciation recovery purposes, where the depreciable asset is disposed of for more than the adjusted tax value, then the taxable income will be the lesser of: the previously allowed depreciation (including deemed to be allowed), or the amount by which the amount received exceeds the adjusted tax value. For assets purchased before the 1994 income year, and depending on the disposal amount, the depreciation recovered is the actual depreciation permitted under the old system (when the depreciation deduction was not compulsory) plus the allowable depreciation for the 1994 and subsequent income years. Taxpayers do not have to have claimed extra depreciation on excluded depreciable assets (generally, meaning assets purchased before 1 April 1993). This extra depreciation is allowed as either: a supplementary depreciation allowance, or a 25% interim loading. Electing not to depreciate Although it's compulsory for you to claim a depreciation deduction, we recognise there can be instances where you may not want to. If you do not want to claim depreciation on an asset, and you want to avoid paying tax on depreciation recovered when it was not claimed, you should elect not to treat the asset as depreciable. You cannot pick and choose the years in which you depreciate an asset. However, if an asset periodically will be and then will not be used in your business (such as a residential building that is temporarily let), you may choose whether or not to depreciate the asset in each period. Our Rental income - IR264 guide discusses this option in more detail. If you elect not to depreciate your asset, it will no longer be a depreciable asset and the depreciation recovery or loss on sale provisions will not apply to it. Part 1 ird.govt.nz 7 Note From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Who can claim depreciation? A depreciation deduction for a particular asset is only allowed once you own the asset and it's used or available for use in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Ownership You're considered to own an asset when: you acquire legal title (binding contract), or you take up beneficial ownership, which occurs when an asset passes by way of gift, bequest or distribution to a new owner. Where there is both an equitable owner and a legal owner of the same asset, depreciation may only be claimed by the owner who uses the asset or has that asset available for use in deriving their gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate their gross income. So, to claim a depreciation deduction for an asset, you must: own it, or lease it under a specified or finance lease (see page 15), or be buying it under a hire purchase agreement. Your asset must also be expected to reduce in value while it's used or is available for use in your business. Used or available for use The following are some examples of the criteria of "used" or "available for use". You cannot start claiming depreciation on any equipment purchased until your business commences. How to make an election not to depreciate You'll need to let us know if you're making an election by attaching your notification to your tax return for the income year that you: purchase the asset, or changed the asset use from non-business to business, or elect not to depreciate an asset that you've not claimed depreciation on in any previous year. This election will then apply to every year from when the asset was purchased. Your notification needs to provide the following details: a description of the asset the purchase date the income year the election is being made for whether the asset has been newly acquired or its use has changed if the election is for retrospective depreciation. Assets that do not depreciate Some assets do not depreciate for tax purposes. These assets include: those you've elected to treat as not depreciable trading stock land (except for buildings, fixture or land improvements as specified in schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007) financial arrangements under the accrual rules intangible assets, for example, goodwill (other than depreciable intangible assets of the type listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) low-value assets that are fully written off on acquisition Up till 16 March 2020Up to $500 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021Up to $5,000 From 17 March 2021Up to $1,000 an asset whose cost is allowed as a deduction under some other tax provision an asset that does not decline in economic value because of compensation for loss or damage an asset whose cost was or is allowed as a deduction in any income year to any other taxpayer under any of the special provisions relating to primary sector land improvements. Part 1 8 DEPRECIATION Example In April 2014, Enid purchases equipment in anticipation of setting up a home tutoring business but does not start the business until March 2015. The depreciation deduction for Enid's 2015 income year is restricted to one-twelfth of the yearly depreciation rate. Cargo ship in dry docks - conducting normal ongoing maintenance is an ordinary incidence of business and the ship would still be wholly used or available for use in carrying on the business. Plant and machinery finished and awaiting other plant - depending on the facts, if the completed plant and machinery were available for use in isolation or in another production line if required, the depreciation could be claimed. However, if a further machine or plant was required in order to produce a product, depreciation could not commence until that other necessary plant or machinery was available for use. Plant and machinery in storage - this depends on the degree and time of reconnection or installation required. If the item (for example, a transformer) were a back-up piece of equipment necessary to keep an operation going, it would be regarded as being available for use and would be depreciable. However, if a new piece of machinery or a new plant were being delivered and had yet to be installed (for example, being shipped in from offshore) there would be no entitlement to depreciation until the installation process was completed. Assets temporarily out of operation for repair or inspection are regarded as being available for use and can be depreciated. Cost of assets for depreciation purposes Generally, the cost of an asset is the amount paid by the purchaser - normally the market value - and this principle applies to associated persons. For further information on transfers between associated persons see page 25. If the property has been inherited, the cost price for depreciation purposes is its market value at the time the property is transferred to the new owner. The exception is for a spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner where transfer is at cost or adjusted tax value. For income tax purposes a deduction is not usually available for expenses incurred in acquiring a capital asset. This includes legal fees charged by a solicitor for preparing and registering the various documents relating to the purchase. From the 2010 income year business-related legal expenses for buying or selling a property can be deducted. This is provided your total legal expenses for the income year, including the fees associated with buying and selling a property, are equal to or less than $10,000. In all other cases, this type of expenditure may be added to the cost of the purchased asset when calculating depreciation on that asset. The depreciation you calculate each year is deducted from the value of your asset. The remaining value is called the asset's adjusted tax value. GST and depreciation If you're registered for GST (goods and services tax), you can generally claim a credit for the GST part of an asset's cost price. You calculate depreciation on the GST-exclusive price of the asset. If you are not registered for GST, you base your depreciation on the actual price you pay for an asset, including GST. Part 1 ird.govt.nz 9 Records As with all tax matters you must keep sufficient and accurate records. For depreciation purposes, your records must be able to substantiate your depreciation claims, purchases and sales of your business assets so, if we need to, we can check your deductions (including losses) and depreciation recovered. You must keep your records for at least seven years. Individual or pooled assets You can account for depreciation on your assets in two ways, as an individual asset or as part of a group or pool of assets. See "Pooling method" in the next column. If you choose to calculate depreciation on individual assets you can use either the diminishing value (DV) method of calculating depreciation or the straight line (SL) method. If you decide to group your assets into a pool you must use the DV method for calculating depreciation. Diminishing value (DV) method With this method depreciation is calculated each year by using a constant percentage of the asset's adjusted tax value. This method is sometimes also referred to as the written down value or tax book value. The DV method means your depreciation deduction will progressively reduce each year. Example Depreciation on office equipment that cost $10,000 was calculated using the DV depreciation rate of 33%. The depreciation is calculated as follows: Adjusted tax valueDepreciation of 33% Year 1 $10,000$3,300 Year 2 $6,700$2,211 Ye a r 3$4,489$1,481 Straight line (SL) method With this method an asset depreciates every year by the same amount, which is a percentage of its original cost price. This method is sometimes called the cost price basis. Example Depreciation on office equipment that cost $10,000 was calculated using the SL depreciation rate of 24%. The depreciation is calculated as follows: Adjusted tax valueDepreciation of 24% Year 1 $10,000$2,400 Year 2 $7,600$2,400 Ye a r 3$5,200$2,400 Changing methods You can choose to use either the SL or DV method for individual assets (except for pooled assets and fixed- life intangible assets) regardless of when you bought the assets. If you decide to change depreciation methods, use the current adjusted tax value to calculate depreciation and not the original cost price of the asset. Once you've filed your tax return you cannot change methods for that income year. Pooling method The pooling method allows you to group together (pool) a number of low-value assets and calculate depreciation on the pool. The advantage of pooling assets is the cost of compliance is reduced because all the assets in the pool are treated as one asset for the purposes of depreciation. The disadvantage of pooling assets is that if you sell an asset in a pool for more than its cost price, this capital gain amount must be included as taxable income. Main features of the pooling method Only diminishing value (DV) rates can be used for the pool method. Where items in the pool have different depreciation rates, the lowest rate is applied to the pool. Buildings cannot be depreciated using the pooling method. The maximum pooling value is generally $5,000 for each individual asset, but you may apply for a higher pooling value for specific assets - see page 34. For GST-registered people, the maximum pooling value excludes GST. Part 1 10 DEPRECIATION The maximum pooling value of $5,000 applies from the 2015-2016 income year. The maximum pooling value is $2,000 prior to this. All poolable assets must be used wholly in business (no private use), or be subject to FBT (fringe benefit tax). Once an asset is included in a pool it cannot be separated out later, except where the asset must be isolated because you now use it privately. There is no restriction on the depreciation recovered for a pooled asset. Any capital gains are taxed - see page 26. When all assets in a pool have been disposed of but the pool still has a positive value, ie, the proceeds of the sale are less than the pool value, this remaining value of the pool is deductible from your gross income. Calculating depreciation for an asset pool Assets can only be pooled if individual assets within the pool each have a value equal to or less than the maximum pooling value. This maximum is currently set at $5,000, so assets that can be pooled are those that: individually cost you $5,000 or less, or have depreciated and whose adjusted tax value has been reduced to $5,000 or less. Example Hiram bought a printing machine for $5,500 and calculated depreciation using the DV method. CostDepreciation 10% DV Adjusted tax value at the end of year $5,500$550$4,950 Hiram could include the printing machine in a pool of assets for the second year. If your assets meet this requirement, you may pool any number of them and you may have as many pools as suit your circumstances. You can also combine two or more pools to form one pool. Note The maximum pooling value of $5,000 applies from the 2015-2016 income year. The maximum pooling value is $2,000 prior to this. Depreciation is calculated on the average value of the pool for the income year, using the DV method. Work out the average value of the pool by adding together the pool's value at the beginning and end of the income year, before depreciation has been deducted, and then dividing by two. Example Adam has a pool of assets with an adjusted tax value at the beginning of the year of $18,000. During the year he purchases three assets for $5,000 each. At the end of the year, he decides to include them in the pool. The value of the pool at the end of the income year (before deducting depreciation) is $33,000. The average pool value is: $18,000 + $33,000 =$25,500 2 Adam is using the DV rate of 22%, so the depreciation deduction and the adjusted tax value of the pool will be calculated as follows: Value of pool at the end of income year 33,000 Less annual depreciation ($25,500 x 22%) -$5,610 Adjusted tax value of pool$27,390 Where your income year is longer or shorter than 12 months because of a change in balance date, you'll need to apportion the annual depreciation to the number of whole or part months in your income year. When the assets in the pool have different depreciation rates you must use the lowest rate. This could happen when different types of assets are included in a pool. Example Richard owns a shop and these are some of his assets that he could pool. Cash register 40% DV Electric sign 20% DV Fittings 20% DV Furniture 20% DV The rate for this pool would be 20% DV. In a case such as this, Richard may decide to pool only those assets with the 20% DV depreciation rate and account for depreciation on the cash register separately or as an asset in another pool. In the first year of pooling, it's very important to carefully consider the date from which you'll pool your assets, because it will have a significant effect on the average pool value used when calculating depreciation. Part 1 ird.govt.nz 11 If you decide to pool your assets part-way through an income year, the pool value at the beginning of the income year will be nil. The amount of depreciation you can claim will be based on half the pool value at the end of the income year. Example Anne starts a business on 15 May 2013 and purchases five assets for $2,000 each, which she pools. She has a 31 March balance date and uses a depreciation rate of 20% DV. Her 2014 depreciation deduction is calculated as follows: Calculate average pool value: Pool value at beginning of year (1 April 2013)nil Pool value at end of year (31 March 2014)$10,000 Divide by 2 to average$5,000 Calculate annual depreciation: $5,000 x 20% x 11 months = $916.66 depreciation 12 (The 11 months is 15 May 2013 to 31 March 2014.) Adding assets to a pool The adjusted tax value of an existing pool is increased by: the cost price of the asset (if it's newly acquired), or the adjusted tax value of the asset (if it was previously depreciated separately). If assets are added to the pool at the beginning of an income year, the pool values at both the beginning and end of the year will increase. If the assets are added to the pool part-way through the income year, only the pool value at the end of the year will increase. Rates Once you've decided on the method (or methods) you'll use to account for depreciation, you have to identify the correct rate for calculating the amount of the deduction. The correct depreciation rate to use depends on the date you acquired the asset. To find the depreciation rates for all depreciable assets acquired after 1 April 1993, use our depreciation rate finder at ird.govt.nz/depreciation For assets acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, use the rates listed in the IR265 guide. For all assets acquired before these dates refer to our IR267 guide. These guides are available on our website ird.govt.nz Loading Any asset purchased from 21 May 2010 onwards is not entitled to the 20% depreciation loading. If you entered into a contract to purchase an asset on or before 20 May 2010, you can still depreciate this asset with the loading. Any asset being depreciated at a rate with loading before 21 May 2010 can continue to be depreciated at that rate for that asset's lifetime. However, if there is a capital improvement to an asset with the 20% loading, this improvement will need to be depreciated separately from the original asset, and will be depreciated without the loading allowance. Provisional and special rates If we haven't set a general depreciation rate for your particular type of asset, you may apply for a provisional rate to be set - see page 33. General depreciation rates are based on the average use of an asset. If you believe you use your asset more heavily or less heavily than is generally the case, or the conditions in which the asset is used are abnormal, you may want to apply for a special rate - see page 32. How rates are calculated If you'd like to know how we work out the general rates for assets see page 30. Part 2 12 DEPRECIATION Buildings do not qualify for the increased loading of 25% on the historic rates or 20% on the general rates. Buildings are not eligible for the special deduction for assets you no longer use - see page 35. Generally, when a personal (non-business) asset is introduced into a business, the market value at that time is used to calculate depreciation. This rule does not apply to buildings, where the original cost (excluding land) must be used for calculating depreciation. Buildings transferred between companies where there is 100% common ownership or transfers under a relationship agreement can continue to use the depreciation rate applying to the building at the time of transfer. Depreciation claims on buildings acquired before the 1994 income year must be calculated using the SL method. However, you can choose between the SL and the DV methods to calculate depreciation for the 1994 and future income years on assets acquired before 1 April 1993. Depreciation on buildings is calculated on either the original cost or the adjusted tax value depending on which depreciation method you use. The first time you use the DV method you need to calculate the adjusted tax value of your building. The building's depreciation is calculated on this amount. To work out the adjusted tax value, deduct the amount of depreciation you've claimed since you bought the building, from the original cost of the building (excluding land). Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Sale of buildings When a building is sold for more than its adjusted tax value, the depreciation recovered is taxable income. The amount of depreciation recovered is the smaller of: the original cost price of the building minus the adjusted tax value the sale price minus the adjusted tax value. This ensures any capital profit made on the sale of a building is not included as taxable income. Losses made when selling or disposing of buildings are generally not deductible. This section provides further information on certain assets of particular interest. Buildings From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties, including leasehold property. If the type of building you own currently has an estimated useful life, as determined by Inland Revenue, of less than 50 years you can simply continue to claim depreciation deductions as you have previously. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Even though many buildings can no longer be depreciated, depreciation recovery will still apply for those buildings when they're sold for greater than their book value. This applies regardless of when the building was acquired. The chattels and fit-out of a building, where it does not form part of the building, can still be depreciated. Interpretation statement 10/01 "Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable property" sets out a three-step test that we apply to determine whether an item can be separated out or whether it's regarded as being part of the building. You can find this in our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). Further information on the treatment of commercial or industrial building fit-outs, "Clarifying that certain building fit-out is depreciable property", is available in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011). These special rules also apply to buildings. When disposing of a building a loss cannot be claimed as a deduction, except where due to an emergency event, eg, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, the building has been rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income and is demolished. See "Event" page 37. Buildings cannot be pooled. Depreciation on buildings, unlike other assets, can be claimed in the year of sale. Part 2 - Detailed information on certain assets Part 2 ird.govt.nz 13 Definition of a "building" The term "building" can have various meanings depending on the context in which the term is used. A building in ordinary circumstances is defined as: a structure of considerable size permanent in the sense that it's intended to last a considerable time enclosed by walls and a roof able to function independently of any other structure. However, a building is not necessarily a physically separate structure. Interpretation statement 22/04 “Claiming depreciation on buildings” steps through the depreciation rules that apply to buildings and explains how to distinguish between a residential building and a non-residential building. You can find this in the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 34, No 8, (September 2022). Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Resource consents The ability to depreciate expenditure on a resource consent depends on the type of expenditure, the type of consent and the resulting asset. Interpretation Statement IS 18/06, Income tax – Treatment of costs of resource consents, provides a full treatment of these issues and when expenditure on resource consents may be depreciable. You can download this statement from our website ird.govt.nz Land You cannot claim depreciation on land because land, generally, does not depreciate. When land and buildings are purchased and the price does not specify the cost of the buildings, the government valuation (at the time of purchase) may be used to calculate this cost: Value of improvements (buildings) × purchase price = cost of buildings Capital value (land and buildings) Land improvements Land improvements, however, may depreciate, and since 1 April 1993 there has been the provision for specific fixtures on the land (non-primary sector land) to be depreciated. These fixtures as listed in schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are: airport runways bores and wells bridges chimneys culverts dams fences hardstanding (for example, asphalt car park) pipes purpose-built surfaces for outdoor sports facilities reservoirs retaining walls roads spillways swimming pools tanks tunnels wharves. In the same manner as plant and machinery, these fixtures are depreciable at the general rates if made in the 1996 and later income years. They also qualify for the 20% loading if made in the 1996 income year and before 21 May 2010. Part 2 14 DEPRECIATION Expenditure on farm and forestry land and aquaculture improvements Although land is not a depreciable asset, there are provisions allowing you to progressively deduct expenditure incurred in preparing or otherwise developing land within the farming, agriculture, forestry and aquaculture industries. This differs from the depreciation of other land improvements. While depreciation is subject to the period the asset was used during the financial year, the deduction for the development expenditure is not time based. You can claim the full percentage of the deduction (plus any loading) even if the development expenditure occurs near the end of the financial year, provided the expenditure benefits the business in that income year. Deductions are allowed for losses on farm land improvements where an event has occurred either destroying or rendering the improvements useless for deriving income. When the land is sold there is no taxable recovery of any deductions allowed for the capitalised development expenditure. When the land is sold the undeducted balance of the development expenditure can be transferred to the new owner. The capitalised development expenditure effectively stays with the land, rather than with the person who incurred it. We recommend you consult a tax agent when considering this. Taxpayers involved in the primary sector may claim depreciation for assets listed in schedule 13. However, they may only do so when they cannot claim the expenditure under section DO 1 or DO 2 or schedule 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007. To read tax legislation online, go to legislation.govt.nz The following are some examples of the specific provisions applying to farming and agriculture (schedule 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007) for land improvements. Clearing land The expenditure incurred in clearing land is deductible in the year it was incurred. Cultivating land The expenditure incurred in cultivating land is deductible on a DV basis (similar to depreciation) at the rate of 5% each year. Expenditure incurred between 16 December 1991 and the end of the taxpayer's 1995 income year qualifies for a 25% loading, ie, 6.25%. Expenditure incurred in the 1996 or any subsequent income year (up until 1 April 2013) qualifies for a 20% loading, ie, 6%. Irrigation system and plant This is capital expenditure so normal depreciation rules apply. Installing tile drains This is deductible on a DV basis at the annual rate of 5% (plus any loading). This same rate would apply to the cost of replacing a tile drainage system. The fact that the retiling may be done over a period longer than one year does not affect the deduction that can be claimed. A loss cannot be claimed on the old system because it's scrapped, nor can a continued deduction be made for the old system since the asset is no longer of benefit to the business. Sinking a bore This is deductible on a DV basis at the rate of 5% (plus any loading) each year. Regrassing and fertilising Expenditure incurred in connection with significant capital activity, such as a change from one type of farming to another, is deductible on a DV basis at the rate of 45% each year. A 20% depreciation loading applied to farming and agriculture land improvements acquired before 1 April 2013. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 15 Leased assets For tax purposes there are four kinds of lease. The type of lease determines whether the lessor (owner) or the lessee (person paying to use the asset) is entitled to claim depreciation on the asset. Specified leases A specified lease is a lease agreement entered into between 6 August 1982 and 19 May 1999 that meets certain criteria. The lease is a specified lease if: it has a guaranteed residual value, or the lease term is more than 36 consecutive months (or, if we consider the economic life of the asset is less than 36 months, a term equal to the economic life of the lease asset), and –the lessee becomes the owner at the end of the term, or –the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at the end of the term at a price significantly lower than market value, or –the total of all payments and the guaranteed residual value is more than, or roughly equal to, the cost price, or –both parties agree the lessee is liable for the payment of all, or nearly all, maintenance and other incidental costs. Specified leases include: leases acquired by any means whatsoever, whether from the lessor or another person, and leases entered into between 28 October 1983 and 19 May 1999 (both dates inclusive) if a person other than the lessee acquires the asset and they are associated with the lessee. Finance leases A finance lease is an agreement entered into on or after 20 May 1999 under which: ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee (or an associate of the lessee) at the end of the term, or the lessee (or an associate of the lessee) has the option of acquiring the asset for an amount significantly lower than market value, or the lease term is more than 75% of the asset's estimated useful life (as determined under section EE63 of the Income Tax Act 2007). For income years including 20 June 2007 and later income years, the lease, or an arrangement of which the lease is part, must: involve the use of the lease asset outside New Zealand for all or most of the term of the lease, and involve income from the use of the asset by any person other than the lessor which is exempt, excluded or non-residents' foreign sourced income, and be an arrangement in which substantially all the risks and rewards that are incidental to ownership are incurred by persons other than the lessor and/ or it's a finance lease under NZIAS 17 either for the lessor or for another company in the same group of companies that derives assessable income from the arrangement. With both specified and finance leases, the lessor is treated as selling the asset to the lessee at the beginning of the lease. Therefore, the lessee is the owner and is entitled to the deduction for depreciation. Hire purchase A hire purchase agreement passing ownership to the person paying the hire purchase allows that person to claim any allowable depreciation. This provision overrides the general provision that limits the claim to the owner of the asset. Leasehold improvements A lessee is considered to own and be entitled to claim depreciation on the cost of leasehold fixtures or improvements incurred by that lessee, but under land law principles are technically owned by the lessor. When the lease expires, to calculate the loss on disposal, the lessee is considered to have disposed of the fixture or improvement. The lessor, including subsequent lessors, will not be able to depreciate such fixtures or improvements during the term of the lease. However, once the lease has expired, the lessor will be able to depreciate the fixtures and improvements if they have paid the lessee for these. This also applies when the lessee transfers the lease and the person the lease is transferred to pays the original lessee for the leasehold improvements. The same applies to licences to occupy. Part 2 16 DEPRECIATION Non-specified and operating leases If a lease was entered into between 6 August 1982 and 19 May 1999 and it is not a specified lease, it's known as a non-specified lease. If the lease was entered into on or after 20 May 1999 and it is not a finance lease, it's an operating lease. For these kinds of leases, the owner (lessor) of the lease asset claims the deduction for depreciation. Renting out a residential property You must claim depreciation on a house or flat you're renting out as a deduction from the rent you receive, unless you make an election for the asset not to be a depreciable asset. You must also claim depreciation on any contents in the house or flat being used or available for use by the tenants, unless you elect otherwise - see page 6. Depreciation rules for the house itself are covered under "Buildings" on page 12. The contents of the house may be depreciated either on an individual item basis or using the pooling method - see page 9. If you're calculating depreciation on contents for the first time, the adjusted tax value will be the lesser of the cost of those items or their market value at the time they're first used or available for use in earning rental income. The rates for house or flat contents are set out in the industry category "Residential rental property chattels". You can find this in our depreciation rate finder on ird.govt.nz/depreciation Or, you can use our guides IR265 for chattels acquired on or after 1 April 2005, and the IR267 for chattels acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and up to 31 March 2005. Depreciable item distinct from the building If an item in a residential rental property is distinct from the building and meets the definition of "depreciable property", it may be depreciated separately. If an item is part of the building it cannot be depreciated separately, but can be depreciated with the building. It's important that the correct approach is applied to determine if these items are regarded as distinct from the building. To determine whether a particular item is part of or separate from the building there is a three- step test. 1. The item is in some way attached or connected to the building. 2. The item is an integral part of the residential rental property, so it wouldn't function as a rental without it. 3. The item is built-in or attached/connected in such a way that it's part of the "fabric" of the building. Full commentary on Interpretation statement 10/01 "Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable properties" can be found in the Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). For more information, read our IR264 guide. It explains the taxable income and deductible expenses for people who own rental property. Holiday homes Where a holiday home is considered to be a "rental" property, depreciation may be claimed. The proportion of depreciation claimed on the assets will vary depending on the degree of actual rental time. The facts of a particular case always need to be considered carefully and so it may be necessary to seek advice from a tax advisor before making any claim for depreciation or other expenses on a holiday home. You can find more information on income tax treatment of holiday homes in the Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 3 (May 2009). Intangible assets Depreciating intangible assets Certain intangible assets have been included in the depreciation rules, and can be depreciated under the general rules applying to other depreciable assets. The only difference is that the rules apply to intangible assets acquired or created on or after 1 April 1993, rather than from a taxpayer's 1994 income or non- standard balance date accounting year. The 20% depreciation loading does not apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 17 Intangible assets acquired or created after 1 April 1993 that are depreciable, intangible property, are limited to those listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and they all have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of creation or acquisition. In brief, the intangible assets covered by schedule 14 are: a patent, or the right to use a patent the right to use a copyright, trademark, design, plan or similar the right to use land, plant or machinery software copyright management rights and licence rights created under the Radiocommunications Act 1989 consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 copyright in a sound recording plant variety rights, or the right to use them. To be depreciable, an intangible asset must be both: an asset of the type listed in schedule 14 an asset that might reasonably be expected to decline in value under normal circumstances. The most common feature of the assets listed in schedule 14 is the "right to use". Take, for example, costs incurred in designing and producing a logo. A logo is not listed in the schedule so the costs are considered to be a one-off capital cost and not depreciable. If the logo, once created, is then trademarked and the rights to use are sold, the purchaser can depreciate those rights. The depreciation rules vary according to whether or not intangible assets have a fixed life or an economic life. Intangible assets with a fixed life An intangible asset with a fixed life is any intangible asset that is depreciable with a legal life that could reasonably be expected, on the date of creation or acquisition of that asset, to be the same length as the asset's remaining estimated useful life. If an intangible asset falls into this category, the depreciation rate is self-assessed by the owner using the formula: 1 Legal life (years) In such cases the "legal life" is defined as the length of time the intangible asset may exist as specified by the contract or statute that created it. In addition, legal life will include any renewal or extension period where those renewals or extensions are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of a predetermined fee. The formula gives an SL depreciation rate. The SL method is the only depreciation method that can be used for fixed-life intangible assets. Intangible assets with a fixed life are not eligible for the 20% loading that applies from the 1996 income year until 20 May 2010. Example Mark acquired the right to use a registered trademark from 1 April 2006 with a value of $10,000 and a legal life of five years. Using the above formula, the depreciation rate Mark would use is: 1 =0.2 or 20% 5 Mark can claim a $2,000 deduction for depreciation each year. Note A special depreciation rate may be applied if the economic life is different from the legal life of the intangible asset. Intangible assets with an economic life If the intangible asset does not have a fixed life, it can be expected to have an economic life shorter than its legal life. Unlike fixed-life intangible assets, economic- life intangible assets are depreciated using the same methods applied to all tangible depreciable assets, ie, a DV or SL depreciation rate. They can be pooled and, if purchased between 1996 and 20 May 2010, are eligible for a 20% loading. Taxpayers can also apply for a special or provisional depreciation rate for economic life intangibles. For example, a taxpayer may obtain a licence to use computer software for life, whereas the economic life of that software would possibly only be three years. Part 2 18 DEPRECIATION Franchises Franchise agreements are not a category of intangible assets listed in schedule 14 so they are not normally considered to be depreciable intangible assets. However, any particular franchise agreement may give rise to specific rights listed in schedule 14, for example, the right to use a trademark. Remember, the rights are the depreciable intangible assets, not the franchise agreement. If a franchise agreement stipulates a mixture of rights, and one particular right is specifically listed in schedule 14 and is capable of being separately and clearly isolated and valued, that right will be a depreciable intangible asset, provided it might reasonably be expected to decline in value under normal circumstances. Whether or not the rights conferred under a franchise agreement are considered to be the type listed in schedule 14, they will not be depreciable if any of the following situations apply: You cannot estimate with any reasonable degree of certainty a finite and defined period of life. The rights are not expected to decline in value over their life. The payment is made to purchase goodwill rather than the rights to secret formulas, processes, trademarks or similar. If a right conferred under a franchise agreement is depreciable, it will usually have a legal life equivalent to its estimated useful life. Accordingly, it must be depreciated using the SL method as an intangible asset with a fixed life. If a right conferred under a franchise agreement is automatically renewed or the right to renewal is only subject to the payment of a predetermined fee, the legal life of that right will be equal to the full term of the agreement, assuming the right to renewal is taken up. Example Cherrypoppin Ltd paid $50,000 to acquire the New Zealand franchise rights to manufacture and distribute Rolloseal towel rails. The franchise agreement is for a 10-year period. The majority of the $50,000 franchise fee went to capital expenditure, however, $20,000 of the fee related to the right to use a patent. The franchise was acquired on 1 April 2006 to extend until 1 April 2016. The right to use the patent is a fixed-life intangible asset. When the franchise was purchased, it appeared the right to use the patent would remain valuable to the end of its legal life. The legal life of this fixed-life intangible asset is 10 years. The SL depreciation rate to be used by Cherrypoppin Ltd for the right to use a patent is: 1/10 = 10% on cost of $20,000. The annual depreciation is $2,000. Additional costs Any additional costs, incurred in relation to an intangible asset with a fixed life during the legal life of that asset, are added to the book value. This is done at the beginning of the income year in which the costs are incurred. The aggregate costs are depreciated over the remaining legal life of that intangible asset (calculated from the beginning of the year in which they are incurred). A legal life includes any renewal or extension period where the renewal or extension is essentially unconditional or conditional only on the payment of predetermined fees. So, the depreciation rate for the fixed-life intangible asset changes. In effect, the fixed-life intangible asset is treated as newly acquired from the beginning of that year for the sum of the adjusted tax value and additional costs. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 19 Example Karion Ltd acquires the right to use a copyright for five years for $10,000 and has an option to renew for a further five years on payment of an additional $5,000. The legal life is therefore: 1/10 = 10% on cost of $10,000. The annual depreciation is $1,000. In the first five years, Karion Ltd claims annual deductions totalling $5,000. In year six, Karion Ltd pays the additional $5,000. The sum of the adjusted tax value and additional cost is $10,000 ($5,000 + $5,000). The remaining legal life of the right is five years, so the depreciation rate for years six to ten is: 1/5 = 20% on cost of $10,000. The annual depreciation in years six to ten is $2,000. It is necessary to calculate a loss or gain on disposal of a depreciable intangible asset - see page 26. Patents Patent rights acquired after 1 April 1993 are also depreciable intangible assets. Timing of depreciation For patent applications lodged before 1 April 2005 and granted in the 2005-06 income year or later, depreciation begins from the date the application is granted. However, there's a catch-up deduction for the period between when the application is lodged and when it's granted. For patent applications lodged on or after 1 April 2005, depreciation begins from the date the patent application is lodged with a complete specification. Depreciation rates for patents Patents have a legal life of 20 years, which is 240 months. To work out the depreciation rate divide the number of months in that year by 240. For patents with applications lodged before 1 April 2005 and granted in the 2005-06 tax year or later, divide the number of months the patent was pending by 240 to give the catch-up depreciation rate. Further details on the tax implications of selling patents are covered on page 27. Example 1 - Patent application lodged before 1 April 2005 Kariov filed for a patent on a new type of footwear on 4 April 2004. The patent is granted on 2 June 2007. The total patent costs were $10,000. The depreciation for the patent would be calculated as follows: Depreciation catch-up (April 04-May 07) 38 months/240 months = 16% on cost of $10,000 = $1,600 depreciation\* Annual rate for the year (June 07-March 08) 10 months/240 months = 4% on cost of $10,000 = $400 depreciation\* 2008-09 income year onwards 12 months/240 months = 5% on cost of $10,000 = $500 depreciation (as the SL method must be used). Kariov will be able to claim $500 each year until the patent expires. \* The total depreciation for the 2007-08 income year would be $2,000 ($1,600+$400) Example 2 - Application lodged after 1 April 2005 KIZ Ltd files for a patent on a new type of cat-door. It lodged its application with complete specification on 15 September 2005. The patent is granted on 21 February 2008. The depreciation rate for the patent application and for the patent (once granted) would be calculated as follows: Depreciation rate for patent application 2005-06 income year (Sept 05 to Mar 06) 7 months/240 months = 0.03 2006-07 income year 12 months/240 months = 0.05 2007-08 income year (April 07-Jan 08) 10 months/240 months = 0.04\* Depreciation rate for patent 2007-08 income year (Feb 08-Mar 08) 2 months/240 months = 0.01\* 2008-09 income year onwards 12 months/240 months = 0.05 \* The total depreciation rate for the 2007-08 income year would be 0.05 (0.04+0.01) Part 2 20 DEPRECIATION For more information on depreciation on patents see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 17, No 7 (September 2005). Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Fishing quotas There are two types of fishing quota: individual term quotas (ITQs), which are issued in perpetuity transferable term quotas (TTQs), which are issued for fixed periods. Most fishing quotas give the owner the right to catch a defined percentage of the total allowable commercial catch, so do not fall within any of the classes of intangible assets listed in schedule 14. Also, the majority of quotas issued to date have been ITQs, which have an indefinite life, and are not depreciable anyway. Please note that a TTQ is depreciable property - specifically, it is fixed-life intangible property. For more information about fishing quotas, please refer to our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 12, No 3 (March 2000). Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Distribution network assets Distribution networks convey electricity, gas, water, and telecommunications. The individual assets within that network are depreciated at the rate applicable to that individual asset (individual assets are known as ‘items of depreciable property’ for depreciation purposes). This is known as the “component approach”. No depreciation rate exists for the composite group of assets that make up the network. Treating the entire distribution network as an item of depreciable property is known as the ‘network approach’. It is common for distribution networks to pool ‘like’ assets and depreciate them using the ‘pool method’ (see page 9). These asset pools are not ‘networks’ but do contain large numbers of generally low value assets with similar characteristics. It is important to recognise that while, for convenience, asset pools are depreciated using the lowest rate for items in the pool, the item of depreciable property does not lose its identity as an individual asset simply because it is depreciated as part of an asset pool. For this reason, repairs and maintenance are considered in relation to each asset in the pool, not the asset pool itself. The component approach applies from the 2008/2009 income year. If a network approach has been used, then the component approach must now be used from the 2024/25 income year. Computer software This section explains our policy on the tax treatment of computer software expenditure. Some of the terms used in our software policy are explained below. Development The following activities are likely to be part of a development phase: gathering and analysing user requirements designing systems developing detailed software specifications constructing programs testing software testing the user or customer (acceptance testing) developing manuals and training material preparing documents for use in ongoing software product maintenance providing management review throughout the development phase (for example, quality assurance). Maintenance The following activities will generally be accepted as deductible maintenance payments: developing helpdesk facilities fixing program bugs bringing performance up to the original specifications making minor changes, such as increasing field sizes. Predevelopment This term refers to a feasibility study of a project as part of ongoing business. Software Software includes all programs or routines used to cause a computer to perform a desired task or set of tasks, and the documentation and training materials required to describe and maintain these programs. Upgrade Generally, an upgrade of computer software: adds new features to the structure increases its capacity or performance extends the life of the software provides a new version of the software that has more capacity or increased performance. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 21 Categories of software expenditure For tax purposes, software expenditure is divided into six categories, each treated differently. Software purchases Cost of purchase should be capitalised and depreciated. Immediate write-off is available for software costing less than $500. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Specified lease of software Cost price of software must be capitalised and depreciated. Interest component of lease payments may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Software developed in-house for use in business Predevelopment expenses may be deducted. Development expenses must be capitalised until the project is completed and depreciated. Costs of unsuccessful development may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Costs of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Commissioned software Development costs must be capitalised until the project is accepted. It must then be depreciated. Costs of unsuccessful development may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Costs of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Software leased other than under a specified lease Lease payments are deductible over the term of the lease. Software developed for sale or licence Development costs are deductible in the year they are incurred. The value of unbilled work in progress and unsold completed software must be taken into account as trading stock. The value of trading stock at balance date must be included as income in your return for that income year. Where a payment covers both maintenance and upgrading, the cost must be apportioned between the two. The cost of maintenance is deductible and the cost of upgrading must be capitalised, taking account of depreciation. Reservation of title clause (also known as Romalpa clause) Depreciation can be deducted from depreciable assets purchased subject to a reservation of title clause (ie, where the contract provides that the vendor reserves title to the asset until the purchase price has been paid but allows the purchaser to take possession of the asset before payment). Note Reservation of title clause does not apply to hire purchase assets subject to hire purchase agreements - see "Hire purchase" and "Leasehold improvements" on page 15. Where you purchase an asset subject to a reservation of title clause you're considered to own (and the vendor is considered not to own) the asset on the later date of entering the contract or taking possession of the asset. This considered ownership remains until: title to the asset passes to you the vendor repossesses the asset. If the asset is repossessed you're considered to have disposed of the asset at cost, less the net amount already paid to the vendor. Part 2 22 DEPRECIATION Example Purchase price of an asset $10,000 Amount purchaser paid towards the asset $5,000 Asset repossessed - vendor refunds $3,000 This means the net payment for the asset has been $2,000. The purchaser is considered to have sold the asset for $8,000, so the depreciation recovered is calculated on the considered sale price of $8,000. The vendor of the asset will not be able to depreciate the asset while you, the purchaser, are deemed to own it. Low Value Assets (including loose tools) Low-value assets, are deductible in the year they're acquired or created, provided: they are not purchased from the same supplier at the same time as other assets to which the same depreciation rate applies the assets will not become part of an asset that is depreciable, for example, the cost of materials to build a wall in a factory. Assets are considered low value where their cost was as follows: Up till 16 March 2020Up to $500 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021Up to $5,000 From 17 March 2021Up to $1,000 If you're GST-registered, the cost is GST-exclusive and if you're not GST-registered, then the cost is GST- inclusive. If you sell an asset you've claimed this deduction for, or you start using it mainly for private purposes, you'll have to account for it in your next tax return. If the asset is sold, the entire sale proceeds are taxable in the year the asset is sold. If the asset becomes a private asset, the market value of the asset when it's first used privately will be taxable income. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 23 This part deals with adjustments you might make and how the various ways of disposing of depreciable assets will be treated for tax purposes. This includes calculating depreciation in the following situations: newly acquired assets private use of business assets transferring depreciable assets between associated persons private assets becoming business assets disposals transferring assets under a relationship agreement transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies local authority trading enterprises determinations. Newly acquired assets If you're using either the SL or DV methods you can claim depreciation for each calendar month or part- month you own an asset and it's used or available to be used in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Example Craig buys a new cash register on 27 January 2010 for $7,000, which he uses 100% in his business. Craig's balance date is 31 March and he uses a DV rate of 48% (including 20% loading). This is how he calculates his 2010 depreciation deduction: Three months' use (January, February, March 2010) 12 months' income year (1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010) The depreciation deduction is: $7,000×48%× 3 =$840 12 Even though he owned the cash register for only a few days in January, Craig can claim depreciation for the entire month. If you have pooled assets you may add a newly acquired asset to a pool - see page 9. Private use of business assets Use the most appropriate unit of measurement when calculating how much a business asset, other than a motor vehicle, is used privately, such as square metres for area or hours and minutes for time. When a business motor vehicle is used privately and the use is subject to FBT (fringe benefit tax), you do not need to adjust the depreciation deduction to exclude the private use. This is because FBT itself is a way of accounting for the non-business use. However, self-employed people (including partners in a partnership) who use a business vehicle for private purposes, must apportion the vehicle's depreciation between business and non-business use. If you keep an accurate vehicle logbook as an ongoing record, you can make a precise apportionment for depreciation. Alternatively, you may keep a record for a minimum of three months to establish an apportionment that may then be used for three years, provided the business use of the vehicle does not change by more than 20%. Example Mike is a self-employed salesperson. He bought a car for $30,000 at the beginning of the income year and 85% of its use is for business purposes. Mike's car has a DV rate of 36% (including 20% loading) and depreciation on the car is calculated as: Step 1 Opening adjusted tax value $30,000 Depreciation $10,800 Closing adjusted value $19,200 Step 2 Total depreciation $10,800 Less 15% private use (non-deductible) $1,620 Equals 85% business use (deductible) $9,180 Part 3 - Adjustments and disposals The 20% depreciation loading does not apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. Part 3 24 DEPRECIATION The adjusted tax value is calculated taking into account 100% of the annual depreciation, not just the deductible proportion - see the table below. YearOpening adjusted tax value DepreciationClosing adjusted tax value Deductible portion 130,00010,80019,2009,180 (85%) 219,2006,91212,2885,875 (85%) 312,2884,4247,8643,760 (85%) When a business asset that's been used privately is sold, resulting in either depreciation recovered or a loss, the loss or gain must be apportioned between business and private use. Calculate the apportionment using this formula: a - b × c a = adjusted tax value at time of sale b = sale price c = percentage of business use Example If Mike, from the previous example, sells his car after three years for $6,000, the loss on the sale must be apportioned between business and private use. Business purposes made up 85% of the car's use. The deductible portion of the loss on the sale is calculated as: Adjusted tax value (at time of sale) $7,864 Sale price -$6,000 $1,864 85% business use of $1,864 $1,584 Mike can claim $1,584 as loss on the sale. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 25 Transferring depreciable assets between associated persons Under normal rules a purchaser is entitled to claim depreciation based on the purchase price of an asset. The new owner of a secondhand asset can claim depreciation based on the amount paid for the asset, as long as it's an arm's length sale where: the sale is bona fide the purchase price is a fair market value for the asset the purchaser buys the asset for use in income- producing activities and the seller no longer uses it for income-producing activities. The fact the parties are related does not prevent depreciation being claimed. In the case of transfers of assets between associated persons (apart from assets transferred under a relationship agreement - see page 29) a restriction applies to the amount and rate of depreciation that may be claimed by the person acquiring the asset. Depreciation on an asset is restricted to the base value of the asset purchased from an associate, being the lower of: the price the seller originally paid for the asset (or, if applicable, the market value of the asset at the time the associated seller was first entitled to depreciate the asset) the price paid by the buyer. This applies unless we give written approval to use the price paid by the buyer. To grant approval, we must consider such treatment is appropriate in the circumstances. Restrictions on the depreciation rate The depreciation rate that may be applied to an asset acquired from an associate cannot be higher than the depreciation rate applied to the asset by that associated seller. If a different depreciation method is used, the restriction applies so the depreciation rate used must not exceed a rate equivalent to that used by the associate. This restriction does not apply if: the value being used for the transfer is gross income to the associated seller, other than under the provisions for depreciation recovered the asset is intangible with a fixed life. The depreciation rate for such intangible assets is calculated using a formula that spreads the cost of the fixed-life intangible asset evenly across its remaining life. The restrictions on the base value of an asset, and the depreciation rate that may be used with the asset, apply whether the asset is transferred directly or indirectly to an associate. Private assets becoming business assets If a private asset becomes a business asset, depreciation is first calculated on the market value of that asset when it was first used in the business (except in the case of buildings, which must always be depreciated on cost - see page 12). Whether or not the market value is GST-inclusive depends on whether you are registered for GST. However, if we ask, you must be able to provide documentation (for example, a valuation) showing how you arrived at the market value. Note Buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more have a depreciation rate of 0% from the 2011- 12 income year. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Disposals Selling and disposing of assets When you sell or dispose of an asset (other than a pooled asset) for a different amount from its adjusted tax value, you must make an adjustment in your end- of-year tax return to account for the loss or gain. If the asset has been used for both business and non-business purposes, you must apportion any loss or gain on disposal between business and non-business use. You cannot claim a deduction for depreciation in the year you dispose of an asset, except in the case of buildings. Costs incurred in selling an asset, such as commission and advertising, can be deducted from the sale price before you work out the loss or gain on sale. The adjustment is generally made in the year you sell or dispose of an asset, except when the disposal is because business has ceased. See page 28 for depreciation adjustments when a business ceases. Part 3 26 DEPRECIATION When a group of assets is sold for a lump sum it may sometimes be necessary to apportion the sale price between the various assets. If, for example, a group of assets that were sold included business and private assets or assets that do not depreciate, such as land, an apportionment would have to be made. We may sometimes ask for an independent valuation of assets if we decide the apportionment agreed to by the buyer and the seller is not acceptable. What constitutes a disposal The term "disposal" includes: an asset that is compulsorily acquired an asset taken out of New Zealand (other than only temporarily) changes in use or location of use of a business asset ceasing intangible asset rights an asset that is irreparably damaged - see page 28 any distribution of assets, including distributions of assets to the beneficial owners for no cost ceasing deemed ownership of a fixture or improvement - see page 15 an asset that is lost or stolen if that asset is not recovered in the income year when the loss or theft occurs - see page 28 an asset contributed to a partnership by a person. A disposal or sale of a depreciable asset triggers either a gain or loss on disposal. A gain on disposal or sale Where there's no election for an asset not to be a depreciable asset and the sale price received for the asset exceeds the adjusted tax value, the lesser of the following amounts must be included as gross income in that income year: the total depreciation that could have been deducted since the asset was purchased or first used in the business (this amount relates to the allowable depreciation deduction rather than the amount of depreciation actually deducted), or the amount by which the sale price received exceeds the adjusted tax value. Note For any asset owned prior to the 1994 income year, only the actual amount of depreciation claimed prior to the 1994 income year needs to be taken into account. You still need to work out the amount of depreciation that could have been claimed from the 1994 income year until date of sale. A loss on disposal or sale When you sell or dispose of an asset for less than its adjusted tax value, the difference between this consideration and the adjusted tax value is allowed as a deduction. If an asset is sold for less than its market value we can fix the sale price as the market value of the asset. This may happen if you sold an asset to someone close to you or your business, for example, a relative or a shareholder of the company. In this situation, the actual sale price may be ignored and the calculations made as if the asset was sold for its market value. The exception to this is when you dispose of pooled assets. For the treatment of pooled assets - see Disposing of pooled assets on page 27. Note A deduction for loss on disposal does not apply to buildings, unless due to an event the building has been damaged or affected by its surroundings rendering it useless for the purposes of deriving income. See pages 12 and 37. Disposing of intangible assets You must calculate a loss or gain when disposing of a depreciable intangible asset. This will include calculating loss or gain from disposing of any franchise rights that are depreciable - see page 18. A disposal of an intangible asset must fall within one of the following two circumstances: any event which means that the owner can no longer apply, at any time, the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset, or any event that causes the asset to be irreparably damaged. A disposal of an intangible asset does not include disposing of that asset as part of an arrangement to replace it with an asset of the same type. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 27 Where a depreciable intangible asset is considered worthless it's unlikely ceasing to use that intangible asset could be seen as a disposal. A disposal of such an asset must fall within one of the following circumstances: any event which means the owner can no longer apply, at any time, the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset any event that causes the asset to be irreparably damaged any event which means the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset are moved overseas. Although worthless, you still have the legal right to use the intangible assets, and they have probably not been irreparably damaged - it's just the value of those assets that has diminished. The write-off provisions could apply to intangible assets. We need to be satisfied: the intangible asset will no longer be used, and is not intended to be used the costs (for example, legal) of disposal would exceed the consideration received (the intangible asset is worthless) no one else could use it (or would want to use it) perhaps due to unmarketability through the liability of defects. We explain write-offs on page 35. Patents Where a patent is sold, the proceeds from the sale are taxable on the net amount after cost. Generally, a corresponding adjustment has been allowed for the total costs of the patent rights (at least those acquired on or after 1 April 1993). As a depreciation allowance has been available for patents since 1 April 1993, there is the potential for a double deduction. So, in calculating the profit or loss on sale of a patent, the cost of the patent is reduced by depreciation deductions that have been allowed. This restricts any deduction for loss on sale to the adjusted tax value. If a patent application is sold while the patent is pending, so that the patent is granted to a person other than the person who filed the application, the legal life for the new owner is reduced by the number of months between when the patent application was lodged and when it was sold to the new owner. Making arrangements between associated persons - intangible assets An intangible asset that wasn't depreciable to the seller remains non-depreciable to the associate, even though assets of the same type have become depreciable since the seller acquired that asset. The provision prevents an intangible asset being transferred to an associate to bring it within the depreciation rules and applies to intangible assets transferred on or after 1 July 1997. Disposing of pooled assets When you dispose of pooled assets, the sale price must be deducted from the adjusted tax value of the pool before calculating depreciation for the year. If the asset is discarded or lost, the adjusted tax value of the pool is not reduced. Where the sale price is greater than the adjusted tax value of the pool, the difference is treated as depreciation recovered and is taxable income. The adjusted tax value of the pool will then be nil and no further depreciation deductions will be allowed until new assets are added to the pool. Once assets are pooled, they're no longer treated as individual assets, so any capital gain made on the sale of any or all assets from the pool cannot be separated from depreciation recovered. The entire proceeds of any sale of pooled assets must be accounted for and any gains are taxable income. When all the assets in a pool are sold and the sale proceeds are less than the pool's adjusted tax value, the balance is deductible. Special rule for sale of assets previously held under the globo accounting method Please note from 12 December 1995 a limitation was placed on the amount of taxable income derived from selling assets in a pool that consists only of assets previously depreciated under the globo accounting method (this method could only be used before 1 April 1993). If this applies to you please see our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 7, No 9 (February 1996) for a fuller explanation of how gains are to be treated. Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Part 3 28 DEPRECIATION Ceasing business or now using the asset for non- business purposes If you cease business and do not sell your business assets immediately or if they're kept for private use, the loss or gain must be accounted for using the market value of the assets as at the beginning of the next income year. You'll have to make an adjustment in your income tax return for the year after the business ceased or the asset changed use, even if the loss or gain is not realised until a later income year. Using a pooled asset privately When an asset is no longer used solely for business purposes after it's been pooled, it must be isolated from the pool. Example Andy has an asset pool with an adjusted tax value of $18,000 at 1 April 2009. The pool includes an asset that Andy is now using for private purposes. He uses it privately for 20% of the time which started on 5 December 2009. The market value of the asset on 5 December 2009 was $1,500. The pool depreciation rate is 22%. Step 1 Pool adjusted tax value (beginning of 2010 income year) $ 18,000 Value at end of 2010 income year ($18,000 less deemed sale at $1,500) + $ 16,500 $ 34,500 Average pool value (divide $34,500 by 2) $ 17,250 Depreciation on the pool at 22% for the year will be: $ 3,795 Step 2 Calculate depreciation on ex-pool assets (market value $1,500) $1,500 x 22% x 4/12\* months = $ 110 (\*December 2009 to March 2010) Total depreciation $ 110 less 20% personal use $ 22 Deductible depreciation $ 88 Deductible depreciation for the 2010 income year is $3,883 ($88 plus $3,795). At the time the asset is first used privately, it will be treated for depreciation purposes as though the business bought and sold it for the market value. Damaged assets You must take into account any insurance proceeds, indemnity damages or compensation payments you receive when an asset is damaged. If such payments exceed the cost of repairing the damaged asset, the surplus is not a capital receipt but must be deducted from the adjusted tax value of the asset for depreciation purposes. If the result is a negative amount, that amount is considered to be gross income in that year. Irreparably damaged assets are considered to be disposed of for a consideration of the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnity payment or other consideration received in relation to that event or damage. A full deduction is allowed for disposal costs, including demolition costs. Lost or stolen assets The loss or theft of a depreciable asset constitutes a disposal if the asset is not recovered in the income year in which the loss or theft occurs. Any insurance proceeds, indemnity payment or other consideration received in relation to the loss or theft of the depreciable asset is taken to be consideration received, minus disposal costs (where applicable), for the disposal of that asset. This consideration for the disposal will then be used in calculating the gain or loss on disposal of the asset. If the lost or stolen asset is recovered in a subsequent income year, and is still owned and used or available for use in deriving income, the following assumptions apply. You're considered to derive gross income equal to any loss on sale deduction allowed in the previous year. The gross income will be considered to be derived either in the year of disposal or of recovery. You're considered to have acquired the recovered asset on the date it was retrieved at the adjusted tax value that applied at the beginning of the year of loss or theft. Note If you're registered for GST, do not include the GST component of these payments in your calculation - account for it in your GST return. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 29 Transferring assets under a relationship agreement Depreciable assets transferred under a relationship agreement are transferred at the adjusted tax value and the person acquiring the assets, provided they use them for business purposes, is allowed the deductions that would have been allowed had the transfer not taken place. Example Colin and Jennifer Day separate and they agree to enter into a relationship agreement. Colin will transfer half the business assets to Jennifer. The general rule is that depreciable assets are transferred: at adjusted tax value at the beginning of the year of transfer at cost price for assets acquired in the year of transfer. As a result, no depreciation gain or loss arises to the transferor (Colin). The transferee (Jennifer) can continue to depreciate the remaining adjusted tax value of the assets. However, if she sells, Jennifer is considered to have claimed the depreciation deductions claimed by Colin and will be required to account for any excess of sale proceeds above the transfer value (up to the cost of the asset to Colin) as depreciation recovered. In relation to buildings, Jennifer's depreciation claim is based on the cost of the building to Colin. He is considered to have disposed of the building at adjusted tax value. Transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies Companies that are 100% commonly owned and choose to enter the consolidated system can transfer assets within their group at the assets' adjusted tax value. When wholly owned companies amalgamate, they're treated as one company and all assets, liabilities, property, rights, powers and privileges of the amalgamating companies are held in the new amalgamated company. This means there is no depreciation recovered when assets are transferred on a qualifying amalgamation. Wholly owned companies that do not form a consolidated group are required to transfer assets at market value and recover or claim a loss of depreciation, as applicable. The vendor company is required to calculate depreciation recovered or a loss on disposal: on actual sale price, or on market value, when the asset has been disposed of for a consideration that is not market value, but we consider the market value is greater than the sale price and consider it to be the more appropriate value for the asset. The purchasing company should value the asset at the cost incurred, or the value we consider the seller to have disposed of that asset, to calculate the depreciation claimed. Council-controlled organisations Council-controlled organisations are established by local government legislation to operate as trading enterprises liable for tax and so are competitively neutral. When a council-controlled organisation is set up, assets transferred to it from a local authority should be transferred for tax purposes at either their: adjusted tax value true market value. Part 3 30 DEPRECIATION Regardless of which value is adopted: a local authority must make an actual sale of assets to a council-controlled organisation full consideration for the sale must pass between the parties there must be complete and detailed documentation providing evidence of the transaction (including listing individual asset values). Our Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 2 (August 1991) has a full policy statement on how to value assets that are transferred from local authorities to council-controlled organisations (previously known as LATEs). To read the Tax Information Bulletin go to ird.govt.nz/tib Determinations Inland Revenue must follow a formal procedure to set new depreciation rates or create new categories for assets and industries. This is known as "issuing a determination" and the general rates listed in our IR265 and the IR267 guides are the result of determinations issued by us. The determination process is also used for setting depreciation rates following applications from taxpayers. You can apply for a determination of depreciation rate if, for example, you find there is no general depreciation rate for your asset. You can also apply to us for a new rate if you believe the relevant existing general depreciation rate shouldn't apply to your asset. There are three different types of determinations that you can apply for, depending on your circumstances: a special depreciation rate a provisional depreciation rate a higher maximum pooling value. How rates are calculated The formula below is used for calculating a DV depreciation rate for an asset. 1 - (( residual value ) 1 ) cost n n =the estimated useful life of the asset. Estimated useful life The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which the asset might reasonably be expected to be useful in earning income in New Zealand. This period of time is calculated taking into account factors such as likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion and obsolescence. Normal and reasonable maintenance over the expected life of the asset is also taken into account. The fact an asset may have been previously used for a purpose other than deriving income (for example, private use) or carrying on a business overseas will not reduce its estimated useful life. The estimate of useful life must take into account the length of time the asset is used by all business owners in New Zealand (ie, first owner plus second owner and so on). Example Grant, an owner-driver, buys a new truck every five years and sells his old one. He expects the New Zealand business that buys each truck from him will use it for another five years and then scrap it. If this is the typical useful lifespan of trucks, the estimated useful life is 10 years. We use valuation consultants' advice when determining the estimated useful life for each asset class. The estimated useful life is determined after averaging the usage of various businesses. The estimated useful life is listed with the depreciation rates in our IR265 guide. You can view our depreciation rates finder or the IR265 at ird.govt.nz/rate-finder Residual value The residual value of an asset is the greater of: 13.5% of the original cost an estimate of the asset's market value (GST-exclusive) at the end of its estimated useful life. This must be a reasonable estimate made at the time of purchase. In estimating the residual value it must be assumed normal and reasonable maintenance is carried out on the asset during its use. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 31 Once the rates are calculated they're rounded up or down to the nearest rate. The full range of general DV and SL rates are shown below: 1994 to 2005 rates For assets you acquired on or after 1 April 1993, and before the end of the 1995 income year, you can use the general rates listed in table 1 or the historic rates listed in part 1 of the IR267 guide plus 25% interim loading and any shift allowances. For assets acquired from the 1996 income year to the end of the 2005 income year (or before 19 May 2005 for buildings), use the general rates listed in table 1. For new assets, including those never used or held for use in New Zealand, and imported secondhand goods (but excluding buildings or used imported cars) depreciation is calculated using the general rate plus 20% loading. The general rates listed in table 1 can also be found in parts 2 and 3 of the IR267 guide at ird.govt.nz Table 1 General DV rate with 20% loading General SL rate with 20% loading 22.41.51.8 44.833.6 67.244.8 7.595.56.6 9.511.46.57.8 1214.489.6 15181012 1821.612.515 2226.415.518.6 2631.21821.6 3339.62428.8 40483036 50604048 63.576.263.576.2 100100100100 2006 and future years For assets acquired from the 2006 income year (or buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005) use the general rates listed in table 2. For new assets (including those never used or held for use in New Zealand) and imported secondhand goods, but excluding buildings or used imported cars, depreciation is calculated using the general DV or SL rates plus 20% loading. The general rates listed in table 2 can be found in parts 1 and 2 of our IR265 guide at ird.govt.nz Table 2 General DV rate with 20% loading General SL rate with 20% loading 22.41.51.8 44.833.6 67.244.8 89.667.2 101278.4 1315.68.510.2 1619.210.512.6 202413.516.2 253017.521 30362125.2 40483036 50604048 6780.46780.4 100100100100 Note The 20% loading has been removed from 21 May 2010, so for any assets acquired on or after this date, use only the general DV or SL rates in table 2. Note From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Part 3 32 DEPRECIATION Disputable decisions Sometimes you may not agree with some of our decisions, for example: a determination setting a special rate a decision not to set a special rate revoking a special rate a determination setting a provisional rate a decision not to set a provisional rate. If you want to challenge any of these decisions, see our factsheet If you disagree with an assessment - IR778. Special depreciation rates We've calculated the general depreciation rates by using the formula given on page 30. We've considered the way assets are normally used, to arrive at the values used in the formula. For example, where it's usual to operate a piece of machinery in two or three shifts a day, the general depreciation rate we've set will reflect this heavier usage. If you believe the general depreciation rate we've set is not appropriate for your asset because, for example, you use your machine in an unusually heavy or light manner, or it will be operated in corrosive conditions, you may apply for a special depreciation rate. As we set a special rate because of individual circumstances, it can only be set for a specific taxpayer's asset or class of assets. Once set, it can only be used by the taxpayer who made the application. Note After 20 May 2010 you can no longer apply for a special depreciation rate on buildings. Note From the 2021 income year depreciation on non- residential buildings has been reintroduced. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Your application for a special depreciation rate must be supported by evidence of how your unique circumstances will affect the life of your asset. If we agree you should have a special depreciation rate, the formula set out on page 30 will be used to calculate the rate. To qualify for a special rate, the rate you've calculated must be halfway or more to the next rate on the general rates table, either higher or lower. Example A personal computer purchased after 1 April 2005 has a general DV rate of 50%. The next higher general rate is 67%. The calculation must result in a rate of 58.5% or higher to qualify for a higher rate, or 45% or lower to qualify for a lower rate to be set since the next lower general rate is 40%. When considering a special rate, we'll take into account any factors relevant in determining estimated useful life. You can download and complete an Application for a special depreciation rate - IR260B from ird.govt.nz/ir260b Send your completed application to: Technical Lead Legal Services - Technical Standards Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 How we set a special rate If we agree a special depreciation rate should be set, we follow three steps. They are: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing the determination. The process, from the time the application is received to the time the determination is issued, must be completed within six months, unless you agree to an extension of time. Draft determination Once we've considered your application, and agree a special depreciation rate should be set, we'll send you a draft determination along with a letter setting out the special depreciation rate we recommend. If this rate is different from the rate you requested, we'll also set out the reasons why we chose this rate. Conference At this point you may request a conference to discuss the determination. There is a time limit for requesting a conference, which will be at least 10 working days from the date we send the draft determination to you. Full details of the time limit will appear with the draft. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 33 If it's decided not to hold a conference, we'll finalise the determination. If it's decided to hold a conference, we'll set a date, time and place. We'll give you at least 20 working days' notice of the conference date. Issuing the determination The final step in the process is to issue the determination. Hopefully, due to the consultation following the draft determination or if a conference is held, both parties will have agreed on the rate to be set. If, however, you do not agree with the rate in the determination, you may dispute that decision. For more information, see our guide Disputing an assessment - IR776. Declining an application We'll turn down your application for a special rate if: your rate is too close to the general rate - see page 31 the general rate is under review you haven't supplied enough information. If we turn down your application or set a rate you do not agree with, you're entitled to dispute this decision - see page 32. Fees Application fee If you're applying for a special rate there's a fee of $150 plus GST, payable with your application. Processing fee There is a processing fee of $75 plus GST for each hour (or part-hour) after the first two hours for work by Inland Revenue. Consultant's fee If we engage a consultant to advise on the estimated useful life or estimated residual value of the asset, we'll charge you the consultant's fees plus GST. If you request a conference and a consultant paid by us attends the conference, or if you ask our consultant to carry out further work, we'll also charge you for the consultant's fee plus GST. If you request a conference we'll advise you of the likely fees before engaging a consultant so you can decide whether you want to continue with the application. Before we engage a consultant we'll take into account the information you've provided with your application. We will not seek a consultant's advice if you've already provided us with enough information to work out an appropriate rate. We'll send you an account for all fees you have incurred. The costs incurred can be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes and you can claim the GST part of the cost as a credit, if you're registered for GST. Withdrawing applications You can withdraw your application at any time. If you wish to do this, please let us know in writing as soon as possible because you'll have to pay fees incurred in processing your application, including any consultant's fees, up to the day we receive notice of your withdrawal. Revoking a special rate If we've approved your application for a special rate and your circumstances change so your asset no longer qualifies, we may either: revoke the determination, in which case you must use the general rate applying to the asset, or revoke the determination and issue a new one setting a new special rate. If this happens we'll let you know. The special rate we have already issued will lapse the day after you've been notified. Provisional depreciation rates You should apply for a provisional depreciation rate if you consider the asset classes for the general rates (excluding the default asset class in each category) do not appropriately cover the assets in a category. This could happen, for example, when an asset is newly invented or imported into New Zealand for the first time and we haven't listed the asset class under the general asset category. Part 3 34 DEPRECIATION To apply for a provisional rate, fill in an Application for a provisional depreciation rate - IR260A form. There are no application fees for a provisional rate. However, we'll charge you a fee if we: decline to issue a provisional rate determination or issue an unfavourable determination and you ask our consultant to carry out further work that does not result in a determination favourable to you. The fee for the further work done, or time attending a conference will include GST. When a provisional rate is set, it will usually apply to all businesses that own and use that class of asset and we do not have sufficient information at the time to set a general rate. However, in some cases it may be appropriate for a provisional rate to be set for a specific taxpayer or class of taxpayers owning that type of asset, for example, where the asset is unique to a specific taxpayer or taxpayer group. Provisional rates (other than taxpayer specific rates) are published in our Tax Information Bulletin and on our website at ird.govt.nz/depreciation When a general rate is subsequently set for a class of asset, the provisional rate will lapse. Calculating a provisional rate Unless the determination provides otherwise, once a provisional rate is set, it's available to all owners of the particular class of asset. So, the basis of the calculation must relate to the typical asset within the class of assets and typical use within an industry. It's important the information you supply with your application is representative for normal use of the asset within your industry. We take into account the rate of depreciation you and other industry members use in your financial reporting when setting a provisional rate. We calculate a provisional or special rate using the formula explained on page 30, or the SL method. The answer is then rounded up or down to the nearest SL or DV rate. How a provisional rate is set As with general and special rates, provisional rates are set by us issuing a determination. There are three main stages: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing a determination. This three-stage process must be completed within six months from the time we receive your application, unless you agree to an extension of time. These stages are explained in more detail on page 32. We'll turn down an application for a provisional rate if: a general rate for the asset already exists we're in the process of setting a general rate you haven't supplied enough information. If we turn down your application or set a rate you do not agree with, you're entitled to dispute the determination - see page 32. When we've set a provisional rate (other than a taxpayer specific rate) we'll notify the making of the determination and publish the determination in our Tax Information Bulletin and on our website at ird.govt.nz Higher maximum pooling values The aim of the pooling method of depreciation is to reduce compliance costs by calculating depreciation on low-value assets collectively, rather than individually. The maximum pooling value is $5,000. This means you can only pool assets that individually have an adjusted tax value of $5,000 or less. However, you may wish to apply for a higher maximum pooling value. You can do this by completing an Application for a higher maximum pooling value - IR719 form. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 35 Factors we take into account When deciding whether to set a higher maximum pooling value we consider the following three factors. Whether the assets you wish to include under a higher maximum pooling value are relatively similar in nature. Whether you'll make savings in compliance costs, such as clerical, computing and overhead costs, by having a higher maximum pooling value. You should show these in your application. How often you buy and sell the assets for which you want a higher maximum pooling value. How a higher maximum is set There are three stages to issuing a determination to set a higher maximum pooling value. These are: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing a determination. These stages are explained on page 32. Fees If you're applying for a higher maximum pooling value there is an application fee of $150 plus GST. We charge a processing fee of $75, plus GST, for each hour (or part-hour) after the first two hours for work by Inland Revenue. If we hire a consultant to advise on the estimated useful life or estimated residual value of an asset, we'll charge you for the consultant's fees plus GST. We'll also charge you for the consultant's fee plus GST if you request a conference and a consultant paid by us attends, or if you ask our consultant to carry out further work that does not result in a determination favourable to you. We'll send you an account for all fees you've incurred. The account will show the fee, the GST and the total unless we state otherwise. The costs incurred can be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes and if you're registered for GST you can claim the GST part of the cost as a credit. You can withdraw your application at any time - see page 33. Deductions for assets you no longer use This section relates to assets that are no longer used but haven't been physically disposed of. For example, if a business discards machinery because it's outdated and unsafe, but does not sell, assign or transfer it, the machinery hasn't been disposed of. If the cost of disposing of an asset you no longer use would be greater than the proceeds from its sale, you may claim the adjusted tax value as a deduction. If the scrap value of the machinery in the above example is greater than the costs of disposing of that machinery, a write-off will not apply. In such cases the machinery would need to be disposed of to claim a deduction. Dumping off site constitutes a disposal. These rules do not apply to buildings and pooled assets. See page 26 for more help on how to account for losses and gains on sale or disposal of assets. Conditions for a deduction To write off the adjusted tax value of an asset, you must meet the following conditions. You no longer use the asset in business or in producing income. Neither you nor an associate intend to use the asset in the future to derive gross income or in future business. It's uneconomic to dispose of the asset.

Asset is the unit to be depreciated. For depreciation purposes it must not be subdivided into its separate components. Associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007 (sub-part YB) sets out rules that define when two persons are associated. These rules are categorised as tests of association as follows: two companies a company and a person other than a company two relatives a person and a trustee for a relative a trustee and a beneficiary trustees with a common settlor a trustee and a settlor a settlor and a beneficiary a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee a partnership and a partner two persons who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test). Base value means: the cost of an asset acquired after the beginning of the 1994 income year, or the adjusted tax value at the end of the 1993 income year if it's acquired before this date, or the market value at the time the asset is taken from private to business use, if this is after the beginning of the 1994 income year. This market value rule does not apply to buildings or schedule depreciable assets - see page 39. Depreciable intangible assets are intangible assets acquired or created on or after 1 April 1993 and listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and have a finite useful life. Depreciable assets are assets that might reasonably be expected, in normal circumstances, to decline in value while used or available for use: in deriving gross income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. Glossary The term "depreciable assets" refers to all depreciable assets regardless of their acquisition date, and it includes assets acquired in the 1993 and earlier income years. Disposal occurs where a depreciable asset is sold or disposed of for a consideration. Event is a natural disaster such as an earthquake or flood resulting in the building being demolished or abandoned and later demolished. The damage to either the building or to the neighbourhood of the building has rendered the building useless for the purposes of deriving income, and is not due to the action or failure to act of the person, their agent, or an associate. You can find out more in our Ta x Information Bulletin Vol 23, No 8 (October 2011), page 66, "Losses on buildings". Excluded depreciable assets are any assets purchased before 1 April 1993 and any of the following circumstances apply. The assets were used or available for use by the taxpayer in New Zealand, other than as trading stock, before 1 April 1993. Before 16 December 1991, the taxpayer entered into a binding contract to purchase the assets or have them constructed. They are or have been qualifying assets for a person or are or have been a qualifying improvement for the person. They are intangible assets used or available for use by the taxpayer before 1 April 1993. Excluded depreciable assets do not include assets in existence at the end of the 1993 income year that were accounted for using the standard value, replacement value or annual revaluation method. Fixed-life depreciable assets are any intangible assets that: are depreciable intangible assets, and have a legal life which could reasonably be expected, on the date of creation or acquisition of those assets, to be the same length as the assets' remaining estimated useful life. Income year for depreciation purposes, includes any corresponding non-standard accounting year. 38 DEPRECIATION Intangible assets are assets with a finite life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of their creation or acquisition. Legal life is defined for any intangible asset and means the number of years and any monthly fraction the asset may remain or continue to remain in existence by virtue of the contract or statute that creates the asset for the owner. It assumes the owner will exercise any rights of renewal or extension that are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of predetermined fees. Poolable assets are assets with a similar base value you can group for depreciation purposes, with a maximum value of $5,000 per asset. Schedule depreciable assets are petroleum drilling rigs, support vessels for offshore petroleum drilling rigs and support vessels for offshore petroleum production platforms. Because of the special nature of these assets, the depreciation calculation is made on a daily rather than a monthly basis. In addition, the base value for schedule depreciable assets acquired by a taxpayer from an associated person is the lower of the cost of the asset to the taxpayer or the aggregate of: the cost of the asset to: –the associated person who didn't acquire the asset from either the taxpayer or another associated person, or –the taxpayer or an associated person who owned the asset at the beginning of an unbroken chain of ownership, and all expenditure (excluding any expenditure allowed as depreciation allowances) incurred for the asset by the taxpayer and any associated persons before the date the taxpayer acquired the asset. The cost is determined as exclusive of any expenditure allowed as depreciation allowances. No adjustment is made on disposition or exit from the tax base for a schedule depreciable asset. ird.govt.nz 39
Depreciation - a guide for businesses IR260 April 2024 ird.govt.nz 2 New Zealand allowed depreciation on all buildings until 2011. From the 2011-12 income year depreciation was removed for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. Legislative changes enacted on 25 March 2020, as part of a wider economic recovery package in response to COVID-19, reintroduced building depreciation but only for non-residential buildings (those that are not primarily used for residential accommodation). Non-residential building Non-residential building is defined as a building that is not a residential building. A residential building is defined as a dwelling; and includes a building intended to ordinarily provide accommodation for periods of less than 28 days at a time, if the building, together with other buildings on the same land, has less than 4 units for separate accommodation. The second part of the definition includes some buildings accommodating short-term stays to ensure there is certainty that the definition of “residential building” includes buildings such as a bach that the owner uses but also rents out for short stays, and also buildings used exclusively for short-stay accommodation provided by owners such as Airbnb properties. These may be within the definition of 'dwelling', but this puts it beyond doubt these buildings remain non- depreciable. The less-than four units provision is meant to exclude larger commercial operations such as motels from being treated as a residential building. Effective date Depreciation for non-residential buildings was reintroduced for the 2020-21 to 2023-24 income years. Depreciation rate The depreciation rate for non-residential buildings was 2% diminishing value or 1.5% straight-line. From the 2024-25 income year, the depreciation rate for non-residential buildings returned to 0%. Opening tax book value The opening tax book value for the beginning of the 2020-21 income year: for buildings that were owned by the taxpayer in the 2010–11 income year, will be: –the adjusted tax book value at the end of the 2010–11 income year, less fit-out deductions taken under the section DB 65 transitional rule if applicable; plus –non-deductible capital expenditure incurred with respect to the building from the end of the 2010–11 income year to the start of the 2020–21 income year. for buildings acquired after the end of the 2010–11 income year, will be: –the cost of the building; plus –non-deductible capital expenditure incurred with respect to the building from the time it was acquired until the beginning of the 2020–21 income year. Straight-line depreciation If a taxpayer elects to use the straight-line method, the building’s cost for the purpose of calculating the depreciation deduction would be the original cost price. The amount of depreciation is then deducted from the opening tax book value (not original cost) for the 2020–21 and subsequent income years. Repeal of the 2010 transitional rule As a result of reinstating depreciation on non- residential buildings, the transitional building fit-out rule introduced as part of the 2010 reforms is no longer required. Section DB 65 has been repealed, and the tax book value of the building will be adjusted for past DB 65 deductions. Special depreciation rate The ability to receive a special depreciation rate from the Commissioner was restored for non-residential buildings during the period depreciation was reintroduced. COVID-19 - Depreciation changes for non-residential buildings 3 DEPRECIATION The information in this guide is based on the tax laws at the time of printing. Introduction This guide explains how to claim depreciation on your business assets. You're required to claim depreciation when you acquire an asset for your business and account for it when you dispose of that asset. We recommend you consult a tax agent when considering claiming for depreciation. However, it's still your responsibility to be aware of your tax obligations. Find the current depreciation rates by: using our Depreciation rate finder checking our General depreciation rates - IR265 guide. You'll find both of these at ird.govt.nz The rates are set out in two categories - industry and asset.

Note In legal terms, depreciable intangible assets, depreciable assets, excluded depreciable assets, fixed-life depreciable assets and intangible assets are known as 'property'. In this guide we refer to them as assets to avoid confusion, because the term 'property' more commonly relates to land and buildings. ird.govt.nz 4 Contents COVID-19 - Depreciation changes for non-residential buildings 2 Non-residential building 2 Effective date 2 Depreciation rate 2 Opening tax book value 2 Straight-line depreciation 2 Repeal of the 2010 transitional rule 2 Special depreciation rate 2 Introduction 3 ird.govt.nz 3 How to get our forms and guides 3 How to use this guide 3 Part 1 - Overview 5 Main features of depreciation law 5 Compulsory depreciation claims 6 Electing not to depreciate 6 How to make an election not to depreciate 7 Assets that do not depreciate 7 Who can claim depreciation? 7 Cost of assets for depreciation purposes 8 GST and depreciation 8 Records 8 Individual or pooled assets 8 Diminishing value (DV) method 8 Straight line (SL) method 9 Changing methods 9 Pooling method 9 Rates 11 Part 2 - Detailed information on certain assets 12 Buildings 12 Resource consents 13 Land 13 Leased assets 14 Renting out a residential property 15 Holiday homes 16 Intangible assets 16 Computer software 20 Reservation of title clause (also known as Romalpa clause) 21 Low value assets (including loose tools) 21 Part 3 - Adjustments and disposals 22 Newly acquired assets 22 Transferring depreciable assets between associated persons 24 Private assets becoming business assets 24 Disposals 24 Transferring assets under a relationship agreement 28 Transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies 28 Council-controlled organisations 28 Determinations 29 1994 to 2005 rates 30 2006 and future years 30 Disputable decisions 31 Special depreciation rates 31 How we set a special rate 31 Provisional depreciation rates 32 Higher maximum pooling values 33 Deductions for assets you no longer use 34 Part 4 - Services you may need 35 Need to speak with us? 35 Supporting businesses in our community 35 0800 self-service number 35 Tax Information Bulletin (TIB) 35 Privacy 35 If you have a complaint about our service 35 Glossary 36 Part 1 5 DEPRECIATION Part 1 - Overview Depreciation allows a deduction for capital expenditure, where a deduction wouldn't normally apply and acknowledges that the asset will eventually wear out or become outdated. For tax purposes, the reduced value of an asset is recognised by allowing a deduction against income for the depreciation of that asset from the time it is used in a business until it is sold, disposed of or discarded. This means the cost of the asset will be written off over its useful life. Once the whole cost price of the asset has been written off, no further deduction is allowed. When you calculate your depreciation deduction it's important to remember: the date you acquired the asset, since this determines which rates are available to you which industry and/or asset category best describes your depreciable asset. Main features of depreciation law From the 1994 income year, depreciation law relates to all depreciable assets regardless of the date you acquired them. You must make depreciation deductions each year, unless you make an election not to treat a particular asset as depreciable. You can only claim a depreciation deduction once you own the asset and it's used or available for use in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Depreciation is calculated according to the number of months in an income year you own and use the asset. A daily basis applies to certain assets used in the petroleum industry. From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings reduced to 0% for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note For the 2021 to 2024 income years, depreciation on non-residential buildings was reintroduced. It returned to 0% from the 2024-25 income year. For more information see page 2 of this guide. You may not claim depreciation in the year you dispose of any asset, unless it's a building. Although the general depreciation rates are set by a formula, you can apply for a higher or lower special depreciation rate if you can establish the general rate is unsuitable for your particular circumstances. Higher depreciation rates, previously available for assets used for multiple shifts, do not apply to assets acquired after 1 April 1993. Expenditure for repairs and maintenance can be claimed as a deduction through business accounts. Anything more than repairs or maintenance is capital expenditure and is not deductible, but will be subject to normal depreciation rules. In general terms the depreciation rate options available are as follows: 1. You must use the general rates set out in determinations we issue. For assets acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, use the rates listed in the IR265 guide. 2. For assets acquired between the 1996 income year and 31 March 2005 (or 18 May 2005 for buildings, including contracts of purchase entered into before 19 May 2005) use the rates listed in parts 2 and 3 of the IR267 guide. 3. For assets acquired on or after 1 April 1993, and before the end of the 1995 income year, you can use either the rates listed in parts 2 and 3 of the IR267 guide or the rates listed in part 1 of this guide plus 25% interim loading and any shift allowances. 4. Generally, for assets acquired before 1 April 1993 you must use the depreciation rates listed in part 1 of the IR267 guide. Both straight line and diminishing value methods are available for calculating depreciation on most assets and you can switch freely between the two. Assets that cost or have an adjusted tax value of $5,000 or less can be depreciated collectively, rather than individually, using the 'pool' depreciation method (refer also next bullet for low value assets). Part 1 ird.govt.nz 6 Generally low value assets can be written off in the year of purchase or creation based on the following thresholds. Up till 16 March 2020Up to $500 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021Up to $5,000 From 17 March 2021Up to $1,000 Certain intangible assets first used or available for use after 1 April 1993 have been brought into the depreciation system. Intangible assets with a fixed life must be depreciated using the straight line method. Gains on sale or disposal must be recognised in the year of sale. Losses on sales of depreciable assets, other than buildings, are deductible in the year of sale. There are restrictions on the depreciation deductions that can be made to depreciable assets transferred between associated parties. From 1 April 1997, only those companies that are 100% commonly owned and that choose to consolidate are able to transfer assets within their group at the assets' adjusted tax value. Wholly owned companies which do not form a consolidated group are required to transfer assets at market value and recover or claim a loss of depreciation as applicable. You may be able to write off the residual tax value of any depreciable asset that you no longer use to derive gross income. Some assets cannot be depreciated for income tax purposes either because they are specifically exempted (for example, land or trading stock) or they do not reduce in value over time (for example, Lotto franchise fees). A depreciation loading no longer applies for assets acquired after 20 May 2010. The loading will only apply to qualifying assets: –acquired on or before 20 May 2010, or –where a binding contract existed on or before 20 May 2010. Compulsory depreciation claims You must claim the amount of depreciation you are entitled to unless you elect an asset not to be depreciable property. It's usually not possible to defer or only partially claim allowable depreciation. If no depreciation deduction is claimed and no election is made, you're considered to have claimed depreciation for the purposes of calculating the adjusted tax value of the asset and when calculating the depreciation recovered, see 'Disposals' on page 25. If you do not claim depreciation in your tax return, the adjusted tax value of the asset will still be reduced by the amount calculated using the appropriate method. The default method for calculating depreciation is diminishing value. For depreciation recovery purposes, where the depreciable asset is disposed of for more than the adjusted tax value, then the taxable income will be the lesser of: the previously allowed depreciation (including deemed to be allowed), or the amount by which the amount received exceeds the adjusted tax value. For assets purchased before the 1994 income year, and depending on the disposal amount, the depreciation recovered is the actual depreciation permitted under the old system (when the depreciation deduction was not compulsory) plus the allowable depreciation for the 1994 and subsequent income years. Taxpayers do not have to have claimed extra depreciation on excluded depreciable assets (generally, meaning assets purchased before 1 April 1993). This extra depreciation is allowed as either: a supplementary depreciation allowance, or a 25% interim loading. Electing not to depreciate Although it's compulsory for you to claim a depreciation deduction, we recognise there can be instances where you may not want to. If you do not want to claim depreciation on an asset, and you want to avoid paying tax on depreciation recovered when it was not claimed, you should elect not to treat the asset as depreciable. You cannot pick and choose the years in which you depreciate an asset. However, if an asset periodically will be and then will not be used in your business (such as a residential building that is temporarily let), you may choose whether or not to depreciate the asset in each period. Our Rental income - IR264 guide discusses this option in more detail. If you elect not to depreciate your asset, it will no longer be a depreciable asset and the depreciation recovery or loss on sale provisions will not apply to it. Part 1 7 DEPRECIATION Who can claim depreciation? A depreciation deduction for a particular asset is only allowed once you own the asset and it's used or available for use in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Ownership You're considered to own an asset when: you acquire legal title (binding contract), or you take up beneficial ownership, which occurs when an asset passes by way of gift, bequest or distribution to a new owner. Where there is both an equitable owner and a legal owner of the same asset, depreciation may only be claimed by the owner who uses the asset or has that asset available for use in deriving their gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate their gross income. So, to claim a depreciation deduction for an asset, you must: own it, or lease it under a specified or finance lease (see page 15), or be buying it under a hire purchase agreement. Your asset must also be expected to reduce in value while it's used or is available for use in your business. Used or available for use The following are some examples of the criteria of 'used' or 'available for use'. You cannot start claiming depreciation on any equipment purchased until your business commences. Example In April 2014, Enid purchases equipment in anticipation of setting up a home tutoring business but does not start the business until March 2015. The depreciation deduction for Enid's 2015 income year is restricted to one-twelfth of the yearly depreciation rate. Cargo ship in dry docks - conducting normal ongoing maintenance is an ordinary incidence of business and the ship would still be wholly used or available for use in carrying on the business. Plant and machinery finished and awaiting other plant - depending on the facts, if the completed plant and machinery were available for use in isolation or in another production line if required, How to make an election not to depreciate You'll need to let us know if you're making an election by attaching your notification to your tax return for the income year that you: purchase the asset, or changed the asset use from non-business to business, or elect not to depreciate an asset that you've not claimed depreciation on in any previous year. This election will then apply to every year from when the asset was purchased. Your notification needs to provide the following details: a description of the asset the purchase date the income year the election is being made for whether the asset has been newly acquired or its use has changed if the election is for retrospective depreciation. Assets that do not depreciate Some assets do not depreciate for tax purposes. These assets include: those you've elected to treat as not depreciable trading stock land (except for buildings, fixture or land improvements as specified in schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007) financial arrangements under the accrual rules intangible assets, for example, goodwill (other than depreciable intangible assets of the type listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007) low-value assets that are fully written off on acquisition an asset whose cost is allowed as a deduction under some other tax provision an asset that does not decline in economic value because of compensation for loss or damage an asset whose cost was or is allowed as a deduction in any income year to any other taxpayer under any of the special provisions relating to primary sector land improvements. Part 1 ird.govt.nz 8 the depreciation could be claimed. However, if a further machine or plant was required in order to produce a product, depreciation could not commence until that other necessary plant or machinery was available for use. Plant and machinery in storage - this depends on the degree and time of reconnection or installation required. If the item (for example, a transformer) were a back-up piece of equipment necessary to keep an operation going, it would be regarded as being available for use and would be depreciable. However, if a new piece of machinery or a new plant were being delivered and had yet to be installed (for example, being shipped in from offshore) there would be no entitlement to depreciation until the installation process was completed. Assets temporarily out of operation for repair or inspection are regarded as being available for use and can be depreciated. Cost of assets for depreciation purposes Generally, the cost of an asset is the amount paid by the purchaser - normally the market value - and this principle applies to associated persons. For further information on transfers between associated persons see page 25. If the property has been inherited, the cost price for depreciation purposes is its market value at the time the property is transferred to the new owner. The exception is for a spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner where transfer is at cost or adjusted tax value. For income tax purposes a deduction is not usually available for expenses incurred in acquiring a capital asset. This includes legal fees charged by a solicitor for preparing and registering the various documents relating to the purchase. From the 2010 income year business-related legal expenses for buying or selling a property can be deducted. This is provided your total legal expenses for the income year, including the fees associated with buying and selling a property, are equal to or less than $10,000. In all other cases, this type of expenditure may be added to the cost of the purchased asset when calculating depreciation on that asset. The depreciation you calculate each year is deducted from the value of your asset. The remaining value is called the asset's adjusted tax value. GST and depreciation If you're registered for GST (goods and services tax), you can generally claim a credit for the GST part of an asset's cost price. You calculate depreciation on the GST-exclusive price of the asset. If you are not registered for GST, you base your depreciation on the actual price you pay for an asset, including GST. Records As with all tax matters you must keep sufficient and accurate records. For depreciation purposes, your records must be able to substantiate your depreciation claims, purchases and sales of your business assets so, if we need to, we can check your deductions (including losses) and depreciation recovered. You must keep your records for at least seven years. Individual or pooled assets You can account for depreciation on your assets in two ways, as an individual asset or as part of a group or pool of assets. See 'Pooling method' in the next column. If you choose to calculate depreciation on individual assets you can use either the diminishing value (DV) method of calculating depreciation or the straight line (SL) method. If you decide to group your assets into a pool you must use the DV method for calculating depreciation. Diminishing value (DV) method With this method depreciation is calculated each year by using a constant percentage of the asset's adjusted tax value. This method is sometimes also referred to as the written down value or tax book value. The DV method means your depreciation deduction will progressively reduce each year. Example Depreciation on office equipment that cost $10,000 was calculated using the DV depreciation rate of 33%. The depreciation is calculated as follows: Adjusted tax valueDepreciation of 33% Year 1 $10,000$3,300 Year 2 $6,700$2,211 Ye a r 3$4,489$1,481 Part 1 9 DEPRECIATION Straight line (SL) method With this method an asset depreciates every year by the same amount, which is a percentage of its original cost price. This method is sometimes called the cost price basis. Example Depreciation on office equipment that cost $10,000 was calculated using the SL depreciation rate of 24%. The depreciation is calculated as follows: Adjusted tax valueDepreciation of 24% Year 1 $10,000$2,400 Year 2 $7,600$2,400 Ye a r 3$5,200$2,400 Changing methods You can choose to use either the SL or DV method for individual assets (except for pooled assets and fixed- life intangible assets) regardless of when you bought the assets. If you decide to change depreciation methods, use the current adjusted tax value to calculate depreciation and not the original cost price of the asset. Once you've filed your tax return you cannot change methods for that income year. Pooling method The pooling method allows you to group together (pool) a number of low-value assets and calculate depreciation on the pool. The advantage of pooling assets is the cost of compliance is reduced because all the assets in the pool are treated as one asset for the purposes of depreciation. The disadvantage of pooling assets is that if you sell an asset in a pool for more than its cost price, this capital gain amount must be included as taxable income. Main features of the pooling method Only diminishing value (DV) rates can be used for the pool method. Where items in the pool have different depreciation rates, the lowest rate is applied to the pool. Buildings cannot be depreciated using the pooling method. The maximum pooling value is generally $5,000 for each individual asset, but you may apply for a higher pooling value for specific assets - see page 33. For GST-registered people, the maximum pooling value excludes GST. The maximum pooling value of $5,000 applies from the 2015-2016 income year. The maximum pooling value is $2,000 prior to this. All poolable assets must be used wholly in business (no private use), or be subject to FBT (fringe benefit tax). Once an asset is included in a pool it cannot be separated out later, except where the asset must be isolated because you now use it privately. There is no restriction on the depreciation recovered for a pooled asset. Any capital gains are taxed - see page 26. When all assets in a pool have been disposed of but the pool still has a positive value, ie, the proceeds of the sale are less than the pool value, this remaining value of the pool is deductible from your gross income. Calculating depreciation for an asset pool Assets can only be pooled if individual assets within the pool each have a value equal to or less than the maximum pooling value. This maximum is currently set at $5,000, so assets that can be pooled are those that: individually cost you $5,000 or less, or have depreciated and whose adjusted tax value has been reduced to $5,000 or less. Example Hiram bought a printing machine for $5,500 and calculated depreciation using the DV method. CostDepreciation 10% DV Adjusted tax value at the end of year $5,500$550$4,950 Hiram could include the printing machine in a pool of assets for the second year. If your assets meet this requirement, you may pool any number of them and you may have as many pools as suit your circumstances. You can also combine two or more pools to form one pool. Note The maximum pooling value of $5,000 applies from the 2015-2016 income year. The maximum pooling value is $2,000 prior to this. Depreciation is calculated on the average value of the pool for the income year, using the DV method. Part 1 ird.govt.nz 10 Work out the average value of the pool by adding together the pool's value at the beginning and end of the income year, before depreciation has been deducted, and then dividing by 2. Example Adam has a pool of assets with an adjusted tax value at the beginning of the year of $18,000. During the year he purchases three assets for $5,000 each. At the end of the year, he decides to include them in the pool. The value of the pool at the end of the income year (before deducting depreciation) is $33,000. The average pool value is: $18,000 + $33,000 =$25,500 2 Adam is using the DV rate of 22%, so the depreciation deduction and the adjusted tax value of the pool will be calculated as follows: Value of pool at the end of income year 33,000 Less annual depreciation ($25,500 x 22%) -$5,610 Adjusted tax value of pool$27,390 Where your income year is longer or shorter than 12 months because of a change in balance date, you'll need to apportion the annual depreciation to the number of whole or part months in your income year. When the assets in the pool have different depreciation rates you must use the lowest rate. This could happen when different types of assets are included in a pool. Example Richard owns a shop and these are some of his assets that he could pool. Cash register 40% DV Electric sign 20% DV Fittings 20% DV Furniture 20% DV The rate for this pool would be 20% DV. In a case such as this, Richard may decide to pool only those assets with the 20% DV depreciation rate and account for depreciation on the cash register separately or as an asset in another pool. In the first year of pooling, it's very important to carefully consider the date from which you'll pool your assets, because it will have a significant effect on the average pool value used when calculating depreciation. If you decide to pool your assets part-way through an income year, the pool value at the beginning of the income year will be nil. The amount of depreciation you can claim will be based on half the pool value at the end of the income year. Example Anne starts a business on 15 May 2013 and purchases five assets for $2,000 each, which she pools. She has a 31 March balance date and uses a depreciation rate of 20% DV. Her 2014 depreciation deduction is calculated as follows: Calculate average pool value: Pool value at beginning of year (1 April 2013)nil Pool value at end of year (31 March 2014)$10,000 Divide by 2 to average$5,000 Calculate annual depreciation: $5,000 x 20% x 11 months = $916.66 depreciation 12 (The 11 months is 15 May 2013 to 31 March 2014.) Adding assets to a pool The adjusted tax value of an existing pool is increased by: the cost price of the asset (if it's newly acquired), or the adjusted tax value of the asset (if it was previously depreciated separately). If assets are added to the pool at the beginning of an income year, the pool values at both the beginning and end of the year will increase. If the assets are added to the pool part-way through the income year, only the pool value at the end of the year will increase. Part 1 11 DEPRECIATION Rates Once you've decided on the method (or methods) you'll use to account for depreciation, you have to identify the correct rate for calculating the amount of the deduction. The correct depreciation rate to use depends on the date you acquired the asset. To find the depreciation rates for all depreciable assets acquired after 1 April 1993, use our depreciation rate finder at ird.govt.nz/depreciation For assets acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005, use the rates listed in the IR265 guide. For all assets acquired before these dates refer to our IR267 guide. These guides are available on our website ird.govt.nz Loading Any asset purchased from 21 May 2010 onwards is not entitled to the 20% depreciation loading. If you entered into a contract to purchase an asset on or before 20 May 2010, you can still depreciate this asset with the loading. Any asset being depreciated at a rate with loading before 21 May 2010 can continue to be depreciated at that rate for that asset's lifetime. However, if there is a capital improvement to an asset with the 20% loading, this improvement will need to be depreciated separately from the original asset, and will be depreciated without the loading allowance. Provisional and special rates If we haven't set a general depreciation rate for your particular type of asset, you may apply for a provisional rate to be set - see page 32. General depreciation rates are based on the average use of an asset. If you believe you use your asset more heavily or less heavily than is generally the case, or the conditions in which the asset is used are abnormal, you may want to apply for a special rate - see page 32. How rates are calculated If you'd like to know how we work out the general rates for assets see page 30. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 12 Depreciation on buildings, unlike other assets, can be claimed in the year of sale. Buildings do not qualify for the increased loading of 25% on the historic rates or 20% on the general rates. Buildings are not eligible for the special deduction for assets you no longer use - see page 34. Generally, when a personal (non-business) asset is introduced into a business, the market value at that time is used to calculate depreciation. This rule does not apply to buildings, where the original cost (excluding land) must be used for calculating depreciation. Buildings transferred between companies where there is 100% common ownership or transfers under a relationship agreement can continue to use the depreciation rate applying to the building at the time of transfer. Depreciation claims on buildings acquired before the 1994 income year must be calculated using the SL method. However, you can choose between the SL and the DV methods to calculate depreciation for the 1994 and future income years for assets acquired before 1 April 1993. Depreciation on buildings is calculated on either the original cost or the adjusted tax value depending on which depreciation method you use. The first time you use the DV method you need to calculate the adjusted tax value of your building. The building's depreciation is calculated on this amount. To work out the adjusted tax value, deduct the amount of depreciation you've claimed since you bought the building, from the original cost of the building (excluding land). Sale of buildings When a building is sold for more than its adjusted tax value, the depreciation recovered is taxable income. The amount of depreciation recovered is the smaller of: the original cost price of the building minus the adjusted tax value the sale price minus the adjusted tax value. This ensures any capital profit made on the sale of a building is not included as taxable income. Losses made when selling or disposing of buildings are generally not deductible. This section provides further information on certain assets of particular interest. Buildings From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings reduced to 0% for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties, including leasehold property. If the type of building you own currently has an estimated useful life, as determined by Inland Revenue, of less than 50 years you can simply continue to claim depreciation deductions as you have previously. Note From the 2021 to 2024 income years depreciation on non-residential buildings was reintroduced. It returned to 0% from the 2024-25 income year. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Even though many buildings can no longer be depreciated, depreciation recovery will still apply for those buildings when they're sold for greater than their book value. This applies regardless of when the building was acquired. The chattels and fit-out of a building, where it does not form part of the building, can still be depreciated. Interpretation statement (IS) 10/01: Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable property sets out a three-step test that we apply to determine whether an item can be separated out or whether it's regarded as being part of the building. You can find this in our Ta x Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). Further information on the treatment of commercial or industrial building fit-outs, 'Clarifying that certain building fit-out is depreciable property', is available in Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 23, No 1 (February 2011). These special rules also apply to buildings. When disposing of a building a loss cannot be claimed as a deduction, except where due to an emergency event, eg, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters, the building has been rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income and is demolished. See 'Event' page 36. Buildings cannot be pooled. Part 2 - Detailed information on certain assets Part 2 13 DEPRECIATION Definition of a 'building' The term 'building' can have various meanings depending on the context in which the term is used. A building in ordinary circumstances is defined as: a structure of considerable size permanent in the sense that it's intended to last a considerable time enclosed by walls and a roof able to function independently of any other structure. However, a building is not necessarily a physically separate structure. Interpretation statement (IS) 22/04: Claiming depreciation on buildings provides guidance to building owners on claiming depreciation on buildings. It considers the meaning of 'building' for depreciation purposes and the distinction between residential and non-residential buildings. You can find this at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz Resource consents The ability to depreciate expenditure on a resource consent depends on the type of expenditure, the type of consent and the resulting asset. Interpretation Statement (IS) 18/06: Income tax – Treatment of costs of resource consents provides a full treatment of these issues and when expenditure on resource consents may be depreciable. You can download this statement from our website ird.govt.nz Land You cannot claim depreciation on land because land, generally, does not depreciate. When land and buildings are purchased and the price does not specify the cost of the buildings, the government valuation (at the time of purchase) may be used to calculate this cost: Value of improvements (buildings) × purchase price = cost of buildings Capital value (land and buildings) Land improvements Land improvements, however, may depreciate, and since 1 April 1993 there has been the provision for specific fixtures on the land (non-primary sector land) to be depreciated. These fixtures as listed in schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 are: airport runways bores and wells bridges chimneys culverts dams fences hardstanding (for example, asphalt car park) pipes purpose-built surfaces for outdoor sports facilities reservoirs retaining walls roads spillways swimming pools tanks tunnels wharves. In the same manner as plant and machinery, these fixtures are depreciable at the general rates if made in the 1996 and later income years. They also qualify for the 20% loading if made in the 1996 income year and before 21 May 2010. Expenditure on farm and forestry land and aquaculture improvements Although land is not a depreciable asset, there are provisions allowing you to progressively deduct expenditure incurred in preparing or otherwise developing land within the farming, agriculture, forestry and aquaculture industries. This differs from the depreciation of other land improvements. While depreciation is subject to the period the asset was used during the financial year, the deduction for the development expenditure is not time based. You can claim the full percentage of the deduction (plus any loading) even if the development expenditure occurs near the end of the financial year, provided the expenditure benefits the business in that income year. Deductions are allowed for losses on farm land improvements where an event has occurred either destroying or rendering the improvements useless for deriving income. When the land is sold there is no taxable recovery of any deductions allowed for the capitalised development expenditure. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 14 When the land is sold the undeducted balance of the development expenditure can be transferred to the new owner. The capitalised development expenditure effectively stays with the land, rather than with the person who incurred it. We recommend you consult a tax agent when considering this. Taxpayers involved in the primary sector may claim depreciation for assets listed in schedule 13. However, they may only do so when they cannot claim the expenditure under section DO 1 or DO 2 or schedule 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007. To read tax legislation online, go to legislation.govt.nz The following are some examples of the specific provisions applying to farming and agriculture (schedule 20 of the Income Tax Act 2007) for land improvements. Clearing land The expenditure incurred in clearing land is deductible in the year it was incurred. Cultivating land The expenditure incurred in cultivating land is deductible on a DV basis (similar to depreciation) at the rate of 5% each year. Expenditure incurred between 16 December 1991 and the end of the taxpayer's 1995 income year qualifies for a 25% loading, ie, 6.25%. Expenditure incurred in the 1996 or any subsequent income year (up until 1 April 2013) qualifies for a 20% loading, ie, 6%. Irrigation system and plant This is capital expenditure so normal depreciation rules apply. Installing tile drains This is deductible on a DV basis at the annual rate of 5% (plus any loading). This same rate would apply to the cost of replacing a tile drainage system. The fact that the retiling may be done over a period longer than one year does not affect the deduction that can be claimed. A loss cannot be claimed on the old system because it's scrapped, nor can a continued deduction be made for the old system since the asset is no longer of benefit to the business. Sinking a bore This is deductible on a DV basis at the rate of 5% (plus any loading) each year. Regrassing and fertilising Expenditure incurred in connection with significant capital activity, such as a change from one type of farming to another, is deductible on a DV basis at the rate of 45% each year. Leased assets For tax purposes there are four kinds of lease. The type of lease determines whether the lessor (owner) or the lessee (person paying to use the asset) is entitled to claim depreciation on the asset. Specified leases A specified lease is a lease agreement entered into between 6 August 1982 and 19 May 1999 that meets certain criteria. The lease is a specified lease if: it has a guaranteed residual value, or the lease term is more than 36 consecutive months (or, if we consider the economic life of the asset is less than 36 months, a term equal to the economic life of the lease asset), and –the lessee becomes the owner at the end of the term, or –the lessee has the option to purchase the asset at the end of the term at a price significantly lower than market value, or –the total of all payments and the guaranteed residual value is more than, or roughly equal to, the cost price, or –both parties agree the lessee is liable for the payment of all, or nearly all, maintenance and other incidental costs. Specified leases include: leases acquired by any means whatsoever, whether from the lessor or another person, and leases entered into between 28 October 1983 and 19 May 1999 (both dates inclusive) if a person other than the lessee acquires the asset and they are associated with the lessee. A 20% depreciation loading applied to farming and agriculture land improvements acquired before 1 April 2013. Part 2 15 DEPRECIATION Finance leases A finance lease is an agreement entered into on or after 20 May 1999 under which: ownership of the asset is transferred to the lessee (or an associate of the lessee) at the end of the term, or the lessee (or an associate of the lessee) has the option of acquiring the asset for an amount significantly lower than market value, or the lease term is more than 75% of the asset's estimated useful life (as determined under section EE63 of the Income Tax Act 2007). For income years including 20 June 2007 and later income years, the lease, or an arrangement of which the lease is part, must: involve the use of the lease asset outside New Zealand for all or most of the term of the lease, and involve income from the use of the asset by any person other than the lessor which is exempt, excluded or non-residents' foreign sourced income, and be an arrangement in which substantially all the risks and rewards that are incidental to ownership are incurred by persons other than the lessor and/ or it's a finance lease under NZIAS 17 either for the lessor or for another company in the same group of companies that derives assessable income from the arrangement. With both specified and finance leases, the lessor is treated as selling the asset to the lessee at the beginning of the lease. Therefore, the lessee is the owner and is entitled to the deduction for depreciation. Hire purchase A hire purchase agreement passing ownership to the person paying the hire purchase allows that person to claim any allowable depreciation. This provision overrides the general provision that limits the claim to the owner of the asset. Leasehold improvements A lessee is considered to own and be entitled to claim depreciation on the cost of leasehold fixtures or improvements incurred by that lessee, but under land law principles are technically owned by the lessor. When the lease expires, to calculate the loss on disposal, the lessee is considered to have disposed of the fixture or improvement. The lessor, including subsequent lessors, will not be able to depreciate such fixtures or improvements during the term of the lease. However, once the lease has expired, the lessor will be able to depreciate the fixtures and improvements if they have paid the lessee for these. This also applies when the lessee transfers the lease and the person the lease is transferred to pays the original lessee for the leasehold improvements. The same applies to licences to occupy. Non-specified and operating leases If a lease was entered into between 6 August 1982 and 19 May 1999 and it is not a specified lease, it's known as a non-specified lease. If the lease was entered into on or after 20 May 1999 and it is not a finance lease, it's an operating lease. For these kinds of leases, the owner (lessor) of the lease asset claims the deduction for depreciation. Renting out a residential property You must claim depreciation on a house or flat you're renting out as a deduction from the rent you receive, unless you make an election for the asset not to be a depreciable asset. You must also claim depreciation on any contents in the house or flat being used or available for use by the tenants, unless you elect otherwise - see page 6. Depreciation rules for the house itself are covered under 'Buildings' on page 12. The contents of the house may be depreciated either on an individual item basis or using the pooling method - see page 9. If you're calculating depreciation on contents for the first time, the adjusted tax value will be the lesser of the cost of those items or their market value at the time they're first used or available for use in earning rental income. The rates for house or flat contents are set out in the industry category 'Residential rental property chattels'. You can find this in our depreciation rate finder on ird.govt.nz/depreciation Or, you can use our guides IR265 for chattels acquired on or after 1 April 2005, and the IR267 for chattels acquired on or after 1 April 1993 and up to 31 March 2005. Depreciable item distinct from the building If an item in a residential rental property is distinct from the building and meets the definition of 'depreciable property', it may be depreciated separately. If an item is part of the building it cannot be depreciated separately, but can be depreciated with the building. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 16 It's important that the correct approach is applied to determine if these items are regarded as distinct from the building. To determine whether a particular item is part of or separate from the building there is a three- step test. 1. The item is in some way attached or connected to the building. 2. The item is an integral part of the residential rental property, so it wouldn't function as a rental without it. 3. The item is built-in or attached/connected in such a way that it's part of the 'fabric' of the building. Full commentary on Interpretation statement (IS) 10/01: Residential rental properties - Depreciation of items of depreciable properties can be found in the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 22, No 4 (May 2010). For more information, read our IR264 guide. It explains the taxable income and deductible expenses for people who own rental property. Holiday homes Where a holiday home is considered to be a 'rental' property, depreciation may be claimed. The proportion of depreciation claimed on the assets will vary depending on the degree of actual rental time. The facts of a particular case always need to be considered carefully and so it may be necessary to seek advice from a tax advisor before making any claim for depreciation or other expenses on a holiday home. You can find more information on income tax treatment of holiday homes in the Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 21, No 3 (May 2009). Intangible assets Depreciating intangible assets Certain intangible assets have been included in the depreciation rules, and can be depreciated under the general rules applying to other depreciable assets. The only difference is that the rules apply to intangible assets acquired or created on or after 1 April 1993, rather than from a taxpayer's 1994 income or non- standard balance date accounting year. Intangible assets acquired or created after 1 April 1993 that are depreciable, intangible property, are limited to those listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and they all have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of creation or acquisition. In brief, the intangible assets covered by schedule 14 are: a patent, or the right to use a patent the right to use a copyright, trademark, design, plan or similar the right to use land, plant or machinery software copyright management rights and licence rights created under the Radiocommunications Act 1989 consents granted under the Resource Management Act 1991 copyright in a sound recording plant variety rights, or the right to use them. To be depreciable, an intangible asset must be both: an asset of the type listed in schedule 14 an asset that might reasonably be expected to decline in value under normal circumstances. The most common feature of the assets listed in schedule 14 is the 'right to use'. Take, for example, costs incurred in designing and producing a logo. A logo is not listed in the schedule so the costs are considered to be a one-off capital cost and not depreciable. If the logo, once created, is then trademarked and the rights to use are sold, the purchaser can depreciate those rights. The depreciation rules vary according to whether or not intangible assets have a fixed life or an economic life. Intangible assets with a fixed life An intangible asset with a fixed life is any intangible asset that is depreciable with a legal life that could reasonably be expected, on the date of creation or acquisition of that asset, to be the same length as the asset's remaining estimated useful life. If an intangible asset falls into this category, the depreciation rate is self-assessed by the owner using the formula: 1 Legal life (years) The 20% depreciation loading does not apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. Part 2 17 DEPRECIATION In such cases the 'legal life' is defined as the length of time the intangible asset may exist as specified by the contract or statute that created it. In addition, legal life will include any renewal or extension period where those renewals or extensions are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of a predetermined fee. The formula gives an SL depreciation rate. The SL method is the only depreciation method that can be used for fixed-life intangible assets. Intangible assets with a fixed life are not eligible for the 20% loading that applies from the 1996 income year until 20 May 2010. Example Mark acquired the right to use a registered trademark from 1 April 2006 with a value of $10,000 and a legal life of five years. Using the above formula, the depreciation rate Mark would use is: 1 =0.2 or 20% 5 Mark can claim a $2,000 deduction for depreciation each year. Note A special depreciation rate may be applied if the economic life is different from the legal life of the intangible asset. Intangible assets with an economic life If the intangible asset does not have a fixed life, it can be expected to have an economic life shorter than its legal life. Unlike fixed-life intangible assets, economic- life intangible assets are depreciated using the same methods applied to all tangible depreciable assets, ie, a DV or SL depreciation rate. They can be pooled and, if purchased between 1996 and 20 May 2010, are eligible for a 20% loading. Taxpayers can also apply for a special or provisional depreciation rate for economic life intangibles. For example, a taxpayer may obtain a licence to use computer software for life, whereas the economic life of that software would possibly only be three years. Franchises Franchise agreements are not a category of intangible assets listed in schedule 14 so they are not normally considered to be depreciable intangible assets. However, any particular franchise agreement may give rise to specific rights listed in schedule 14, for example, the right to use a trademark. Remember, the rights are the depreciable intangible assets, not the franchise agreement. If a franchise agreement stipulates a mixture of rights, and one particular right is specifically listed in schedule 14 and is capable of being separately and clearly isolated and valued, that right will be a depreciable intangible asset, provided it might reasonably be expected to decline in value under normal circumstances. Whether or not the rights conferred under a franchise agreement are considered to be the type listed in schedule 14, they will not be depreciable if any of the following situations apply: You cannot estimate with any reasonable degree of certainty a finite and defined period of life. The rights are not expected to decline in value over their life. The payment is made to purchase goodwill rather than the rights to secret formulas, processes, trademarks or similar. If a right conferred under a franchise agreement is depreciable, it will usually have a legal life equivalent to its estimated useful life. Accordingly, it must be depreciated using the SL method as an intangible asset with a fixed life. If a right conferred under a franchise agreement is automatically renewed or the right to renewal is only subject to the payment of a predetermined fee, the legal life of that right will be equal to the full term of the agreement, assuming the right to renewal is taken up. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 18 Example Cherrypoppin Ltd paid $50,000 to acquire the New Zealand franchise rights to manufacture and distribute Rolloseal towel rails. The franchise agreement is for a 10-year period. The majority of the $50,000 franchise fee went to capital expenditure, however, $20,000 of the fee related to the right to use a patent. The franchise was acquired on 1 April 2006 to extend until 1 April 2016. The right to use the patent is a fixed-life intangible asset. When the franchise was purchased, it appeared the right to use the patent would remain valuable to the end of its legal life. The legal life of this fixed-life intangible asset is 10 years. The SL depreciation rate to be used by Cherrypoppin Ltd for the right to use a patent is: 1/10 = 10% on cost of $20,000. The annual depreciation is $2,000. Additional costs Any additional costs, incurred in relation to an intangible asset with a fixed life during the legal life of that asset, are added to the book value. This is done at the beginning of the income year in which the costs are incurred. The aggregate costs are depreciated over the remaining legal life of that intangible asset (calculated from the beginning of the year in which they are incurred). A legal life includes any renewal or extension period where the renewal or extension is essentially unconditional or conditional only on the payment of predetermined fees. So, the depreciation rate for the fixed-life intangible asset changes. In effect, the fixed-life intangible asset is treated as newly acquired from the beginning of that year for the sum of the adjusted tax value and additional costs. Example Karion Ltd acquires the right to use a copyright for five years for $10,000 and has an option to renew for a further five years on payment of an additional $5,000. The legal life is therefore: 1/10 = 10% on cost of $10,000. The annual depreciation is $1,000. In the first five years, Karion Ltd claims annual deductions totalling $5,000. In year six, Karion Ltd pays the additional $5,000. The sum of the adjusted tax value and additional cost is $10,000 ($5,000 + $5,000). The remaining legal life of the right is five years, so the depreciation rate for years six to ten is: 1/5 = 20% on cost of $10,000. The annual depreciation in years six to ten is $2,000. It is necessary to calculate a loss or gain on disposal of a depreciable intangible asset - see page 26. Patents Patent rights acquired after 1 April 1993 are also depreciable intangible assets. Timing of depreciation For patent applications lodged before 1 April 2005 and granted in the 2005-06 income year or later, depreciation begins from the date the application is granted. However, there's a catch-up deduction for the period between when the application is lodged and when it's granted. For patent applications lodged on or after 1 April 2005, depreciation begins from the date the patent application is lodged with a complete specification. Depreciation rates for patents Patents have a legal life of 20 years, which is 240 months. To work out the depreciation rate divide the number of months in that year by 240. For patents with applications lodged before 1 April 2005 and granted in the 2005-06 tax year or later, divide the number of months the patent was pending by 240 to give the catch-up depreciation rate. Further details on the tax implications of selling patents are covered on page 27. Part 2 19 DEPRECIATION Example 1 - Patent application lodged before 1 April 2005 Kariov filed for a patent on a new type of footwear on 4 April 2004. The patent is granted on 2 June 2007. The total patent costs were $10,000. The depreciation for the patent would be calculated as follows: Depreciation catch-up (April 04-May 07) 38 months/240 months = 16% on cost of $10,000 = $1,600 depreciation\* Annual rate for the year (June 07-March 08) 10 months/240 months = 4% on cost of $10,000 = $400 depreciation\* 2008-09 income year onwards 12 months/240 months = 5% on cost of $10,000 = $500 depreciation (as the SL method must be used). Kariov will be able to claim $500 each year until the patent expires. \* The total depreciation for the 2007-08 income year would be $2,000 ($1,600+$400) Example 2 - Application lodged after 1 April 2005 KIZ Ltd files for a patent on a new type of cat-door. It lodged its application with complete specification on 15 September 2005. The patent is granted on 21 February 2008. The depreciation rate for the patent application and for the patent (once granted) would be calculated as follows: Depreciation rate for patent application 2005-06 income year (Sept 05 to Mar 06) 7 months/240 months = 0.03 2006-07 income year 12 months/240 months = 0.05 2007-08 income year (April 07-Jan 08) 10 months/240 months = 0.04\* Depreciation rate for patent 2007-08 income year (Feb 08-Mar 08) 2 months/240 months = 0.01\* 2008-09 income year onwards 12 months/240 months = 0.05 \* The total depreciation rate for the 2007-08 income year would be 0.05 (0.04+0.01) For more information on depreciation on patents see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 17, No 7 (September 2005). Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Fishing quotas There are two types of fishing quota: individual term quotas (ITQs), which are issued in perpetuity transferable term quotas (TTQs), which are issued for fixed periods. Most fishing quotas give the owner the right to catch a defined percentage of the total allowable commercial catch, so do not fall within any of the classes of intangible assets listed in schedule 14. Also, the majority of quotas issued to date have been ITQs, which have an indefinite life, and are not depreciable anyway. Please note that a TTQ is depreciable property - specifically, it is fixed-life intangible property. For more information about fishing quotas, please refer to our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 12, No 3 (March 2000). Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Distribution network assets Distribution networks convey electricity, gas, water, and telecommunications. The individual assets within that network are depreciated at the rate applicable to that individual asset (individual assets are known as ‘items of depreciable property’ for depreciation purposes). This is known as the component approach. No depreciation rate exists for the composite group of assets that make up the network. Treating the entire distribution network as an item of depreciable property is known as the ‘network approach’. It is common for distribution networks to pool ‘like’ assets and depreciate them using the ‘pool method’ (see page 9). These asset pools are not ‘networks’ but do contain large numbers of generally low value assets with similar characteristics. It is important to recognise that while, for convenience, asset pools are depreciated using the lowest rate for items in the pool, the item of depreciable property does not lose its identity as an individual asset simply because it is depreciated as part of an asset pool. For this reason, repairs and maintenance are considered in relation to each asset in the pool, not the asset pool itself. The component approach applies from the 2008/2009 income year. If a network approach has been used, then the component approach must now be used from the 2024/25 income year. Part 2 ird.govt.nz 20 Computer software This section explains our policy on the tax treatment of computer software expenditure. Some of the terms used in our software policy are explained below. Development The following activities are likely to be part of a development phase: gathering and analysing user requirements designing systems developing detailed software specifications constructing programs testing software testing the user or customer (acceptance testing) developing manuals and training material preparing documents for use in ongoing software product maintenance providing management review throughout the development phase (for example, quality assurance). Maintenance The following activities will generally be accepted as deductible maintenance payments: developing helpdesk facilities fixing program bugs bringing performance up to the original specifications making minor changes, such as increasing field sizes. Predevelopment This term refers to a feasibility study of a project as part of ongoing business. Software Software includes all programs or routines used to cause a computer to perform a desired task or set of tasks, and the documentation and training materials required to describe and maintain these programs. Upgrade Generally, an upgrade of computer software: adds new features to the structure increases its capacity or performance extends the life of the software provides a new version of the software that has more capacity or increased performance. Categories of software expenditure For tax purposes, software expenditure is divided into six categories, each treated differently. Software purchases Cost of purchase should be capitalised and depreciated. Immediate write-off is available for software costing less than $1000. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Specified lease of software Cost price of software must be capitalised and depreciated. Interest component of lease payments may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Cost of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Software developed in-house for use in business Predevelopment expenses may be deducted. Development expenses must be capitalised until the project is completed and depreciated. Costs of unsuccessful development may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Costs of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Commissioned software Development costs must be capitalised until the project is accepted. It must then be depreciated. Costs of unsuccessful development may be deducted. Maintenance costs may be deducted. Costs of upgrades must be capitalised and depreciated. Software leased other than under a specified lease Lease payments are deductible over the term of the lease. Software developed for sale or licence Development costs are deductible in the year they are incurred. The value of unbilled work in progress and unsold completed software must be taken into account as trading stock. The value of trading stock at balance date must be included as income in your return for that income year. Part 2 21 DEPRECIATION Where a payment covers both maintenance and upgrading, the cost must be apportioned between the two. The cost of maintenance is deductible and the cost of upgrading must be capitalised, taking account of depreciation. Reservation of title clause (also known as Romalpa clause) Depreciation can be deducted from depreciable assets purchased subject to a reservation of title clause (ie, where the contract provides that the vendor reserves title to the asset until the purchase price has been paid but allows the purchaser to take possession of the asset before payment). Note Reservation of title clause does not apply to hire purchase assets subject to hire purchase agreements - see Hire purchase and Leasehold improvements on page 15. Where you purchase an asset subject to a reservation of title clause you're considered to own (and the vendor is considered not to own) the asset on the later date of entering the contract or taking possession of the asset. This considered ownership remains until: title to the asset passes to you the vendor repossesses the asset. If the asset is repossessed you're considered to have disposed of the asset at cost, less the net amount already paid to the vendor. Example Purchase price of an asset $10,000 Amount purchaser paid towards the asset $5,000 Asset repossessed - vendor refunds $3,000 This means the net payment for the asset has been $2,000. The purchaser is considered to have sold the asset for $8,000, so the depreciation recovered is calculated on the considered sale price of $8,000. The vendor of the asset will not be able to depreciate the asset while you, the purchaser, are deemed to own it. Low value assets (including loose tools) Low value assets, are deductible in the year they're acquired or created, provided: they are not purchased from the same supplier at the same time as other assets to which the same depreciation rate applies the assets will not become part of an asset that is depreciable, for example, the cost of materials to build a wall in a factory. Assets are considered low value where their cost was as follows: Up till 16 March 2020Up to $500 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021Up to $5,000 From 17 March 2021Up to $1,000 If you're GST-registered, the cost is GST-exclusive and if you're not GST-registered, then the cost is GST- inclusive. If you sell an asset you've claimed this deduction for, or you start using it mainly for private purposes, you'll have to account for it in your next tax return. If the asset is sold, the entire sale proceeds are taxable in the year the asset is sold. If the asset becomes a private asset, the market value of the asset when it's first used privately will be taxable income. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 22 Part 3 - Adjustments and disposals This part deals with adjustments you might make and how the various ways of disposing of depreciable assets will be treated for tax purposes. This includes calculating depreciation in the following situations: newly acquired assets private use of business assets transferring depreciable assets between associated persons private assets becoming business assets disposals transferring assets under a relationship agreement transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies local authority trading enterprises determinations. Newly acquired assets If you're using either the SL or DV methods you can claim depreciation for each calendar month or part- month you own an asset and it's used or available to be used in deriving your gross income or in carrying on a business that aims to generate your gross income. Example Craig buys a new cash register on 27 January 2010 for $7,000, which he uses 100% in his business. Craig's balance date is 31 March and he uses a DV rate of 48% (including 20% loading). This is how he calculates his 2010 depreciation deduction: Three months' use (January, February, March 2010) 12 months' income year (1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010) The depreciation deduction is: Even though he owned the cash register for only a few days in January, Craig can claim depreciation for the entire month. If you have pooled assets you may add a newly acquired asset to a pool - see page 9. Private use of business assets Use the most appropriate unit of measurement when calculating how much a business asset, other than a motor vehicle, is used privately, such as square metres for area or hours and minutes for time. When a business motor vehicle is used privately and the use is subject to FBT (fringe benefit tax), you do not need to adjust the depreciation deduction to exclude the private use. This is because FBT itself is a way of accounting for the non-business use. However, self-employed people (including partners in a partnership) who use a business vehicle for private purposes, must apportion the vehicle's depreciation between business and non-business use. If you keep an accurate vehicle logbook as an ongoing record, you can make a precise apportionment for depreciation. Alternatively, you may keep a record for a minimum of three months to establish an apportionment that may then be used for three years, provided the business use of the vehicle does not change by more than 20%. Example Mike is a self-employed salesperson. He bought a car for $30,000 at the beginning of the income year and 85% of its use is for business purposes. Mike's car has a DV rate of 36% (including 20% loading) and depreciation on the car is calculated as: Step 1 Opening adjusted tax value $30,000 Depreciation $10,800 Closing adjusted value $19,200 Step 2 Total depreciation $10,800 Less 15% private use (non-deductible) $1,620 Equals 85% business use (deductible) $9,180 Part 3 23 DEPRECIATION The adjusted tax value is calculated taking into account 100% of the annual depreciation, not just the deductible proportion - see the table below. YearOpening adjusted tax value DepreciationClosing adjusted tax value Deductible portion 130,00010,80019,2009,180 (85%) 219,2006,91212,2885,875 (85%) 312,2884,4247,8643,760 (85%) When a business asset that's been used privately is sold, resulting in either depreciation recovered or a loss, the loss or gain must be apportioned between business and private use. Calculate the apportionment using this formula: a - b × c a = adjusted tax value at time of sale b = sale price c = percentage of business use Example If Mike, from the previous example, sells his car after three years for $6,000, the loss on the sale must be apportioned between business and private use. Business purposes made up 85% of the car's use. The deductible portion of the loss on the sale is calculated as: Adjusted tax value (at time of sale) $7,864 Sale price -$6,000 $1,864 85% business use of $1,864 $1,584 Mike can claim $1,584 as loss on the sale. The 20% depreciation loading does not apply to assets acquired after 20 May 2010. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 24 Transferring depreciable assets between associated persons Under normal rules a purchaser is entitled to claim depreciation based on the purchase price of an asset. The new owner of a secondhand asset can claim depreciation based on the amount paid for the asset, as long as it's an arm's length sale where: the sale is bona fide the purchase price is a fair market value for the asset the purchaser buys the asset for use in income- producing activities and the seller no longer uses it for income-producing activities. The fact the parties are related does not prevent depreciation being claimed. In the case of transfers of assets between associated persons (apart from assets transferred under a relationship agreement - see page 29) a restriction applies to the amount and rate of depreciation that may be claimed by the person acquiring the asset. Depreciation on an asset is restricted to the base value of the asset purchased from an associate, being the lower of: the price the seller originally paid for the asset (or, if applicable, the market value of the asset at the time the associated seller was first entitled to depreciate the asset) the price paid by the buyer. This applies unless we give written approval to use the price paid by the buyer. To grant approval, we must consider such treatment is appropriate in the circumstances. Restrictions on the depreciation rate The depreciation rate that may be applied to an asset acquired from an associate cannot be higher than the depreciation rate applied to the asset by that associated seller. If a different depreciation method is used, the restriction applies so the depreciation rate used must not exceed a rate equivalent to that used by the associate. This restriction does not apply if: the value being used for the transfer is gross income to the associated seller, other than under the provisions for depreciation recovered the asset is intangible with a fixed life. The depreciation rate for such intangible assets is calculated using a formula that spreads the cost of the fixed-life intangible asset evenly across its remaining life. The restrictions on the base value of an asset, and the depreciation rate that may be used with the asset, apply whether the asset is transferred directly or indirectly to an associate. Private assets becoming business assets If a private asset becomes a business asset, depreciation is first calculated on the market value of that asset when it was first used in the business (except in the case of buildings, which must always be depreciated on cost - see page 12). Whether or not the market value is GST-inclusive depends on whether you are registered for GST. However, if we ask, you must be able to provide documentation (for example, a valuation) showing how you arrived at the market value. Note Buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more have a depreciation rate of 0% from the 2011- 12 income year. Note For the 2021 to 2024 income years, depreciation on non-residential buildings was reintroduced. It returned to 0% from the 2024-25 income year. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Disposals Selling and disposing of assets When you sell or dispose of an asset (other than a pooled asset) for a different amount from its adjusted tax value, you must make an adjustment in your end- of-year tax return to account for the loss or gain. If the asset has been used for both business and non-business purposes, you must apportion any loss or gain on disposal between business and non-business use. You cannot claim a deduction for depreciation in the year you dispose of an asset, except in the case of buildings. Costs incurred in selling an asset, such as commission and advertising, can be deducted from the sale price before you work out the loss or gain on sale. The adjustment is generally made in the year you sell or dispose of an asset, except when the disposal is because business has ceased. See page 28 for depreciation adjustments when a business ceases. Part 3 25 DEPRECIATION When a group of assets is sold for a lump sum it may sometimes be necessary to apportion the sale price between the various assets. If, for example, a group of assets that were sold included business and private assets or assets that do not depreciate, such as land, an apportionment would have to be made. We may sometimes ask for an independent valuation of assets if we decide the apportionment agreed to by the buyer and the seller is not acceptable. What constitutes a disposal The term 'disposal' includes: an asset that is compulsorily acquired an asset taken out of New Zealand (other than only temporarily) changes in use or location of use of a business asset ceasing intangible asset rights an asset that is irreparably damaged - see page 28 any distribution of assets, including distributions of assets to the beneficial owners for no cost ceasing deemed ownership of a fixture or improvement - see page 15 an asset that is lost or stolen if that asset is not recovered in the income year when the loss or theft occurs - see page 28 an asset contributed to a partnership by a person. A disposal or sale of a depreciable asset triggers either a gain or loss on disposal. A gain on disposal or sale Where there's no election for an asset not to be a depreciable asset and the sale price received for the asset exceeds the adjusted tax value, the lesser of the following amounts must be included as gross income in that income year: the total depreciation that could have been deducted since the asset was purchased or first used in the business (this amount relates to the allowable depreciation deduction rather than the amount of depreciation actually deducted), or the amount by which the sale price received exceeds the adjusted tax value. Note For any asset owned prior to the 1994 income year, only the actual amount of depreciation claimed prior to the 1994 income year needs to be taken into account. You still need to work out the amount of depreciation that could have been claimed from the 1994 income year until date of sale. A loss on disposal or sale When you sell or dispose of an asset for less than its adjusted tax value, the difference between this consideration and the adjusted tax value is allowed as a deduction. If an asset is sold for less than its market value we can fix the sale price as the market value of the asset. This may happen if you sold an asset to someone close to you or your business, for example, a relative or a shareholder of the company. In this situation, the actual sale price may be ignored and the calculations made as if the asset was sold for its market value. The exception to this is when you dispose of pooled assets. For the treatment of pooled assets - see 'Disposing of pooled assets' on page 27. Note A deduction for loss on disposal does not apply to buildings, unless due to an event the building has been damaged or affected by its surroundings rendering it useless for the purposes of deriving income. See pages 12 and 37. Disposing of intangible assets You must calculate a loss or gain when disposing of a depreciable intangible asset. This will include calculating loss or gain from disposing of any franchise rights that are depreciable - see page 18. A disposal of an intangible asset must fall within one of the following two circumstances: any event which means that the owner can no longer apply, at any time, the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset, or any event that causes the asset to be irreparably damaged. A disposal of an intangible asset does not include disposing of that asset as part of an arrangement to replace it with an asset of the same type. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 26 Where a depreciable intangible asset is considered worthless it's unlikely ceasing to use that intangible asset could be seen as a disposal. A disposal of such an asset must fall within one of the following circumstances: any event which means the owner can no longer apply, at any time, the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset any event that causes the asset to be irreparably damaged any event which means the rights that form or are part of an intangible asset are moved overseas. Although worthless, you still have the legal right to use the intangible assets, and they have probably not been irreparably damaged - it's just the value of those assets that has diminished. The write-off provisions could apply to intangible assets. We need to be satisfied: the intangible asset will no longer be used, and is not intended to be used the costs (for example, legal) of disposal would exceed the consideration received (the intangible asset is worthless) no one else could use it (or would want to use it) perhaps due to unmarketability through the liability of defects. We explain write-offs on page 35. Patents Where a patent is sold, the proceeds from the sale are taxable on the net amount after cost. Generally, a corresponding adjustment has been allowed for the total costs of the patent rights (at least those acquired on or after 1 April 1993). As a depreciation allowance has been available for patents since 1 April 1993, there is the potential for a double deduction. So, in calculating the profit or loss on sale of a patent, the cost of the patent is reduced by depreciation deductions that have been allowed. This restricts any deduction for loss on sale to the adjusted tax value. If a patent application is sold while the patent is pending, so that the patent is granted to a person other than the person who filed the application, the legal life for the new owner is reduced by the number of months between when the patent application was lodged and when it was sold to the new owner. Making arrangements between associated persons - intangible assets An intangible asset that wasn't depreciable to the seller remains non-depreciable to the associate, even though assets of the same type have become depreciable since the seller acquired that asset. The provision prevents an intangible asset being transferred to an associate to bring it within the depreciation rules and applies to intangible assets transferred on or after 1 July 1997. Disposing of pooled assets When you dispose of pooled assets, the sale price must be deducted from the adjusted tax value of the pool before calculating depreciation for the year. If the asset is discarded or lost, the adjusted tax value of the pool is not reduced. Where the sale price is greater than the adjusted tax value of the pool, the difference is treated as depreciation recovered and is taxable income. The adjusted tax value of the pool will then be nil and no further depreciation deductions will be allowed until new assets are added to the pool. Once assets are pooled, they're no longer treated as individual assets, so any capital gain made on the sale of any or all assets from the pool cannot be separated from depreciation recovered. The entire proceeds of any sale of pooled assets must be accounted for and any gains are taxable income. When all the assets in a pool are sold and the sale proceeds are less than the pool's adjusted tax value, the balance is deductible. Special rule for sale of assets previously held under the globo accounting method Please note from 12 December 1995 a limitation was placed on the amount of taxable income derived from selling assets in a pool that consists only of assets previously depreciated under the globo accounting method (this method could only be used before 1 April 1993). If this applies to you please see our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 7, No 9 (February 1996) for a fuller explanation of how gains are to be treated. Go to ird.govt.nz/tib Part 3 27 DEPRECIATION Ceasing business or now using the asset for non- business purposes If you cease business and do not sell your business assets immediately or if they're kept for private use, the loss or gain must be accounted for using the market value of the assets as at the beginning of the next income year. You'll have to make an adjustment in your income tax return for the year after the business ceased or the asset changed use, even if the loss or gain is not realised until a later income year. Using a pooled asset privately When an asset is no longer used solely for business purposes after it's been pooled, it must be isolated from the pool. Example Andy has an asset pool with an adjusted tax value of $18,000 at 1 April 2009. The pool includes an asset that Andy is now using for private purposes. He uses it privately for 20% of the time which started on 5 December 2009. The market value of the asset on 5 December 2009 was $1,500. The pool depreciation rate is 22%. Step 1 Pool adjusted tax value (beginning of 2010 income year) $ 18,000 Value at end of 2010 income year ($18,000 less deemed sale at $1,500) + $ 16,500 $ 34,500 Average pool value (divide $34,500 by 2) $ 17,250 Depreciation on the pool at 22% for the year will be: $ 3,795 Step 2 Calculate depreciation on ex-pool assets (market value $1,500) $1,500 x 22% x 4/12\* months = $ 110 (\*December 2009 to March 2010) Total depreciation $ 110 less 20% personal use $ 22 Deductible depreciation $ 88 Deductible depreciation for the 2010 income year is $3,883 ($88 plus $3,795). At the time the asset is first used privately, it will be treated for depreciation purposes as though the business bought and sold it for the market value. Damaged assets You must take into account any insurance proceeds, indemnity damages or compensation payments you receive when an asset is damaged. If such payments exceed the cost of repairing the damaged asset, the surplus is not a capital receipt but must be deducted from the adjusted tax value of the asset for depreciation purposes. If the result is a negative amount, that amount is considered to be gross income in that year. Irreparably damaged assets are considered to be disposed of for a consideration of the amount of any insurance proceeds, indemnity payment or other consideration received in relation to that event or damage. A full deduction is allowed for disposal costs, including demolition costs. Lost or stolen assets The loss or theft of a depreciable asset constitutes a disposal if the asset is not recovered in the income year in which the loss or theft occurs. Any insurance proceeds, indemnity payment or other consideration received in relation to the loss or theft of the depreciable asset is taken to be consideration received, minus disposal costs (where applicable), for the disposal of that asset. This consideration for the disposal will then be used in calculating the gain or loss on disposal of the asset. If the lost or stolen asset is recovered in a subsequent income year, and is still owned and used or available for use in deriving income, the following assumptions apply. You're considered to derive gross income equal to any loss on sale deduction allowed in the previous year. The gross income will be considered to be derived either in the year of disposal or of recovery. You're considered to have acquired the recovered asset on the date it was retrieved at the adjusted tax value that applied at the beginning of the year of loss or theft. Note If you're registered for GST, do not include the GST component of these payments in your calculation - account for it in your GST return. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 28 Transferring assets under a relationship agreement Depreciable assets transferred under a relationship agreement are transferred at the adjusted tax value and the person acquiring the assets, provided they use them for business purposes, is allowed the deductions that would have been allowed had the transfer not taken place. Example Colin and Jennifer Day separate and they agree to enter into a relationship agreement. Colin will transfer half the business assets to Jennifer. The general rule is that depreciable assets are transferred: at adjusted tax value at the beginning of the year of transfer at cost price for assets acquired in the year of transfer. As a result, no depreciation gain or loss arises to the transferor (Colin). The transferee (Jennifer) can continue to depreciate the remaining adjusted tax value of the assets. However, if she sells, Jennifer is considered to have claimed the depreciation deductions claimed by Colin and will be required to account for any excess of sale proceeds above the transfer value (up to the cost of the asset to Colin) as depreciation recovered. In relation to buildings, Jennifer's depreciation claim is based on the cost of the building to Colin. He is considered to have disposed of the building at adjusted tax value. Transferring depreciable assets between 100% group companies Companies that are 100% commonly owned and choose to enter the consolidated system can transfer assets within their group at the assets' adjusted tax value. When wholly owned companies amalgamate, they're treated as one company and all assets, liabilities, property, rights, powers and privileges of the amalgamating companies are held in the new amalgamated company. This means there is no depreciation recovered when assets are transferred on a qualifying amalgamation. Wholly owned companies that do not form a consolidated group are required to transfer assets at market value and recover or claim a loss of depreciation, as applicable. The vendor company is required to calculate depreciation recovered or a loss on disposal: on actual sale price, or on market value, when the asset has been disposed of for a consideration that is not market value, but we consider the market value is greater than the sale price and consider it to be the more appropriate value for the asset. The purchasing company should value the asset at the cost incurred, or the value we consider the seller to have disposed of that asset, to calculate the depreciation claimed. Council-controlled organisations Council-controlled organisations are established by local government legislation to operate as trading enterprises liable for tax and so are competitively neutral. When a council-controlled organisation is set up, assets transferred to it from a local authority should be transferred for tax purposes at either their: adjusted tax value true market value. Part 3 29 DEPRECIATION Regardless of which value is adopted: a local authority must make an actual sale of assets to a council-controlled organisation full consideration for the sale must pass between the parties there must be complete and detailed documentation providing evidence of the transaction (including listing individual asset values). Our Tax Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 3, No 2 (August 1991) has a full policy statement on how to value assets that are transferred from local authorities to council-controlled organisations (previously known as LATEs). To read the Tax Information Bulletin go to ird.govt.nz/tib Determinations Inland Revenue must follow a formal procedure to set new depreciation rates or create new categories for assets and industries. This is known as 'issuing a determination' and the general rates listed in our IR265 and the IR267 guides are the result of determinations issued by us. The determination process is also used for setting depreciation rates following applications from taxpayers. You can apply for a determination of depreciation rate if, for example, you find there is no general depreciation rate for your asset. You can also apply to us for a new rate if you believe the relevant existing general depreciation rate shouldn't apply to your asset. There are three different types of determinations that you can apply for, depending on your circumstances: a special depreciation rate a provisional depreciation rate a higher maximum pooling value. How rates are calculated The formula below is used for calculating a DV depreciation rate for an asset. 1 - (( residual value ) 1 ) cost n n =the estimated useful life of the asset. Estimated useful life The estimated useful life of an asset is the period over which the asset might reasonably be expected to be useful in earning income in New Zealand. This period of time is calculated taking into account factors such as likely wear and tear, the passage of time, exhaustion and obsolescence. Normal and reasonable maintenance over the expected life of the asset is also taken into account. The fact an asset may have been previously used for a purpose other than deriving income (for example, private use) or carrying on a business overseas will not reduce its estimated useful life. The estimate of useful life must take into account the length of time the asset is used by all business owners in New Zealand (ie, first owner plus second owner and so on). Example Grant, an owner-driver, buys a new truck every five years and sells his old one. He expects the New Zealand business that buys each truck from him will use it for another five years and then scrap it. If this is the typical useful lifespan of trucks, the estimated useful life is 10 years. We use valuation consultants' advice when determining the estimated useful life for each asset class. The estimated useful life is determined after averaging the usage of various businesses. The estimated useful life is listed with the depreciation rates in our IR265 guide. You can view our depreciation rates finder or the IR265 at ird.govt.nz/rate-finder Residual value The residual value of an asset is the greater of: 13.5% of the original cost an estimate of the asset's market value (GST-exclusive) at the end of its estimated useful life. This must be a reasonable estimate made at the time of purchase. In estimating the residual value it must be assumed normal and reasonable maintenance is carried out on the asset during its use. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 30 Once the rates are calculated they're rounded up or down to the nearest rate. The full range of general DV and SL rates are shown below: 1994 to 2005 rates For assets you acquired on or after 1 April 1993, and before the end of the 1995 income year, you can use the general rates listed in table 1 or the historic rates listed in part 1 of the IR267 guide plus 25% interim loading and any shift allowances. For assets acquired from the 1996 income year to the end of the 2005 income year (or before 19 May 2005 for buildings), use the general rates listed in table 1. For new assets, including those never used or held for use in New Zealand, and imported secondhand goods (but excluding buildings or used imported cars) depreciation is calculated using the general rate plus 20% loading. The general rates listed in table 1 can also be found in parts 2 and 3 of the IR267 guide at ird.govt.nz Table 1 General DV rate with 20% loading General SL rate with 20% loading 22.41.51.8 44.833.6 67.244.8 7.595.56.6 9.511.46.57.8 1214.489.6 15181012 1821.612.515 2226.415.518.6 2631.21821.6 3339.62428.8 40483036 50604048 63.576.263.576.2 100100100100 2006 and future years For assets acquired from the 2006 income year (or buildings acquired on or after 19 May 2005) use the general rates listed in table 2. For new assets (including those never used or held for use in New Zealand) and imported secondhand goods, but excluding buildings or used imported cars, depreciation is calculated using the general DV or SL rates plus 20% loading. The general rates listed in table 2 can be found in parts 1 and 2 of our IR265 guide at ird.govt.nz Table 2 General DV rate with 20% loading General SL rate with 20% loading 22.41.51.8 44.833.6 67.244.8 89.667.2 101278.4 1315.68.510.2 1619.210.512.6 202413.516.2 253017.521 30362125.2 40483036 50604048 6780.46780.4 100100100100 Note The 20% loading has been removed from 21 May 2010, so for any assets acquired on or after this date, use only the general DV or SL rates in table 2. Note From the 2011-12 income year, depreciation on buildings reduced to 0% for buildings with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies to both commercial and residential properties including leasehold property. For more information see page 12. Note For the 2021 to 2024 income years, depreciation on non-residential buildings was reintroduced. It returned to 0% from the 2024-25 income year. For more information see page 2 of this guide. Part 3 31 DEPRECIATION Disputable decisions Sometimes you may not agree with some of our decisions, for example: a determination setting a special rate a decision not to set a special rate revoking a special rate a determination setting a provisional rate a decision not to set a provisional rate. If you want to challenge any of these decisions, see our factsheet If you disagree with an assessment - IR778. Special depreciation rates We've calculated the general depreciation rates by using the formula given on page 30. We've considered the way assets are normally used, to arrive at the values used in the formula. For example, where it's usual to operate a piece of machinery in 2 or 3 shifts a day, the general depreciation rate we've set will reflect this heavier usage. If you believe the general depreciation rate we've set is not appropriate for your asset because, for example, you use your machine in an unusually heavy or light manner, or it will be operated in corrosive conditions, you may apply for a special depreciation rate. As we set a special rate because of individual circumstances, it can only be set for a specific taxpayer's asset or class of assets. Once set, it can only be used by the taxpayer who made the application. Note You can only apply for a special depreciation rate on non-residential buildings for the 2020-21 to 2023-24 income years. From the 2024-25 income year the depreciation rate for non-residential buildings is 0%. Your application for a special depreciation rate must be supported by evidence of how your unique circumstances will affect the life of your asset. If we agree you should have a special depreciation rate, the formula set out on page 30 will be used to calculate the rate. To qualify for a special rate, the rate you've calculated must be halfway or more to the next rate on the general rates table, either higher or lower. Example A personal computer purchased after 1 April 2005 has a general DV rate of 50%. The next higher general rate is 67%. The calculation must result in a rate of 58.5% or higher to qualify for a higher rate, or 45% or lower to qualify for a lower rate to be set since the next lower general rate is 40%. When considering a special rate, we'll take into account any factors relevant in determining estimated useful life. You can download and complete an Application for a special depreciation rate - IR260B from ird.govt.nz/ir260b Send your completed application to: Technical Lead Legal Services - Technical Standards Inland Revenue PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 How we set a special rate If we agree a special depreciation rate should be set, we follow three steps. They are: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing the determination. The process, from the time the application is received to the time the determination is issued, must be completed within 6 months, unless you agree to an extension of time. Draft determination Once we've considered your application, and agree a special depreciation rate should be set, we'll send you a draft determination along with a letter setting out the special depreciation rate we recommend. If this rate is different from the rate you requested, we'll also set out the reasons why we chose this rate. Conference At this point you may request a conference to discuss the determination. There is a time limit for requesting a conference, which will be at least 10 working days from the date we send the draft determination to you. Full details of the time limit will appear with the draft. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 32 If it's decided not to hold a conference, we'll finalise the determination. If it's decided to hold a conference, we'll set a date, time and place. We'll give you at least 20 working days' notice of the conference date. Issuing the determination The final step in the process is to issue the determination. Hopefully, due to the consultation following the draft determination or if a conference is held, both parties will have agreed on the rate to be set. If, however, you do not agree with the rate in the determination, you may dispute that decision. For more information, see our guide Disputing an assessment - IR776. Declining an application We'll turn down your application for a special rate if: your rate is too close to the general rate - see page 31 the general rate is under review you haven't supplied enough information. If we turn down your application or set a rate you do not agree with, you're entitled to dispute this decision - see page 31. Fees Application fee If you're applying for a special rate there's a fee of $150 plus GST, payable with your application. Processing fee There is a processing fee of $75 plus GST for each hour (or part-hour) after the first two hours for work by Inland Revenue. Consultant's fee If we engage a consultant to advise on the estimated useful life or estimated residual value of the asset, we'll charge you the consultant's fees plus GST. If you request a conference and a consultant paid by us attends the conference, or if you ask our consultant to carry out further work, we'll also charge you for the consultant's fee plus GST. If you request a conference we'll advise you of the likely fees before engaging a consultant so you can decide whether you want to continue with the application. Before we engage a consultant we'll take into account the information you've provided with your application. We will not seek a consultant's advice if you've already provided us with enough information to work out an appropriate rate. We'll send you an account for all fees you have incurred. The costs incurred can be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes and you can claim the GST part of the cost as a credit, if you're registered for GST. Withdrawing applications You can withdraw your application at any time. If you wish to do this, please let us know in writing as soon as possible because you'll have to pay fees incurred in processing your application, including any consultant's fees, up to the day we receive notice of your withdrawal. Revoking a special rate If we've approved your application for a special rate and your circumstances change so your asset no longer qualifies, we may either: revoke the determination, in which case you must use the general rate applying to the asset, or revoke the determination and issue a new one setting a new special rate. If this happens we'll let you know. The special rate we have already issued will lapse the day after you've been notified. Provisional depreciation rates You should apply for a provisional depreciation rate if you consider the asset classes for the general rates (excluding the default asset class in each category) do not appropriately cover the assets in a category. This could happen, for example, when an asset is newly invented or imported into New Zealand for the first time and we haven't listed the asset class under the general asset category. Part 3 33 DEPRECIATION To apply for a provisional rate, fill in an Application for a provisional depreciation rate - IR260A form. There are no application fees for a provisional rate. However, we'll charge you a fee if we: decline to issue a provisional rate determination or issue an unfavourable determination and you ask our consultant to carry out further work that does not result in a determination favourable to you. The fee for the further work done, or time attending a conference will include GST. When a provisional rate is set, it will usually apply to all businesses that own and use that class of asset and we do not have sufficient information at the time to set a general rate. However, in some cases it may be appropriate for a provisional rate to be set for a specific taxpayer or class of taxpayers owning that type of asset, for example, where the asset is unique to a specific taxpayer or taxpayer group. Provisional rates (other than taxpayer specific rates) are published in our Tax Information Bulletin and on our website at ird.govt.nz/depreciation When a general rate is subsequently set for a class of asset, the provisional rate will lapse. Calculating a provisional rate Unless the determination provides otherwise, once a provisional rate is set, it's available to all owners of the particular class of asset. So, the basis of the calculation must relate to the typical asset within the class of assets and typical use within an industry. It's important the information you supply with your application is representative for normal use of the asset within your industry. We take into account the rate of depreciation you and other industry members use in your financial reporting when setting a provisional rate. We calculate a provisional or special rate using the formula explained on page 30, or the SL method. The answer is then rounded up or down to the nearest SL or DV rate. How a provisional rate is set As with general and special rates, provisional rates are set by us issuing a determination. There are three main stages: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing a determination. This three-stage process must be completed within six months from the time we receive your application, unless you agree to an extension of time. These stages are explained in more detail on page 32. We'll turn down an application for a provisional rate if: a general rate for the asset already exists we're in the process of setting a general rate you haven't supplied enough information. If we turn down your application or set a rate you do not agree with, you're entitled to dispute the determination - see page 32. When we've set a provisional rate (other than a taxpayer specific rate) we'll notify the making of the determination and publish the determination in our Tax Information Bulletin and on our website at ird.govt.nz Higher maximum pooling values The aim of the pooling method of depreciation is to reduce compliance costs by calculating depreciation on low-value assets collectively, rather than individually. The maximum pooling value is $5,000. This means you can only pool assets that individually have an adjusted tax value of $5,000 or less. However, you may wish to apply for a higher maximum pooling value. You can do this by completing an Application for a higher maximum pooling value - IR719 form. Part 3 ird.govt.nz 34 Factors we take into account When deciding whether to set a higher maximum pooling value we consider the following three factors. Whether the assets you wish to include under a higher maximum pooling value are relatively similar in nature. Whether you'll make savings in compliance costs, such as clerical, computing and overhead costs, by having a higher maximum pooling value. You should show these in your application. How often you buy and sell the assets for which you want a higher maximum pooling value. How a higher maximum is set There are three stages to issuing a determination to set a higher maximum pooling value. These are: preparing a draft determination holding a conference issuing a determination. These stages are explained on page 32. Fees If you're applying for a higher maximum pooling value there is an application fee of $150 plus GST. We charge a processing fee of $75, plus GST, for each hour (or part-hour) after the first two hours for work by Inland Revenue. If we hire a consultant to advise on the estimated useful life or estimated residual value of an asset, we'll charge you for the consultant's fees plus GST. We'll also charge you for the consultant's fee plus GST if you request a conference and a consultant paid by us attends, or if you ask our consultant to carry out further work that does not result in a determination favourable to you. We'll send you an account for all fees you've incurred. The account will show the fee, the GST and the total unless we state otherwise. The costs incurred can be claimed as a deduction for income tax purposes and if you're registered for GST you can claim the GST part of the cost as a credit. You can withdraw your application at any time - see page 33. Deductions for assets you no longer use This section relates to assets that are no longer used but haven't been physically disposed of. For example, if a business discards machinery because it's outdated and unsafe, but does not sell, assign or transfer it, the machinery hasn't been disposed of. If the cost of disposing of an asset you no longer use would be greater than the proceeds from its sale, you may claim the adjusted tax value as a deduction. If the scrap value of the machinery in the above example is greater than the costs of disposing of that machinery, a write-off will not apply. In such cases the machinery would need to be disposed of to claim a deduction. Dumping off site constitutes a disposal. These rules do not apply to buildings and pooled assets. See page 26 for more help on how to account for losses and gains on sale or disposal of assets. Conditions for a deduction To write off the adjusted tax value of an asset, you must meet the following conditions. You no longer use the asset in business or in producing income. Neither you nor an associate intend to use the asset in the future to derive gross income or in future business. It's uneconomic to dispose of the asset.

Find out more about making a complaint, and the disputes process, at ird.govt.nz/disputes Part 4 ird.govt.nz 36 Adjusted tax value is the remaining value of your asset once the depreciation you calculate each year has been deducted from the value. Asset is the unit to be depreciated. For depreciation purposes it must not be subdivided into its separate components. Associated persons definition in the Income Tax Act 2007 (sub-part YB) sets out rules that define when two persons are associated. These rules are categorised as tests of association as follows: two companies a company and a person other than a company two relatives a person and a trustee for a relative a trustee and a beneficiary trustees with a common settlor a trustee and a settlor a settlor and a beneficiary a trustee and a person with the power of appointment or removal of the trustee a partnership and a partner two persons who are each associated with the same third person (tripartite test). Base value means: the cost of an asset acquired after the beginning of the 1994 income year, or the adjusted tax value at the end of the 1993 income year if it's acquired before this date, or the market value at the time the asset is taken from private to business use, if this is after the beginning of the 1994 income year. This market value rule does not apply to buildings or schedule depreciable assets - see page 39. Depreciable intangible assets are intangible assets acquired or created on or after 1 April 1993 and listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and have a finite useful life. Depreciable assets are assets that might reasonably be expected, in normal circumstances, to decline in value while used or available for use: in deriving gross income, or in carrying on a business for the purpose of deriving gross income. The term depreciable assets refers to all depreciable assets regardless of their acquisition date, and it includes assets acquired in the 1993 and earlier income years. Disposal occurs where a depreciable asset is sold or disposed of for a consideration. Event is a natural disaster such as an earthquake or flood resulting in the building being demolished or abandoned and later demolished. The damage to either the building or to the neighbourhood of the building has rendered the building useless for the purposes of deriving income, and is not due to the action or failure to act of the person, their agent, or an associate. You can find out more in our Ta x Information Bulletin (TIB), Vol 23, No 8 (October 2011), page 66, 'Losses on buildings'. Excluded depreciable assets are any assets purchased before 1 April 1993 and any of the following circumstances apply. The assets were used or available for use by the taxpayer in New Zealand, other than as trading stock, before 1 April 1993. Before 16 December 1991, the taxpayer entered into a binding contract to purchase the assets or have them constructed. They are or have been qualifying assets for a person or are or have been a qualifying improvement for the person. They are intangible assets used or available for use by the taxpayer before 1 April 1993. Excluded depreciable assets do not include assets in existence at the end of the 1993 income year that were accounted for using the standard value, replacement value or annual revaluation method. Fixed-life depreciable assets are any intangible assets that: are depreciable intangible assets, and have a legal life which could reasonably be expected, on the date of creation or acquisition of those assets, to be the same length as the assets' remaining estimated useful life. Income year for depreciation purposes, includes any corresponding non-standard accounting year. Glossary Part 4 37 DEPRECIATION Intangible assets are assets with a finite life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of their creation or acquisition. Legal life is defined for any intangible asset and means the number of years and any monthly fraction the asset may remain or continue to remain in existence by virtue of the contract or statute that creates the asset for the owner. It assumes the owner will exercise any rights of renewal or extension that are essentially unconditional, or conditional on the payment of predetermined fees. Poolable assets are assets with a similar base value you can group for depreciation purposes, with a maximum value of $5,000 per asset. Schedule depreciable assets are petroleum drilling rigs, support vessels for offshore petroleum drilling rigs and support vessels for offshore petroleum production platforms. Because of the special nature of these assets, the depreciation calculation is made on a daily rather than a monthly basis. In addition, the base value for schedule depreciable assets acquired by a taxpayer from an associated person is the lower of the cost of the asset to the taxpayer or the aggregate of: the cost of the asset to: –the associated person who didn't acquire the asset from either the taxpayer or another associated person, or –the taxpayer or an associated person who owned the asset at the beginning of an unbroken chain of ownership, and all expenditure (excluding any expenditure allowed as depreciation allowances) incurred for the asset by the taxpayer and any associated persons before the date the taxpayer acquired the asset. The cost is determined as exclusive of any expenditure allowed as depreciation allowances. No adjustment is made on disposition or exit from the tax base for a schedule depreciable asset. ird.govt.nz 38

Application for a special depreciation rate About this form This form is used to apply for a special depreciation rate. You may apply for a special depreciation rate if you believe that the applicable depreciation rate for your item of depreciable property is not appropriate because of the way in which your item is used in your business. The Commissioner’s Table of Depreciation Rates is available in the booklet General depreciation rates - IR265 on our website ird.govt.nz Note: From 1 April 2020 (2021 and later income years) you can also apply for a special depreciation rate on non-residential buildings. General rates are set in bands, that are shown in schedules 11 and 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Having banded rates standardises the number of depreciation rates that customers and Inland Revenue need to manage. A special rate will generally only be issued if it is more than half the difference between the item’s general banded rate and the next higher (or lower) banded rate contained in schedule 11. If there is no applicable depreciation rate for your item in the Commissioner’s Table of General Depreciation Rates, please complete the form Application for a provisional depreciation rate - IR260A instead. Fees are payable for special depreciation rate application. Notes concerning fees, as well as the process and timeframe for responding to this application, are contained at the end of this form.

Because of this, many people who start working as distributors for direct selling organisations are unsure about how the tax rules affect them. If you're a distributor for a direct selling organisation, this booklet is for you. We've written it to help you understand how to meet your tax obligations. Read page 7 to find out whether you're a commission agent, an independent reseller or an employee. ird.govt.nz Go to our website for information and to use our services and tools. • Log in or register for myIR - manage your tax and entitlements online. • Calculators and tools - use our calculators, worksheets and tools, for example, to check your tax code, find filing and payment dates, calculate your student loan repayment. • Forms and guides - download our forms and guides.

How to get our forms and guides You can get copies of our forms and guides at ird.govt.nz/forms-guides The information in this booklet is based on the tax laws at the time of printing. ird.govt.nz 5 Part 1 - Commission agent, independent reseller or employee? Who are direct selling distributors? Direct selling organisations sell products to the public through their distributors. The distributors may purchase the products and sell them at a marked-up price or sell them on behalf of the organisation for a commission. Distributors might also sponsor other distributors into the organisation and teach them how to sell and sponsor. These distributors are called downliners. Distributors are normally independent from the direct selling organisation. When you set up as a distributor for a direct selling company you fall into one of 3 categories for tax purposes – • commission agent • independent reseller • or employee. The first 2 types of distributors are normally self-employed but there are important differences in their tax treatment. The tax rules for employees are very different from the rules for self-employed people. It's important you know whether you're a commission agent, an independent reseller or an employee. Are you in business? The first step in working out which tax rules apply to you is to establish whether, for tax purposes, you're ‘in business’. If you're in business for yourself, you're either an independent reseller or a commission agent. Employees are not in business - their employers are. As far as the income tax rules are concerned, you're in business if the nature of your activity is business like and indicates an intention to make a profit. If you only buy products for yourself or as gifts for others and have no intention of making a profit from selling those products, you're not in business. Deciding whether or not you're in business under the tax laws is not always clear cut. If you’re unsure, call us on 0800 377 774. DIRECT SELLING 6 Your relationship with the direct selling organisation It's important you know exactly what your status is with the direct selling organisation so you know which tax rules affect you. The table below shows the most common relationships between direct selling organisations (upliners) and their distributors (downliners) and briefly describes their tax obligations. If you...If you...If you... ...earn a salary or wage from the direct selling organisation ...are paid solely on a commission basis for products you sell ...buy products from the direct selling organisation at wholesale prices and sell them at retail prices ...then you're......then you're......then you're... an employee.a commission agent.an independent reseller. So...So...So... PAYE and ACC earners' levy are deducted from your wages. tax is deducted from your payments. you must pay your own tax. You cannot claim expenses. You may have to register for GST. Your direct selling organisation does not deduct tax from payments to you. You can claim expenses if you're in business. You may have to register for GST, and you can claim expenses. If you're not sure what sort of distributor you are, call us on 0800 377 774. ird.govt.nz 7 Employees If your only source of income is as an employee of a direct selling organisation you'll need to fill in a Tax code declaration - IR330 form and give it to the business you sell the product for. They'll deduct the appropriate PAYE and pay it to us. The rest of this booklet is for commission agents and independent resellers. Commission agents If your income is commission from your sales, tax will have to be deducted from your commissions. Fill in an IR330 and give it to the business you sell the product for. Make sure you write ‘WT’ as your tax code. They'll then deduct 20% tax from your gross commission and pay it to us. If you do not complete the IR330 or provide your IRD number, tax will be deducted at 35%. Keep a record of expenses you incur in selling the products. You'll be able to claim those expenses against your commission received when you file your IR3 tax return at the end of the financial year. Read Part 2 for details on filing tax returns, Part 3 for expenses you can claim and Part 4 for GST obligations. Independent resellers As an independent reseller you're self-employed. Being self-employed means you're responsible for paying your own tax on your direct selling business profit. Profit is the amount of income left after all expenses have been deducted. You'll have to file an IR3 tax return by 7 July each year. If you have a tax agent this date may be different. If you're in a partnership you'll pay tax on your share of the partnership profit. You'll have to file an IR7 tax return for your partnership, as well as an IR3 return for yourself. You must include a set of your direct selling financial accounts with your IR3 return or complete a Schedule of business income - IR3B form. DIRECT SELLING 8 Part 2 - General information about being in business In Part 1 we set out some guidelines to help you decide whether you're in business. This part sets out some general tax facts all business people need to know. Record keeping It’s important for all businesses to keep full and accurate records. You must keep these records for 7 years. Your records must be accurate enough to allow us to calculate the income and expenses of your business, and to confirm your accounts. You must keep records of all sales and purchases. Examples of records include: • taxable supply information • supply correction information • bank statements • invoices and receipts • credit card records – including statements and vouchers • cash register or point of sale records • cashbooks. If you’re GST registered, go to Part 4 for more information on records you need to keep. For more help If you would like more information on record keeping, get a copy of our Smart business - IR320 guide. Filing your returns A balance date is the last day of an accounting year. For most businesses the accounting year begins on 1 April and ends the following 31 March. When you apply for an IRD number, your balance date will be 31 March. This is called the standard balance date. You can change your balance date in myIR. For more information, go to ird.govt.nz/change-balance-date ird.govt.nz 9 For a 31 March balance date, you must send your IR3 tax return to us by 7 July. Any tax owing as a result should be paid by 7 February in the following year. Example Fred is self-employed and has a 31 March balance date. He must file his 2023 IR3 by 7 July 2023. He does this and finds he owes $780.22 in tax. Fred must pay this tax by 7 February 2024. Note If you have a tax agent these dates may be different. Provisional tax If you're running a business, you need to budget for paying your own tax. Unless your profit is very small, you'll have to start paying your income tax through the year - this is known as provisional tax. Even commission agents who have tax deducted from their commissions may have to pay provisional tax. The number of provisional tax instalments you'll need to make depends on whether you're GST-registered, your GST filing frequency and which provisional tax method you're using. If you're GST-registered you'll make combined GST and provisional tax payments and complete combined returns. If you're not GST-registered, you'll need to make 3 instalments. If you use the ratio method to calculate your provisional tax, you'll need to make 6 instalments. You'll need to budget for these payments in the financial planning of your business. Are you liable for provisional tax? When you, or your accountant or tax agent, work out the financial accounts for your business after your balance date each year, you'll know how much profit (or loss) the business made. This profit or loss goes into your tax return as part of your taxable income. You can then work out the tax due on your total year's income. After deducting any other tax already paid on your behalf (such as PAYE), the result is your residual income tax. If the residual income tax is more than $5,000, you need to pay provisional tax for the following year. DIRECT SELLING 10 When you start your business If you use the standard, estimation or ratio options, you will not need to pay provisional tax during your first year of business. If you use the accounting income method (AIM), you’ll only pay provisional tax when you make a profit, even during your first year. However, your first year in business is not tax free. Any income tax from your first year in business is usually due by 7 February the following year. If you have an agent it will be due by 7 April. This may mean you must pay income tax for your first year in business at the same time as paying provisional tax for your second year in business. You can choose to make voluntary payments of tax during your first year of business to help spread the cost. If you make voluntary payments you may be able to get an early payment discount. For more help Read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. It explains what provisional tax is, what income it's charged on and how to pay it. ird.govt.nz 11 Part 3 - Claiming expenses Expenses Generally, an expense is deductible for income tax purposes if it's incurred in generating taxable income or is necessary for carrying on a business. Expenses may be deducted even if they do not produce income immediately, but are expected to do so in the future. You cannot claim private living expenses. If you buy goods or services that you use both in your business and privately, you'll need to apportion those expenses between business and private use. The cost of assets cannot be claimed as an expense. However, they can be written off (depreciated) over a number of years covering the life of the asset. See page 15 for more information. The way you acquire assets can sometimes make a difference to what you can claim. For example, rental payments for leased assets are often fully deductible. Following are some of the more common types of business expenses. Cost of goods sold Independent resellers buy goods and resell them. This means one of their major expenses is the cost of the goods they sell. Commission agents do not usually buy the stock they sell, so they do not claim for the cost of goods sold. The cost of goods sold is made up of 3 parts - purchases, opening stock and closing stock. Independent resellers subtract the cost of goods sold from their sales total to get their gross profit. Purchases are the amounts you pay for the goods you're going to sell. At the end of the income year (usually 31 March) if you hold goods that you purchased for selling to customers, you'll have to do a stocktake. This will give you your closing stock figure. There are several ways to value your stock but cost is the most practical way. This means your closing stock value is the amount it cost you to buy the items you have on hand. DIRECT SELLING 12 Example At 31 March 2023 Bill has 140 bottles of shampoo on hand. They cost him $5 each. His closing stock value is simply 140 × $5 = $700. Your closing stock then becomes your opening stock for the next year (starting 1 April). Going back to the cost of goods sold, the calculation is: Opening stock plus purchases less closing stock Example Bill’s purchases for the year ended 31 March 2023 were $2,470. His opening stock at 1 April 2022 was $600, and we worked out his closing stock at $700 (see above). His cost of goods sold is: Opening stock $ 600 plus purchases $ 2,470 $ 3,070 less closing stock $ 700 Cost of goods sold $ 2,370 Bill subtracts his cost of goods sold from his total sales. His sales were $7,620 for the year ended 31 March 2023, so his gross profit is: Sales $ 7,620 less cost of goods sold $ 2,370 Gross profit $ 5,250 If Bill pays or receives performance volume rebates he will adjust his gross profit accordingly (see page 13). Goods for private use You must make an adjustment for any trading stock used privately. Keep full records of the market value of goods you take for personal use, or for family and friends. Show the market value of these goods as sales and include them in your sales figures. ird.govt.nz 13 Example Bill took shampoo from his opening stock for personal use. The market value at the time he took the shampoo was $50. He included $50 in his sales figure for the year. Performance volume rebates Depending on how your direct selling organisation is structured, an upliner may pay performance volume rebates to downliners. If you do this, you can claim the payments for tax purposes. Add them on to your cost of goods sold when you work out your gross profit. If you receive performance volume rebates, you reduce your cost of goods sold by the amount you receive. Example Bill’s gross profit is worked out in the example on page 12. If he paid and received some performance volume rebates, his profit is worked out as follows: Sales $ 7,620 Cost of goods sold $ 2,370 less performance volume rebates received $ 1,250 plus performance volume rebates paid out $ 750 Subtotal $ 1,870 Gross profit $ 5,750 Samples and promotional equipment Promotional equipment such as product samples, brochures, delivery bags and sales aids for showing to distributors or customers can be claimed for tax purposes. Remember, if you're using the equipment privately you must make an adjustment for private use. DIRECT SELLING 14 Motor vehicle expenses You'll probably use a motor vehicle in your direct selling business to make deliveries, attend sales meetings and visit your downliners. To claim for business running expenses (such as repairs, registration, petrol, depreciation, insurance) on a private motor vehicle, you need to record the amount of business use of the vehicle by using a logbook. Your logbook must show the date, distance and reason for travel. Rather than recording actual business use of the motor vehicle for the whole year you can keep a logbook for a 90-day test period to calculate your percentage of business use. You can then use this percentage for the next 3 years, unless your business use of the vehicle rises or drops by more than 20%. Example Hugh keeps a logbook for a 90-day test period and finds he has travelled a total of 2,500 km. The business trips he has detailed in his logbook total 1,800 km. 1,800 = 72% 2,500 Hugh can claim 72% of all his motor vehicle expenses as a business expense. If you do not keep a vehicle logbook you may claim up to 25% of the vehicle running costs as a business expense. However, you may be asked to substantiate the percentage claimed. Alternatively, you can keep a record of the number of kilometres travelled for your business and use Inland Revenue kilometre rates to make a claim. For more information go to ird.govt.nz No GST credit can be claimed on motor vehicle expenses calculated using mileage rates. Home office expenses If you run your business from a home office you may be able to claim part of the costs of running your home. Your home office must be an area you've set aside principally for business use. You must keep a full record of all expenses you wish to claim. ird.govt.nz 15 Divide the total floor area you set aside for your home office by the total floor area of your house. The result is the percentage you can claim of your expenses. Example Sandy has an office of 10 square metres set aside in a house of 100 square metres. She can claim 10% (10/100) of house expenses, including power. If Sandy owns the property, she can claim 10% of the rates, interest on her mortgage (not the principal) and insurance on her house. Phone, mobile and internet expenses If you run your business from home you can claim a deduction of 50% of the rental of a telephone landline if this is also your private line. Business-related toll calls are 100% deductible. If you have a separate business line, you can claim the full cost of this for both income tax and GST. If you make any private calls on the business line and are charged for these, you will have to make an adjustment. If you run your business from home and have an internet plan for both business and private use, you can claim part of this as a business expense. You can decide how to work out the business proportion, but it needs to give a fair and reasonable result. You must also meet normal record-keeping requirements. Depreciation If you buy assets for your business you cannot immediately claim their cost for tax purposes, but you can make a claim for depreciation over the asset's life. The depreciation you calculate each year is deducted from the asset's value. The remaining value of the asset is called the "adjusted tax value". There are 2 ways to calculate depreciation on an asset - the diminishing value method and the straight line method. The diminishing value (DV) method calculates depreciation each year by using a constant percentage of the asset's adjusted tax value. This means the amount you claim for depreciation will steadily reduce each year. The amount you claim using the straight line (SL) depreciation method is a percentage of the asset's original cost price. So you claim the same amount of depreciation for an asset each year. DIRECT SELLING 16 Example Molly buys a used car for $15,000 in April 2022 for use in her business. A logbook shows the car is used 75% of the time for business purposes. She cannot claim the full $15,000 as an expense in the year she purchases it. However, she can claim depreciation each year. Molly chooses to use the diminishing value method of depreciation for cars, which means she can claim 30% of the adjusted tax value each year. $15,000 × 30% = $4,500 depreciation The adjusted tax value of the car will now be: $15,000 - $4,500 = $10,500 (this is the figure Molly will use to calculate depreciation on next year). An adjustment must be made for Molly’s private use of the car and is calculated as: $4,500 × 75% = $3,375 Therefore Molly can only claim $3,375 as a depreciation expense, even though the full depreciation amount is $4,500. Example Harry bought a computer for $3,000 in October 2021. In April 2022 he started using it full time in his business. The market value of the computer in April 2022 is $1,500. This is the figure that depreciation will be calculated on in Harry’s 2023 income tax return. For more help For more information on depreciation read our booklet Depreciation - a guide for businesses - IR260. Other expenses you can claim Other business expenses that can be claimed for tax purposes are: • accounting fees • postage • ACC levies • stationery such as business cards, writing material, name stamps and other office supplies • conference and travel-related expenses (business part only). ird.govt.nz 17 For more help For more information on claiming business entertainment expenses read our booklet Entertainment expenses - IR268. Working out your profit Commission agents If you're a commission agent you need to keep details of the expenses you can claim. The total of these expenses will be deductible from your commission income when you file your Individual tax return - IR3. In May, after the end of the tax year, you'll receive a Summary of Income that will show your commission income and the amount of tax deducted from it. You'll also be able to see your earnings information through your myIR secure online services account. Independent resellers Independent resellers receive their income by selling goods they've bought from their supplier. They can supplement their income with volume price rebates or discounts. At the end of your accounting year you'll have to produce a set of accounts to work out how much profit (or loss) your business made. To do this, add up all the income that the business earned over the year, and subtract all the allowable business expenses. Your profit is the remainder.

GST and your income tax accounts If you're registered for GST there are 2 ways to prepare your accounts for income tax purposes. • You can record all income and expenses including GST. Then adjust your accounts by listing GST refunds as income and GST to pay as expenses. • The other way to prepare your accounts is to simply exclude GST on all income and expense items. If you're not registered for GST show your total expenses, including GST, as well as your total income. See Part 4 for more information on GST obligations. ird.govt.nz 19 Part 4 - GST (goods and services tax) GST is a tax on consumption. It's charged and accounted for at a rate of 15%, by GST-registered businesses. They then calculate the amount of GST they have charged and pay it to us. They also claim back the GST they incur as part of their business. The GST rules apply differently to commission agents and independent resellers. Employees do not have to account for GST - their employer does. Registering for GST Before you can register for GST you must be conducting a taxable activity. Your distributorship may be a taxable activity even if you're not ‘in business’ as defined on page 5. You must register for GST if your turnover (sales from taxable activities), including certain imported services you receive: • was over $60,000 for the last 12 months, or • is expected to go over $60,000 for the next 12 months. In a direct selling business, turnover is made up of: • retail sales • bonuses • commissions. A good guideline to check if you'll be over the $60,000 threshold for the year is to look at your monthly turnover. If your monthly turnover is $5,000 or more you should register for GST. If you operate 2 or more business ventures, you'll need to add the turnovers together to see if you're over the $60,000 turnover figure. You can voluntarily register for GST if your turnover is less than $60,000. If you charge GST in your prices you must register, even if your turnover is less than $60,000. You can register for GST in myIR. If you're already GST-registered in another business and you're running your direct selling business part-time, you are GST-registered for both businesses. DIRECT SELLING 20 If you register for GST, let your direct selling organisation and also your upliner know. Taxable periods When you register for GST you have a choice as to how often you file your GST returns. Depending on your turnover you may be able to file your returns monthly, 2-monthly or 6-monthly. Accounting basis There are 3 ways of accounting for GST—payments, invoice or hybrid. You should choose the accounting basis that best suits your business. If you do not choose an accounting basis when you register, we’ll put you on the invoice basis. If you want to change your accounting basis after you’ve registered you can do this in myIR. Payments basis Under the payments basis you account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you make or receive the payment. This helps you manage your cash flow because you only pay us GST after you’ve received the payment from your customers, and you only claim GST for the purchases and expenses you’ve paid for (provided you hold taxable supply information for the claim). Invoice basis Using the invoice basis, you account for GST at the end of the taxable period when you provided an invoice to your customers or received an invoice from your supplier (provided you hold taxable supply information for the claim). Hybrid basis Under the hybrid basis you account for GST on sales and income using the invoice basis, and account for GST on expenses and purchases when you actually make payment. Note: This method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. This is because you may return GST on invoiced sales before you have received payment, but you can only claim GST when you have paid for your purchases (not when invoiced). ird.govt.nz 21 Filing your returns The due date is usually the 28th of the month following the end of your taxable period, except for return periods ending: • 30 November – the due date is 15 January of the following year • 31 March – the due date is 7 May of the same year. If the due date for your GST return falls on a weekend or public holiday, it will be due the next working day. Taxable supply information The GST rules for invoicing and record keeping have changed. You must keep records for all transactions however, you no longer need to keep a single physical document detailing the supply information, such as a tax invoice, credit note, or debit note. Your transaction records, accounting systems and contractual documents may, in combination, contain all the information you need to support the figures in your GST returns. Taxable supply information refers to the minimum set of information buyers and sellers need to keep as evidence of a transaction. Taxable supply information includes invoices, but it can also include information held in other forms, such as supplier agreements, contracts, and bank statements. Your transaction records, accounting systems and contractual documents may, in combination, contain all the information you need to support the figures in your GST returns. Sellers can provide taxable supply information to a customer using an automated direct exchange between the buyer’s and seller’s software, for example PEPPOL eInvoicing. If you’re GST-registered, you must • keep records of all your sales and income including taxable supply information and supply correction information • keep taxable supply information and supply correction information for your purchases and expenses, such as invoices, receipts, or other documents. DIRECT SELLING 22 The information you need to keep may depend on the value of goods or services: Taxable supply amounts $200 or less More than $200 and up to $1,000 More than $1,000 Seller’s details• Name or trade name of the seller • Name or trade name of the seller • GST number • Name or trade name of the seller • GST number Buyer’s details• Not required• Not required• Name, and 1 or more of the following: - address (physical or postal) - contact phone number - email address - trading name if different to the buyer’s name - New Zealand business number or website URL address Date• Date of invoice • If no invoice provided, the time of supply date • Date of invoice • If no invoice provided, the time of supply date • Date of invoice • If no invoice provided, the time of supply date Information on the goods or services • Description of the goods or services • Description of the goods or services • Description of the goods or services Payment information The consideration for the supply\* Either • GST exclusive amount, • GST amount, and • GST inclusive amount or • GST inclusive amount and • a statement GST is included, charged at the standard rate for all the goods and services listed Either • GST exclusive amount, • GST amount, and • GST inclusive amount or • GST inclusive amount and • a statement GST is included, charged at the standard rate for all the goods and services listed \* Consideration can be a payment, act or holding back from using a legal right (for example, forgiving debt instead of enforcing payment). These are not consideration when they are unconditional gifts to not-for-profit organisations. ird.govt.nz 23 Performance volume rebates As an independent reseller you may receive performance volume rebates. These rebates reduce the cost price of stock from your supplier. Your direct selling organisation or upliner should give you supply correction information with the rebate. You’ll then have to make an adjustment in your GST return so you do not over claim GST on your purchases. If you’re passing on part of a rebate you’ve received to your downliner, give them supply correction information for their part of the rebate. Note Supply correction information was previously known as debit and credit notes. GST and direct selling As a commission agent you're supplying your services to your direct selling organisation, so you'll have to charge the organisation GST on your commissions. Make sure you let your direct selling organisation know if you register for GST. You do not usually account for GST on sales because your direct selling organisation will do that. Instead, on your GST return deduct the GST you've paid on your business expenses from the GST you charge on your commissions and pay the balance to us. The rules are slightly different for independent resellers. You charge all your customers and downliners GST, then deduct the GST your supplier charged as well as the GST you paid on business expenses. Pay the balance to us. If you're going to register for GST, let your upliner know. In both cases, if you've paid more GST than you charged, we'll refund the difference. You cannot charge or claim GST if you’re not GST registered. DIRECT SELLING 24 Cancelling your GST registration You can cancel your GST registration if: • you’re closing or selling your business • you expect your turnover to drop below $60,000 - and stay there for a while • you realise you are not required to be registered. If you’re going to continue your taxable activity you may still choose to cancel your registration. If you do decide to cancel, you can no longer: • charge GST on your sales • claim GST on your expenses. If you’re considering cancelling your GST registration, you’ll need to know the situations where you must cancel or have a choice in cancelling. Use our handy online tool to help you decide what’s best for your situation - Should I cancel my GST registration If GST is included in your prices, you cannot cancel your GST registration, even when your turnover is under $60,000.

Normally income that you receive from renting out property will be liable for income tax, so you must include it in your tax return. This income could be from renting out land or buildings, or it could be income you earn by having private boarders or flatmates living with you. Our website ird.govt.nz has more information on private boarders and flatmates. Note The rules for income and expenses in this part apply to all rental properties. But if you rent your holiday home to the public for short-term stays, you may need to calculate the proportion of your expenses that you can deduct. You'll find more information about holiday homes in Part 5 of this guide. Note If you earn income from renting out residential property, there may be a limit on the amount of expenses you can claim in an income year. You’ll find more information about the residential property deduction rules in Part 4 of this guide. Rent in advance Any rent paid to you in advance is taxable in the year you receive it. So if your tenant paid rent on 30 March 2020 for the next two weeks, you'd return this income in the income year 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2020 (if you have a standard 31 March balance date). Tenancy bond Amounts you receive for tenancy bond and pass on to the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) are not income. Amounts out of a tenancy bond you receive from MBIE for payment of rent arrears, should be included as income. Amounts out of a tenancy bond you receive because of damage to the property during the tenancy, are not income. Expenses you can deduct from your rental income When you own a rental property, you're likely to have maintenance and administrative costs. You can claim all or some of these costs depending on how the property is used and the nature of the work being done. If you use the property for both rental and private use then costs need to be apportioned. Go to Deducting your expenses on page 62 or 64, depending on your situation. For properties subject to the residential property deduction rules (also known as ring-fencing rules), the amount of expenses you can claim as deductions each year generally cannot be more than your residential rental property income. There are no changes to what expenses you can claim, but there is a limit on the total amount of deductions that can be claimed for the year. Allowable deductions you cannot claim for the year are carried forward for use in a future year. Find out more in Part 4 - Residential property deduction rules. 5 ird.govt.nz Generally, you can only claim expenses relating to your rental income. The following costs or expenses can be deducted from your rental income for tax purposes. Rates and insurance You can claim the rates and insurance on your rental property. Interest The interest limitation rules may mean you are unable to claim interest charged on the money you borrow to finance your rental property. For properties purchased on or after 27 March 2021, interest is not deductible from 1 October 2021 unless an exclusion or exemption applies. If your loan relates to the purchase of a property before 27 March 2021, you can deduct a certain percentage of your interest expense until 31 March 2025 (provided the loan was first drawn down before 27 March 2021 or was for the settlement of the property). If you borrowed the money for another purpose as well as buying your rental property, you cannot claim all the interest as an expense. Example Your loan finances both your rental property and the house you live in. You can only claim the interest for the rental property and generally only if you purchased the rental property before 27 March 2021 and subject to the rules phasing out interest deductions. For more information about interest see Part 3 of this guide. Agent's fees and commission If you use an agent to collect the rent and/or maintain the property, the cost of the agent's fees can be deducted. Any commission paid to an agent to find tenants for the property is also deductible. Repairs and maintenance The cost of repairs and maintenance you do, or pay someone else to do, on the rental property is normally deductible as an expense. Examples of repairs and maintenance are: • replacing a broken shower head • plastering and painting a crack in the wall • replacing a blown element in a hot water cylinder • redecorating the property so that it's in the same condition it was in when you bought it to use as a rental property. If you do the repairs yourself, you cannot claim your time as an expense, only the materials you purchase. RENTAL INCOME 6 There are some circumstances when the cost of repairs cannot be deducted as an expense because they're considered a capital improvement, such as where you: • buy a rundown property and spend large sums of money on it to significantly improve or alter it before renting it out. • carry out work which significantly improves the property, for example you take down a badly deteriorated wall and put a conservatory in its place. These are capital expenses and the cost of the work is depreciated. In some situations it can be difficult to work out whether work done on the property is repairs and maintenance or capital improvements. If you're not sure, we recommend speaking with a tax agent. Motor vehicle expenses If you use your own vehicle in the course of renting out your property, for example travelling to inspect a property or to do some repairs, you may be able to claim some vehicle running costs as an expense against your income. There are two options for claiming motor vehicle expenses: 1. Use the Inland Revenue kilometre rates. These rates are based on the average cost to run a motor vehicle. They're available at ird.govt.nz/vehicle-expenses To claim kilometre rates you need to keep a vehicle logbook and record the date, distance travelled and reason for each trip related to your rental activity. 2. Claim a percentage of the total running costs such as petrol, oil, repairs, registration, insurance and depreciation. You need to keep records of the running costs. At the end of the year, add them all up and work out what percentage of these running costs and depreciation relates to your rental activity. To do this you'll need to keep an annual logbook and record the: • total mileage for the year • total distance travelled as part of your rental activity, with a breakdown of the date, distance and reason for each trip. Alternatively, you can keep a logbook for a test period of at least 3 months every 3 years that shows: • the odometer reading at the start of the test period • total distance travelled as part of your rental activity, with a breakdown of the date, distance and reason for each trip • the odometer reading at the end of the test period. The test period must fairly represent your normal vehicle running conditions. Also, if you believe that the proportion of rental-related travel has changed by more than 20%, you must re-run your test period or keep an annual logbook. If you do not maintain actual records or a logbook, then the default method applies to limit your motor vehicle expenses. This is the lesser of: • the proportion of actual business travel of the vehicle • 25% of total expenses. 7 ird.govt.nz Example Nicole uses her own car for her rental activity. She's decided to keep a logbook for a three-month test period.

Remember, you have to keep your vehicle records for 7 years, even if you stop renting out your property. Travel expenses If your rental property is somewhere in New Zealand other than your hometown you may have to travel to do property inspections and maintenance. If you travel using other transport and the trip is solely to inspect or do maintenance on the rental property the cost is usually fully deductible. This might include: • air fares • taxis • rental car hire • overnight accommodation. RENTAL INCOME 8 If your travel is for both business (rental property activity) and personal reasons, you can only deduct the portion/part that relates to earning your rental income. This is to take into account any private use, which is not deductible. Deductions are only allowed for expenses that are part of earning your rental income. Example John lives in Wellington. He has a rental property in Tauranga. He has to go to replace some boards in the fence. He decides he'll go for the weekend and catch up with an old friend. John spends half his time on rental property maintenance and half his time meeting his friend. Based on the time spent on rental property maintenance only half the cost of travel and accommodation can be claimed as tax deductible. The other half is a personal cost. If John was going to Tauranga for a holiday and just decided to pop in on his rental property, he would not be able to claim any of the cost. If John's trip is solely to visit the rental property then the travel costs are fully deductible. Do not forget you need receipts or invoices for any travel costs that you claim, whether this is the full cost or part-cost. Go to page 12 for more on record keeping requirements. Fees You can deduct as an expense any fees that you incur in: • arranging a mortgage to finance the rental property • drawing up a tenancy agreement • getting a valuation required to obtain a mortgage. (A valuation acquired for insurance purposes is not deductible) • taking legal action to recover unpaid rent • evicting a tenant. You can also claim legal fees as part of buying a rental property provided your total legal fees for the income year are $10,000 or less. Mortgage repayment insurance You can claim a deduction for the cost of any mortgage repayment insurance if you are required by the lender to incur this expense to obtain a loan. Accounting fees If you use an accountant to prepare your accounts the cost of the fees are tax deductible. Any fees paid when setting up the rental property, such as investigating the viability of the rental, are not deductible. Depreciation Depreciation covers the cost of wear and tear and general ageing of assets used to produce income. You can: • claim a deduction for depreciation on any furniture or fittings that belong to you, or • elect not to claim depreciation - see page 26. 9 ird.govt.nz Note When you sell or dispose of an asset (except a building) for an amount different from its adjusted tax value,\* you must account for the difference - either a loss or a gain - in your income tax return. \* Adjusted tax value is generally the cost price, less depreciation deducted each year. For more information about depreciation see Part 2 of this guide. Expenses you cannot deduct for tax purposes You cannot claim deductions for capital expenses, private expenses, or expenses that do not relate to your rental. Capital expenses are the costs of buying a capital asset or increasing its value, for example the cost of buying the property and making improvements. Private expenses are things you buy or pay for that are for your own benefit, rather than to generate rental income. The following are expenses you cannot deduct from your rental income in your tax return: • the purchase price of a rental property • the capital portion of any mortgage repayments • interest on money you borrow for some purpose other than financing the rental property, even if you use the rental property to secure the loan • the cost of repairing or replacing any damaged part of the property, if the repairs or replacement make improvements to the property and increase its value • the cost of adding to or improving the property • real estate agent or legal fees charged as part of selling the property. Note Generally, you cannot claim legal fees charged as part of selling the property. However, you may be able to claim your legal expenses for selling a rental property if: • you are in the business of providing residential rental accommodation, and • your total legal expenses for the income year are $10,000 or less (including any legal expenses relating to buying the property). For more information about the expenses you can claim talk to your tax agent. Expenditure to meet Healthy Homes standards Owners of residential rental properties are required to make sure their properties meet certain minimum standards. The 2019 Healthy Homes regulations apply progressively when there are changes in tenancies after 1 July 2021 with universal application from 1 July 2024. RENTAL INCOME 10 Costs incurred in meeting the standards will be capital in nature and not deductible if the work: • results in the reconstruction, replacement or renewal of the whole asset or substantially the whole asset, or • goes over and above making good wear and tear (that is, it is not a repair) and changes the character of the asset. Costs incurred in meeting the standards will be revenue in nature and deductible if work to repair or maintain an asset is completed without reconstructing, replacing or renewing the whole asset, or substantially the whole asset, or without changing its character. For more information, see our Question we've been asked (QB) 20/01: Can owners of existing residential properties claim deductions for costs incurred to meet Healthy Homes standards at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz If the property is not rented out for the full year You can claim a deduction for any expenses that you incur while your rental property is either rented out or is available to be rented out. But if the property is not occupied by tenants or available for rent for part of the year, you cannot claim the full year's ongoing costs, such as rates, insurance and interest. Example You own a property and live in it for the first 3 months of the year. You then rent it out for the rest of the year. The cost of rates, insurance and interest for the year is $9,230. To work out your rental income for the year, deduct the ongoing costs for the 9 months the property was rented out, that is, 9/12ths of the expenses. $9,230 ÷ 12 = $769.16 per month $769.16 × 9 = $6,922.44 The amount of these expenses you can claim for the year. If a property is not occupied or available for letting for a short time, because of redecorating or other maintenance, you can still get a deduction for the ongoing costs for that period. The redecorating or maintenance costs will also be deductible, as long as the work done is not classed as capital improvements. If your residential rental activity makes a loss In this guide, “rental loss” refers to when your deductions for a rental property exceed the income you earned from the rental activity. Rental losses can only be used to reduce your overall tax liability by offsetting the losses against other income, like salary and wages, up to and including the 2018-19 income year. From the start of the 2019-20 income year, deductions you can claim for residential rental property in a particular year generally cannot be more than the rental income you earn from the rental activity. Any deductions in excess of your income from the property for the year will be carried forward to the next year you earn income from the residential property. Find out more in Part 4 - Residential property deduction rules. 11 ird.govt.nz Example You own a property and receive $15,000 rental income for the year. In that year, you incur $16,000 of expenses. Under the new rules, you can only claim $15,000 of expenses against your rental income for the year and must carry forward the excess deductions of $1,000 to a future income year in which you receive income from your residential property. Note Accumulated tax losses brought forward from the 2018-19 income year are not affected by the new rules for rental deductions, even if they include rental losses. You may continue to offset these tax losses against your net income. However, from the start of the 2019-20 income year onwards, excess residential rental deductions will be carried forward separately from the accumulated tax losses. If the property is rented out at less than market value If you rent your property out for less than its true rental value, for example, to a relative or friend at mates’ rates, and you still make a profit from it, the profit is taxable as part of your income. But if you make a loss in this situation, because the expenses of the property are more than the reduced rental income, you generally will not be able to deduct expenses more than the amount of income you received. Record keeping You must keep records to be able to calculate the income and expenses of your rental property and for us to confirm your accounts. These include: • a record of all receipts and payments • bank statements, cheque butts and deposit books • invoices and receipts • working papers for all calculations, including your vehicle logbook • a list of assets and receipts with cost price and purchase date • a copy of the rental agreement and rent book • a copy of any loan mortgage agreement. It's a good idea to use a separate bank account for your rental activity. Note You must keep accurate records of the purchases and sales of your rental assets so we can check your depreciation deductions if we need to. Keep all your records for 7 years, even if you stop renting out the property. You do not need to send your records or working papers with your tax return, but you must keep them in case we want to see them.

Each IR3R covers the year to your balance date. Note 2 Income Enter the total rents received in Box 1. Enter any other income related to the rental property, such as insurance receipts or rates refunds in Box 2. If you sell or dispose of any of your assets you may be required to account for the loss or gain in Box 3. Add up Boxes 1, 2 and 3 to calculate your total income. If Box 3 is a loss, subtract it from the sum of Boxes 1 and 2. Enter the total income in Box 4. Note 3 Expenses Claim ongoing expenses such as rates, insurance, interest and depreciation in proportion to the number of months the property was available for renting out, for example if the property was available for 10 months, you can claim 10 / 12 of these expenses. Expense for a holiday home or bach used both privately and to earn income may be subject to the mixed-use asset rules. See the Rental income - IR264 booklet for more information. Note 4 Interest From 1 October 2021, interest is not deductible for residential property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 unless an exclusion or exemption applies. For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest is being phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. Enter the total interest incurred for residential property in Box 7A. Do not include this amount in total expenses at Box 14. Enter interest expenses claimed in Box 7B. Include this amount in total expenses at Box 14. If you have claimed an interest expense in Box 7B, at Box 7C tick the reason(s) for the interest expense claimed. See the Rental income – IR264 booklet for more information. Note 5 Repairs, maintenance and other expenses Please fully explain any claims for repairs, maintenance and other expenses. You may claim repairs and maintenance but not additions or improvements to property or plant. Improvements to property or plant can be depreciated. If there is not enough space, please attach a separate note. Note 6 Depreciation on buildings From the 2011-2012 income year, depreciation on buildings has reduced to 0% where buildings have an economic life of more than 50 years. For more information refer to Depreciation – a guide for businesses - IR260 Note 7 Depreciation on assets You may depreciate each item individually or pool some or all of the assets to calculate depreciation. Assets which can be pooled are those which: - are not used privately, and - cost $5,000 or less, or - have been depreciated so their adjusted tax value is $5,000 or less. Pool depreciation is calculated on the average pool value at a single rate using the DV method. The rate you must use for the pool is the lowest rate for an asset in the pool. Once you have included an asset in a pool you can segregate it only if you use the asset for private use. If you switch from the DV to the SL method for assets not pooled, calculate depreciation on the opening adjusted tax value instead of the original cost. To find the correct rate of depreciation for an asset, please see our depreciation rate finder at ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators Note 8 Residential rental properties From the start of the 2019-2020 income year, deductions for residential rental properties are subject to residential property deduction rules. The new rules limit the amount of deductions you can claim if your residential rental property makes a loss in an income year. You can use the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to help you complete your return. Note 9 Record keeping Keep your receipts and invoices with your records in case we request them. You must keep all your records for seven years. Note 10 More information Our booklets Rental income - IR264, Depreciation - IR260 and Depreciation rates - IR265 may help you.

This applies regardless of when the building was acquired. Calculating the net rent If you own a residential rental property that is subject to the residential property deduction rules, you can use the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to calculate your net residential income and any excess residential rental deductions you may have. These worksheets help you calculate the amounts that you need to transfer to the section in your return for Income from residential property. Find out more in Part 4 - Residential property deduction rules. For rental properties that are not subject to the rules, once you've worked out what your income and expenses are, transfer the information to our Rental income - IR3R and calculate the net rent. Transfer the net rent figure from Box 15 to your income tax return and attach the IR3R. Find an example of a completed IR3R on the previous page. Paying income tax If you're an individual property owner, or a partner in a partnership, you need to complete an IR3, or if you're a non-resident, an IR3NR, income tax return each year. You can submit your return online in myIR. You can also download a return from ird.govt.nz/end-of-tax-year and send it to us by post. If your rental property is not subject to the residential property deduction rules, the net income from that property is added to your other income, and the net loss is offset against your other income. If your rental property is subject to the rules, you cannot offset your net loss against your other income. Any excess deductions will need to be carried forward until the next year you earn residential income. You then work out the tax on your total taxable income. If you have any tax credits, such as PAYE or RWT on interest or dividends, these are deducted from the tax on your total taxable income. After deducting any tax credits you'll have a balance to pay or to be refunded. The tax year ends 31 March each year for most people. If you have any tax to pay, known as residual income tax, for the year, it usually needs to be paid to us by 7 February of the following year. If you have a tax agent with an extension of time you have until 7 April. When you start renting out your property, you’ll need to complete a tax return each year. You can do this in myIR. RENTAL INCOME 14 Provisional tax If you have to pay income tax of more than $5,000 ($2,500 for the 2019/20 and earlier years) at the end of any tax year, you'll most likely have to pay provisional tax for the following year. Provisional tax is not a separate tax, but a way of paying the tax on your income as you receive it through the year. You usually pay 3 instalments of provisional tax, based on what you expect your tax at the end of the year to be. If your balance date is 31 March then your instalment dates are 28 August, 15 January and 7 May each year. For more information read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. Note If you're registered for GST and also have to pay provisional tax, please read our Provisional tax - IR289 guide. If the property is owned by more than 1 person If you own a residential property with 1 or more people, your income tax obligations will depend on the nature of the relationship with the other people. You may own a residential property jointly with 1 or more people but not have entered into a formal legal partnership with them. For example, the owners of a jointly owned property may be married or in a civil union, in a de facto relationship, or relatives. In this case, each of you must complete an Individual tax return - IR3 for your share of the rental income and deductions. A copy of the rental accounts or completed Rental income - IR3R schedule must be included in each individual tax return. You do not need a separate partnership IRD number and you do not need to submit an IR7 return. Your partnership needs its own IRD number if: • you are in a legal partnership that carries on a business in New Zealand (and you may have entered into a formal agreement recording the purpose of the partnership and details such as the responsibility, contribution, and share of each of the partners), or • you own a property in partnership which is a limited partnership registered under the Limited Partnerships Act 2008. You can get an IRD number for your partnership by completing an IRD number application - resident non-individual - IR596 form. The partnership only needs to keep 1 set of accounts to record its income and expenses and file an IR7 income tax return each year. This return shows the rental income calculated in your Rental income - IR3R schedule and the amount of each partner's share. Each individual in the partnership then uses that share to complete their income tax return. If the partnership owns residential property subject to the residential property deduction rules, use the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to calculate each partner's net income and any excess deductions. Note Each partner's individual tax return must include their share of the rental profit or loss. 15 ird.govt.nz What happens if the rental property is sold or you move into it? If you sell or move into your rental property, you'll need to make some adjustments in your tax return. The amount of expenses you can claim for a loss-making residential rental property may change depending on whether the sale of the property was taxable. Find out more in Part 4 - Residential property deduction rules. Please read the depreciation section on page 19 and then refer to pages 30-32. The rules applying to building sales can be quite complex so you may want to consult your tax agent. Bright-line property rule for residential property If you purchase or acquire a residential rental property on or after 1 October 2015 and sell or dispose of it within the applicable bright-line period, any gain on sale may be taxable income. The bright-line property rule will apply if you purchased or acquired residential property on or after: • 1 October 2015 through to 28 March 2018 and you sold or disposed of it within 2 years • 29 March 2018 through to 26 March 2021 and you sold or disposed of it within 5 years. This includes property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 if it was acquired as a result of an offer the purchaser made on or before 23 March 2021 and that offer could not be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021, or • 27 March 2021 and you sold or disposed of it within 5 years to the extent the property has a 'new build' on it or 10 years for all other properties. The date you acquire a property is generally the date a binding sale and purchase agreement was entered into for the purchase of the property (even if some standard conditions like getting finance or a building report still need to be met). This date determines which bright-line period applies. In most cases your bright-line period starts on the date the legal title is transferred to you and ends on the date you enter into a binding sale and purchase agreement to sell or dispose of the property. For more information on when a property is acquired, see our Question we've been asked (QB) 17/02: Date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz Note From the 2021-22 income year, the definition of residential land has been amended to ensure the bright-line property rule applies to short-stay accommodation in a dwelling that is not the owner’s main home, even if it's a business premises (for example, Airbnb). Newly built properties From 27 March 2021, to qualify for the shorter 5-year bright-line period for new builds, one of the following must be satisfied:   • For an existing new build, you must have acquired it no later than 12 months after the Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) was issued for that new build under the Building Act 2004.  • Where you made an off-the-plans purchase for the new build, the CCC confirming the dwelling was added to the land must be issued by the time you sold the land.  RENTAL INCOME 16 • Where you constructed the new build on your land, the CCC confirming the dwelling was added to the land must be issued by the time you sold the land.  ln all cases the new build must be a self-contained dwelling and must still be on the land when you sold it, otherwise the 10-year bright-line period applies. A remediated or converted building can also qualify as a new build in any of the following situations: • It was removed from the earthquake prone buildings register on or after 27 March 2020 and you can prove the remediation is complete. Proof can be either a CCC or local or building consent authority records showing the work was completed and then signed off by a qualified engineer. • It had weathertightness issues in the past but it’s now at least 75% reclad and a CCC was issued on or after 27 March 2020 for the reclad. • It has been converted from a commercial premises and a CCC was issued on or after 27 March 2020 confirming the conversion has been completed. • It was converted from a hotel or motel, and local or building consent authority records show the conversion was completed on or after 27 March 2020. • It is part of a building with 2 or more dwellings that before conversion was just a single dwelling, and a CCC was issued on or after 27 March 2020 confirming the conversion. Where land has a new build and a non-new build on the same legal title, any gain on the sale of the property may need to be apportioned between the new build and the non-new build. Only the gain on sale in relation to the new build qualifies for the 5-year bright-line period. Adding a new build to land after acquiring it does not restart the bright-line period to the date the new build was added. The start of the bright-line period remains the same, which for most people is the date property ownership is registered with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ). Example James signs a sale and purchase agreement for a section in March 2023. Settlement occurs and title is transferred to James on 12 April 2023. James adds a new build to the section. The new build receives its CCC confirming it has been added to the land in June 2025. James sells the property in October 2029. The bright-line period begins on 12 April 2023 (when title was issued to James) and not from June 2025 (when the new build receives its CCC). Therefore, James would only be taxed on the gains on sale if he sold the property by 11 April 2028 (that is, within 5 years of title for the property transferring to James). Since James sold the land outside of that period, the bright-line property rule does not apply. Note If you're an offshore residential land withholding tax (RLWT) person and sell or dispose of your New Zealand residential property within the applicable bright-line period (see above), you may have RLWT deducted. For more information go to ird.govt.nz/rlwt For more information see our guide Bright-line property tax - IR1227. 17 ird.govt.nz GST (goods and services tax) Renting out residential property long-term is exempt from GST. You cannot claim GST on expenses from a residential property, and you cannot include GST in the rent you charge. But, when you claim income tax deductions you use the cost of the expense including the GST. If you're a property developer and you buy residential properties, you may have to pay GST. Go to ird.govt.nz/gst for more information. Working for Families and student loans When you apply for Working for Families you must show any rental income you earn. Go to ird.govt.nz/working-for-families to find out more. If you're a student loan borrower, from 1 April 2014 rental losses will not reduce your income for working out your student loan repayment obligation. Prior to this the rental loss did reduce your income and repayment obligation. Depreciation on buildings If you sell a rental property that you owned before 2003 and have depreciation recovered for income tax purposes, you can reduce your income for Working for Families by the amount of any depreciation recovered. Child support From 1 April 2019, residential rental losses will generally no longer reduce your income for working out how much child support you pay. This is because a child support assessment is based on your taxable income. RENTAL INCOME 18 Part 2 - Depreciation Assets, such as the stove and carpets, that are part of the property or used in your rental activity will eventually reduce in value through wear and tear or by becoming out of date. This reduction in the value of your assets is known as depreciation. Each year you calculate the depreciation amount and deduct it as an expense. This is a summary of the depreciation rules relating to rental properties. For more information read our guide Depreciation - a guide for business - IR260 or go to ird.govt.nz/depreciation We set depreciation rates for various assets, excluding land as it's not depreciated, for tax purposes. We base these rates on: • its estimated useful life • its estimated residual (market) value. The assets commonly used in rental activity and their depreciation rates are listed on pages 22-25. If you're claiming depreciation you have to keep a schedule of all the assets you're depreciating. This should show the depreciation claimed in previous years and the adjusted tax value of each asset. The adjusted tax value is generally the cost price, less depreciation deducted each year. You can choose not to claim depreciation - go to page 26. Note If you inherited the property, the cost price for depreciation is its market value at the time the property is transferred to you as the new owner. The exception is for a spouse, civil union, or de facto partner, in this case the transfer is at cost or adjusted tax value. If you've claimed depreciation on the sale of a building prior to the 2011-12 income year, you're required to account for the gain in your income tax return - go to pages 28-31. If you rent a holiday home to the public for short-term stays, there may be limits to the amount of depreciation you can claim. See Part 5 for more information. Depreciation methods You can depreciate an asset individually or as part of a group or pool of assets - go to page 25. But you cannot pool the assets if you also use them privately, for example, the chattels in a holiday home you sometimes rent out and sometimes use yourself. If you choose to calculate depreciation on individual assets, you can use either the diminishing value method or the straight line method. If you pool your assets you can only use the diminishing value method. Diminishing value method Using this method, the amount of depreciation is worked out on the adjusted tax value of the asset. This value is the original cost price (including GST) less any depreciation already claimed in previous years. 19 ird.govt.nz Example 1 Using diminishing value method Asset: Dishwasher - purchased after 20 May 2020 Cost: $1,200 Depreciation rate: 30% Value atAdjusted tax value start of the year Depreciation rateDepreciation claimed Adjusted tax value end of year Ye a r 1$1,200.0030%$360.00$840.00 Ye a r 2$840.0030%$252.00$588.00 Ye a r 3$588.0030%$176.40$411.60 Ye a r 4$411.6030%$123.48$288.12 Ye a r 5$288.1230%$86.44$201.68 Note This table excludes the 20% loading which ceased from 20 May 2010. Straight line method Each year you claim a set percentage of the asset's original cost. This percentage is set so that the depreciation you claim over an asset's expected useful life works out to its original cost at the time you acquired it. Example 2 Using the straight-line method to depreciate the dishwasher in Example 1. Original costDepreciation rateDepreciation claimedAdjusted tax value Ye a r 1$1,20021%$252.00$948.00 Ye a r 2$1,20021%$252.00$696.00 Ye a r 3$1,20021%$252.00$444.00 Ye a r 4$1,20021%$252.00$192.00 Ye a r 5$1,20021%$192.00$0.00 You can claim $252.00 for the first four years, but, in the fifth year the final claim is $192.00. This is because the dishwasher's adjusted tax value is less than the original calculated depreciation of $252.00. The amount of depreciation claimed cannot exceed the adjusted tax value. RENTAL INCOME 20 Note You do not have to use the same method for all your assets, but you cannot switch methods for an asset part-way through any income year. You can change the method you choose for any asset from year to year. If you do change methods, the asset's opening value at the start of one year must be its adjusted tax value at the end of the previous year, not its original cost. Assets not used for the full year You have to reduce the amount of depreciation you claim on an asset if it has not been part of your rental activities for the whole year. You do this based on the number of months that you use it for rental purposes. Depreciation on buildings From the 2011-12 income year depreciation on residential buildings is 0% where buildings have an estimated useful life of 50 years or more. This applies regardless of when the building was acquired. If you're completing a tax return for an earlier income year, our Depreciation rate finder can help you find the correct rate of depreciation for your building. Go to ird.govt.nz/depreciation for more information. Depreciation on contents The following tables show the rates for some commonly used assets. If you have an asset that was acquired before the end of your 2004-05 income year different rates will apply. If this is the case, or an asset being used is not listed, go to ird.govt.nz/depreciation to find out more. 21 ird.govt.nz Table 1 - Assets acquired on or after 1 April 1995 and up to 31 March 2005 AssetDiminishing value %Straight line % General rateRate plus 20%General rateRate plus 20% Appliances (small)4048 3036 Bedding, linen50604048 Blinds, drapes and curtains2226.415.518.6 Carpets3339.62428.8 Crockery, cutlery, glassware50604048 Dishwashers2631.21821.6 Furniture (loose)1821.612.515 Lawnmowers40483036 Light fittings1821.612.515 Microwave oven2631.21821.6 Ovens and stoves2226.415.518.6 Paintings, drawings9.511.46.57.8 Refrigerators and freezers2226.415.518.6 Televisions, videos, stereos3339.62428.8 Utensils, pots, pans50604048 Washing machines, dryers2631.21821.6 RENTAL INCOME 22 Table 2 - Assets acquired on or after 1 April 2005 and up to 31 March 2011 AssetDiminishing value %Straight line % General rateRate plus 20%General rateRate plus 20% Appliances (small)50604048 Bedding, linen6780.4 6780.4 Blinds, drapes and curtains2530 17.521 Carpets4048 3036 Crockery, cutlery, glassware6780.4 6780.4 Dishwashers3036 2125.2 Furniture (loose)2024 13.516.2 Lawnmowers50604048 Light fittings2024 13.516.2 Microwave oven3036 2125.2 Ovens and stoves2530 17.521 Paintings, drawings101278.4 Refrigerators and freezers253017.521 Televisions, videos, stereos4048 3036 Utensils, pots, pans6780.46780.4 Washing machines, dryers3036 2125.2 Note The 20% loading does not apply to secondhand assets and has been removed for assets purchased after 20 May 2010. The general rate of depreciation will apply. Assets purchased, or with binding contracts for purchase, entered into on or before 20 May 2010 can continue to use the general rate with loading. Where there's a capital improvement to an asset with the 20% loading, this improvement needs to be depreciated separately from the original asset, and without the loading allowance. Low value items Where you purchase an asset that has a low value you can fully deduct the cost of that asset at the time of purchase. This removes the need to depreciate that low value asset over its useful life. A low value asset is determined by its cost: • up to 16 March 2020 - up to $500 • 17 March 2020 to 16 March 2021 - up to $5,000 • 17 March 2021 onwards - up to $1,000 23 ird.govt.nz Fully or partly furnished properties If you rent your property out fully or partly furnished you can either depreciate the contents individually or, if there are many items included in the contents (for example loose furniture, paintings), choose to pool the assets.

Go to page 23 for more on low value items. This means you do not have to work out the depreciation on each one separately. You can pool assets that individually cost up to $5,000, or have been depreciated and now have an adjusted tax value of $5,000 or less. You can apply to us to pool assets when their values are more than $5,000. You can also have more than one pool. Once an asset is included in a pool you cannot treat it as a single asset again later, except where the asset is now used by you privately. Note The maximum pooling value of $5,000 applies from the 2015-16 income year. If you're filing for income years prior to this the maximum pooling value is $2,000. You depreciate each pool using the diminishing value method, at the lowest depreciation rate applying to any asset in the pool. 25 ird.govt.nz Example A pool of chattels (purchased before 1 April 2005) consisting of carpets (39.6% depreciation rate), light fittings (21.6%), drapes (26.4%), stove (26.4%) and dishwasher (31.2%) is created. The lowest rate in the pool is light fittings, so the depreciation rate to use is 21.6%. If the carpets were not included in the pool, the rate to use for the pool would still be 21.6%, but the carpets could then be depreciated individually at 39.6%. If you sell an asset in a pool for more than its cost, the excess is subtracted from the adjusted tax value of the pool. Electing not to depreciate an asset You may decide you do not want to claim a depreciation deduction, for example, when renting out your home while you're overseas. Note In this section, the term asset does not include a building. From the 2011-12 income year depreciation on buildings is 0%. If you decide not to claim depreciation on an asset, and you do not want to pay tax on depreciation recovered when depreciation was not claimed, you should elect not to treat the asset as depreciable. Tell us on an asset-by-asset basis by telling us which assets you're choosing not to depreciate. Tell us which asset you're making an election for in your tax return for the income year when: • you purchase your asset • you change the use of your asset from non-business to business. Once you've given us your election not to depreciate an asset you cannot claim depreciation on this asset in future years. It will not be a depreciable asset and the depreciation recovery or loss on sale provisions will not apply. If you do not make an election not to depreciate an asset, even if you have not claimed depreciation, you'll be considered to have claimed it. The amount considered to be a claim needs to be included in the depreciation recovery calculation. Note You can backdate an election not to depreciate an asset you never claimed depreciation on. The election is made by telling us in your tax return in any income year after acquiring the asset. RENTAL INCOME 26 Example Geoff rented out his house while he was overseas for a year, from June 2018. Q Does he have to claim depreciation on the chattels left in the house for the period the house is rented out? A No, Geoff can elect not to depreciate the depreciable assets in the house for the period the house is rented. Geoff must tell us in his tax return for the 2018-19 year. If no election is made, it's assumed that depreciation has been claimed. Working out the value of chattels When you buy a property, you need to work out the value of your chattels so you can make a claim for depreciation. If you have a registered valuation, use the total value of all the chattels and apportion this amongst them on a market value basis. If you do not have a registered valuation, use the market value of each chattel as its opening tax value on which to claim depreciation. You can get market values from second-hand dealers or from classified advertisements for similar items of the same age and condition. Note You can find examples of depreciable items, for example, fixtures, fittings and chattels, in our interpretation statement IS 10/01: Residential rental properties - depreciation of items of depreciable property at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz Transferring personal assets to your rental activity Sometimes you might transfer a personal asset into your rental property. For example, you buy a new stove for your own house and move your old stove into your rental property. If one of your personal assets becomes part of your rental activity, use its market value at the time of the change to use as the opening book value for depreciation. Example At the local second-hand dealer there's a stove the same as the one you're moving into the rental property. It's being sold for $250. This can be used as market value. The opening value in your assets register will be $250. Note This rule does not apply to buildings - go to page 30 for more information. 27 ird.govt.nz Renting out your own home If you start to rent out the home that you were living in, you need to use the market value of your chattels at the time you started renting the property to calculate depreciation. You also need to make some adjustments if you later move back into the property - page 30. Selling and disposing of assets If you sell or dispose of a rental asset that is not a building for a different amount to its adjusted tax value, you need to account for the difference - either a loss or a gain. Remember the adjusted tax value is the remaining value of your asset once all depreciation calculated has been deducted from the value of the asset. If you sell an asset for more than its adjusted tax value, you'll have to include the difference between the sale price and the adjusted tax value in your taxable income. Only include the difference between the original cost and the adjusted tax value in your taxable income if the asset is sold for more than its original cost. Note Costs incurred in selling an asset, such as commission and advertising, can be deducted from the sale price before you work out the loss or gain on sale. Example 1 - All depreciation deductions have been claimed Stove purchased for $ 1,400 Less depreciation allowed as a deduction $ 1,260 Adjusted tax value $ 140 Sale price of stove $ 250 Less adjusted tax value $ 140 Depreciation recovered $ 110 The depreciation recovered is $110 and is included as taxable income in the year the stove was sold. RENTAL INCOME 28 Example 2 - Not all depreciation deductions have been claimed When an asset is sold and you did not claim all the depreciation you still have to calculate it as if all depreciation has been claimed, to find the adjusted tax value when accounting for the difference. Depreciation claimed: Income yearDepreciation claimedBook value $1,400 2011$252$1,148 2012nil$1,148 2013$252$896 2014$252$644 2015nil$644 For 2012 and 2015 the depreciation that has not been claimed is considered to have been claimed. So the total depreciation allowed as a deduction is $1,260 ($252 × 5 years). Stove purchased for $ 1,400 Less depreciation allowed as a deduction $ 1,260 Adjusted tax value $ 140 Sale price of stove $ 250 Less adjusted tax value $ 140 Depreciation recovered $ 110 The depreciation recovered is $110 and is included as taxable income in the year the stove was sold. Gain If you sell an asset for more than its adjusted tax value, include in your taxable income the lesser of: • the total depreciation that could have been deducted • the amount by which the sale price received exceeds the adjusted tax value, or • the amount by which the original cost exceeds the adjusted tax value. Loss If you sell an asset for less than its adjusted tax value, you can claim a deduction for the difference between the sale price and the adjusted tax value. Note If you sell an asset for a price that's substantially different from its true market value at the time, for tax purposes the sale is treated as though you had sold the asset for its true market value. This is so people cannot avoid paying tax by selling assets to their associates for artificially low prices. If you keep an asset, but stop using it for rental purposes, you'll have to make an adjustment as if you'd sold it for its market value at the start of the next tax year. For example, you take an asset from your rental property for your own personal use or you move into the property. 29 ird.govt.nz You make the adjustment in your income tax return for the year after the asset changed use or the year after you ceased renting the property. Sale of a building If you sell a building that you've previously claimed depreciation on, this section applies to you. Depreciation on residential buildings only applied before the 2011-12 income year. When a residential building is sold for more than its adjusted tax value, the depreciation recovered is taxable income. The amount of depreciation recovered is the lesser of: • the original cost price of the building, less the adjusted tax value, or • the sale price, less the adjusted tax value. This ensures that any capital profit made on the sale of a residential building is not included as depreciation recovered. Moving back into your own home If you stop renting your own home and move back into it (or move into a property you have been renting), for the purpose of depreciation you treat this as if you’ve sold the property. The sale value of the property is the market value as at the beginning of the next income year. If you’ve claimed depreciation on the property, and the sale value is more than its adjusted tax value, the depreciation recovered is taxable income. The depreciation recovered is the lesser of: • the original cost price of the building less the adjusted tax value or • the sale value less the adjusted tax value. You’ll need to show the depreciation recovery income in your income tax return the year after you moved back into the property. Example Original purchase price (excluding land value) $ 100,000 Total depreciation claimed $ 10,000 Adjusted tax value $ 90,000 Sale value (excluding land value) $ 125,000 Adjusted tax value $ 90,000 Gain on sale $ 35,000 Depreciation recovered $10,000 The depreciation recovered ($10,000) is less than the gain on sale ($35,000). Include the $10,000 of depreciation recovered as income in your tax return the year after you move back into the property. Generally, depreciation claimed on a house would be recoverable because the market value of the house would usually be higher than the adjusted tax value. Chattels though, in most circumstances, depreciate faster than a house and the market value of the chattels is likely to be close to the adjusted tax value, reducing any likely difference. RENTAL INCOME 30 When you rent out your home with the intention of moving back in the future you may want to consider the effect of depreciating each asset. Electing not to depreciate the asset could reduce any depreciation to be recovered. If you sell the property for a loss, generally you cannot claim this or any excess deductions unless you have other income from a taxable property sale. These will need to be held and offset in a future year, when you have income from a taxable property sale. Note Losses on the sale or disposal of buildings are not deductible, unless the building has been rendered useless for the purposes of deriving income - page 32. The rules applying to building sales can be quite complex, so you may need to talk to a tax agent. Disposal costs You're allowed a deduction for the cost to dismantle, demolish and remove an asset. You include this cost when you work out a loss or gain on the disposal of the asset. Example Machinery is damaged by a flood and a cost is incurred to remove the machinery from the business premises. Original purchase price$ 1,200 Less total depreciation claimed$ 1,000 Adjusted tax value$200 Proceeds from sale as scrap metal$ 500 Less cost of removal from premises-$ 800 Net disposal proceeds-$300 Loss on disposal-$500 Insurance proceeds Assets lost or destroyed If you receive an insurance payout for an asset which is lost or destroyed, treat it like you've sold the asset for the amount of the insurance payout: • If the insurance payout is more than the asset's adjusted tax value but less than its original cost, you must include the difference between the insurance payment and the adjusted tax value as taxable income. • If the insurance payout is more than the asset's adjusted tax value and also more than the asset's original cost, you must include the difference between the cost and the adjusted tax value as taxable income. The difference between the insurance payout and the asset's cost is a capital gain and not taxable. • If the insurance payout is less than the asset's adjusted tax value, you can treat it like a loss on sale and claim the difference. Remember, if the asset was a building, there's no deduction for any loss on sale. 31 ird.govt.nz Damaged assets If you receive an insurance payout to repair a damaged asset, do not include it as income and do not claim the cost of the repairs which are covered by the insurance. However, please note the following: • If the insurance payment is more than the cost of the repairs, you need to deduct the excess from the asset's adjusted tax value. If this makes the adjusted tax value a negative amount, you're required to include this amount in your gross rental income. • If the insurance payout is less than the cost of the repairs, you can deduct the extra cost of the repairs from your taxable income. Remember to keep all invoices relating to the repairs. Loss on disposal of buildings If an unexpected event causes damage to the building or to the neighbourhood of the building so that it's useless and cannot be used to earn income, then you're allowed a deduction for a loss on the disposal of the building. This is providing the damage has not been caused by the owner. The unexpected event could be a natural disaster such as an earthquake, flood or fire. Damage of the neighbourhood of the building can be where: • 2 buildings next door are badly damaged by fire, and your building has to be demolished to demolish the fire damaged buildings • the building is undamaged but an earthquake has made the ground unstable so that it must be demolished. You can offset any disposal costs (for example demolition costs) from any disposal proceeds to calculate the final loss or gain on disposal. Example A building is damaged in an earthquake and must be demolished. Original purchase price$ 140,000 Less total depreciation claimed (before 2011-12 income year)$40,000 Adjusted tax value$ 100,000 Insurance proceeds$ 120,000 Less demolition costs-$25,000 Net disposal proceeds$95,000 Loss on disposal-$5,000 The building is disposed of for less than its adjusted tax value resulting in a loss of $5,000. This can be claimed as a deduction. RENTAL INCOME 32 Part 3 – Interest Overview of the rules Since 1 October 2021, interest limitation rules mean interest is not deductible for residential property in New Zealand acquired on or after 27 March 2021 (unless an exclusion or exemption applies). For properties acquired before 27 March 2021, the ability to deduct interest is being phased out as shown in the table below (provided the loan was first drawn down before 27 March 2021 or was for the settlement of the property): Date interest incurredPercentage of the interest that can be claimed 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021100% 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021100% 1 October 2021 to 31 March 202275% 1 April 2022 to 31 March 202375% 1 April 2023 to 31 March 202450% 1 April 2024 to 31 March 202525% Note You can continue to deduct a portion of your interest expense during the interest phase-out period in certain situations where legal ownership changes - see Changes in how property is held on page 47. Interest on any new loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 cannot be claimed from 1 October 2021 onwards. Example In May 2021, Petra drew down an additional $100,000 to add an extra floor onto her rental property. Interest on this $100,000 is $250 per month. The additional $100,000 was not part of the loan required to complete the terms of the sale and purchase agreement signed before 27 March 2021. Therefore, from 1 October 2021, Petra cannot claim any deduction for the $250 per month interest expense incurred on the additional $100,000. A property purchased on or after 27 March 2021 can qualify for phased-out interest deductions only if it was purchased as a result of an offer made on or before 23 March 2021, and that offer was not able to be revoked or withdrawn before 27 March 2021 (for example, by tender). 33 ird.govt.nz Note Special rules apply for loans in a foreign currency, refinanced loans and for interest on variable balance loans (such as revolving credit and overdraft facilities) – see page 44. We have tools to help you work out if the interest limitation rules apply to your property. You can find our Guided help on our website ird.govt.nz/property-interest-rules. Property the rules apply to The interest limitation rules apply to residential property in New Zealand. Overseas properties are not subject to the rules. Generally, any property with a dwelling on it (such as a house or apartment) is subject to these rules, and also bare land that could be used for residential property. It does not matter whether the property is rented out long or short-term, used for short-stay accommodation some or all of the time, or left vacant. Property the rules do not apply to Certain properties are not affected by these rules, for example, farmland, employee accommodation owned by a business and an accommodation business where the owner lives on the property. Certain types of Māori land are also unaffected by interest limitation, along with housing provided by Māori authorities to its shareholders or beneficiaries (for example, papakāinga and kaumātua housing). For more information on these and other properties not affected by the interest limitation rules, go to ird.govt.nz/property-interest-rules This means that if you satisfy the general deductibility rules, you are still able to deduct interest for these properties. If a property you own is partly affected and partly unaffected by the rules, then you will need to apportion your interest expense between the different parts of the land using standard tax apportionment principles (for example, considering area and time). Main home You generally cannot claim interest deductions for private use, but if you use your main home to earn income for example, from a flatmate, boarder or as short-stay accommodation, you are able to deduct some interest against that income. An interest deduction is also allowed if you use your main home for a non-accommodation income- earning purpose, for example, a workshop or a contractor's home office. RENTAL INCOME 34 Example Tane owns two residential properties – one in Wellington and another up the coast at Waikanae beach. He spends most of his time in Wellington. Tane has a flatmate at his Wellington property. He spends many weekends at his property in Waikanae, normally driving up Friday night and returning to Wellington on Sunday. Tane’s Wellington property is his main home and is not subject to the interest limitation rules. However, the proportion of his interest expense he can deduct in relation to the rent from his flatmate is limited under other parts of the Income Tax Act 2007. Tane’s Waikanae property is subject to the interest limitation rules as it is not Tane’s main home. For interest to be deductible, it must satisfy the general deductibility rules. In a flatmate situation, this means apportioning expenses between shared areas, areas exclusively used by the flatmate, and areas exclusively used by the homeowner to determine the amount that is deductible. Example Consider Tane’s main home in Wellington and the income he derives from having a flatmate. Tane’s monthly interest expense is $600. Tane has exclusive use of one bedroom, an ensuite and a spare room, which he uses as an office. His flatmate has exclusive use of a second bedroom and a different bathroom. They both have shared use of the lounge, dining room, kitchen and laundry. Looking at the shared-use and exclusive-use areas, Tane calculates that 30% of his interest expense relates to the income from his flatmate and is deductible, and the remaining 70% is non-deductible due to the private nature of the use. Tane would be able to deduct $180 of his monthly interest expense. Where there are multiple residential properties on the same parcel of land (for example, a main dwelling and a self-contained flat or cottage, sometimes advertised as “home and income”), only the property used by the owner as the main home qualifies for the main home exclusion. Example Mandi owns a property that is split into two – a self-contained one-bedroom flat on the ground floor and a larger three-bedroom unit above it. Mandi lives in the upstairs three-bedroom unit. Mandi wants a flatmate in her unit and also wants to find a tenant for the downstairs flat. Mandi’s friend Miriama moves in to one of the bedrooms upstairs. Mandi advertises the downstairs flat online and finds a tenant to move into it. The upstairs three-bedroom unit is Mandi’s main home and qualifies for the main home exclusion. Mandi is able to deduct some of her interest expense against her rental income from Miriama. The downstairs one-bedroom flat is not part of her main home and is residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. 35 ird.govt.nz To qualify for the main home exclusion, the person who incurs the interest and the person who owns the main home generally need to be the same person. In most cases, only natural persons can be considered to have main homes. However, if you hold your residential property through a transparent entity like a look-through company (LTC), the main home exclusion may still apply. This is because shareholders in LTCs are deemed to hold their proportion of LTC assets directly for tax purposes. Note Non-LTC companies (ordinary companies) do not have access to the main home exclusion. If the property is owned by a trust, the property will meet the main home exclusion if it is the main home of one of the trust’s beneficiaries and a principal settlor does not have a different main home of their own. A principal settlor is someone whose settlements for the trust are the greatest, or greatest equal, by market value. Build-to-rent land A medium-to-large scale housing development (with 20 or more dwellings with a single owner) built to provide long-term rental accommodation is excluded from the interest limitation rules. You’ll qualify for this exclusion if your development is approved as build-to-rent land by Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga ‒ Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). A full list of the requirements and information about the application process is available at www.hud.govt.nz/our-work/build-to-rent/ For new developments, the requirements must be met and you’ll need to apply as soon as the development is completed. If approved, the exclusion will apply from the date your application is received by HUD. Note Any existing developments have until 1 July 2023 to meet the requirements and for you to apply. If the development does not meet this deadline, it will never qualify for the exclusion. If this deadline is met, the exclusion can apply retrospectively meaning the interest incurred on or after 1 October 2021 can be claimed. Once approved, HUD will record your land on a register of build-to-rent assets and will share this information with us. You will need to notify HUD of any changes to your approved build-to-rent land, for example units or dwellings that no longer meet the requirements. Only interest relating to the portion of the development meeting the build-to-rent land definition can be claimed. You’ll have to apportion your interest expense in your income tax return for any units or dwellings that do not meet the build-to-rent land definition. Individual units or dwellings that become ineligible can never qualify for the exclusion again in the future. If this results in your development no longer meeting the requirements for build-to-rent land, the development will no longer qualify for an exclusion from the interest limitation rules. Even if your development meets the requirements in the future, it can never qualify for the build-to-rent exclusion again. Once your exclusion comes to an end, you must stop claiming interest as an expense in your income tax return unless another exclusion or exemption applies. RENTAL INCOME 36 Note A development is not prevented from accessing the new build exemption instead of the build-to-rent exclusion. However, to access the build-to-rent exclusion at any time in the future (for example once the 20-year new build exemption ceases) the development must meet the requirements from: • 1 July 2023 for an existing development • as soon as the development is completed for a new development. For more information about the new build exemption, see page 40. Emergency, transitional and social housing If your property is used for the sole purpose of emergency, transitional or social housing, or housing for people in need, and is leased to a government department, for example to Te Tūāpapa Kura Kāinga - the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or Kāinga Ora, or a registered community housing provider, then you can still claim interest deductions. This exemption also covers connected or related services provided in the same building or in a different building on the same land. The whole property needs to be leased to the housing provider in order to qualify (for example, 1 bedroom in a 5 bedroom house would not qualify for this exemption). Note A full list of eligible government departments can be found in schedule 2, Part 1 of the Public Service Act 2020 available at www.legislation.govt.nz The Community Housing Regulatory Authority maintains a register of community housing providers registered under the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 at www.chra.hud.govt.nz Example Kris owns a house in the Bay of Plenty that is occasionally rented by a social housing provider when the provider requires emergency or transitional housing for its clients. The booking arrangement is on a casual basis and is dependent on the availability of the property, as the property can also be booked by members of the public for short-stay accommodation. During the 2022–23 tax year, the house is rented by the social housing provider for the provision of emergency or transitional housing from 16 June to 31 August, and again from 28 October to 17 November. For the remainder of the year, it is either rented by members of the public or not rented by anyone and vacant. For the 2022–23 tax year, Kris would qualify for the social housing exemption for interest incurred from 16 June to 31 August and from 28 October to 17 November. 37 ird.govt.nz Example Olivia owns a house in Christchurch and leases it to the Chan Community Housing Trust (CCH Trust), a registered community housing provider, for use as social housing. The lease is for a fixed period of three years starting from 1 July 2021. From 1 October 2021 until 7 June 2022, the CCH Trust rents the house as social housing to Jason. Jason moves out of the house on 7 June 2022. The house is temporarily vacant while the CCH Trust prepares it for another social housing tenant to move in. On 1 August 2022 the CCH Trust begins renting the house as social housing to Rosemary. Olivia’s Christchurch property would be exempt from the interest limitation rules while it is under lease to the CCH Trust. This would include the period it is vacant from 8 June 2022 to 31 July 2022. Council housing If your property is used by a local authority or a council-controlled organisation (CCO) for the sole purpose of providing housing to people assessed by a local authority as being eligible for housing at less than market rent, it is not subject to the interest limitation rules. The exemption still applies if connected or wraparound services are provided on site either in the same building or in a different building on the same land (for example, rehabilitation). The whole property needs to be leased to the local authority or CCO in order to qualify (for example, 1 bedroom in a 5 bedroom house would not qualify for this exemption). Interest incurred on a property is subject to interest limitation if the property is not used for council housing, for example, if the CCO provides rental housing at market rates. Note This exemption uses the definition of “council-controlled organisation” provided in section 6 of the Local Government Act 2002. How the rules work for different entities The interest limitation rules apply to:  • Individuals  • Look-through companies  • Partnerships  • Tr u s t s • Close companies • Certain non-close companies (see below for criteria). Close companies  If your company is a close company where 5 or fewer individuals or trustees own more than 50% of the company, you will usually have to apply the rules.  RENTAL INCOME 38 Certain non-close companies  The interest limitation rules apply to certain non-close companies. If your company is not a close company the interest limitation rules only apply if your company is a residential land company or a residential land wholly owned group member.  A company will be a “residential land company” for an income year if it is not a member of a wholly- owned group and the value of its residential property that is subject to interest limitation rules is equal to or is greater than 50% of the value of its total assets at any time during that income year. If the company owns shares in a company that is a residential land company, the value of those shares is treated as residential property for the purposes of the 50% threshold calculation. If your company is part of a wholly-owned group, this 50% test is applied on a consolidated basis at the group level. This means if your company is below the 50% threshold on its own, the interest limitation rules will still apply if it is part of a wholly-owned group and the group exceeds the 50% threshold. Example A Ltd’s total assets consist of the following: • Residential property with a value of $400,000. • Other business property with a value of $500,000. • 50% of the shares in B Ltd with a value of $300,000. To determine if A Ltd is a residential land company, it must first determine if B Ltd is a residential land company. This is because shares owned by non-close companies in residential land companies are treated like residential property for the purposes of this test. The percentage of B Ltd’s residential property of its total assets is 66.7% (being $400,000/$600,000). B Ltd is therefore a residential land company. A Ltd must therefore treat the value of its shares in B Ltd ($300,000) as residential property in applying the residential land company test itself. The value of A Ltd’s residential property as a percentage of its total assets is therefore 58.3% (($400,000 + $300,000)/$1,200,000). A Ltd is therefore also a residential land company Exempt Māori company  Interest limitation rules do not apply to an Exempt Māori company, even if it is a close company. An Exempt Māori company is a company that is not a residential land company or residential land wholly- owned group member and is one of the following:  • a Māori authority or eligible to be a Māori authority, or  • wholly-owned by a Māori authority or by a company or trust that is eligible to be a Māori authority.  For more details about Māori authorities, read our guide Becoming a Māori authority - IR487 or go to ird.govt.nz/maori-authorities For more information, read the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 34, No 5 (June 2022). 39 ird.govt.nz Exemptions from interest limitation rules If the interest limitation rules apply to your property, you may still be able to claim interest if you qualify for one of the following exemptions: • land business - land held as part of a developing, subdividing, or land-dealing business, or a business of erecting buildings on land • property development - land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build • new build land - a self-contained residence that receives a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) issued under the Building Act 2004 confirming the residence was added to the land on or after 27 March 2020. For interest to be deductible, it must not be private in nature and the general deductibility rule must be met. Exemption for property development The development exemption does not require you to have a ‘land business’ and applies to land that you develop, subdivide, or build on to create a new build. The development may be a one-off. The exemption applies from the time you start developing the land and ends when you sell the land, cease the development project or a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) is issued for your new build under the Building Act 2004. Once a CCC is issued for your new build, the new build exemption applies instead. Interest relating to remediation work done to an existing property that is not significant enough to create a new build does not qualify for this exemption. Example Romy has engaged in sufficient development activity on her land, creating a new self-contained residence. The development exemption applies to the land while Romy is completing the development and building of the new self-contained residence. Her interest is deductible if the general deduction criteria set out in existing tax rules is met. Once a CCC is issued, the development exemption will end, and Romy’s property will transition to the new build exemption. Exemption for new build land A new build is defined as a self-contained residence that receives a Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) confirming the residence was added to the land on or after 27 March 2020. It also includes a self-contained residence acquired off the plans that receives a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 confirming it has been added to the land. A place only qualifies as a new build if it is self-contained. This means the new build needs to contain its own cooking and bathroom facilities and have its own entrance. The entrance can be from a shared accessway – for example, a hallway shared by a block of flats in the same building. RENTAL INCOME 40 Example Kate owns residential land with an existing dwelling on it. She adds a sleepout to the property, which she intends to rent out, behind the existing dwelling. The sleepout can function as an extra bedroom, but it does not have its own kitchen and bathroom. Anyone staying in the sleepout would have to use the kitchen and bathroom located in the existing dwelling. Having no kitchen and bathroom means the sleepout is not self-contained and is therefore not considered a new build. The land attributable to the sleepout does not satisfy the definition of new build land. Example Assume the same facts as the above example. Six months later, Kate renovates the sleepout and adds a kitchen and bathroom. The building work receives its CCC on 3 March 2021. As the sleep-out is now self-contained, and it received its CCC after 27 March 2020, it qualifies as a new build. The land the new build is on, any land used exclusively by the residents of the new build, and a reasonable proportion of any shared areas, is considered new build land. The remainder of the land (attributable to the existing dwelling) is not considered new build land. A new build does not have to be made of new material or constructed onsite, so it can include modular and relocated homes. The following are new build examples. A self-contained dwelling: • added to bare land • added to land that has an existing dwelling on it, whether stand-alone or attached (apportionment will be required) • or multiple self-contained dwellings replacing an existing dwelling • converted from a commercial premises or from a hotel/motel • part of a building of dwellings converted from a single dwelling • previously on the earthquake prone buildings register that has been remediated • that has been at least 75% reclad because of weathertightness issues. 41 ird.govt.nz Example Haydn owns a large hotel complex in Rotorua comprising 100 separate units. Ever since the borders closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the reduced number of tourists has meant that many of his units have sat empty or have only been booked a fraction of the time they were previously. He has heard there is a shortage of long-term rental accommodation in the region, so he decides to convert his units into places that can be let as long-term rentals instead. The units were already configured for short-term stays by tourists, and included bathrooms but no kitchens. Haydn engages tradespeople to do some work to ensure the units are configured as self- contained residences by adding kitchens. The work Haydn has done to the property is not significant enough to require building consents, which means CCCs are not issued for the work. Haydn gets in touch with his local authority (which is also a building consent authority) and notifies them that he has converted all his hotel units into residential accommodation. This conversion is noted down as having been completed on 24 October 2021 in the authority’s records. The new build exemption applies to Haydn’s units for 20 years from 4 October 2021 until 23 October 2041. When does the new build exemption begin? The new build exemption generally starts from the date a CCC is issued for a new build. For new builds purchased off the plan, the exemption starts from the date you entered into an agreement to purchase it. For hotel and motel conversions, the new build exemption starts from the date the local authority or building consent authority records indicate the conversion was complete. When does the new build exemption expire? The exemption will expire 20 years after the date a new build receives its CCC (or after the date recorded by the local authority as evidence the conversion/remediation work was completed), or when the new build ceases to be on the land (for example, it is demolished or removed), whichever is earlier. Where a new build is acquired off the plans and before its CCC is issued, the 20-year fixed period will still run from the date of the CCC. Example Bagheera enters into an agreement to buy a new build from Neo-Archie Homes Ltd on 1 October 2021. The new build is still being constructed and does not receive a CCC until 24 October 2022. On 31 October 2022, title for Bagheera’s new build is registered to him. Bagheera qualifies for the new build exemption from 1 October 2021, because he has acquired a new build off the plans. He is able to deduct interest from that date, provided he satisfies the requirements to do so under existing tax rules. The new build exemption applies to the land until 23 October 2042, 20 years after the new build received its CCC. Special rules also apply for new builds that receive their CCC after a significant delay. The exemption applies to anyone who owns the new build within this 20-year fixed period, and the timing of the exemption does not reset when the property is sold. RENTAL INCOME 42 Apportionment required where land is only partially new build land If interest relates to land with both a new build and a non-new build, then only part of the land is considered new build land. In these circumstances, you need to apportion the interest between the new build land and the non-new build land. Only interest incurred in relation to the new build land qualifies for the exemption. Example This example illustrates how interest could be reasonably apportioned where it only partially relates to new build land. There may be other apportionment methods that, if applied in accordance with existing tax principles, could also be considered acceptable. Viv and Adrian acquire 1500m 2 of land in Kaitaia. The land has a 1970s standalone house (non-new build), as well as two new build townhouses. They take out a loan of $1m to acquire the land. All three buildings on the land are used as long-term rentals. The total land area of 1500m 2 is used as follows: • 400m 2 is used exclusively by the non-new build • 800m 2 is used exclusively by the new builds, and • 300m 2 is a shared outdoor area. After apportioning the shared outdoor area: • 500m 2 is not considered new build land. This is the 400m 2 used exclusively by the non-new build, plus one third of the shared outdoor areas (1/3 x 300m 2 = 100m 2 ). • 1000m 2 is considered new build land. This is the 800m 2 used exclusively by the new builds, and two thirds of the shared outdoor areas (2/3 x 300m 2 = 200m 2 ). It is reasonable for Viv and Adrian to deduct two thirds of the interest they incur in relation to the land, because two thirds of the total land area (1000m 2 of the total 1500m 2 ) is attributable to the new builds. One third of the interest they incur is not deductible, because it is attributable to the non-new build portion of the land. Loans that cannot be reasonably traced The interest limitation rules do not apply to borrowings for non-residential property purposes. For example, if you borrow against a residential property to buy a truck for a transport business, your interest deductions are not affected. If you have a loan drawn down before 27 March 2021 and used that loan for residential property and non- residential property purposes, you need to trace the loan and determine how much of the loan was used for residential property. Interest incurred on the portion of the loan used for residential property will be subject to phasing (that is, denial on a progressive basis between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025). The deductibility of the interest incurred on the non-residential property portion of the loan is determined under the general deductibility rules. If it cannot reasonably be determined how much of the loan was used for residential property and how much was used for non-residential property purposes (an “untraceable loan”), a special transition rule applies (which ends on 31 March 2025). Whether a loan cannot in fact reasonably be traced is objectively determined and is dependent on question of fact and degree in each case. 43 ird.govt.nz The transitional rule treats an untraceable loan as being used to acquire other income generating property before being used to acquire residential property that is subject to the interest limitation rules. Other income generating property includes residential property that is not subject to the interest limitation rules because an exemption from the rules applies to the property. For more information about exemptions, see page 40. Under the rule, if the balance of an untraceable loan on 26 March 2021 is less than the value of other income generating property held on 26 March 2021, none of the interest on the loan is subject to limitation under the interest limitation rules. If the balance of the untraceable loan (on 26 March 2021) exceeds the value of other income generating property held on 26 March 2021, the excess is treated as having been used to acquire the residential property subject to the interest limitation rules. The interest incurred is denied on a progressive basis between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. There is also a rule that specifies how repayments of an untraceable loan are to be treated. Generally, repayments are applied to the residential property which is subject to the interest limitation rules first, unless the repayment is funded from the disposal of other income generating property held on 26 March 2021. Loans in foreign currency, refinanced loans and variable balance loans Special rules apply for loans in a foreign currency, refinanced loans and for interest on variable balance loans (such as revolving credit and overdraft facilities). Loans in a foreign currency If your rental property is financed by a loan in foreign currency, any interest is non-deductible from 1 October 2021. However, if you refinance the loan with a New Zealand dollar loan, the new loan will qualify for phasing out for the period from when the New Zealand dollar loan is drawn down. Refinance Refinancing up to the level of the original loan will not affect the deductibility of your interest. If the original loan qualified for phasing out, then the treatment remains the same. Note If you have used the money in your home loan account or you have topped up your home loan for another purpose not related to your residential rental property, the interest is not deductible, and you don’t claim it in your income tax return. Variable balance loans If you have a variable balance loan (for example, a revolving credit facility or an overdraft) for your residential rental property, you need to trace each individual withdrawal and deposit to that loan account to work out the amount of deductible interest. The calculation may be time consuming. To simplify the calculation, you may use the “high water mark” method to work out how much interest is deductible. The high water mark method is designed to simplify the calculation of deductible interest for variable balance loans. If your loan is solely used to finance your residential rental property, then any interest incurred will be deductible (subject to phasing) if the loan balance remains at or below the loan balance as at 26 March 2021. RENTAL INCOME 44 However, if the loan is used to finance a mixture of taxable and private activities, then you can calculate the amount of interest based on the lower of: • the affected loan balance – this is the amount of the actual loan balance at any particular time that applies to the residential rental property (for example, exclude funds used to finance private expenditure) • the initial loan balance – this is the loan balance on 26 March 2021. If the affected loan balance is lower than the initial loan balance, all interest incurred will be deductible after applying the phasing percentage for the year. If the affected loan balance is higher than the initial loan balance, only the interest incurred up to the initial loan balance is deductible after applying the phasing percentage for the year. The amount of interest incurred above the initial loan balance is not deductible after 1 October 2021. Completing your income tax return When completing your income tax return you will need to consider how the interest limitation rules apply to your property and calculate the total interest on residential property and the amount of interest that can be claimed. Total interest on residential property is the total interest incurred on your borrowings on all your residential properties for the year. We also encourage you to keep a record of the interest incurred for each of your rental properties because you may be able to claim this amount when the property is sold if the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule. For more information – see the next section What happens to denied interest deductions when I sell? Interest expense claimed is the total interest you can claim on your borrowings on all your residential properties under the interest limitations rules. If you claim interest, you will also be asked to provide the reason(s) why you are claiming that interest. To assist with your calculation of interest expense claimed please refer to the calculators on our website ird.govt.nz/tools-calculators or refer to examples below for guidance. 45 ird.govt.nz Example Joe took out an interest-only loan to acquire a residential rental property in 2017. As at 26 March 2021, the balance of Joe’s loan is $500,000 and the interest rate is 4.0% pa. Joe does not make any principal repayments on the loan. As the loan was drawn down before 27 March 2021, Joe can calculate the deductible interest as follows: • From 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021, Joe incurs interest expenditure of $10,000, which is fully deductible. From 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022, Joe incurs interest expenditure of $10,000, but only 75% of this ($7,500) is deductible. When completing his 2022 income tax return, Joe will enter $20,000 into the ‘Total interest on residential property box’ and $17,500 in the ‘Interest expense claimed’ box. • From 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023, Joe incurs interest expenditure of $20,000, but 75% of this ($15,000) is deductible. When completing his 2023 income tax return, Joe will enter $20,000 into ‘Total interest on residential property’ box and $15,000 in the ‘Interest expense claimed’ box. • From 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, Joe incurs interest expenditure of $20,000, but 50% of this ($10,000) is deductible. When completing his 2024 income tax return, Joe will enter $20,000 into ‘Total interest on residential property’ box and $10,000 in the ‘Interest expense claimed’ box. • From 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025, Joe incurs interest expenditure of $20,000, but 25% of this ($5,000) is deductible. When completing his 2025 income tax return, Joe will enter $20,000 into ‘total interest on residential property’ box and $5,000 in the ‘Interest expense claimed’ box. For each of the years, Joe selects ‘Loan drawn down prior to 27 March 2021’ as the reason for claiming interest. • From 1 April 2025 onwards, Joe is not allowed to claim deductions for interest under his loan. What happens to denied interest deductions when I sell? If you sell/dispose of a residential property and the sale is taxable under the bright-line property rule, the amount of the previously denied interest under the interest limitation rules is treated as if it were part of the cost of the property in the year of disposal. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss is limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. Under that rule, the loss can only be deducted against other taxable land sale gains. Any excess loss must be carried forward and deducted against other land sale gains in later income years. If the disposal is not taxable, you cannot claim the interest previously denied under the interest limitation rules. For more detail about what happens to interest previously denied under the interest limitation rules on disposal, read the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 34, No 5 (June 2022). Interposed entity rules Interest deductions are denied for a person who indirectly holds residential rental property through an Interposed residential property holder (IRP holder). This does not apply to look-through companies or to partnerships. RENTAL INCOME 46 An IRP holder for a person may be one of three types of residential property holders: • a close company for which the person has voting interests or market value interests and the company has, at the end of each quarter in the income year, a residential property percentage of more than 10%. • a company that is not a close company for which the person has voting interests or market value interests and the company has, at any time during the income year, a residential property percentage of more than 50%. • trustees of a trust of which the person is a direct or indirect beneficiary, and the relevant trust has, at any time during the income year, a residential property percentage of more than 10%. The residential property percentage is the value of the entity’s residential rental property as a percentage of the value of the entity’s total assets. For this calculation, residential rental property excludes: • property covered by the land business, development and new build exemptions • property used for social, emergency, transitional and council housing. If a close company is an IRP holder for a person, the interest incurred by the person is limited in proportion to the close company’s residential property percentage. If a company other than a close company is an IRP holder for a person, all interest incurred by the person for legal or beneficial ownership of the company is denied. If a trust is an IRP holder for a person, all interest incurred by the person for legal or beneficial ownership of the trust is denied. Talk to a tax agent if you think the interposed entity rules may apply to you. For more information, read the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 34, No 5 (June 2022). Changes in how property is held Rollover relief allows you to change the legal ownership of property after 27 March 2021 while allowing you to deduct a portion of your interest expense during the interest phase-out period. This applies to the following: • relationship property settlements • transfers as part of a company amalgamation that qualifies as a resident's restricted amalgamation • transfers following the death of the owner, to an executor or administrator of an estate or to a beneficiary of the estate • some transfers to or from look-through companies and partnerships • some transfers to or from family trusts. Specific relief also applies for certain transfers of land subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. 47 ird.govt.nz Relationship property settlements Example Dale and Dawn, a married couple, decide to separate in April 2022. As part of the relationship property settlement, they agree that Dale will keep the family home and Dawn will keep the investment property they acquired back in 2003, shortly after they got married. Dawn decides to retain the property as an investment rather than move into it herself. There is an existing mortgage over the property that has an outstanding loan balance of $20,000. Dawn has agreed to take this over. Since the loan was drawn down before 27 March 2021, the interest on the loan will be deductible subject to phasing. Dale and Dawn are entitled to deduct 75% of the amount of interest they each incurred for the property over the period from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022. Rollover relief also applies to the transfer of Dale’s share of the property to Dawn in April 2022, so Dawn is entitled to deduct a reducing amount of interest on the loan of $20,000 over the remaining period to 31 March 2025. Inherited property Example Pat purchased a house as a private residence for himself in 2010 and borrowed $200,000 at that time to finance the purchase. In his will, Pat has provided that all his property should be inherited by his son Robin when he dies. At the time of Pat’s death in July 2021, $40,000 is still owing on the loan. This loan was drawn before 27 March 2021 and therefore the interest is deductible subject to phasing. Robin would like to keep Pat’s house and use it as a rental property to supplement his income, so he agrees with the executors of Pat’s estate that he will obtain a loan from another bank to repay the loan outstanding to Pat’s bank. Robin borrows $90,000 – of which $40,000 is used to repay Pat’s bank and the remaining $50,000 is used to fund renovations before Robin finds tenants. Rollover relief applies to the transfer of the property to Robin, but only on the $40,000 required to repay Pat’s bank, as only this amount was drawn before 27 March 2021. Robin is entitled to deduct a reducing amount of interest for the $40,000 over the transition period (1 October 2021 to 31 March 2025). Transfers to or from look-through companies (LTCs) and partnerships Rollover relief also applies to transfers to or from LTCs and partnerships to the extent a person transferring the residential property to the LTC or partnership (or acquiring it from the LTC or partnership) has the same ownership interest before and after the transfer. RENTAL INCOME 48 Example Mary and Bob, a married couple, are the shareholders in a look-through company, Company A. Mary and Bob jointly own an investment property in equal shares (50:50). They each hold 50 percent of the shares in Company A. Mary and Bob had drawn down a loan in 2018 to purchase the property. In September 2021, the loan has an outstanding balance of $100,000. In September 2021, Mary and Bob sell the property to Company A. Company A borrows $150,000 from the bank for the purchase of the property and uses its equity to fund the remainder of the purchase price. Partial rollover relief applies to the transfer of the property, meaning that Company A can deduct the interest on a loan balance of $100,000 (being the amount of Mary and Bob's original loan balance on the date of the transfer) subject to phasing until 31 March 2025. Company A’s excess loan balance of $50,000 does not qualify for rollover relief. Transfers to or from family trusts Rollover relief applies for transfers of residential property to or from family trusts, provided that: • each transferor (in the case of transfers to a trust) or each recipient (in the case of transfers from a trust) of the residential property is a beneficiary of the trust • all principal settlors are beneficiaries of the trust, and • each beneficiary is either a principal settlor, has a family connection with a principal settlor, or is a company controlled by a family member beneficiary or is a charity. In addition, when the trustees of a family trust transfer the property back to the settlors who originally transferred the property to the trust, each recipient's proportionate interest in the property must be the same as what was held before the property was transferred to the trust. Rollover relief may apply to a transfer from the trustees of a qualifying family trust to the settlors, even if the settlors did not previously transfer the property to the trust, but the trustees instead acquired the property from a third party. In this instance, all the settlors receiving the property from the trustees have to have been principal settlors of the trust both at the time the trustees acquired the property and when the trustees transferred the property to them for rollover relief to apply. Example Neo acquired a rental property and drew down a loan of $500,000 for the property on 3 March 2017. On 29 October 2022, Neo sells the property to his family trust. He and his son, Archie, are beneficiaries of the trust. The outstanding balance of Neo’s loan is $400,000. The trustee takes out a loan of $450,000 to purchase the property from Neo. Neo uses $400,000 of the sale proceeds to repay the outstanding balance of his loan. The transfer of the property to the trust qualifies for partial rollover relief and therefore enables the trustee to deduct limited interest deductions until 31 March 2025. However, only interest on $400,000 of the trustee’s loan is deductible (being the amount of Neo's loan balance on the date of the transfer). Interest on the additional $50,000 borrowed does not qualify for rollover relief and is not deductible. 49 ird.govt.nz Example Maude acquired an investment property in 2017 using a combination of savings and a loan from the bank. In April 2021, Maude sold the property to her family trust, the beneficiaries of which are her and her adult children, Fran and Josiah. At the time of sale, the outstanding balance on Maude’s loan is $150,000. To finance the purchase of the property, the trustees of the trust borrow $150,000 from the bank. Rollover relief applies to the transfer of the property. This means the trustees can deduct the interest on a loan balance of $150,000 subject to phasing until 31 March 2025. If certain criteria are met, rollover relief also applies when residential property held in a qualifying family trust is resettled onto another family trust. Rollover relief does not apply when you transfer shares in an LTC to a trust. Transfers to a Māori authority or Māori family trust Rollover relief is available for a transfer of residential property to a Māori authority, or person eligible to be a Māori authority, as the trustee of a trust if: • the residential property is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 • each transferor is both a settlor and beneficiary of the trust, and • the transferors of the residential property and the beneficiaries of the trust are all either: - members of the same iwi or hapū, or - the descendants of the same tipuna (living or dead). In addition, when the trustees of a trust transfer property that is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 back to the persons who originally transferred the property to the trust, each recipient’s proportionate interest in the property must be the same as what was held before the property was transferred to the trust. RENTAL INCOME 50 Part 4 – Residential property deduction rules Overview of the rules In some situations, you may have more expenses for a residential rental property in an income year than the rental income you earn. This is sometimes described as a “rental loss”. In previous years, rental losses could be used to reduce your overall taxable income. From the start of the 2019-20 income year, this is no longer the case. Now, you can generally only deduct expenses for residential rental property up to the amount of income you earn from the property for the year. Any deductions that exceed your income from the property, called excess deductions, must be carried forward to the next income year you earn income from the property (or from another residential property). This means that rental property losses cannot be used to reduce your tax liability for other income, such as salary and wages or business income. These rules are the residential property deduction rules, also known as the ring-fencing rules. The rules apply whether you hold the property yourself, or in a partnership, look-through company, or close company. They also apply to trustees of a trust who earn taxable income from a residential rental property. The rules may also apply to limit interest deductions if you have borrowed money to invest in an entity and more than 50% of the entity's assets are residential land. Please read Investment in an entity with significant holdings in residential land - interposed entity rules on page 60. Property the rules apply to The residential property deduction rules apply to most residential land in New Zealand and overseas – the exceptions are listed in the next section. Residential land includes a rental property with an existing dwelling, land that is to have a dwelling built on it and bare land that may have a dwelling built on it under the relevant district plan. From the 2021-22 income year the definition of residential land has been amended to ensure the residential property deduction rules apply to property used for short-stay accommodation and the dwelling is not the owner’s main home, even if it's a business premises (for example, Airbnb). Income and deductions for residential land are reported in a section of the income tax return separate from other kinds of rental income. Property the rules do not apply to The residential property deduction rules do not apply to: • your main home - if you have more than 1 home, this is the home you have the greatest connection with • your holiday home, if it is used privately, used to earn income, and it is unused for at least 62 days in the year. See Part 5 for more information about the mixed-use asset rules • farmland • land that is used mainly as a business premises. From the 2021-22 income year, the definition of residential land has been amended to ensure that the provision of short-stay accommodation in a dwelling that is not the owner’s main home is subject to the residential property deduction rules, even if it's a business premises. 51 ird.govt.nz Rents for these kinds of properties must be reported in the Other rents field in the IR3 income tax return. Residential land may also be excluded if it is land that will be taxed on sale regardless of when it’s sold. This is called revenue account land. For this land to be excluded from the rules you must notify us that it is revenue account land. You must also be able to separately identify the deductions for that land, unless all your residential land is subject to tax on sale. There is no need to notify us of land that will be taxed because it was acquired for a land-related business. For more information about revenue account land and how to notify us, go to Residential rental property on revenue account on page 59. How do I calculate my net residential income? You must calculate your residential income and the total deductions you can claim for the year for a residential portfolio or individual residential property. For an explanation of the portfolio basis and individual property basis, see Applying the rules on the portfolio basis or the individual property basis on page 54. You can generally claim allowable deductions up to the amount of residential income you earned in the income year. If you have more deductions than income for a residential portfolio or individual property, then you will have excess deductions. Working out what to show on your income tax return You can use our Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 to calculate: • the amount of deductions you can claim for the year against your income from a residential portfolio or individual property • your net residential rental income for a residential portfolio or individual property • the amount of any excess deductions for a residential portfolio or individual property that you must carry forward to a future income year. These amounts are calculated for each residential portfolio and individual property you own and are then added together and included in your income tax return. In your income tax return, you will need to show the following income from a residential portfolio and/ or individual property: • gross residential rental income • net bright-line profit (excluding losses) • other residential income. Other residential income includes the total from the following amounts: • income in relation to a loan denominated in a foreign currency from a portfolio and/or individual property • all depreciation recovery income from assets disposed of from a portfolio and/or individual property • the net income from the taxable disposal of a residential property outside the residential property deduction rules because it is held on revenue account. For more information about revenue account land, go to Residential rental property on revenue account on page 59. RENTAL INCOME 52 These amounts are added together to calculate your 'Total combined residential income'. To calculate your total deductions for a residential portfolio or individual property for an income year, add together all of the following amounts: • deductible expenses for the individual property or the portfolio (as applicable), for the current income year • any excess deductions brought forward for the portfolio or individual property (as applicable) from previous years • any excess deductions left over after the sale of another residential property or the last property in a residential portfolio. What do I do if I have excess deductions? You will need to calculate the amount of excess deductions you have (if any) for each residential portfolio and each individual property you own. If your deductions exceed your residential income for an individual property or residential portfolio in a year, the excess deductions cannot be used to offset income in that year. The excess deductions will instead be carried forward to the next year you derive residential income, and are added to your deductions for the individual property or residential portfolio in that year. It is important to remember that, provided there has not been a sale of property, excess deductions can only be used against income from the same individual property or residential portfolio the excess deductions relate to. This means excess deductions from a property in a portfolio can offset any income from the portfolio, but cannot be used to offset income from any other residential property. Excess deductions from an individual property can only be offset against income from that same property. If you have sold an individual property or the last property in a residential portfolio and you have unused excess deductions remaining, there are different rules depending on whether the sales were taxable or not. If the sales were non-taxable, the excess deductions are transferred to another residential property that you own. If you do not own any other residential property, the unused excess deductions are carried forward until you do. For more information see Transferred excess deductions at page 58. If the sales are taxable, the excess deductions may be released. Released excess deductions can be used to offset any other residential rental income and other income such as salary and wages and business income. However, the amount released will be reduced by the amount of all unused excess deductions transferred to the property from non-taxable sales. For more information on released excess deductions see What happens when I sell a residential rental property at page 55. Once you have calculated your excess deductions for each residential portfolio and individual property, you enter the total amount of excess deductions from all your residential properties into the Excess residential deductions carried forward field on your income tax return. 53 ird.govt.nz Note If you complete your return in myIR, the amount that you enter in your return in the Excess residential rental deductions carried forward box will be pre-populated on your return for the next income year in the Excess residential rental deductions brought forward box. Note You will need to keep track of the amount of excess deductions carried forward for each individual property and portfolio each year. This is because the amount you show in your return in each box is the total for all your individual properties and portfolio. Note The shareholder continuity rules apply to close companies that have excess deductions. When there has been a change of shareholding, a close company’s excess deductions cannot be used in a later income year if the rules that restrict the carrying forward of a company’s loss balance apply. This guide does not cover the continuity rules for companies. Talk to your tax agent if you think that these rules apply. Applying the rules on the portfolio basis or the individual property basis You can calculate your net residential rental income and excess deductions using one of 2 methods, or a combination of both. These methods are: • the portfolio basis • the individual property basis (also called the property-by-property basis), or • a combination of the portfolio basis and the individual property basis. Portfolio basis Under the portfolio basis you calculate your income and deductions across a residential portfolio. A portfolio includes all residential properties in your portfolio from the beginning of the income year you first had the residential portfolio until the end of the income year you dispose of the last property included in the portfolio. This means that properties in a portfolio can change from year to year as they are bought and sold. Individual property basis For the individual property basis, you apply the rules to a single property separately. This means that the deductions for an individual property can be offset only against the income from that property. You can have more than 1 individual basis property, but you must do the calculations for each property separately. Your net income from each property gets combined in your tax return, as well as the excess deductions for each property. If you have expenses that relate to more than 1 property, such as interest on a loan used for 2 properties, the individual property basis cannot be used. RENTAL INCOME 54 You must choose to use the individual property basis from the first year the rules apply to the property. This could be when you buy the property, start renting out the property, or the start of the 2019-20 income year when the rules came in. You can decide at any time to move to the portfolio basis, but once you start using the portfolio basis you must continue to use this method. Example Aroha owns two residential rental properties. For the 2019-20 income year, property A has income of $15,000 and deductible expenses of $2,000. Property B has income of $12,000 and deductible expenses of $15,000. In Aroha’s 2019-20 income tax return, she calculates her net residential rental income and excess deductions on an individual property basis for both properties. As a result, property A has net residential rental income of $13,000 and no excess deductions to carry forward. Property B has net residential income of $0 and excess deductions of $3,000 to carry forward. Example In the 2019-20 income year, Aroha had 2 properties that she accounted for income and deductions on an individual property basis - property A and property B. In the following year, Aroha buys a third residential rental property, property C. Aroha decides that the new property will form a portfolio with property A. Aroha completes her 2020-21 return on the basis that she has 1 property on an individual property basis, property B, and a portfolio consisting of 2 residential rental properties, property A and property C. Aroha cannot go back to applying the individual property basis to property A. Combination of portfolio basis and individual property basis This guide and the Residential property deductions worksheets - IR1226 are aimed at people who own 1 or 2 rental properties, and who are not in the business of providing residential rental accommodation. However, if you have 2 or more residential properties, you may use a combination of the portfolio basis and the individual property basis. This means that some properties can be held on the portfolio basis and some can be held on the individual basis. In any case, it is important to calculate your deductions for each residential portfolio and individual property that you own. In your income tax return, you will show totals for all your residential properties. If you are unsure about which option is right for you, we suggest you talk to your tax agent. What happens when I sell a residential rental property? You may still have unused excess deductions for a residential rental property after it is sold. In some circumstances these excess deductions may be released. This means they can be used against your other income, such as your salary and wages. 55 ird.govt.nz Sale of an individual property basis property If you sell a property treated on an individual property basis and the sale is not taxable, any unused excess deductions must be transferred, or carried forward until they can be transferred to another residential portfolio or individual property that has earned residential income. If you have another individual property or residential portfolio you can transfer the unused excess deductions from the property that was sold to the other individual property or residential portfolio in the current year. You can offset the transferred excess deductions against residential income of the other property. You need to track the transferred deductions until they are used to offset income as they can never be released. If you do not have other residential rental properties, the unused excess deductions must be carried forward to the next income year you earn residential income from another individual property or portfolio. At this point the unused excess deductions would be treated as transferred to that individual property or portfolio see Transferred excess deductions on page 58. If the sale of the individual property was taxable, any unused excess deductions for the property will be released. However, if the excess deductions included an amount transferred from another property the amount released must be reduced by an amount equal to the total unused excess deductions transferred. The excess deductions released can be used to offset any income you have from any source in the year of the sale. The excess deductions released can also be carried forward to future years as part of a tax loss if you have a net loss for the tax year. Example Nikita has 3 residential rental properties – property A and property B are in a portfolio, and Nikita used the individual property basis for property C. Nikita also has salary income of $70,000. Property C has accumulated excess deductions of $80,000. Nikita decides to sell property C. The sale is taxed and has a net gain of $60,000. Nikita uses $60,000 of the excess deductions against the net sale income from Property C. Because Nikita has applied the residential property deduction rules on a property-by-property basis for this property, the remaining excess deductions of $20,000 are released and used against Nikita’s salary income. Sale of one property in a portfolio If you have taxable income from the sale of a property that is part of a residential portfolio, and there are other properties still in the portfolio, include the net income from the sale in your residential income for the portfolio for the year. You need to keep track of whether the sale of each property in your portfolio was taxable or not so that when you dispose of the last property in your portfolio, you can correctly deal with any remaining excess deductions. For more information about what happens when you dispose of the last property in a portfolio, go to the Sale of all properties in a portfolio section. RENTAL INCOME 56 Example In the 2019-20 income year, Minerva owns 2 residential rental properties and applies the residential property deduction rules on the portfolio basis. In the 2020-21 income year, Minerva sells 1 of her properties. The sale is taxable, and Minerva earns net income of $20,000 from the sale. This amount is added to the rental income of $30,000, giving a total income of $50,000 for the portfolio. Deductions for the portfolio amounted to $35,000. In her tax return, Minerva can use all the deductions for the portfolio in that year because the deductions of $35,000 are less than the total income of $50,000. Minerva will have net residential income of $15,000. If the sale of the property was not taxable, then the residential income of the portfolio would be $30,000. In this situation, because the deductions of $35,000 are more than the income of $30,000, Minerva cannot use all of the deductions for the income year. Minerva would show in her tax return net income of $0 for the portfolio and excess deductions to carry forward of $5,000. Sale of all properties in a portfolio If you sell all the properties, or the last property, in your residential portfolio in an income year, you may still have unused excess deductions. If the sale of each of the properties in the portfolio was taxable, any unused deductions would be released. This means they can be used to offset any income you have from any sources in the year of the sale, or be carried forward to future years as a regular loss if required. However if the excess deductions included an amount transferred from another property the amount released is reduced by an amount equal to the total unused excess deductions transferred. For more information, go to Transferred excess deductions on page 58. If any of the properties in the portfolio in any income year were not taxed on sale, any unused excess deductions for the portfolio must be transferred, or carried forward until they can be transferred, to another residential portfolio or individual property that has earned residential income. If you have another individual property or residential portfolio you can transfer the unused excess deductions from the property that was sold to the other individual property or residential portfolio in the current year. You can offset the transferred excess deductions against residential income of the other property. You need to track the transferred deductions until they are used to offset income as they can never be released. If you do not have other residential rental properties, the unused excess deductions must be carried forward to the next income year you earn residential income from another residential portfolio or individual property. At this point the unused excess deductions would be treated as transferred to that individual property or portfolio, see Transferred excess deductions on page 58. 57 ird.govt.nz Example Jairus owns a portfolio of 2 residential properties. He has not previously owned other residential properties. In the 2019-20 income year, Jairus sells both of his properties for a total net taxable gain of $10,000. He also has gross rental income of $20,000 from the properties in that year, rental deductions for the properties of $35,000, and a salary of $70,000. The taxable sale and rental income gives Jairus a total of $30,000 residential income from the portfolio for the year. He can use $30,000 of the rental deductions against his residential income. Because the sale of both properties in the portfolio were taxed, the remaining $5,000 of rental deductions are released and can be used against his salary income. If only 1 of the properties was taxed on sale, any excess deductions must continue to be carried forward and used against any residential income Jairus has from another residential property or portfolio in the future. Transferred excess deductions You may have unused excess deductions remaining after the non-taxable sale of an individual property or residential portfolio. In this situation, the unused excess deductions must be transferred to another residential rental property. The transfer can be made in the year of sale to another residential portfolio or individual property that you have earned residential income from. Otherwise, the unused excess deductions are carried forward to the next income year that you earn residential income and then they are transferred. Once transferred, the excess deductions continue to be subject to the residential property deduction rules and they become part of the total deductions of the property they were transferred to. When an individual property is sold, and the sale is taxable, excess deductions are released. When the last property in a residential portfolio is sold, and each sale in the portfolio was taxable, any excess deductions remaining are released. Once released, these excess deductions can be used to offset income from other sources, such as salary and wages or business income. However, transferred excess deductions can never be released from the residential property deduction rules. They can only be offset against residential income. In this situation, the amount of any excess deductions transferred to the property is subtracted from the amount of excess deductions that would otherwise be released. RENTAL INCOME 58 Example George owns a residential rental property A. In the 2019-20 income year George sells property A and the sale was not taxable. After the sale, George has remaining unused excess deductions of $2,000. 2 years later, George acquires another residential rental property, property B, and earns rental income from it. The unused excess deductions from property A transfer to property B. In the 2023-24 income year, George sells property B. The sale is taxable under the bright-line rules and George makes a loss on the sale. George has excess deductions of $5,000 for property B, including the $2,000 of deductions transferred from property A. Because the sale of property B was taxable, some of the excess deductions can be released from the rules. The released amount is the total remaining excess deductions of $5,000 less the transferred deductions of $2,000 from property A. This means that $3,000 of deductions are released and can be used against any other income George has. The excess deductions of $2,000 transferred from Property A must be carried forward to the next year George earns income from a residential property. Residential rental property on revenue account The residential property deduction rules may not apply to residential land that is taxable on sale regardless of when it is sold. This is called revenue account land. For this land to be excluded from the rules, you must let us know it is revenue account land. You need to do this by the due date for filing your income tax return for the year it becomes known that the land will be taxed on sale, or the 2019-20 income year if you held it on revenue account then. You must also keep the deductions relating to the land separate, unless all your residential land is subject to tax on sale. If you do not let us know the land is revenue account land, you’ll need to apply the rules to it. If the land is taxed on sale because it is held by a person in the business of dealing, development, subdivision, or building business you do not need to let us know for the exclusion to apply. If you have net income from revenue account land that is excluded from the rules, you can include it in the calculation of residential income that income to offset residential rental deductions from a residential portfolio or individual basis property. You can include net income from revenue account land in the residential income of a portfolio or an individual basis property. You can also spread the income across more than 1 property or portfolio, but you cannot use any of the income more than once. Net income from residential land that is revenue account land is included as residential income in your income tax return. However, net losses for this type of property should be included as Other rents or Income from taxable property sales/disposals. To notify us of land that is revenue account land and excluded from the rules, you will need to provide us with the address of the property and its land title number or certificate of title number. The certificate of title number for your property can be found through your local council or at homes.co.nz We will also need confirmation that you can separately identify any deductions relating to the revenue account property. You can notify us by phone, or secure mail in myIR. 59 ird.govt.nz Investment in an entity with significant holdings in residential land – the interposed entity rules There are special rules that may apply if you have borrowed money to buy a share or interest in an entity like a close company, partnership, or look-through company, and the entity holds significant interests in residential land. These rules are called the interposed entity rules. The interposed entity rules may apply if more than 50% of the entity’s assets by value are residential land. In this situation, the amount of the interest expense you can claim as a deduction may be limited. The amount of the interest that can be deducted in the year is calculated as the lesser of: • the deductible interest under the interest limitation rules multiplied by the percentage of the entity’s capital used to acquire residential rental property, or • your share of the entity’s calculated net residential income. Any excess amounts of interest expenditure are carried forward to later income years. If you think the interposed entity rules apply to you, you may want to talk to a tax agent. Read the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol 31, No 8 (September 2019) for more information. RENTAL INCOME 60 Part 5 - Holiday homes Mixed-use asset rule There are special deduction rules for mixed use assets, including holiday homes. These rules came into effect from the beginning of the 2013-14 tax year. The rules determine the deductibility and apportionment of expenditure when certain assets are used partly to earn income and partly for private purposes. They apply to natural persons and to close companies and apply differently depending on whether a mixed-use asset is owned by a natural person or a close company. The description of the rules below is for when a holiday home is owned by a natural person(s). If, during the tax year, your holiday home is used both for private use and income-earning use, and it's unused for 62 days or more, then you have a mixed-use holiday home. If your holiday home is used privately and for income-earning but is not vacant for 62 days or more, the standard tax rules apply. For more information about how the standard tax rules apply to holiday homes, go to Standard tax rules on page 64. The rules do not apply if your property is a residential property used for long-term rental. If you own a mixed-use holiday home, you will generally need to pay tax on the income you earn from letting it and apportion some of your expense claims. Note If you buy or sell your property part-way through the tax year, you'll need to reduce the 62 days figure to reflect your period of ownership. Example You buy your property on 1 October. Your period of ownership from 1 October to 31 March is 182 days. The 62 days figure is reduced as follows: 182 × 62 = 30.91 days 365 Private use Private use of your holiday home means use by: • you or your family, even if 100% market rent is paid. • non-associated people if they pay rent at less than 80% of market rates. To help you work out if someone is associated to you, use our guide Associated persons definitions for income tax purposes - IR620. Income-earning use Income-earning use of your holiday home means use by a non-associated person from which you earn rent at 80% or more of market rates. 61 ird.govt.nz Interest limitation rules and mixed-use asset rules When interest is incurred for a holiday home, the interest limitation rules apply to that interest, unless an exclusion or exemption applies. Paying tax on your rent You must pay income tax on rent earned from income-earning use. Any rent from private use is exempt from income tax. Deducting your expenses Expenses from mixed-use holiday homes fall into 3 categories: 1. Fully deductible You can claim 100% of any expense relating solely to the income-earning use of the holiday home (subject to any limitations or exceptions outside of mixed-use asset rules, such as interest limitation rules). Examples: Costs of advertising for tenants, costs of repairing damage caused by tenants. 2. Not deductible You cannot claim any expenses relating to the private use of the holiday home. Example: Costs of a boat and quad bike stored in a locked garage unavailable to the non-associated people renting the holiday home. 3. Apportioned If an expense relates to both income-earning use and private use, you need to apportion it using this formula: Expense × income-earning days income-earning days + private-use days The amount resulting from the formula is allowed as a deduction subject to any limitations, such as the interest limitation rules. Expenses might include interest, rates, insurance, repairs for general wear and tear, depreciation on chattels. When the expense is interest, the amount resulting from the formula will be subject to the interest limitation rules, unless an exclusion or exemption applies. Note If you're registered for GST, you'll need to make adjustments in your GST return. Read our GST guide - IR375 for details. Opting out If your income from income-earning use is less than $4,000 for the year, you can choose to keep the holiday home outside the tax system. That means your rental activity does not need to be included in your income tax return. You do not return any income or claim any expenses for your holiday home. RENTAL INCOME 62 You can also choose to keep your rental activity outside the tax system if you have an amount of quarantined expenditure for the year. These opting out exemptions do not apply to holiday homes owned by companies. Quarantining expenditure (mixed-use asset) If you make a loss from your mixed-use asset, you may not be able to claim the loss straightaway. Instead, you may have to quarantine the excess expenditure and carry it forward to a future tax year to offset against future profits from the asset. This rule applies if your gross income from income-earning use of the asset is less than 2% of the value of the asset. The cost or value of the asset is the most recent of the: • purchase price or market value if purchased from an associated person, or • the local authority capital or annual value (rateable value). Example 1 David has a city apartment with a rateable value of $300,000. He rents out the apartment and also uses it privately. He receives market rate rental of $4,000 from non-associates, and $6,000 from associates. His total allowable expenditure, after applying the apportionment rules is $15,000. Since David's income from non-associates is less than 2% of the apartment's rateable value, the excess expenditure of $11,000 cannot be claimed as a deduction. The quarantined expenditure can be offset against profits in subsequent income years. Example 2 In the next income year, David makes $10,000 from renting his city apartment at market rates to non-associates. His total allowable expenditure after applying the apportionment rules is $8,000. As calculated above, he also has expenditure of $11,000 quarantined from the previous income year. David can deduct $2,000 of that quarantined expenditure to reduce his profit to zero. The $9,000 left continues to be quarantined and can be used as a deduction in a later income year. There are restrictions around the use of the quarantined deductions in later years. The profit: • must be from the use of the same asset • must come from the asset being used as a mixed-use asset. There is one exception to the same asset rule - if the asset for which the loss arose is damaged, destroyed, or lost and is no longer held by the person, and the replacement asset is identical or substantially the same as the original mixed-use asset, the loss from the first asset can be offset against subsequent profits from the second asset. You can find more information about mixed-use holiday homes at ird.govt.nz/mixed-use 63 ird.govt.nz Standard tax rules If your holiday home is used privately and for income-earning but is not vacant for 62 days or more, the mixed-use asset rules will not apply. The standard tax rules for what counts as income and how expenses should be apportioned apply. Paying tax on your rent You must pay income tax on rent earned from income-earning use. Under the standard rules, the amounts you receive from paying guests will generally be income. This includes mates’ rates rent. An exception would be where family or friends use the property and are not charged rent, but make a minor contribution to your expenses, for example, they pay you $20 towards power. In that situation, the contribution is not rental income, but you also cannot claim any deductions for that period. Deducting your expenses Expenses from holiday homes that are in the standard tax rules fall into three categories: 1. Fully deductible You can claim 100% of any expense relating solely to the income-earning use of the holiday home. Examples: Costs of advertising for tenants, cleaning costs for the rental periods, any additional insurance or rates you have to pay because you rent the property out. 2. Not deductible You cannot claim any expenses relating to the private use of the holiday home. Example: If you use the property for a month over the summer and you can identify actual usage charges for some of your expenses, like power, you cannot deduct any of the usage component for that period. 3. Apportioned If an expense relates to both income-earning use and private use, you need to apportion it using this formula: Expense × nights the property is rented out or available to be rented out nights in the year Expenses might include interest, rates, insurance, repairs for general wear and tear. Depreciation on chattels is dealt with separately on page 27. You’ll need to keep track of the number of nights you rent out the dwelling, and you’ll need to have evidence of when it was available to be rented out. This evidence needs to show the property was genuinely available to rent – including that there was active and regular marketing of the property at market rates. RENTAL INCOME 64 Depreciation Once you know the depreciation losses for the year for the chattels in the property that paying guests can use (page 27), you need to work out what proportion of those losses you can deduct. To do this, use this formula: Depreciation losses × nights the property is rented out or available to be rented out nights in the year the property is used or available for any purpose The difference between this formula and the approach for mixed expenses is that if the property is not available for use by anyone for a period, those nights are not counted. For example, if the property cannot be lived in while some building work is being done. 65 ird.govt.nz Part 6 - Services you may need myIR You can manage your tax and entitlements online with a myIR account.
